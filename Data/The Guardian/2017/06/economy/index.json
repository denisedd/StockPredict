Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ADP payrolls number has really grabbed investor attention, with the 253,000 reading providing yet more clues that we will see the Fed raise rates once more this month. Tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls figure is undoubtedly the big release of the week, as this will largely provide confirmation of whether the Fed will actually act this month.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US dollar got a significant uplift after a bumper ADP payrolls report for May which showed that 253k new jobs were added, with most of them in the services sector. As a bellwether for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official payrolls report it could well rubber stamp the prospect of a move in June, but also raise expectations of a further hike as soon as September. The main puzzle for a lot of people given the number of jobs being added is the weak nature of wage growth which still remains lacklustre. </p> </blockquote> <p>Despite the dollar strength, sterling has not been hit too hard. Hewson again:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound has managed to hold up fairly well despite another poll showing a narrow lead for the Conservative party, as the focus returns to the UK economy. Another decent manufacturing report for the month of May saw decent gains in new orders as well as employment. Rising prices remained a concern but they also showed further signs of easing back. </p> </blockquote> <p>The latest election poll shows an 8 point lead for the Conservatives over Labour, down from 15 points on May 23.</p> <p><strong> <br></strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59302157e4b0be3ed1921ce6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-01T14:16:32.561Z\">3.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The ISM survey adds more impetus for the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this months, says ING Bank economist James Knightley:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The key manufacturing survey suggests strong order books will keep output robust with employment picking up nicely.</p> <p>The US ISM manufacturing index for May has barely changed from April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rising to 54.9 from 54.8. The consensus had expected it to hold steady. Production slipped marginally to stand at 57.1 versus 58.6 previously, but new orders rose to 59.5 from 57.5 so it looks as though the pipeline for output remains very strong given both readings are well above the break-even 50 level. The employment component moved higher to 53.5 from 52.0, which offers encouragement for the jobs story as well. As such, the manufacturing sector is clearly a source of strength right now and the report boosts the case for a Fed rate hike at the June 14 FOMC meeting.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59301fede4b0be3ed1921cdb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-01T14:14:26.981Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Meanwhile US construction spending recorded its biggest drop in a year in April.</strong></p> <p>With slowing investment in both public and private projects, spending fell by 1.4% compared to expectations of a 0.5% rise.</p> <p>But the March figure was revised up from an initial 0.2% decline to a rise of 1.1%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59301e1ae4b0bdd87e2f22b8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-01T14:08:36.491Z\">3.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US manufacturing edges higher - ISM</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In fact the second manufacturing survey has confounded expectations by showing a slight rise rather than a slight dip.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/ismreport/mfgrob.cfm?SSO=1\">ISM manufacturing activity index </a>has increased from 54.8 in April to 54.9 last month, better than the 54.5 forecast by analysts.

Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ADP payrolls number has really grabbed investor attention, with the 253,000 reading providing yet more clues that we will see the Fed raise rates once more this month. Tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls figure is undoubtedly the big release of the week, as this will largely provide confirmation of whether the Fed will actually act this month. However, with markets already pricing in a 100% chance of a rate rise, there is reason to believe we could see a lower degree of volatility than usual. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 23.82 points or 0.32% higher at 7543.77 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.4% to 12,664.92 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.66% higher at 5318.67 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB climbed 0.99% to 20,936.07 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.01% better at 10,881.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.85% to 781.85 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 54 points or 0.27% higher. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. After a nervous opening, Wall Street has the wind in its sails. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 46 points or 0.22% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have both hit new highs. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Crude inventories are tanking if the latest data from the EIA is anything to go by, with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading providing the biggest weekly draw-down in 2017. The recent OPEC decision to extend production cuts was treated with disdain, yet there is reason to believe that their actions are gradually managing to reduce global crude inventories despite rising output in the likes of the US. More signs of growing demand for oil, with US crude stocks falling last week by the biggest amount so far this year. Crude supplies fell by 6.43m barrels to 509.91m, compared to expectations of a 2.5m decline. Gasoline stocks were also down by more than analysts had been forecasting, according to the Energy Information Administration. The news has pushed crude prices higher, with West Texas Intermediate up 0.56% to $48.59 a barrel and Brent crude 0.37% better at $50.95. Sterling is now moving higher against both the dollar and the euro, shrugging off worries about the latest election opinion polls and buoyed by the decent UK manufacturing data. It is now up 0.12% against the dollar at $1.2905 and 0.29% higher against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1490. More on the currency markets. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The US dollar got a significant uplift after a bumper ADP payrolls report for May which showed that 253k new jobs were added, with most of them in the services sector. As a bellwether for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official payrolls report it could well rubber stamp the prospect of a move in June, but also raise expectations of a further hike as soon as September. The main puzzle for a lot of people given the number of jobs being added is the weak nature of wage growth which still remains lacklustre. Despite the dollar strength, sterling has not been hit too hard. Hewson again: The pound has managed to hold up fairly well despite another poll showing a narrow lead for the Conservative party, as the focus returns to the UK economy. Another decent manufacturing report for the month of May saw decent gains in new orders as well as employment. Rising prices remained a concern but they also showed further signs of easing back. The latest election poll shows an 8 point lead for the Conservatives over Labour, down from 15 points on May 23. The ISM survey adds more impetus for the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this months, says ING Bank economist James Knightley: The key manufacturing survey suggests strong order books will keep output robust with employment picking up nicely. The US ISM manufacturing index for May has barely changed from April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rising to 54.9 from 54.8. The consensus had expected it to hold steady. Production slipped marginally to stand at 57.1 versus 58.6 previously, but new orders rose to 59.5 from 57.5 so it looks as though the pipeline for output remains very strong given both readings are well above the break-even 50 level. The employment component moved higher to 53.5 from 52.0, which offers encouragement for the jobs story as well. As such, the manufacturing sector is clearly a source of strength right now and the report boosts the case for a Fed rate hike at the June 14 FOMC meeting. Meanwhile US construction spending recorded its biggest drop in a year in April. With slowing investment in both public and private projects, spending fell by 1.4% compared to expectations of a 0.5% rise. But the March figure was revised up from an initial 0.2% decline to a rise of 1.1%. In fact the second manufacturing survey has confounded expectations by showing a slight rise rather than a slight dip. The ISM manufacturing activity index has increased from 54.8 in April to 54.9 last month, better than the 54.5 forecast by analysts. Timothy Fiore, ISM chair, said: Comments from the panel generally reflect stable to growing business conditions, with new orders, employment and inventories of raw materials all growing in May compared to April. The slowing of pricing pressure, especially in basic commodities, should have a positive impact on margins and buying policies as this moderation moves up the value chain. And here are some comments from the survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s respondents: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sales have picked up compared to the last two months. Customer demand has increased.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Plastics &amp; Rubber Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Economy is still strong, but [the] political climate can change things very quickly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Transportation Equipment) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Global price increases for commodities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Electrical Equipment, Appliances &amp; Components) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business (sales/production) is steady. Pricing pressures on raw materials. Skilled labor in short supply.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Furniture &amp; Related Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Agricultural demand very strong.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Chemical Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our business is definitely paying attention to developments with the Canadian lumber tariff announcement. The final outcome could change our fiber pricing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Paper Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153OEM longer lead parts possibly longer lead time due to more orders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Nonmetallic Mineral Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business conditions are steady, and with competition increasing, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s making negotiations even more intense to reduce costs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Machinery) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business is booming, and getting direct employees is increasingly difficult.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Fabricated Metal Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Difficult to find qualified labor for factory positions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products) Commenting on the US PMI, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: Manufacturing growth momentum continued to ebb in May, down to its weakest since just before the presidential election. Manufacturing output, order books and employment all grew at only modest rates as sluggish sales prompted firms to scale back hiring. Exports sales remained especially lacklustre, hampered in part by the relatively strong dollar. The survey also brought signs of companies becoming more cautious about holding inventory. Factories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 raw material prices meanwhile rose at a sharply reduced rate, which should at least help take pressure off profit margins and also feed through to weaker pressure on consumer price inflation. The rival ISM survey is due shortly, and is also expected to show a slight dip from the April figure. The first of the two US manufacturing surveys has come in better than the initial reading but has shown a very slight dip from the previous month. The Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index has slipped from 52.8 in April to 52.7 last month, compared to a first estimate of 52.5. While this is still in expansion territory it is the lowest reading since September. US markets have made a tentative start to the new month, despite the strong private sector jobs data and ahead of two rival manufacturing surveys for May. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 9 points while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have edged marginally higher at the open. The dollar is rallying after the stronger than expected private sector jobs figures, ahead of the non-farm payrolls due on Friday. The US currency is up 0.5% against the yen and 0.2% better against the euro. And the pound is currently 0.13% lower at $1.2874. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen plenty of encouraging economic news this morning, with factory output rising in the UK and also in the eurozone, strong job creation in America, and an upgrade to Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP. But this is no time for complacency. The chief executive of the World Bank has just warned governments to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuckle up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, ready for the next crisis. Kristalina Georgieva warned an audience at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum that the rise in financial, economic and terror-related emergencies is becoming the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She explained: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m asking myself what has changed in this decade and my conclusion is what has changed probably can be summed up with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuckle up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are now at the point when shocks are more frequent. Unexpected crises are maybe not more dramatic than they used to be before, but they are very impolite, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait their turn.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In the past, Georgieva argued, governments would be faced with one \u00e2\u20ac\u0153massive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd crisis at a time. Now, they come in battalions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you just look at the last years, we had financial crisis, economic crisis, eurozone crisis, terrorism, geopolitical crises, and neither institutions or businesses are well tuned to deal with more than one shock at a time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have to really figure out - if this is the new normal, and I happen to think this is the new normal - how we can have more resilient , more agile and more adaptable government policies, (and) private sector behaviour so that (work) security can be put on a sound foundation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thanks to the Press Association for the quotes. More American employment data just landed. And it shows that the number of US citizens filing new claims for unemployment benefit has risen to 248,000, from 235,000 a week ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than expected, but remains low by historical standards. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector created 253,000 new jobs in May, substantially more than expected. Economists had predicted that the monthly ADP payroll would rise by 185,000, and these blow-out figure suggest tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll could also be impressive. More than 200,000 jobs were created in the service sector, including 88,000 in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprofessional and business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sector. There were also small gains in manufacturing and mining, and 37,000 new hires in construction. Brian Wesbury, chief economist at First Trust Portfolios, says the report shows that the US economy is motoring along quite nicely. But economists are also looking for signs that wage growth is picking up. International Airlines Group CEO Willie Walsh has broken his silence over the disruption that grounded over a thousand British Airways flights last weekend. Speaking to the BBC, Walsh said he was pleased that BA has recovered from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant disruption\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that it faced on Saturday. And he insist that the IT meltdown was caused by a power outage, rather than a problem with BA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology, saying: We clearly apologise to any customers who were disrupted. It was not an IT failure. It was a problem caused by the failure of electrical power to our IT systems. We understand what happened, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still investigating why it happened, and that investigation will take some time. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that IT experts have told us that a power surge could not cause such a catastrophic outage. Walsh added that the team at BA did \u00e2\u20ac\u0153everything they could\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to recover the situation. Clearly we will do everything we can to make up for the disruption that passengers suffered, he concludes. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got bad news for wine lovers out there. The average price of a bottle in the UK has risen over \u00c2\u00a35.50 for the first time ever. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122a according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, which blames the fall in sterling following last June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. Miles Beale, WSTA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Last year the WSTA predicted that Brexit and the fall in the value of the pound, compounded by rising inflation, would force the UK wine industry to up their prices. Sadly this is now a reality as an average priced bottle of wine in the UK is at an all-time high. Unfortunately, for both British businesses and consumers, we are clear that this is not a one off adjustment, but rather that wine prices will continue to rise. What is even more concerning is that this does not take into account the inflationary duty rise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at a painful 3.9% - on alcohol inflicted by the Chancellor in the March Budget. Billionaire-turned-philanthropist George Soros has weighed in on Brexit this morning, saying the European Union needs to be radically re-invented. Soros also argued that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the EU will take much longer than the two-year window set under the Lisbon Treaty. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Negotiating the separation with Britain will divert the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention from its own existential crisis, and the talks are bound to last longer than the two years allotted to them. Five years seems more likely.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Our Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin has more details: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unrest at the Bank of England this morning. Workers at Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank are to be balloted on strike action, after being offered a pay rise of just 1%. Unite regional officer Mercedes Sanchez has blasted the BoE, calling it arrogant and out of touch: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disgraceful snub of low paid staff stinks of arrogance and represents an organisation thoroughly out of touch with the reality of the pressure staff face meeting their costs of living. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a source of shame that an iconic symbol of financial services in the UK is choosing to ride roughshod over the concerns of its dedicated and hardworking staff and impose this derisory pay deal. In effect, staff are facing a real terms pay cut. A 1% rise in wages won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep pace with inflation, which has just jut a four-year high of 2.7%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ahead of the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own target of 2%. Unite represent security, catering, legal, and human resource staff at the Bank. Update: Apparently Unite represent 2% of all BoE staff. Sky News has more details. Economists have welcomed the news that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing PMI dipped to 56.7 in May, from 57 in April, showing solid growth. Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply says manufacturers are shrugging off political uncertainty: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While not quite hitting the heights of April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound in activity, the manufacturing sector didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disappoint with a sustained rise in purchasing activity, output and new orders, optimism at a 20- month high, and storming ahead unfazed by the looming election. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The domestic market persisted as the driving force, but the weak pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continuing bounty meant levels of export orders also increased, for the thirteenth month, as export markets made use of the competitiveness of UK firms. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation, agrees that UK manufacturing is in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood shape\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Output and orders expansion is being driven by resilient demand coming through UK supply chains and a better looking global economy than UK manufacturers have been used to for some time. Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays, says the weak pound is helping exporters, but could bite UK customers in the pocket: Exporters have continued to take advantage of a weak sterling, which has kept British exports competitive on a global stage, and at a time when the world economy is showing signs of improvement. However, rising cost pressures are still circling, not only from elevated import costs but also from the growing effect of domestic costs from sources such as energy and staffing which will all contribute to fuelling inflation. Although manufacturers have resisted passing on these costs to date, the expectation of price rises is becoming more apparent in the sector.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chris Leyland, analyst at investment firm True Potential, says factory bosses face some pressures: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure is above 50, meaning expansion is still happening, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just that the rate has slowed compared to last month. There are a number of reasons for that, mostly stemming from the weaker pound pushing up import cost for factories and therefore prices for the end consumer. It also means consumers have less disposable income, because their food and fuel bills have risen. The price of oil has also increased, leading to higher fuel costs for manufacturers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The key will be exports, because the weaker pound means factories may receive more orders from abroad, which could offset some domestic pain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Williamson flags up that export growth slowed a little in May: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector has continued to shrug off Brexit, by posting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153further marked growth in May\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI survey from Markit, which shows that UK factory growth was close to April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three-year high. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the topline: UK factory bosses reported that they benefitted from domestic demand, and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153solid increase\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in new export business. Optimism regarding the outlook for production levels in one year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time rose to a 20-month high. This is also feeding into the jobs market; factory employment rose for the tenth consecutive month in May, at the fastest rate since June 2014. In short, it all suggests that the manufacturing sector is holding up well. Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The strong PMI numbers suggest the manufacturing sector has gained growth momentum in the second quarter after the sluggish start of the year. The ongoing strength of the domestic market remains the main driver of the upturn. Growth of new export business played a lesser role in comparison, with the trend in foreign demand continuing to improve only in fits and starts, despite the assistance of a historically weak sterling exchange rate.

Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate has been revised sharply higher, in another sign that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery is strengthening. Italian GDP rose by 0.4% in January-to-March, new figures show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twice as fast as first estimated. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also twice as fast as Britain managed in Q1, and confirms that the UK was the weakest-performing G7 member at the start of this year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details of the surge in manufacturing employment across the eurozone last month: Staffing levels rose at quicker rates in Germany (six- year high), Italy (just below October 1999\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s series- record), Spain (fastest in 19 years), Ireland (two-year peak) and Austria (two-month high). Slower increases were registered in France and the Netherlands, while Greece reported jobs growth for the first time in six months. Newsflash: Eurozone factories have just racked up their fastest growth in six years. The euro-area manufacturing PMI has come in at 57.0, up from 56.7 in April, thanks to faster growth in output and new orders. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector led the way, with growth at a 73-month high. Most other eurozone countries also posted growth, but Greece brought up the rear with another contraction. And the really good news is that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories have created more jobs in May than at any time since this survey began, 20 years ago. Markit says: The ongoing expansion of the eurozone manufacturing sector gathered further momentum in May. Growth in output and new orders accelerated to the best seen for around six years, to underpin the strongest job creation in the 20-year survey history. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, says the surveys show Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery is strengthening: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The eurozone upturn is developing deeper roots as factories enjoy a spring growth spurt. Demand for goods is growing at the steepest rate for six years, encouraging manufacturers to step up production and take on extra staff at a rate not previously seen in the two-decade history of the PMI survey. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fact that the upturn is being accompanied by such strong jobs growth sends a signal that increasing numbers of companies are moving away from a focus on cost cutting towards investing in expansion, underscoring the elevated levels of business optimism seen across the region. The record hiring adds to the sense that the upturn is looking more and more robust as each month goes by. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories have expanded faster than their French rivals last month: Good news from Spain! Spanish factories are taking on new staff at the fastest rate since 1998, after posting another month of growth. The Spanish manufacturing PMI hit a four-month high of 55.4 in May, up from 54.5 in April. Firms reported a rise in output and new orders, encouraging them to take on extra workers to deal with the demand. Spain has suffered one of the worst unemployment crisis of any eurozone country since the financial crisis, so this is very encouraging. Andrew Harker, senior economist at IHS Markit, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153May was an excellent month for workers in the Spanish manufacturing sector as firms took on staff at the strongest pace for 19 years. Moreover, with new work rising healthily again and further signs of capacity coming under pressure, the likelihood is that jobs will continue to be created at a decent clip over the near-term at least. The first eurozone manufacturing report of the day was quite a belter. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory PMI jumped to 55.9 in May from 55.0 in April, signalling \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a marked improvement in business conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level in 22 months. Investec, which produces the report, says: Respondents linked higher output to rising new orders and improving economic conditions. New business also rose at a faster pace in May amid reports of stronger client demand. We have fresh evidence that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market is cooling. House prices fell by 0.2% in May, reports Nationwide, which is the third monthly fall in a row. That hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happened since 2009 - the dark days of the financial crisis. On an annual basis, prices are only 2.1% higher than a year ago - another sign that demand is cooling off. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Economist, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153House prices recorded their third consecutive monthly fall in May \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first time this has occurred since 2009. The annual rate of growth slowed to 2.1%, the weakest in almost four years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is still early days, but this provides further evidence that the housing market is losing momentum. Moreover, this may be indicative of a wider slowdown in the household sector, though data continues to send mixed signals in this regard. Worries over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy are intensifying this morning after new data showed its manufacturing sector is shrinking. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index (PMI) fell to 49.6 in May, from 50.1 in April. That signals that activity contracted last month, for the first time in nearly a year. Chinese firms reported that output grew at the weakest level in 11 months, due to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmuted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 growth in new orders from domestic and overseas customers. Firms also slashed jobs again, at the fastest rate since last September. Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, said there are signs that Chinese factories are struggling. The sub-index of stocks of purchases signalled a renewed decline, while the sub-index of stocks of finished goods rebounded, indicating that companies have stopped actively restocking as inventories began to stack up. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector has come under greater pressure in May and the economy is clearly on a downward trajectory.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Caixin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey is weaker than the official Chinese PMIs.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new month, and that means a new flurry of economic data. June is kicking off with new surveys of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories, from China to the US via Europe. The Purchasing Manager Indexes are expected to show that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery continued last month, with eurozone manufacturing growth possibly hitting a six-year high. The UK data will also be closely scrutinised. Economists predict a small slowdown in growth last month. RBC Capital Markets say: Another set of robust numbers would make the Q1 slowdown seem potentially transitory, whereas softer data would instead leave the April upturn looking like a positive blip amidst mounting evidence of a slowing economy. Our economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 central expectation remains that the consumer-led slowdown will be more durable, so our bias is to look for a pullback in the PMIs to confirm this. The City has already woken up to some disappointing data from China, where factory activity contracted for the first time in 11 months (more on that shortly). The pound continues to bob around like a cork in a stormy sea, as the UK general election approaches. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shed almost half a cent this morning, to $1.285, after a new YouGov poll showed a mere 3 point gap between the Conservatives and Labour. Other polls, though, have given Theresa May a larger lead, so traders are suitably cautious. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 8.15am to 9am: Eurozone manufacturing PMIs are released 9.30am: UK manufacturing PMIs 1.15pm: US ADP payroll of private sector jobs 1.30pm: US weekly jobless figures 3pm: US manufacturing PMIs",

So most stock markets have fallen back again, while the dollar has hit a seven month low. Oil has recovered some of its early losses after the latest tensions in the Middle East, with Brent crude edging up 0.2% to $49.57 a barrel having fallen as low as $49.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 has ended virtually flat, outperforming the bulk of its European peers, as the latest polls show a Conservative lead. The FTSE 250, hit by weakness in sterling, has lost 1%, its worst daily performance since the middle of April. The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 edged down 0.81 points or 0.01% at 7524.95</strong></li> <li><strong>The FTSE 250 fell 1.08% to 19,654.84</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.04% to 12,690.12</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.73% at 5269.22</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished up 0.19% at 20,760.01</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.05% at 10,879.7</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market dropped 1.15% to 777.53</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 21 points or 0.1%.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day.

Marchel Alexandrovich, senior European economist at Jefferies, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On Thursday the ECB is widely expected to change some of the language around its forward guidance, but the implications of these changes are likely to be downplayed by Mario Draghi during the Q&amp;A session.</p> <p>In the last two meetings the ECB hinted that a further cut to the depo rate was unlikely \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and we expect this position to be formally confirmed in the Monetary Policy Decisions statement. However, the shift to a more neutral policy stance with regards to interest rates will not affect the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other key messages: the depo rate will remain at present level until after QE comes to an end; and QE will carry on until the end of the year \u00e2\u20ac\u0153or beyond, if necessary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>All in all, the take-away is expected to be that while the ECB is taking a small step toward eventual policy normalisation, this process is not on a predetermined path. For the markets, Draghi is unlikely to provide any useful guidance in terms of when tapering may start, or what form it may take.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5acae04e7749d6fda38f88309732f6c55f0cd55f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5acae04e7749d6fda38f88309732f6c55f0cd55f/0_148_3080_1849/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Draghi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Draghi</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5936c681e4b00493c8279f62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-06T15:13:33.943Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Reuters take on the US job openings figures:</p> <blockquote> <p>U.S. job openings surged to a record high in April while hiring slowed, suggesting a recent moderation in job growth was the result of employers having difficulties finding qualified workers.</p> <p>The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released by the Labor Department on Tuesday showed there were 6.0 million job openings on the last day of business in April, an increase of 259,000 from March.

Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There has been a clear shift into haven trades to protect against any fireworks following key events on Thursday.

With three big events clustered in one day, it only takes one to go way to set things off.</p> <p>Stocks mostly retreated with a tendency for more defensive areas of the market to outperform. Utilities, a typical haven when staying invested in stocks rose over half-a-percent on the Euro Stoxx 600 while most other sectors were lower...</p> <p>A 1% decline in the FTSE 250 while FTSE 100 was essentially flat on the day was notable. Investors appear to be shunning UK domestic shares before the election. Within the broader FTSE 350, retail shares were biggest decliners, which are typically closely tied to the health of the British economy. While a Labour victory remains a distant outlier, polls would indicate a hung parliament is possible. The fear is that with the country entering at least two-years of economic uncertainty because of the Brexit negotiations, higher personal and business taxes under a new government could tip the economy over the edge.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5936bb8be4b0bdd87e2f3e75\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-06T14:33:18.889Z\">3.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nick_bunker/status/872097945117655041\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JOLTS?src=hash\">#JOLTS</a> Graph time!

The Job Openings and Labor Turnovers Survey (JOLTS) gives another snapshot of the state of the employment market, with indications on job openings, hiring, layoffs and the quit rate. The latter in particular, if it is increasing, shows a more optimistic market, if employees feel confident enough to leave their jobs in search of new ones.

                "bodyText":"Investors are being rather cautious ahead of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK election, ECB meeting and the testimony by ex-FBI boss James Comey. So most stock markets have fallen back again, while the dollar has hit a seven month low. Oil has recovered some of its early losses after the latest tensions in the Middle East, with Brent crude edging up 0.2% to $49.57 a barrel having fallen as low as $49. The FTSE 100 has ended virtually flat, outperforming the bulk of its European peers, as the latest polls show a Conservative lead. The FTSE 250, hit by weakness in sterling, has lost 1%, its worst daily performance since the middle of April. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 edged down 0.81 points or 0.01% at 7524.95 The FTSE 250 fell 1.08% to 19,654.84 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.04% to 12,690.12 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.73% at 5269.22 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished up 0.19% at 20,760.01 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.05% at 10,879.7 In Greece, the Athens market dropped 1.15% to 777.53 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 21 points or 0.1%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. One of the big events on Thursday is the latest meeting of the European Central Bank, with president Mario Draghi expected to make a minor shift in the tone of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message. Marchel Alexandrovich, senior European economist at Jefferies, said: On Thursday the ECB is widely expected to change some of the language around its forward guidance, but the implications of these changes are likely to be downplayed by Mario Draghi during the Q&amp;A session. In the last two meetings the ECB hinted that a further cut to the depo rate was unlikely \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and we expect this position to be formally confirmed in the Monetary Policy Decisions statement. However, the shift to a more neutral policy stance with regards to interest rates will not affect the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other key messages: the depo rate will remain at present level until after QE comes to an end; and QE will carry on until the end of the year \u00e2\u20ac\u0153or beyond, if necessary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. All in all, the take-away is expected to be that while the ECB is taking a small step toward eventual policy normalisation, this process is not on a predetermined path. For the markets, Draghi is unlikely to provide any useful guidance in terms of when tapering may start, or what form it may take. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Reuters take on the US job openings figures: U.S. job openings surged to a record high in April while hiring slowed, suggesting a recent moderation in job growth was the result of employers having difficulties finding qualified workers. The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released by the Labor Department on Tuesday showed there were 6.0 million job openings on the last day of business in April, an increase of 259,000 from March. Hiring decreased by 253,000 jobs to 5.1 million. Investors are shying away from risk at the moment, with precious metals and defensive shares reaping the benefit. Gold is at its highest level in seven weeks, up $14 to $1293 an ounce, while silver is up from $17.54 to $17.68 an ounce. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: There has been a clear shift into haven trades to protect against any fireworks following key events on Thursday. Brits heading to the polls, central bankers deciding interest rates in Europe and testimony from FBI Director Comey all pose a threat. With three big events clustered in one day, it only takes one to go way to set things off. Stocks mostly retreated with a tendency for more defensive areas of the market to outperform. Utilities, a typical haven when staying invested in stocks rose over half-a-percent on the Euro Stoxx 600 while most other sectors were lower... A 1% decline in the FTSE 250 while FTSE 100 was essentially flat on the day was notable. Investors appear to be shunning UK domestic shares before the election. Within the broader FTSE 350, retail shares were biggest decliners, which are typically closely tied to the health of the British economy. While a Labour victory remains a distant outlier, polls would indicate a hung parliament is possible. The fear is that with the country entering at least two-years of economic uncertainty because of the Brexit negotiations, higher personal and business taxes under a new government could tip the economy over the edge. And here are the job openings figures, and they have come in at a record high. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, job openings rose from a revised 5.78m in March to 6m in April, the highest level since the survey began. But hires were weaker, falling from 5.3m to 5m while the quits rate edged marginally lower from 2.2% to 2.1%. Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US non-farm payroll numbers were much weaker than expected, but analysts agreed they were unlikely to prevent the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates next week. But some observers suggested they could slow down the pace of any further rises. Another set of US jobs data is due shortly, and it is one that Fed chair Janet Yellen is known to pay particular attention too, even if it is not as well followed as the non-farm numbers. The Job Openings and Labor Turnovers Survey (JOLTS) gives another snapshot of the state of the employment market, with indications on job openings, hiring, layoffs and the quit rate. The latter in particular, if it is increasing, shows a more optimistic market, if employees feel confident enough to leave their jobs in search of new ones. However David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, said the job opening figure could see a decline on last month: The expectation is for 5.65 million, and that compares with 5.74 million in March. This report will be of particular importance given the disappointing non-farm payroll figure last week. Ahead of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s triple whammy of the UK election, European Central Bank meeting and ex-FBI director James Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony, US markets are following the trend elsewhere and heading lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 57 points or 0.28% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.26% lower and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.22%. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is down 0.26%, the FTSE 250 has fallen 0.95%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 1% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is 0.8% lower. The weakness in the pound is a factor behind a drop in the FTSE 250. At one point, the mid-cap index was on track for its worst day since November although it has recovered from its worst levels. Even so, the index is down 0.9% and currently sitting at a near three week low as jitters about the UK election continue to unsettle investors. To be fair, the mid-cap index has been hitting new highs in recent days so the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall needs to be seen in that context. After a bright start to the morning, the British pound has taken a lurch lower. Sterling is now down 0.2% today at $1.2875, as traders worry about Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, says sterling is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coming under renewed pressure from polls showing the Conservative Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s out-sized lead dwindling.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Those polls have left investors scratching their heads. Last night, Survation released a phone poll giving the Conservatives a lead of just 1 percentage point. Other pollsters have reported a much wider gap, with ICM putting Theresa May 11 points ahead. And then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s YouGov, whose controversial daily seat projections suggests the Conservatives will fall short of a majority. Back in the UK, one of the bankers at the centre of the 2008 financial crisis is being spared from giving evidence about his actions in court. A group of Royal Bank of Scotland shareholders have settled their claim that they were misled when they backed its rights issue in 2008, shortly before its collapse. That means that Fred Goodwin, who lost his knighthood after RBS was nationalised, will not have to answer questions about the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demise. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: The South African rand has slumped to 12.875 to the US dollar, down from 12.7 yesterday. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM suspects it could fall further: Sentiment towards the South African economy took a hit on Tuesday following reports of the nation falling into a technical recession for the first time since 2009. The latest GDP data released by Stats SA showed that the economy declined by 0.7% in the first quarter of 2017 with all industries excluding agriculture and mining contracting. Despite this decline, there remains some optimism over GDP growth finding some ground and rebounding to 0.7% in the second quarter of 2017 amid the stabilizing economic data seen in recent months. The South African Rand weakened following this news with the USDZAR edging towards 12.9000. Repeated weakness from the Rand should encourage a further incline towards 13.0000 on the USDZAR. South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide into recession piles more pressure on president Jacob Zuma. Zuma was already feeling the heat over his links to the wealthy and influential Gupta family. Last week, leaked emails purported to show that the Gupta family had used their friendship with Zuma to advance their business interests. Zuma had previously repeatedly denied allegations that the Guptas had unfairly won state contracts, and even influenced the choice of government ministers. Magda Wierzycka, CEO of financial services group Sygnia, says South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaders need to focus on fixing its economy: The full South African GDP report is online here. This neat graphic sums it up: Here are the key points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s South African growth report. In the first quarter of 2017, both the secondary and tertiary sectors recorded negative growth rates. Trade growth shrank by 5.9% and manufacturing by 3,7%. On the positive side, the agriculture and mining industries both contributed positively to growth in the first quarter, but not enough to avoid recession. Trade experienced production falls across the board, particularly in catering and accommodation and wholesale trade. Manufacturing found itself hamstrung by lower production levels in seven of its 10 divisions, most notably petroleum and chemical products (accounting for over 20% of the manufacturing industry). It was the third consecutive quarter of decline in total manufacturing. The tertiary sector, which is make up of finance, transport, trade, government and personal services, recorded its first quarter of decline since the second quarter of 2009, when South Africa was in a recession as well. Social media users in South Africa have been reacting to the news: Emerging markets analyst John Ashbourne confirms that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures are much worse then expected: Statistics South Africa deputy director general Joe de Beer has confirmed that the country is in recession, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can now pronounce that the economy is in recession,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The major industries that contracted in the economy were the trade and manufacturing sectors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bloomberg is reporting that South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has been dragged into recession by political infighting. That row saw the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s respected finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, sacked three months ago, alarming international investors. Bloomberg says: While rains are helping Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most-industrialized economy recover from a 2015 drought that was the worst since records started more than a century earlier, political uncertainty has hampered implementing reforms aimed at boosting growth. President Jacob Zuma changed his cabinet and fired Pravin Gordhan as finance minister in March, a move that saw the nation lose its investment-grade status with two ratings companies for the first time in 17 years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a risk that these contractions are not over and we could see another negative coming out in the second quarter of this year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Annabel Bishop, the chief economist at Investec Ltd., said by phone from Johannesburg. More here: S. Africa Has Second Recession in 8 Years as Economy Shrinks The South African rand has has slumped by 1% on the foreign exchange markets, as traders react with alarm to the disappointing GDP figures. Breaking: South Africa has fallen back into recession, for the second time in eight years. South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy shrank by 0.7% in the first quarter of 2017, figures just released show. That follows a 0.3% contraction in the final three months of 2016; two consecutive quarters of contraction mean a recession. The downturn was caused by a sharp contraction in trade. Manufacturing output also shrank, while government and household spending both fell too. Government agency Stats SA has tweeted the key points: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something of a shock. Economists had expected growth to rebound in the last quarter. Details and reaction to follow..... European markets have weakened this morning, dragged down by worries over America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and the diplomatic row between Qatar and its neighbours. Despite the jump in eurozone investor confidence, all the main indices are in the red today. Risk aversion is gripping the markets, driving money out of shares and into gold and the Japanese yen. Signs that the Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election race is tightening are also gripping the City. Joshua Mahony of IG explains: On a day which is largely devoid of major economic releases, the focus remains firmly fixed on Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blockbuster schedule and what it could mean for the future of politics either side of the Atlantic. UK election polls have been widely conflicting of late, reflecting the significant impact different methodology has upon results. Previously we have seen the pound fall with any mention of a hung parliament, yet with the pound rising gradually over recent weeks, it is clear that the markets continue to foresee a Tory majority. More eurozone data just landed, showing that retail sales crept higher in April. Retail spending across the eurozone rose by 0.1%, weaker than the 0.2% which the City expects. On an annual basis, spending was 2.5% higher than in April 2016. Breaking: Investors across the eurozone are at their most confident in a decade! The monthly gauge of investor morale produced by Sentix has risen to 28.4 points this month, up from 27.4 in May. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest reading since July 2007 (just before the credit crunch struck, triggering the financial crisis). Investors reported that the current economic situation has improved, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also more optimistic about future economic prospects. The data suggest that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery is gathering pace, Sentix says: The assessment of the current situation has climbed to the highest level since January 2008, underlining that it is not just ephemeral expectations, but increasingly hard data, that are driving the upswing in the eurozone. The cost of renting a home in the UK has fallen for the first time since the financial crisis, as the slowdown in the sector gathers pace. Average rents were down 0.3% in May, compared with a year earlier, at \u00c2\u00a3901, according to industry body HomeLet. This is the first annual decline since 2009, Rents in London are 3% lower than a year ago; they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also down in the North-East of England, the South-East, Yorkshire &amp; Humberside, and Scotland. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for tenants, but a painful time for landlords. HomeLet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Executive Officer, Martin Totty, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153May 2017 saw average rents nationally fall for the first time in eight years when the economy had suffered the shock of the financial crisis. HomeLet rental data suggests landlords are now facing a difficult balancing act between ensuring rents are affordable for tenants in a low real wage growth environment whilst covering their own rising costs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Financial advisor Claire Walsh reckons Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the EU is now rippling through the economy: The Japanese yen has hit a six-week high against the US dollar, as traders dash for safe-haven assets. Russian intrigue and the looming UK general election are to blame, says FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed: In currency markets, the dollar fell to lowest levels in six weeks against the Yen. This shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprising given the scale of event risks this Thursday, specifically UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election and former FBI director James Comey testifying before the US Senate intelligence committee about potential Russian interference in 2016\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US election. The weakening dollar is good news for the pound, which has gained 0.3% to $1.293 this morning. The US dollar has fallen to its lowest level since Donald Trump won the US presidential election. Investors appear to be increasingly anxious about the American economy, after learning yesterday that its services sector grew slower than expected in May. That followed Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s underwhelming US labour report, showing fewer jobs created than expected. Markets are also bracing for potential bombshells on Thursday, when former FBI chief James Comey is due to testify to Congress. That appearance could provide more problems for president Trump. As Reuters puts it: It has been reported that Comey plans to testify to conversations in which U.S. President Donald Trump pressured him to drop his investigation into former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn, who was fired for failing to disclose conversations with Russian officials. Online electrical chain AO World has added to the gloom in the retail sector this morning, with an underwhelming set of results. AO World, which sells domestic appliances as well as computers, has warned the City that sales will slow \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significantly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between April and June, its first quarter. It said the tough trading environment in the UK that hit sales in the second half of last year had continued into its new financial year. Its operating loss for the year to 31 March widened to \u00c2\u00a312m from \u00c2\u00a310.6m, as a \u00c2\u00a315.6m profit in the UK was offset by losses in Germany and the Netherlands. The company was founded in 2000 by John Roberts, a former kitchen salesman, who ran the business as chief executive until February. When it floated on the stock market three years ago the shares soared \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but soon dipped below the 285p offer price. They are now worth just 136p, after tumbling by 6% in early trading today. Brushing aside the difficulties, the new chief executive Steve Caunce said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We remain relentless in pursuing our goal to be the best electrical retailer in Europe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With two days to go until the UK general election, we have new evidence that parts of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy are slowing. UK retail sales shrank by 0.4% in May, according to the latest healthcheck from the British Retail Consortium. The report found that households are cutting back as rising inflation hits them in the pocket. Worryingly, people have less to spend on discretionary items once they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve covered essentials such as food. Online sales -- typically a big growth area -- also slowed. They only rose by 4.3% during the month, compared to over 13% a year ago. Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said many shoppers are now suffering from falling real wages, leaving them less to spend in the shops. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The impact of inflationary pressures on the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s purse continues to play out in this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures, with shoppers evidently spending more on food and drink than on non-food purchases. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With inflation continuing to rise and wage growth stagnating, consumers are starting to feel the pinch - although the highly competitive nature of the UK grocery market continues to play out in the consumer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favour. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Katie Allen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full report: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s set the tone for a rather subdued day, with many stock markets in Asia dipping and the US dollar coming under pressure. The agenda: Today we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out whether eurozone retail sales kept growing in April, and whether investors across Europe remain confident. 9:30am BST: Sentix\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone investor confidence survey for June 10:00am BST: Eurozone retail sales for April 3pm BST: US Jolts report, showing how many job vacancies were created in America last month",

                "bodyText":"It was a down day for European shares ahead of Thursdays key events, the UK election, the European Central Bank meeting and ex-FBI director James Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony. A slide in the euro unnerved European stocks while conversely, a strong pound helped push the FTSE 100 lower. Energy and commodity companies were also under pressure after a slide in the oil price following a surprise jump in US crude stocks. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 46.33 points or 0.62% at 7478.62 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.14% to 12,672.49 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.07% lower at 5265.53 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.1% to 20,739.91 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.07% at 10,871.7 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.42% to 774.29 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 7 points or 0.04%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Back with the oil price reaction to the surprise rise in US crude stocks: The pound rose to a two week high against the dollar, as investors became more convinced that the Conservatives would win Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK election despite their poll lead narrowing. Sterling touched $1.2967 against the dollar, before slipping back to its current level of $1.2936, still up 0.22%. Against the euro, it is up 0.6% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1513. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said there were also other factors at work in sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favour: The pound found some extra energy this afternoon, though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not quite clear whether the currency is being driven higher by home-grown news or events elsewhere. Against both the dollar and the euro sterling jumped half a percent, suggesting that the election-jitters that have bothered the pound for the last fortnight or so have subsided. However, there are potentially other explanations for its growth. The euro has been hit by reports that the ECB is preparing to cut its inflation forecasts, something that would further kick the rate hike can down the road. In the US, meanwhile, the dollar is gearing up for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony from former FBI chief James Comey, an event that could destabilise an already shaky White House. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters on the rise in US crude stocks: Oil prices slid more than 3 percent on Wednesday after the U.S. government reported an unexpected increase in inventories of crude and gasoline, fanning fears that output cuts by major world oil producers have not drained the global crude glut very much. Crude stocks in the United States grew 3.3 million barrels to 513 million barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). That confounded forecasters who had predicted a drop of 3.5 million barrels, especially a day after preliminary data from the American Petroleum Institute indicated an even bigger drop. Gasoline inventories also unexpectedly rose, imports increased, and exports dropped, the EIA data showed... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Flagging gasoline demand continues to bedevil the market. With gasoline currently the seasonal leader of the complex, its weakness is dragging everything down,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York. Prices slid even as some in the market remained concerned about the move by OPEC members Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar, an OPEC member that had agreed to cut only about 30,000 barrels a day as part of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreement to reduce output. However, analysts saw a risk that rivalries between OPEC members could weaken the production cut agreement. Some were already concerned about rising production from Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt from the agreement. OPEC has pledged to cut almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to help reduce global inventories. More on the US inventory figures: The drop in the oil price following the unexpected increase in US crude stocks has also had an impact on stock markets. The FTSE 100, which had been just marginally lower, is now down 41 points or 0.56% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dipped into the red. In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now virtually unchanged after its earlier gains, up just 1.2 points. Brent crude is now down more than 3% at $48.46 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has dropped 4.6% to $45.95. The surprise rise in US crude stocks contradicts Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report from the API showing a decline in inventories. Oil prices were already on the slide after the blockade imposed on Qatar by its neighbours, with analysts concerned the rift could impede Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement to curb production. Now they have come under more pressure following a surprise rise in US crude stocks. According to the Energy Information Administration, US crude inventories rose by 3.3m barrels last week to 513.21m, compared to forecasts of a 3.46m decline. Gasoline stocks rose 3.32m, well ahead of the expected 0.58m increase. Brent crude has fallen to its lowest level since early May following the EIA report. Meanwhile the pound is now up 0.2% against the dollar at $1.2933, while the dip in the euro on reports that the European Central Bank might cut its inflation outlook on Thursday has helped the pound gain 0.59% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1512 against the single currency. US markets have opened in positive territory, but investors remain cautious ahead of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s triple whammy of the UK election, the European Central Bank meeting and - of more concern to Wall Street - the testimony of ex-FBI boss James Comey. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 24 points or 0.12%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.13% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.27%. WPP, whose boss Sir Martin Sorrell earlier received a rough ride from shareholders over his pay packet and his own future at the company, is the biggest faller in the FTSE 100. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less to do with the annual meeting outcome and more to do with the trading statement issued alongside it. This showed a slightly slowdown in like for like sales growth of 0.7% in the first four months of the year (January to April), down from 0.8% in the first quarter (January to March). Analysts at Jefferies said: One month is not a trend, but these numbers are in focus given the concern around FMCG [fast moving consumer group] spending, US growth in light of the account losses (VW and AT&amp;T) and the weaker start to the year that WPP had in Asia. Later come the latest weekly US oil stocks figures from the Energy Information Administration, a day after an industry survey showed a bigger than expected fall. But the worries over the Middle East after the rift between Qatar and other Gulf states has continued to see oil prices slide, and a positive EIA report may have little impact. Craig Erlam, market analyst at Oanda, said: The only notable data to come today is EIA crude oil inventories which follow an API release on Tuesday that reported a drawdown of 4.62 million barrels. With oil already under pressure as traders appear to question the suitability of the output deal and the latest geopolitical issues in the region weigh, it will be interesting to see whether another large drawdown will offer any support. Having broken below $50 though, Brent continues to look vulnerable to further downside. Manuel Lopez, regulation partner at law firm Ashurst in Madrid, has declared that Santander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue of Banco Popular is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153landmark moment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It shows that the Single Resolution Board is determined to resolve failing banks, without involving state money, he says. This signals that SRB and other EU regulators will take major steps to ensure that taxpayers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bear the cost of bank failures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait until the situation deteriorates too far before doing so. The shareholders of Popular have seen, overnight, the results of the lessons learned in 2008. This will not be the last such case, and investors will certainly study the result and the financial consequences of this important decision.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top advertising magnate, Sir Martin Sorrell, received a rough ride from shareholders today over his pay package, and his own future. One fifth of WPP shareholders refused to back Sorrell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest bumper pay deal, worth \u00c2\u00a348m, even though the company has tightened its remuneration policy after earlier protests. Investors also demanded more action on a succession plan for life after Sorrell, who is 76, especially as either side can end his contract with no notice. Businesses who are fretting about the election could consider protecting themselves against the pound suffering wild swings when the results come in. Roy Williams, managing director at supply chain firm, Vendigital, explains why sterling volatility could be a problem. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never too late for businesses to hedge against unpleasant currency-related post-Election surprises. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The currency markets appear to be banking on a Tory win but the polls are more ambivalent. Businesses operating on low margins with significant imports or exports should consider a late hedge to protect their trading position from exchange rate volatility in the immediate aftermath of the General Election. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Prior to deciding what to do, businesses need to understand if they are a net importer or exporter to each of their various markets. For manufacturers that are net exporters for example, it would be worth considering locking in their exchange rate for a fixed period of time as part of a bank agreement. This will at least allow them a period of financial certainty to plan against. Another option is to line up suppliers in different regions, to give flexibility depending how the foreign exchange markets move, Williams adds. UBS Wealth Management have fired over some analysis of how the financial markets will respond to the result of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election: None of their scenarios sound particularly appealing, frankly, but here goes.... Conservative enhanced majority Back to business as usual for government. Established trends of rising inflation and weak growth in household incomes unlikely to change, weighing on growth in coming quarters. Conservative majority, in the case of less than stellar performance Prime Minister beholden to backbenchers in her party who favour a swift exit and hard Brexit. Less likely to see a transition deal. This results in sharp slowdown in growth as trade falters. Firms shift investment from the UK into the EU. Labour-led minority government Complete change of economic programme for the UK. Domestic policy takes a backseat amid Brexit negotiations, with lack of clarity over which aspects of Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposals will be implemented. Sharp drop in business and consumer confidence amid prospect of unstable coalition, muddled Brexit stance, and higher corporate and business taxes. Downside risks to already below-consensus estimates of 1.4% GDP growth for this year and 0.7% for next. The pound has done its best impression of a somnolent sloth this morning. Sterling is unchanged on the day, at $1.2907, on the final trading session before Britons trudge to the polls to elect our next government. Traders are eager to find out which (if any) of the rival opinion polls have actually predicted the result correctly. The pound could rally if Theresa May gets an increased majority, but likely slide if the PM manages to actually lose seats. Paresh Davdra of RationalFX says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The pound has remained steady on the eve of the general election. As campaigning reaches its climax, the pound has retreated slightly from the two-week highs seen yesterday but remains stable, as analysts await the election results. The markets are positive about the prospects of Prime Minster Theresa May emerging the winner of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote, as current polls indicate a secure lead for the Conservatives. However, there is still caution over the remote possibility of a hung parliament or a Labour victory, which investors fear would sink the pound in the aftermath of the election. Most European stock markets have crept a little high this morning, as traders enjoy a quiet day ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excitement. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX is lagging behind, with Banco Santander down 2% following its plan to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn in new capital to cover Banco Popular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-performing assets. Thursday will include Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election, a European Central Bank meeting, and ex-FBI chief James Comey testifying to Congress. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, says: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing mild gains in the FTSE in what is otherwise a mixed European session this morning. US futures are pointing a little higher ahead of the open, with little direction coming from across the pond. The UK index has stabilised in the weeks leading up to the election, with the sudden uncertainty around the outcome appearing to be contributing to the moves. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suddenly some drama in the markets, as the euro slides to a four-day low. The single currency shed half a cent to $1.122 after Bloomberg reported that the ECB is preparing to cut its inflation forecasts. Government bond prices are also jumping, pushing down the yield (interest rate) on that debt. Lower inflation forecasts means less chance of the ECB tightening monetary policy soon, and unwinding its huge bond purchase scheme. The Financial Times also argue that the Banco Popular bailout has bolstered the credibility of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector. Their Madrid bureau chief Tobias Buck writes: Analysts said that the ability of eurozone authorities to decisively step in to wind down Popular and safeguard its assets gives the EU regime new credibility after questions were raised during the tortuous struggle to clean up Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubled banks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s essentially a case of the regulation doing exactly what it was created for,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Laurent Frings, head of credit research at Aberdeen Asset Management. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But it does show that there is real risk in investing in these second tier names in the banking sector. The rescue of Banco Popular means that attention will now turn to Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sector. Some analysts are speculating on whether any Italian banks will fall into Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resolution mechanism, as some regional lenders are struggling to raise fresh capital. Analysts at ABN Amro, though, fear that some Italian banks aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as attractive as Popular. The deal is facilitated by the fact that Banco Popular is actually strong enough to have buyers. Especially their loan book, and diversification to Portugal was of interest. Crucially, the deal could be performed without the need for state assistance. However, in Italy, the banks of Veneto and Vicenza are not in the equivalent balance sheet position as the Banco Popular. It would seem that the large institutions in Italy would be unwilling to take over the banks without the interaction of the Italian state, either via the Atlante fund or another mechanism. The question now is, if Banco Popular has now been stated as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfailing or likely to fail\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by the SRB, what does this mean for the arguably weaker banks of Veneto and Vicenza banks This chart, from M&amp;S\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bond Vigilantes team, shows how Banco Popular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s risky bonds have been wiped out by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal (the orange line). But senior debt (which is further down the pecking order when a company fails) is not being \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbailed-in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue, so its value has actually risen. Once upon a time, a failing eurozone bank would have sparked mayhem in the financial markets. Not today, though. The news that Banco Popular has been acquired for one shiny euro by Santander has caused a notable lack of drama. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bank resolution mechanism is acting like it was meant to. Shareholders in a failed bank have been wiped out, and crucially so have the riskier bondholders. Various Banco Popular debt instruments have been written down, or converted into equity which was then handed to Santander, as part of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal. That means that bondholders who took a risk by holding this debt (which offered attractive returns) are suffering losses, rather than the taxpayer. James Mackintosh of the Wall Street Journal has tweeted the details: The OECD also hiked its growth forecasts for the eurozone and Japan, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t nudge its UK forecasts. Angel Gurria, head of the OECD, says we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too excited that global growth is heading for a six-year high of 3.5%. He told Reuters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everything is relative. What I would not like us to do is celebrate the fact that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re moving from very bad to mediocre. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that we have to get used to it or live with it. We have to continue to strive to do better.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Something to ponder.... This shows why global growth still isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood enough\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, in the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view. This chart shows how the OECD expects the global economy to grow faster, but with many of the benefits heading to the richest: The OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest global economic outlook is just out, and it gives a mixed picture. On the upside, the Paris-based thinktank has hiked its global growth forecast this year to 3.5%, from 3.3% previously. That would be the best performance in six years. The OECD sees growth rising further to 3.6% in 2018. But it is also concerned by persistent inequality in the global economy, lacklustre wage growth, and signs that the public are losing faith in their governments. And it says the outlook is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better, but not good enough\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The OECD has cut its US growth forecasts, but it now more optimistic about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic prospects. My colleague Katie Allen has read the report, and explains: The OECD devoted a significant proportion of its latest report to the possible forces behind a backlash against globalisation. That discontent was seen as a key factor behind Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory in the race for the US presidency, since when he has pledged to put \u00e2\u20ac\u0153America first\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Anti-globalisation sentiment also appears to have boosted protectionist politicians in other countries, including France where the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen made it to the final round of the presidential election but lost to the centrist Emmanuel Macron. The OECD said international trade had been a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153powerful engine of global economic growth and convergence in living standards between countries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but that despite those gains, the backlash against it had been rising. Readers may remember that Santander has a track record on rescuing ailing and troubled banks, including in the UK. It took over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Abbey National and Alliance &amp; Leicester before the financial crisis in 2008, and then added Bradford &amp; Bingley savers to its businesses when B&amp;B\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mortgage book was nationalised. Santander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, Ana Botin, has insisted that she came under \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely no pressure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from regulators to rescue Banco Popular. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, she says This is a transaction that is very good for our franchise in Spain and Portugal. It creates the best bank in both markets. Botin says that an opportunity arose yesterday to present an offer to the Single Resolution Board, to take over Popular, and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impressed by how quickly the rescue was handled. This is really great news for Europe, for the financial system, for Spain, and for Santander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders. Botin says that the deal won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hurt Santander -- it is sticking with all its financial targets for 2017 and 2018, and will be able to improve on its targets from 2019. The \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn of fresh capital is coming from a rights issue, she points out, so Santander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital reserves won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be depleted. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no word on any potential job cuts or branch closures. Botin says: We are fully committed to supporting both the team and the customers from today. But what about Popular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-performing real estate loans - does Santander really know what it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taking on? Botin says her staff did have time to do due diligence on Popular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets, prior to making its offer. And with Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy growing strongly, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confident this deal will be a success. Elke K\u00c3\u00b6nig, chair of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Single Resolution Board (which triggered Banco Popular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue), says that the deal will protect the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s savers. K\u00c3\u00b6nig also argues that the deal vindicates Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to avoid another financial crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decision taken today safeguards the depositors and critical functions of Banco Popular. This shows that the tools given to resolution authorities after the crisis are effective to protect taxpayers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 money from bailing out banks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official statement: The Single Resolution Board adopts resolution decision for Banco Popular Back in the UK, the Halifax bank building society has reported that house prices rose by 0.4% in May. That ends a run of four monthly falls in a row, and means prices are 3.3% higher than a year ago. But prices were still 0.2% lower in the March-to-May quarter than in the previous three months, highlighting how the UK housing market has cooled. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Luis de Guindos, has welcomed Santander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue of Banco Popular. In a statement, de Guindos says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good outcome for the bank, given the situation it had arrived at in recent weeks, as it implies maximum protection for depositors and continuity of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added that taxpayer money is not involved, and there is no danger of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccredit risk contagion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 spreading to other banks. Shares in Santander have dropped by 3% at the start of trading in Madrid. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because investors are reacting to its plan to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn in new capital to fund its rescue of Banco Popular. Popular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have been suspended, following their sale to Sandander If Banco Popular is in such trouble, why did Santander buy it? Popular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attraction is its retail banking division, and its small business customers. They can bolster Santander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existing business, and give it a larger share of the Spanish banking market. Bloomberg reporter Rodrigo Orihuela says: On the one hand, Popular has a very strong SME business and a very strong retail business, which is what Santander wants. The real estate business is the big big question....Everyone will have to wonder whether Sandander can solve it. They probably have a plan. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of Orihuela explaining the situation: Banco Popular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse into the arms of Santander today was primarily due to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctoxic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 real estate loans on its books, and its failure to raise fresh capital. The bank made some seriously bad loans before the financial crisis triggered a major Spanish housing crash, and its management have been unable to fix the damage. Back in February, Popular posted a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.5bn annual loss due to bad debts, restructuring costs and various writedowns. Then in May it admitted that it was setting aside even more money to cover real estate losses. Its new chairman, Emilio Saracho, has been trying to sell assets and issue more shares to raise capital, but the market has proved unreceptive to his efforts. The crisis escalated in recent days, as a series of potential buyers dropped out of an auction to buy Banco Popular. With capital levels running dangerously low, and its shares in freefall, the ECB was forced to step in and trigger today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue, to Sandander. Karen Tso of CNBC points out that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t costing the taxpayer anything, because Santander will raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn of new capital from the markets. Nick Leeson, the rogue trader who broke Barings Bank in the 1990s, is struck by the symbolic price of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal: Breaking news from Spain: Banco Santander has bought Banco Popular for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1, rescuing its fellow Spanish lender from from the brink of collapse. Santander said it would raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn to cover the capital shortfall and strengthen the balance sheet of Popular, after the European Central Bank deemed it to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153failing or likely to fail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The ECB (which supervises the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest banks) triggered the move after concluding yesterday that Banco Popular was running out of cash. It says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The significant deterioration of the liquidity situation of the bank in recent days led to a determination that the entity would have, in the near future, been unable to pay its debts or other liabilities as they fell due. Santander said it was making the purchase after \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a competitive sale process\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to rescue the ailing bank. Popular lost more than half of its market value in recent days as investors grew increasingly fearful over its ability to deal with its capital shortfall. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgraded the lender on Tuesday. Details and reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. You have to take your hat off to Australia. Despite the economic challenges of the last decade, it has just racked up its 103rd successive quarter of growth - dating all the way back to 1991. However, these latest growth figures aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too impressive. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.3% in the first three months of this year, a little faster than Britain but slower than France or Germany. That means annual growth is now just 1.7%; the weakest since 2009. Bad weather is partly to blame, with some economists pointing to the disruption caused by Cyclone Debbie in Match. But others are concerned. Michael Workman, a Commonwealth Bank senior economist, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Australian economy began 2017 with a whimper following a decent pace of expansion in the final quarter of 2016.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The weakness in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data extends beyond the weather, and the slowdown in the domestic economy has occurred at a time when the global economic backdrop has improved. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details: That sets the scene for this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main economic event, the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest assessment of the global economy. The Paris-based thinktank will update its growth forecasts, and highlight the key threats it sees ahead. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not expecting much drama in the London markets today. The pound is hovering around the $1.29 mark, and the FTSE 100 is forecast to open unchanged. Oil remains volatile, though, as the diplomatic crisis in the region rumbles on.

                "bodyText":"Rising inflation and weak wage growth will leave Britain rooted to the bottom of the league table for living standards among the west\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest countries in 2018, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has warned. In the last piece of economic news before the general election, the Paris-based thinktank said the next government would spend the first 18 months of the next parliamentary term presiding over a severe squeeze on real incomes. The OECD said inflation at 2.7% during 2018 would dwarf wage growth of 1.5% and result in the UK have the weakest real income performance, alongside Finland, of any of its 34 rich member states. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady, said it was alarming that UK workers would face the biggest real wage fall of any advanced economy in 2018, while other OECD members, with the exception of Italy and Mexico, would experience real wage increases in 2018. She said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Boosting wages has to be a top priority for whoever gets the keys to Downing Street. British workers still haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recovered from the last financial crisis. The last thing they can afford is another hit on their finances.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The west\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading economic thinktank has predicted a tentative recovery for the global economy this year and next but warned of risks from fragile trust in government, weak wage growth and persistent inequality. In its latest health check on growth prospects, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development described the outlook for the global economy almost a decade on from the financial crash as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better, but not good enough\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Paris-based organisation nudged up its forecasts for global growth this year. But it trimmed its outlook for the US, to show growth accelerating a little more gently than in its previous assessment in March. The OECD made no changes to previous predictions that the UK will suffer a Brexit-related slowdown, with growth easing from 1.8% in 2016 to 1.6% this year and just 1% in 2018. But after being a strong supporter of austerity measures to curb Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit after the end of the 2008-09 recession, the thinktank said it was time for a different approach. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The budget deficit is projected to remain broadly unchanged this year, but fiscal consolidation is planned for 2018 despite a weaker growth outlook. Instead, further fiscal initiatives to increase public investment should be considered to support demand in the near term and boost supply in the longer term,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it said. Labour seized on the report as evidence of OECD backing for its proposal to bolster public borrowing for investment by \u00c2\u00a3250bn over the next decade. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the thinktank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conclusion was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a hammer blow for the Tories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economic credibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for increased investment in our economy is a ringing endorsement of Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policy in this election, and shows the clear choice voters have on Thursday.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Referring to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline in GDP growth in the past six months, Catherine Mann, the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, said recent data had been poor and the benefit of the lower pound for exporters was offset by inflationary pressures from higher import prices hitting disposable incomes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are concerned about the purchasing power for consumers in an environment where the pass through [from higher import prices] seems pretty robust,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. After 3% growth in 2016, the global economy is expected to expand by 3.5% this year and 3.6% in 2018. That compares with previous forecasts of 3.3% and 3.6% respectively. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After many years of weak recovery, with global growth in 2016 at the lowest rate since 2009, some signs of improvement have begun to appear,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mann wrote in the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest outlook report.

This time around, all eyes were on the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forward guidance on interest rates and the risk assessment for the economic outlook. On both, the ECB delivered some changes. As regards the forward guidance on interest rates, it was not about what the ECB said but what it actually didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say. The ECB omitted the reference that interest rates could even be lower than their present levels and therefore dropped the easing bias for interest rates. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not forget, however, that at the same time, the ECB kept the easing bias on QE, sticking to the formulation that the ECB would be willing to step up its monthly asset purchases if need be. Also, Draghi remarked that the ECB will remain in the market for a long while and the QE tapering was not discussed at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. As regards the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s macro-economic assessment, the ECB upgraded the risk to the growth outlook from negative to now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broadly balanced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Actually the first time since 2011 that the ECB calls the outlook for growth balanced.</p> <p>The improved economic outlook, however, has not yet led to any significant inflationary pressure in the Eurozone. This picture was reflected in the ECB staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic projections which were marginally upgraded to 1.9% (during the Q&amp;A session, Draghi said that due to the upward revision of 1Q GDP, growth would actually now come in at 2%), 1.8% and 1.7% in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. At the same time, the inflation projections were revised downwards to 1.5%, 1.3% and 1.6% for 2017, 2018 and 2019. Even though the downward revision was mainly the result of lower oil prices and a slightly stronger exchange rate, subdued inflation rates remain the biggest concern for the ECB. Reasons for low inflation rates are in our view not only the slack in the Eurozone economy, still high unemployment and a high number of (involuntary) part-time and low-wage employment but also globalisation and digitalisation. </p> <p>In our view, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB meeting was a very first baby step towards eventual tapering. It is obvious that the ECB is trying to be as cautious as possible to very gradually get out of the unconventional monetary policy measures. Therefore, this process of preparing markets extremely carefully with words and changes in the communication will continue and can take a long while before the ECB delivers new action. In this context, the low inflation forecasts in our view argue in favour of only a mild tapering and probably a tapering without an end date on it. There is clearly room for another \u00e2\u20ac\u0153longer but lower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd announcement for 2018 later this year.</p> <p>All in all, the ECB today delivered two important linguistic changes to its official communication which were more than only words. These changes marked the official start of a taper tiptoeing. A tiptoeing which will still take a long while before it could be called policy normalisation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59394ec2e4b0bdd87e2f49da\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-08T13:34:13.811Z\">2.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens mixed</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With the third element of Triple Threat Thursday - the testimony of ex-FBI head James Comey - due shortly, US markets have got off to an uncertain start.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down just 5 points, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both edged higher.</p> <p>Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Following the release of James Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement on Wednesday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which suggested Trump pressured him for a pledge of loyalty and implied his job was in peril if he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drop the Michael Flynn investigation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all eyes will be on the former FBI chief\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony in front of the Senate intelligence committee.

                "bodyText":"Finally, away from the Triple Threats, there are developments concerning Greece. The IMF has confirmed that the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director will attend next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s critical meeting of eurozone finance ministers as efforts intensify to resolve the rift over how to lighten the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt load. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Its official: Christine Lagarde will attend the June 15 eurogroup meeting in Luxembourg according to IMF spokesman Gerry Rice. Her presence now leaves the door open to the Fund approving a program \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in principle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if the impasse over debt relief isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resolved at the meeting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an effective get-out clause that would allow the EU more time to come to an agreement while emergency loans were disbursed to Greece in time for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.5bn worth of debt repayments in July. The IMF has made clear it will not contribute to disbursements until a debt relief formula is devised permitting Largarde to make the case for further bailout participation before the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We would still be insisting on reforms and debt relief before the IMF would disburse any of its funds,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rice told reporters this afternoon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So this is not a backing down or a walking away in any respect.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The EU and IMF have been at loggerheads over how to make Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gargantuan debt load sustainable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a prerequisite for the ECB to accept the country into its stimulus programme. Earlier Thursday, the EU economic affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici cautioned against \u00e2\u20ac\u0153playing with fire\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd saying it was vital a debt relief agreement was secured on June 15. Lagarde had stayed away from the last and inconclusive meeting of euro area finance ministers on May 22 amid concerns the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt crisis was poised to flare up again. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras legislated further pension cuts and tax rises recently telling sceptical MPs a debt deal would be reached that would put Greece back on the road to economic recovery. Late on Wednesday he said EU investment programs should now be used to heal the rift between the EU and IMF by igniting the sort of growth that would bring concordance on debt relief. Citing data released by the labour ministry, the leftist leader told the inaugural European Concordia summit in Athens that indices were improving with 89,500 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real jobs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd being created in May in addition to the 92,000 work places created in April. On Thursday, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics agency, Elstat, said unemployment had dropped from a record high of 27.9% in September 2013 to 22.5% in March. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and for the latest on the UK election we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be following events through the night. Otherwise we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back here as usual tomorrow to cover the aftermath of the vote. The testimony of ex-FBI director James Comey certainly does not appear to be troubling the US markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has just hit a new peak of 21,265. Its last record was just under a week ago on 2 June. Triple Threat Thursday has so far pass off without too much market drama. Ahead of the close of polls in the UK election, the FTSE 100 and the pound have both slipped back, with investors nervous about the possible outcome. The general feeling is that a Conservative majority is on the cards, but traders are not ruling out a surprise, given the Brexit and Trump shocks. In Europe, the euro has weakened as the European Central Bank ruled out lowering interest rates, a change in its policy. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 28.64 points or 0.38% lower at 7449.98 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax closed 0.32% higher at 12,713.58 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac slipped 0.02% to 5264.24 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 1.46% to 21,042.41 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.75% higher at 10,953.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.61% to 779.05 On Wall Street, as James Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony continues, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 29 points or 0.14%. On the latest market reaction to the UK election, David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The FTSE 100 is sliding today as dealers are concerned about the UK general election. If you take an average of the polls conducted, it points to a Conservative win but some investors have less confidence in the polls, in the wake of Brexit and President Trump. The UK stock market would prefer a Tory victory as the party is more in favour of free market economics than Labour. The ground lost by the Conservatives in the past couple of weeks has rattled some traders. So far markets seem to be taking the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big events in their stride. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a bit more movement this afternoon, but nothing to quite deliver on the promise of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctriple threat Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. So far James Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance in front of the Senate intelligence committee has done little to disrupt the US markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if anything the dollar is looking pretty perky, rising against both the pound and the euro. Of course it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early days yet, with a couple of hours to go until the former FBI chief\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public testimony is finished. Who knows what it will uncover? Elsewhere the ECB largely went through the motions this afternoon. Though the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation forecasts cuts had already been leaked, the central bank did still pull a mild surprise out of the bag by dropping the reference to lowering interest rates, stating that they would \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcremain at their present levels for an extended period of time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Yet Draghi made sure that this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken as too hawkish, something that only ended up disappointing the euro, which fell half a percent against the dollar and 0.1% against the pound. And what of the UK? Well, the FTSE found itself down by around 0.2%, while the pound gradually shed its early growth, both saving any major movements until they get a glimpse at the first trickle of results this evening. A reminder that ex-FBI head James Comey is testifying at the moment. So far there has been little market reaction, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down just a couple of points. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour of the meeting, with Comey explaining why he started making contemporaneous notes about his discussions with President Trump: Why did Comey decide to document that [first] discussion. What was it about that meeting? Comey replies: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A combination of things. The circumstances, the subject matter and the person I was interacting with.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Comey says he was alone with the president-elect discussing weighty matters. Then: I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting, and so I thought it was important to document it. Our live blog is here: The European Central Bank has got the eurozone economy moving again, but will it last, asks our economics editor Larry Elliott: Growth forecasts revised up. Inflation forecasts revised down. Jobs being created. Take a bow Mario Draghi. Urged on by its proactive boss, the European Central Bank has achieved what looked impossible until recently: it has got the eurozone economy moving again. Draghi should milk the applause while he can because the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sweet spot won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last for ever. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the US and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the UK, two countries that pursued exactly the same macro-economic strategy as the ECB, only earlier. His full analysis is here: More reaction to Draghi and the ECB: Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at Forex.com, said: There was so much fuss made about this key ECB meeting and it ended up being a bit of a damp squib. The central bank and its president Mario Draghi delivered contradictory statements about inflation and probably left many market participants feeling somewhat disappointed that there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything concrete announced. To be fair, the leaked inflation and growth forecasts earlier this week had already taken the edge out of this meeting and many people had already prepared to hear a more dovish than a hawkish ECB. Hence, the euro didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly fall off a cliff. Back with the European Central Bank, and Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank has commented again following Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference: It was a bit like in the good old days when ECB watchers looked out for code words like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vigilance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This time around, all eyes were on the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forward guidance on interest rates and the risk assessment for the economic outlook. On both, the ECB delivered some changes. As regards the forward guidance on interest rates, it was not about what the ECB said but what it actually didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say. The ECB omitted the reference that interest rates could even be lower than their present levels and therefore dropped the easing bias for interest rates. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not forget, however, that at the same time, the ECB kept the easing bias on QE, sticking to the formulation that the ECB would be willing to step up its monthly asset purchases if need be. Also, Draghi remarked that the ECB will remain in the market for a long while and the QE tapering was not discussed at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. As regards the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s macro-economic assessment, the ECB upgraded the risk to the growth outlook from negative to now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broadly balanced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Actually the first time since 2011 that the ECB calls the outlook for growth balanced. The improved economic outlook, however, has not yet led to any significant inflationary pressure in the Eurozone. This picture was reflected in the ECB staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic projections which were marginally upgraded to 1.9% (during the Q&amp;A session, Draghi said that due to the upward revision of 1Q GDP, growth would actually now come in at 2%), 1.8% and 1.7% in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. At the same time, the inflation projections were revised downwards to 1.5%, 1.3% and 1.6% for 2017, 2018 and 2019. Even though the downward revision was mainly the result of lower oil prices and a slightly stronger exchange rate, subdued inflation rates remain the biggest concern for the ECB. Reasons for low inflation rates are in our view not only the slack in the Eurozone economy, still high unemployment and a high number of (involuntary) part-time and low-wage employment but also globalisation and digitalisation. In our view, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB meeting was a very first baby step towards eventual tapering. It is obvious that the ECB is trying to be as cautious as possible to very gradually get out of the unconventional monetary policy measures. Therefore, this process of preparing markets extremely carefully with words and changes in the communication will continue and can take a long while before the ECB delivers new action. In this context, the low inflation forecasts in our view argue in favour of only a mild tapering and probably a tapering without an end date on it. There is clearly room for another \u00e2\u20ac\u0153longer but lower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd announcement for 2018 later this year. All in all, the ECB today delivered two important linguistic changes to its official communication which were more than only words. These changes marked the official start of a taper tiptoeing. A tiptoeing which will still take a long while before it could be called policy normalisation. With the third element of Triple Threat Thursday - the testimony of ex-FBI head James Comey - due shortly, US markets have got off to an uncertain start. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down just 5 points, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both edged higher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Following the release of James Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement on Wednesday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which suggested Trump pressured him for a pledge of loyalty and implied his job was in peril if he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drop the Michael Flynn investigation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all eyes will be on the former FBI chief\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony in front of the Senate intelligence committee. Presently neither the dollar nor Dow Jones seems too fussed by the recent revelations, though that could all change when Comey takes the stand. For those wanting to follow Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony, our US live blog is here: Q: The economy has started to improve nicely; is that because of QE or despite QE? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because of QE - we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re here because of that, smiles Draghi (perhaps inwardly fuming at this implied criticism of his precious stimulus package). And then he reels off the evidence that QE has worked: Eurozone growth in the first quarter of 2017 has been revised up today from 0.5% to 0.6%. The PMI indices, which track private sector output, are at their highest level since April 2011. The eurozone economic sentiment is close to its highest level, set in 2007. And unemployment is the lowest since 2009....and five million jobs have been created in the last three and a half years, more than in America. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the ECB press conference. Another nudge to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elected leaders to crack on with the job: Draghi is trying to cool speculation that the ECB is inching towards the exit of its stimulus programme.... Q: Could the ECB increase its QE programme if the economy weakens? Draghi says that there is adequate \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flexibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the asset purchase scheme. An Estonian journalist asks if her country is unfairly missing out from the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s asset purchase scheme, because it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any government debt for the ECB to mop up. Draghi argues that Estonia benefits from QE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive impact on the euro area, as it is an open economy. Q: Why did the ECB decide that Santander was the best candidate to take over Banco Popular? Vice-president V\u00c3\u00adtor Const\u00c3\u00a2ncio says that the ECB concluded that Popular was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153failing or likely to fail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as a bank run was taking hold and liquidity was running low. But the final decision on its future was taken by the Single Resolution Board (an independent agency) not the ECB Q: Did the ECB discuss when to start normalising monetary policy? No, says Draghi.... but then he remembers that two council members made some observations about this issue. I suspect that one of them was Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker, Jens Weidmann. Q: Could a prolonged lower inflation rate force the ECB to change its forward guidance and raise its negative deposit rate before ending its QE programme? [currently it promises to complete the asset purchase scheme before tackling interest rates] \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No, no\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Draghi, emphatically. Nothing substantial has happened to inflation, other than changes to the oil price, he insists. Q: Should we expect the ECB to outline its tapering strategy in September, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to drop your pledge to cut interest rates? It was not discussed, president Mario Draghi snaps back. Q: Last month, ECB governing council member Ewald Nowotny questioned whether the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation target was achievable. Should the markets share his concerns? Draghi says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to look at the reasons behind Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low inflation. One problem is that wage growth is modest, because negotiations are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153backward looking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd -- ie, bosses only offer small pay rises because inflation has been so low recently. Draghi also points out that many of the jobs created recently are of relatively poor quality -- many are temporary, or part-time. So \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to be patient....and persistent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Draghi insists. The euro has shed half a cent against the US dollar after Mario Draghi announced the ECB has slashed its inflation forecasts. Q: Did the ECB act quickly enough to tackle Banco Popular (the Spanish bank which was rescued by Santander this week). Draghi says he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on individual institutions, but he hails the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153timely action\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the regulators who handled the sale. Onto questions Q: Were today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions unanimous? We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a vote, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear any dissenting voices, Draghi replies (presumably he hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stuck his fingers in his ears....) Draghi ends his statement with his traditional call on European governments to do more to tackle structural problems in their economics, and underpin the recovery. The leaks were true! The ECB has cut its forecasts for inflation over the next few years. Here are the new forecasts for CPI inflation: 2017: 1.5%, down from 1.7% previously 2018: 1.3%, down from 1.6% 2019: 1.6%, down from 1.7% Draghi says this is mainly due to lower oil prices. More encouraging news. The ECB has raised its growth forecasts for the next few years. It now expects GDP to rise by 1.9% this year, up from 1.8% expected back in March. It has also raised its growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019 by 0.1 percentage points, to 1.8% and 1.7% respectively. But while the eurozone economy is recovering, there are still \u00e2\u20ac\u0153downside risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, predominately due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153global factors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Draghi says. Boom! Mario Draghi says that the eurozone recovery is enjoying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stronger momentum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and now growing at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhat faster pace than previously expected. Risks to the growth outlook are now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broadly balanced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he declares -- dropping the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous warning that risks were to the downside. Over in Tallinn, Mario Draghi has arrived to explain the decisions taken at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB governing council meetings. He confirms that the ECB left interest rates on hold, adding: The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation that the pledge to cut rates to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lower levels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if needed has been dropped. Draghi also confirms that the ECB agreed to maintain its asset purchase programme at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn per month, adding: If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration. The ECB president then turns to the economic situation. Our stimulus programme has created the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very favourable financing conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that are needed to get inflation back to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of close to but below 2%. Away from the ECB for a moment, and more positive signs from the US economy. Weekly jobless claims fell to 245,000 compared to 255,000 the previous week. That however was slightly worse than the 240,000 figure that had been expected. And the previous week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure was revised up from the original estimate of 248,000. This really is a historic day..... You might have expected the euro to rally, after the ECB dropped its pledge to cut interest rates to fresh lows if needed. But actually the single currency has fallen a little, down 0.3% today at $1.1225, after a sudden spike when the ECB announcement hit the wires. That shows that investors expected today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s change in language, and are also anticipating a dovish performance from ECB chief Mario Draghi in a few minutes. Fred Ducrozet of Pictet Bank says the ECB has taken a symbolic step towards tightening monetary policy in the eurozone, for the first time in many years. Carsten Brzeski of ING calls it a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbaby step\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 towards tapering (or trimming the size of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE programme down from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn per month). It was not about what the ECB said but what it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say. In fact, the ECB omitted the reference that interest rates could be lower than their present levels. This easing bias is now gone. Starting at 2.30pm CET, Draghi will present the new ECB staff macro-economic projections, the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment on growth and inflation and possibly some hints at the future path of monetary policy. In our view, some tweaks to the macro-economic risk assessment as a clear statement that the current recovery does still not show any inflationary signs are the most likely outcomes of the press conference. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the ECB appears to have ruled out the prospect of further rate cuts. We still need to hear from Mario Draghi, but the initial assessment of the early statement is that the ECB may have made some tiny, tentative steps towards policy normalisation by dropping a reference that it could cut interest rates further. We still need to see the ECB staff forecasts for growth and inflation, and there is a big expectation that the ECB will sharply cut its inflation forecast to the 1.5% level, way below the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target rate. Reto Foellmi, Professor of International Economics at University of St.Gallen, says interest rates will still remain at record lows for some time, despite the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspillover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 effects on the global economy. While the short-term costs of prolonging the ongoing monetary regime for a quarter or so seem small, it is not without incident. The longer we stay in this regime the more severe consequences it has on related currencies, such as the Swiss Franc. The actions of the ECB force them to set very low interest rates and to engage in huge bond buying programmes on their own. This spillover effect to other currencces makes it more difficult it is to change the course of action afterwards.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ECB has also voted to keep creating \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn of new money each month, to buy government and corporate bonds in an attempt to get inflation up. The bank has also pledged to boost this QE programme if needed, saying: If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration. Newsflash: The European Central Bank has dropped its pledge to cut interest rates to fresh record lows if needed. Following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council meeting, the ECB has (as expected) voted to leave borrowing costs at their current levels. But importantly, it has adjusted the language in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement. It now says that it expects interest rates to remain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at their present levels for an extended period of time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Previously, the ECB promised that rates would remain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at their present levels or lower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So this is the first step towards tightening monetary policy in the euro area - although we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still a long way from an actual interest rate hike. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision means that the headline interest rate in the eurozone remains at 0.0%, and banks must pay a negative interest rate of -0.4% when they leave money in the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaults rather than lending it to businesses and households. Reaction to follow.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly time for the first of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctriple threats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 -- the results of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European Central Bank meeting, followed by Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference. Investors across the eurozone, and beyond, will be looking closely for signs that the ECB could adjust its monetary policy stance, especially after today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth upgrades. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, explains: While investors have their eyes and ears glued to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU GDP release and this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision could have big ramifications for financial markets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most were expecting the upward revision of 0.6% to be confirmed and the latest estimate of EU GDP, although positive, is unlikely to alter Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking ahead of his lunchtime press conference. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When Draghi speaks later today, investors will be listening out for any dovish tones on interest rates. The ECB has previously stated that rates will remain \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcat present or lower\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and any removal of the potential to loosen monetary policy further could perk up markets significantly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says the City is facing the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccalm before the storm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, ahead of tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election results. The polls are open, and despite what is expected to be an incredibly volatile 24 hours ahead, we have seen a remarkably calm start to the day for the FTSE 100... Amid a remarkable Corbyn resurgence in the polls, FTSE traders would do well to remember the confusion caused around the US election and EU referendum, where the predicted demise of stocks in the eventuality of a Trump win or Brexit really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come to fruition, catching many off-guard. Ultimately the worst eventuality here would be a hung parliament, given that Brexit negotiations are due to start in just 11 days. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is basically becalmed right now, with the FTSE 100 currently down 9 points at 7469. It has gained around 4.5% since today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election was called in mid-April, so traders are now waiting to see if the pollsters have got this one right. The pound is also failing to provide any excitement, and is currently down 0.1% at $1.2945. With Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s polling stations doing a brisk trade, City experts have been analysing how the results of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote will shift the markets. Here are some predictions from Mihir Kapadia of Sun Global Investments, who expects Theresa May to be returned with an increased majority. \u00c2\u00b7 Conservative Win: This is largely expected, however, it is the scale of the victory that matters. If there is a landslide for the Conservatives, the markets will be stable, as they have already priced in for this scenario and thus there is not much leverage for it to rally further. The pound on the other hand will perform well over the news and can well trade over $1.3100. If there is a marginal victory, the markets will await for further clarity on the Brexit prospects and developments. So whichever the outcome in the Tory victory, the markets will be stable. \u00c2\u00b7 Labour Win: This will be a major political upset but is highly unlikely. This could see pressure on the GBP and on Gilts in particular. UK shares may also decline though some sectors will gain on the back of expectations of higher government spending. \u00c2\u00b7 Hung Parliament: This scenario is probably the most difficult for the markets, as it will could lead to a coalition government. This will also weaken the new government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position in handling the Brexit negotiations, and can be particularly damaging for the pound. Jeremy Cook of currency firm World First is predicting (or possible hoping for) a relatively quiet night: Craig Erlam, senior analyst at foreign exchange firm OANDA, says the pound will plunge if the election didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide a clear winner: From a markets perspective, this election is huge and could produce some substantial moves, particularly in sterling, the FTSE and UK debt. As we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned from similar events previously \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Brexit, US election - not only is the outcome not always obvious but the market reaction can also catch people off guard and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had traders acting with such caution all week. The most undesirable outcome is surely a hung parliament that produces both domestic political uncertainty and, more importantly, uncertainty and delays in Brexit negotiations. With the currently deadline being March 2019, any delay will be detrimental to the UK in negotiations and could therefore be devastating for sterling. While the knee jerk reaction to this may also be bad for the FTSE, as we saw after the EU referendum, we could see this bounce back quite quickly with the weaker currency benefiting its mostly outward facing companies. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown at the start of this year was due to faltering demand in the services sector, especially among businesses that relied on consumer spending. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that higher inflation, due to the weak pound, is hitting households. It also highlights the risks posed by Brexit, argues Ben Chu of the Independent. He writes: The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump in GDP growth in the first quarter has been attributed by economists to a sharp slowdown in consumer spending, owing to the spike in inflation that has followed the drop in the pound in the wake of the Brexit vote last June. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP growth rate is expected to pick up slightly in the next quarter, but most analysts believe that leaving the EU will set back the economy, with the damage depending on the nature and scope of future trade arrangements with the EU, our biggest trade partner. Some economists warn that a failure to secure any form of deal - a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cliff-edge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit in 2019 - could cost the economy up to 9 per cent of GDP, relative to otherwise, by 2030. The UK has been growing more strongly than the rest of the EU for most of the past seven years but that partly reflects stronger population growth in the UK. The pound has shed its early gains, following the news that Britain was the slowest-growing member of the EU in the last quarter. Sterling is now hovering around $1.295, falling away from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-week high. Some early reaction to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European growth figures: Breaking! The eurozone economy grew even faster than first thought at the start of this year. Statistics body Eurostat has just updated its figures, to show that GDP in the euro area expanded by 0.6% in January-to-March. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from an initial reading of 0.5%, and is the fastest growth in a year. The figures also show that Britain was the worst-performing member of the European Union in Q1, growing by just 0.2%. In contrast, Germany expanded by 0.6%, France and Italy grew by 0.4%, and many Eastern European states grew by over 1%. We shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read too much into one quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures, though. On an annual basis, the eurozone has expanded by 1.9%, which is actually a bit slower than Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% growth over the same period. But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures do underline how Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is (finally) gathering speed, helping to bring unemployment down across the region to the lowest levels since the debt crisis starter. This chart shows how the cost of insuring against the pound tumbling, or soaring, overnight has surged today - to the highest level since last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned over the years that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wise to treat opinion polls with caution, which is why traders are rather nervous today. Jasslyn Yeo, JP Morgan market strategist, says that younger voters (who typically have a lower turnout than older ones) could catch the City out. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets appear to be pricing in a Conservative Party majority victory. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, we still see much uncertainty surrounding the UK election, where a higher turnout vote of young people could potentially turn the tables on investors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Last week, YouGov showed the scale of the generational split in UK politics: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another chart showing how the markets might react to the UK election result: There will be drama in the markets if Theresa May doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t manage to increase her majority today (she currently has a working majority of just 17). Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services reckons 40 is the magic number to avoid internal Tory party strife. Barring a surprise the key question is how large the Conservative majority might be, with anything below 40 seats likely to embolden the ever restive elements, whose penchant for internecine warfare is well documented, to embark on a fresh leadership challenge, given the incompetence of the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign. Ostwald also pints out that the next UK government faces a very tough job: Even if a substantially larger majority is achieved, there is little doubt that it will make not a iota of difference to the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance on Brexit negotiations, though it will heighten the risk that both sides continue to talk AT, rather than TO each other, and end in a complete breakdown. There is also little doubt that the UK economy is now facing some significant headwinds, above all consumers that are facing higher inflation, weak wage growth and the pressures associated with a far too rapid pace of credit growth, the more so given an increasingly soggy housing market, above all in the populous south east. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is rather subdued this morning, with the FTSE 100 dipping by a mere 3 points to 7473. Investors are sitting on their hands (or possibly nipping off to the polling booth), while they anticipate the three big events of today. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says traders need to bring their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A game\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to work today. Voters over in the UK are going to vote for their new Prime Minister, the European Central Bank will deliver their verdict about their monetary policy and James Comey will testify in front of senate. It is difficult to say which event will have create more volatility but it would be sensible thing to be ready for all kind of outcomes. The outcome of UK elections does matter because the new Prime minister will have arduous task ahead \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the negotiation process of Brexit. Moreover, the winning candidate is not going to have a glittering economic prize because the country is facing significant slow growth, tepid wage gains and a currency which has its back broken and productivity issue which is cursed. City analysts believe the pound will rise over $1.30 if Theresa May increases her majority (which was the whole reason for calling the election). But a hung parliament could send sterling plunging by over six cents - a really sizeable move. Bloomberg has crunched forecasts from several investment banks: The cost of insuring against sharp swings in the value of the pound has soared today. That shows that City traders are preparing for sterling to move sharply when the exit polls are released at 10pm tonight. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details via Reuters: STERLING/DOLLAR OVERNIGHT IMPLIED VOLATILITY JUMPS TO 30.75 PCT ON DAY OF UK ELECTION, HIGHEST SINCE JULY EURO-STERLING OVERNIGHT IMPLIED VOLATILITY HIGHEST SINCE BREXIT VOTE AT 31.55 Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Connor Campbell of SpreadEx agrees that sterling is getting a small lift from the general election: As Britain heads to the ballot box the markets got off to a relatively quiet start this Thursday, with the pound very gently building on yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains. Cable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which, despite some big swings, has been climbing since the beginning of June \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rose another 0.2%, sending sterling to a its best price in a fortnight. Against the euro the pound has been less successful of late; nevertheless, despite being a long way from recovering the losses it has incurred since mid-May, a 0.1% increase has nudged the currency to a one and a half week peak. The pound is assumedly benefiting from the final round of polls, all of which \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to varying degrees \u00e2\u20ac\u201c point to a Tory win. The pound has hit a two-week high in early trading, as City investors anticipate a Conservative win in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election. Sterling has hit $1.2976, its highest level since 25 May, after the last wave of opinion polls suggested that Theresa May is heading back to Number 10 Downing Street with a larger majority. As this chart shows, the pound has been wallowing below $1.30 in mid-May, as the election campaign heated up and investors started wondering if Britain could end up with a hung parliament. But late last night, YouGov reported that the Conservatives have a seven-point lead over Labour: Sterling traders are now pricing a Theresa May victory, says FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed: The higher the margin Conservatives win by, the more negotiation power May will have on Brexit terms, and the higher the Pound goes from here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re calling it Triple Threat Thursday in the City. A pivotal day lies ahead, with plenty of political and economic drama in Europe and the US that could send the markets lurching. In the City, investors are on edge as Britain heads to the polling stations. The latest opinion polls point to a Conservative victory, and an increased majority for Theresa May -- but a shock result could have seismic impact on shares and the pound. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a big day for the European Central Bank as its governing council holds a monetary policy meeting. Investors had been expecting the ECB to take its first step towards tightening monetary policy, by tweaking the language in its outlook statement. However, leaks yesterday claimed that the ECB is actually going to revise down its inflation outlook -- making any exit from its stimulus programme even less likely. ECB president Mario Draghi will reveal all in his eagerly awaited press conference at lunchtime. We also get updated eurozone GDP figures, which could possibly see growth revised UP to 0.6% in the last quarter, from 0.5%, so it could be a volatile day for the euro. The third threat? Former FBI boss James Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony to Congress (from 3pm BST). It could be a historic event, with Comey facing questions from the Senate Intelligence Committee over the investigation into ties between president Trump and Russia. Our world affairs editor Julian Borger explains why it really really matters: When James Comey, the former FBI director, stands before a Senate committee on Thursday to give evidence about the president who fired him, it will be one of the most dramatic moments in US political history. The stakes will be as high as they have ever been at a congressional hearing. The questions Comey will be asked by the Senate intelligence committee include whether Donald Trump tried to persuade him to stop an investigation into improper contacts between a top adviser and Russian officials, whether Trump sought to extract a vow of personal loyalty, and whether Comey was fired because he did not comply. Trump has denied trying to make Comey drop the case, but if Comey contradicts him and is supported by other evidence, it would represent potential obstruction of justice by the president and mark a long leap down the road towards impeachment. Even in the Teapot Dome scandal that shook Warren Harding\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration in the early 1920s, and in the Watergate affair half a century later, it was not alleged that the president himself tried to intimidate an investigator.... More here: Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prepared statement has already set the scene, showing that president Donald Trump pressured him to shut down an investigation into a senior adviser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s links to Russia.

There are now obvious and serious questions being asked about what the final deal will look like and whether the article 50 talks can be completed within the two-year deadline. Unsurprisingly, the CBI expressed concern at an outcome that is bound to make business warier about investing. Life is only going to get more difficult for the Conservatives, assuming that they manage to cling on to power as a minority government. One reason May lost rather than won seats was that the country has had enough of austerity and is fed up with working ever harder for little reward. Political history suggests that sitting governments tend to do well when living standards are rising \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as they were in 2015 - and badly when they are falling. On that basis, this was a supremely daft time to hold an election, because prices are going up more quickly than wages, which are still lower in real terms than they were seven years ago. Far from helping the Conservatives, the terrorist attacks in Manchester and London merely served to make voters wonder about the wisdom of cuts in police budgets in an attempt to hit deficit-reduction targets that have not been met. Certain things are clear despite the fog of uncertainty. First, the idea of balancing the budget has retreated further into the distance. A minority government will be looking to hand out goodies to the voters rather than squeeze them further. Second, the fall in the value of the pound will intensify the squeeze on living standards, making it even more likely that there will be soft-pedalling on austerity. Third, Philip Hammond is safe in his job because May is not strong enough to sack him. Finally, the prospect of a Brexit deal under which the UK stays in the single market has increased.",

Two factors behind last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breeze-on-through attitude have run their course. First, real incomes are now falling. When they were rising last year, it was relatively easy for consumers not to fret about an event due to happen, in yet-to-be-defined form, in 2019. In any case, 52% of the voters had got want they wanted. Exporters, too, had to be concerned that slashing investment overnight could be costly.

Now, of course, the clock is ticking, which adds a truly dangerous current to the turmoil in Westminster. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vision of a hard Brexit may be dying - let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hope so - but the odds must also have shortened on a chaotic Brexit in which no deal is done because consensus proves impossible. In these circumstances, it would only be natural for a board of directors to adopt extreme caution when making investment decisions.</p> <p>The forces pushing in the other direction look weak. The government could give the public sector a pay rise, for example, but that may not be enough to shift the dial on real incomes. The second quarter GDP figures may not be affected by the uncertainty since most surveys suggested an improvement from the first. By the autumn, however, the picture could look very different. The IoD may be overdoing it with words such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disastrous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but it is basically right.

Even politicians obsessed by grand Hinkley Point-style projects cannot fail to have noticed some of the milestones achieved by solar and wind recently.

                "bodyText":"\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty has on business leaders, and the consequences could \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if not addressed immediately \u00e2\u20ac\u201c be disastrous for the UK economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, pointing to a poll of members that showed 57% were quite or very pessimistic about the economy over the next 12 months. We heard similar predictions of gloom from the business world after last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum, of course. They did not materialise, or at least not in the style imagined. The Brexit flunk was a brief affair and the Bank of England and almost every other forecaster was obliged to admit that Armageddon would not be arriving as previously advertised. Could the plot run so happily again? Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bet a penny, or a euro cent, on it. Two factors behind last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breeze-on-through attitude have run their course. First, real incomes are now falling. When they were rising last year, it was relatively easy for consumers not to fret about an event due to happen, in yet-to-be-defined form, in 2019. In any case, 52% of the voters had got want they wanted. Exporters, too, had to be concerned that slashing investment overnight could be costly. The gift - for them - of a lower pound had to be exploited. The second factor was that article 50 had not been triggered. Now, of course, the clock is ticking, which adds a truly dangerous current to the turmoil in Westminster. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vision of a hard Brexit may be dying - let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hope so - but the odds must also have shortened on a chaotic Brexit in which no deal is done because consensus proves impossible. In these circumstances, it would only be natural for a board of directors to adopt extreme caution when making investment decisions. The forces pushing in the other direction look weak. The government could give the public sector a pay rise, for example, but that may not be enough to shift the dial on real incomes. The second quarter GDP figures may not be affected by the uncertainty since most surveys suggested an improvement from the first. By the autumn, however, the picture could look very different. The IoD may be overdoing it with words such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disastrous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but it is basically right. The political mess, for as long as it lasts, is bound to damage investment. Time for a reboot on nuclear subsidies \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The momentum behind these [renewable] technologies is unstoppable now,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Valentina Kretzschmar, director of research at the energy consultants Wood Mackenzie. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They [the oil companies] are recognising it is a megatrend; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a fad, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not going away. There is definitely a risk to their core business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Well let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hope so. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also hope that government recognises that the same megatrend that is bringing down the cost of wind and solar generation has implications for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear programme. Even politicians obsessed by grand Hinkley Point-style projects cannot fail to have noticed some of the milestones achieved by solar and wind recently. Costs of generation are falling to a point that makes Hinkley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation-linked subsidies look even more of a swindle at the expensive of UK bill-payers. In the next round of auctions for government subsidies, energy experts predict offshore wind will be demonstrably cheaper than nuclear. That is for windfarms that must be operational from 2023 to 2025. Over the next 35 years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the life on Hinkley Point\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index-linked contract \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that pricing gap will only widen. Offshore wind will get cheaper, nuclear won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Yes, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true, as the nuclear lobby always objects, that increased use of wind and solar requires a corresponding increase in always-on reliable baseload supply. But that does not imply that the UK requires new nuclear capacity on anything like the scale policy currently imagines, especially if the next megatrend arrives in the form of a revolution in energy storage. It may be too late to stop Hinkley itself because so many costs have been sunk in Somerset already, but the rest of nuclear programme should be hauled in for review at the earliest opportunity. It would be Theresa May U-turn worth cheering. Keep business away from ballots It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ghastly when self-important business leaders write mass-signature letters to newspapers telling people how to vote.

Edoardo Campanella, economist at UniCredit Research, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The eurozone enters the second quarter on a good footing. Industrial production accelerated in April, expanding by 0.5% month on month from 0.2% in the previous month. The industrial production increase was broad-based across its main components (with durable capital goods being the only exception), but not across the largest economies. Germany led the way, while France and Italy recorded slight declines. However, part of the weakness is due to some technical factors related to both the Easter break and a bridge-day effect in Italy that weighed on the number of working days and, thus, on factory activity. This might explain why today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure, albeit good, seems disappointing when compared to the exceptionally strong manufacturing PMI reading that in April hit a six-year high.</p> <p>Since the most recent surveys continue to point to a rather solid growth in manufacturing activity in the eurozone, it is fair to expect that May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard data from the industrial sector will finally reflect this acceleration in output activity.</p> </blockquote> <p>ING Bank economist Bert Colijn pointed out that much of the growth was due to improvements in energy production, which had underperformed in the first quarter due to a mild winter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Growth in production of goods dropped in April though and capital goods production even declined. While the monthly data for production is volatile, this does show that industry continues to struggle on its way up.</p> <p>The outlook for industry does remain bright though as businesses have been indicating that backlogs of work are increasing as new orders are coming in at a faster pace. This will likely translate into accelerating growth over the course of Q2. Still, while backlogs of work have been increasing, this does not mean that Eurozone industry is overheating. Capacity utilisation has been improving over 2016 and is getting closer to peaks seen in previous expansions, but businesses are also still indicating that a lack of demand is limiting production far more than a lack of labour, funding or equipment.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile eurozone employment grew by 0.4% quarter on quarter and 1.5% year on year in the first quarter.

                "bodyText":"That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick round-up. The US Federal Reserve has pressed on with the normalisation of interest rate policy, by hiking borrowing costs for the second time this year. The Fed funds rate is now 1% to 1.25%. The Fed is also broadly sticking to its previous guidance for interest rate rises over the next couple of years. Chair Janet Yellen tried to cool speculation that recent weak inflation might make the central bank more dovish. The Fed remains confident that the US economy is recovering, saying: The Committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Economists said the move shows that the Fed believes the recovery is on track. Ian Kernohan, senior economist at Royal London Asset Management, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Fed made little changes in the language or projections for further interest rate hikes. They acknowledged that inflation was running below target, but also that job gains have been solid. We expect another rate hike and some balance sheet normalisation before the end of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In another sign of confidence, the Fed outlined its plans to start selling off some of the assets bought during its stimulus programme. During a press conference, Janet Yellen said she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d not discussed her future with president Trump. She remains committed to serving her full term (to February 2018). Wall Street took the news in its stride, with the Dow Jones ending the day at a new high thanks to rising financial stocks. The US dollar also strengthened during Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference, as traders anticipated further rate hikes down the line. Scott Minerd of investment firm Guggenheim Partners sums it up: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW DING DING goes the closing bell on Wall Street. And the Dow Jones industrial average has finished at a record high, up around 0.2% But the technology-focused Nasdaq index has dropped by 0.6%. Capital Economists have provided a brisk summary of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions today: As widely expected, the Fed raise its policy rate target by an additional 25bp today, to between 1.00% and 1.25% and, despite the recent weakness of core inflation, Fed officials still expect to raise that rate once more in the second half of this year. The Fed also laid out plans for shrinking its balance sheet, with the initial run-off even smaller than we had previously expected, although it offered no specifics on the timing of when that normalisation would begin other than \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Wall Street isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too happy with Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments. The Nasdaq index has dropped by 1% after the Fed chair downplayed recent weak inflation data and signalled that US interest rates will continue to rise over the next couple of years. The S&amp;P 500 is down 0.25%, while the Dow Jones industrial average is flat. Finally, Yellen gets a question about apprenticeships, and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new push to get more Americans to develop their work skills on the job (a specialist subject for the President, of course). Yellen agrees that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important area. It is hard for firms to find workers with appropriate skills right now, as the labor market is so tight. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a particular problem for smaller businesses, she explains, as they have less latitude to retrain workers. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the press conference Q: Now you are getting ready to reduce your balance sheet, what have you learned about QE and whether it works? Great question, says Yellen, who explains how staff at the Fed, and outside, have done a great deal of work evaluating QE. I think we have learned that it works, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a valuable part of the toolkit. How has it worked, exactly? Yellen says QE (buying huge amounts of bonds with new money) succeeded in putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates. And it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t caused the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153runaway inflation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which some critics feared. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Quite the reverse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Yellen, dryly. So in future, if the Fed hit an episode of extreme economic weakness its primary weapon would be interest rates. But if it reached the point where it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cut again (the zero lower bound), QE could be deployed. Q: The president has credited you with being a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclow interest rate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 person. Do you agree? Yellen says she \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstrongly supported\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy of keeping interest rates at record lows after the financial crisis -- so i guess she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accepting the accolade, despite having just raised rates! Q: What do you say to the group of economists who are calling for the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation target to be raised? [This group, which includes Nobel laureate Joe Stiglitz, warned that the Fed could trigger a recession if it kept raising rates] Yellen plays a straight bat (unlike the England cricket team today, alas), saying it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very important issue. The Fed is open to a wide range of views, and might reconsider its target sometime in the future....ants to take in a wide range of views. Fidelity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Anna Stupnytska, is surprised that Yellen is sounding more cautious - especially about inflation and wage growth. Back to inflation... Q: Is it possible that globalisation, and falling central bank credibility, mean we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve entered an era of low inflation where it will be very hard to get wages and prices rising again? Yellen doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credibility has been impaired (but what else would a Fed chair say?!). But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certainly possible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that structural factors are partly to blame, she adds. Yellen says she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not seen much evidence that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed tax and spending plans have changed consumer or business spending. Q: Is the Fed worried about the recent run of weak inflation futures? Yellen doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound too worried, saying that inflation can be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153noisy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and affected by idiosyncratic factors. She cites cuts to cell phone contract prices, and some over-the-counter medicines. Onto questions, and the press pack quickly home in on Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. Q: Have you spoken to the president about the possibility of serving a second term, and would you be interested? Yellen says she is fully committed to serving her full first term, but she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not had any discussions with president Trump about a second term. She declines to say whether she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to say on when her first term expires (in February 2018). [Background: Trump dropped loud hints last year that he would replace Yellen] Q: Are you disappointed that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t produced any nominees for the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board of governors? The White House is working hard to find nominees for open slots, Yellen replies. She \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very much hopes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd there will be nominations in the not too distant future. Yellen is now outlining the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to start reducing its balance sheet later this year [details here]. She confirms that the Fed will take a cautious approach, initially with a $6bn monthly cap on sales of Treasury bonds and $4bn on mortgage-backed securities. This cap, which is expected to rise every quarter, will avoid any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153market strains\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as the Fed sells some of the assets bought during the financial crisis to stimulate the economy. Yellen also cautions that there is no rush to take decisions about the long-run framework of monetary policy. Big decisions, like the ideal future composition of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance sheet, needn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be taken for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quite some time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Janet Yellen also acknowledges the shooting in Virginia earlier today, where several people including Steve Scalise, Republican House majority whip, were shot. Our thoughts are with those who were injured this morning, the Fed chair says. Fed chair Janet Yellen explains that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest hike reflects the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153progress\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the economy, which appears to have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rebounded\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after slowing in the first three months of 2017. A pick-up in global growth is helping US exports, she says. Yellen adds that the job market will probably strengthen further, but cautions that it is near its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maximum sustainable level\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. On inflation, she credits one-off factors for the recent slowdown in inflation. And the bottom line - the Fed continues to expect that gradual increases in borrowing costs will be needed to keep inflation close to target, while sustaining the economic expansion. But, rates are still likely to be lower than in previous economic cycles, she adds. Over in Washington, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is holding a press conference to discuss today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions. You can watch it live here. Yellen is explaining that the Fed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continues to expect that the economy will expand at a moderate pace\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as conditions continue to improve in the labour market. The most important news tonight is the new guidelines on Fed balance sheet reduction. So says Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International. Stevenson explains: There was never much doubt that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates by a further 0.25% at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting to between 1% and 1.25%. ... More important was what the US central had to say about its plans to rein in its bloated balance sheet, which has ballooned to $4.5trn since the financial crisis as the Fed has bought government and mortgage-backed bonds to underpin the American economy. The Fed said today that it would decrease reinvestment of maturing bonds at a steadily increasing rate until after a year it is holding back $30bn a month on Government bonds and $20bn on mortgage backed securities. The Fed has taken another step towards \u00e2\u20ac\u0153normalisation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management commented. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recent economic indicators have not been weak enough to prevent Yellen pulling the lever on the third rate hike in seven months. Yes, inflation remains elusive, and wage growth relatively weak, but the data does not suggest growth has slowed enough to suggest a change in tack. The decision to raise rates doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t signal the beginning of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, but it does mark another step towards normalisation, as well as confidence in the long-term recovery of the economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate hike shows that the Federal Reserve is confident that the US economy is recovering, says Kully Samra, UK Managing Director at Charles Schwab. Samra adds: Despite recent underwhelming jobs numbers, the underlying US economic data remains robust enough to warrant tightening. While the economy is bouncing back from a weak first quarter, earnings have been strong and even in the wake of continued political uncertainty, corporate confidence remains secure. The market has demonstrated that it is comfortable with gradual rate hikes and will be reassured that the Fed has today committed to its promises. We expect at least one more rate hike this year but incoming data will influence future decisions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We have some unexpected news - the Fed has outlined how it expects to start reducing its huge balance sheet. Reuters has a great explanation: The Fed gave a clear outline on its plan to reduce its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, most of which were purchased in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The committee currently expects to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program this year, provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Fed said in its statement. According to an addendum released with the policy statement, the Fed anticipates that the balance sheet reduction plan would feature halting reinvestments of ever-larger amounts of maturing securities. The Fed sees the cap for Treasury securities to be $6 billion per month initially, increasing in $6 billion increments at three-month intervals over 12 months until it reaches $30 billion per month. For agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, the cap will be $4 billion per month initially, increasing by $4 billion at quarterly intervals over a year until it reaches $20 billion per month. The Federal Reserve has updated its dot plot, which shows where each policymaker thinks interest rates will be over the next few years. It shows that 4 policymakers expect rates will remain on hold for the rest of 2017. Eight Fed voters predict one more rate hike -- the central view - and another four expect two. As this chart shows, that means one voter is less hawkish than in March. The US dollar has fallen by 0.4% against a basket of currencies as Wall Street digests today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement. In its prepared statement, the Federal Reserve says that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continued to strengthen\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd since its last meeting. Economic activity has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rising moderately\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so far this year, the Fed says: Job gains have moderated but have been solid, on average, since the beginning of the year, and the unemployment rate has declined. Household spending has picked up in recent months, and business fixed investment has continued to expand. The Fed also acknowledge that inflation is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhat below 2%\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a nod to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker-than-expected CPI data. They add: Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2% in the near term but to stabilise around the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% objective over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely. Breaking: The Federal Reserve has voted to raise American interest rates today, to a range of 1% to 1.25%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quarter-point move, and exactly what Wall Street expected ... The Fed has also stuck to its forecast of one more interest rate rise this year. Just over 15 minutes to go, until the Federal Reserve either delivers the interest rate hike that the markets expect, or shocks us by leaving borrowing costs on hold ... Earlier, on the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme, the consensus seemed to be the US Federal Reserve would be raising rates. George Magnus, economist and senior advisor at UBS said: I think they [the Fed] really want to do this [rate rise] and I think they want to do it because they are trying to normalise the situation. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re quite worried about sub prime \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in other words less than good quality automobile loans and commercial real estate. So they have other concerns in addition to the economy. After today, though, things might change, because if inflation doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pick up in the United States later this year then the expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep going will be revised. Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management, said: The US economy is fundamentally a 2% growth economy. All the soft data, the surveys have been great but if you look at the hard data it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look as great, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look terrible either. The US recovery is continuing, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as strong as the markets might suggest ... I also agree that the Fed will hike rates today. As long as the markets are aligned as they are with yields pretty low, the dollar fairly weak but equity markets soaring, it gives the Fed room to hike. Of course they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to not just normalise rates but start shrinking their balance sheet but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a deadline for that which is when Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s term ends next year. A slump in the oil price after disappointing US weekly inventory figures has seen some of the shine come off stock markets. The FTSE 100 has also been hit by a rise in sterling, which is bad news for the overseas earners which dominate the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index. On top of that, commodity companies fell back despite some reasonable industrial production figures from China. There was also some caution among investors ahead of the US Federal Reserve meeting, which is widely expected to raise interest rates later. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 26.04 points or 0.35% at 7474.40 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.32% to 12,805.95 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.35% at 5243.29 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.61% to 20,960.55 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.98% at 10,775.8 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.48% to 800.97 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 9 points or 0.04%. On oil, Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Oil prices are in freefall again, thanks to a second consecutive failure of forecasters on the oil inventories front. Stockpiles dropped by much less than forecast, although at least they got the direction right this week, after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock rise in inventories. What is particularly noticeable is that oil production continues to rise, even as prices fall. It looks like everyone is keen to get as much sold before another rout in prices. WTI now trades at its lowest level in six weeks, with little sign of a turnaround in place. Both Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate are now down more than 2%. The weekly US oil figures have shown a smaller than forecast fall in crude stocks. The Energy Information Admistration said crude stocks fell by 1.66m barrels last week to 511.55m, lower than the 2.7m drop expected by the market and indicating weaker than expected demand. Gasoline stocks rose by 2.1m barrels compared to forecasts of a 0.5m decline. Crude prices, which have been buffetted by concerns that Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output cuts were having little effect given rising US production, have seen their losses increase following the figures. Brent, down 0.88% before the US data, has now fallen 1.64% to $47.92 a barrel. West Texas Intermediated has seen its losses increase from 0.8% to 1.89%. Back with the dollar, and it has fallen to its lowest level against the euro since the start of November. The single currency currently sits at $1.1286, up 0.64%, after reaching $1.1295. With the uncertainty over the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view on further interest rate rises in the wake of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak data, Wall Street has made a mixed start. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a new peak of 21,354 initially, before falling back to 21,334, a gain of around 6 points. The S&amp;P 500 edged up 0.12% at the open, while the Nasdaq Composite was unchanged. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, also believes the weak US data casts doubts on further Federal Reserve rate hikes after today: A double dose of soft economic data sent the US dollar plunging and gold rallying before the Federal Reserve rate decision. Slowing inflation and flat retail sales add to the growing sense that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting could see the last US rate rise this year. We would be in a state of shock if the Federal Reserve didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lift interest rates at its meeting later today.... Movement in the dollar will depend on what kind of signal policymakers give about the next hike, possibly in September. The US economy has not been firing on all cylinders but the Fed risks losing credibility if it backed off from a rate hike when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been so heavily intonated. A \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdovish hike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 seems most appropriate, which may not be enough to generate enthusiasm for the dollar. With the expectations for further US rate rises after today dimming, the dollar is continuing to weaken. This is to the benefit of the pound, which has climbed above $1.28 for the first time since the UK election. It was a brief moment, but sterling is still up 0.36% at $1.2795. The weaker than expected US inflation and retail sales figures could mean the Federal Reserve being more cautious about further interest rate rises this year, says James Knightley of ING Bank: This [data] creates more of a headache for the Federal Reserve in how it communicates its hiking strategy. They keep talking about slower growth and weaker inflation being transitory (the word was used on nine separate occasions in the minutes to the May FOMC meeting), but the longer we go without seeing growth and inflationary pressures is resulting in the markets becoming less convinced about higher interest rates. With little sign of tax reform and fiscal stimulus coming the Fed will likely sound more cautious on the prospect of an additional hike later this year even though their forecasts will almost certainly include it when released later on today. The dollar has just hit a one week-low against a basket of currencies, as the markets give their verdict to that double-dose of US data. Jamie McGeever of Reuters says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures were much weaker than expected: Matt Boesler of Bloomberg has spotted that the markets are repricing their interest rate hike expectations: Colin Cieszynski of CMC Markets wonders if the Fed might even leave interest rates on hold today, rather than delivering the hike that has been priced in by the markets: Chris Vecchio of Daily FX suggests the US dollar will have a volatile day Another newsflash! US retail sales have suffered their biggest decline in 16 months. Retail sales declined by 0.3% in May, new figures from the Commerce Department show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest drop since January 2016, and dashes expectations of a 0.1% rise. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another signal that the US recovery might not be as strong as hoped, and means the dollar is getting quite a hoofing. Newsflash: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has fallen!, surprising the markets and sending the dollar sliding. Consumer prices across the US dropped by 0.1% during May, having risen by 0.2% in April. And that dragged the annual inflation rate down to 1.9%, down from 2.2% a month ago. Core inflation, which strips out the prices of volatile elements like gasoline and food, only rose by 1.7% - the weakest rise since May 2015. This gives America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bankers something to think about, as they gather for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. It probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop the Federal Reserve raising interest rates in under six hours time, but it might make them more cautious about the next rise.... Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage squeeze since the financial crisis struck is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153staggeringly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bad. He writes: Cast your mind back to March 2008. The financial markets have been in turmoil since the previous summer and in the previous month the Labour government has been forced to nationalise the troubled bank Northern Rock. Few realised it at the time but the economy had peaked. A deep and brutal recession was about to begin. In that month, the average basic weekly wage, excluding bonuses, was \u00c2\u00a3473. The recession officially came to an end by late 2009 and after a couple of years of weak and patchy growth, the worst seemed to be over. Activity picked up, unemployment started to come down. Yet more than nine years after the slump of 2008 began, wages \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the yardstick by which most people judge whether the economy is doing well or not \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have not recovered. In fact, according to the Office for National Statistics, they have gone backwards. The average basic weekly wage, adjusted for movements in prices, now stands at \u00c2\u00a3458. More here: Over in Europe and eurozone industrial production rose by 0.5% month on month in April, with March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure revised up from a 0.1% fall to a 0.2% increase. Edoardo Campanella, economist at UniCredit Research, said: The eurozone enters the second quarter on a good footing. Industrial production accelerated in April, expanding by 0.5% month on month from 0.2% in the previous month. The industrial production increase was broad-based across its main components (with durable capital goods being the only exception), but not across the largest economies. Germany led the way, while France and Italy recorded slight declines. However, part of the weakness is due to some technical factors related to both the Easter break and a bridge-day effect in Italy that weighed on the number of working days and, thus, on factory activity. This might explain why today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure, albeit good, seems disappointing when compared to the exceptionally strong manufacturing PMI reading that in April hit a six-year high. Since the most recent surveys continue to point to a rather solid growth in manufacturing activity in the eurozone, it is fair to expect that May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard data from the industrial sector will finally reflect this acceleration in output activity. ING Bank economist Bert Colijn pointed out that much of the growth was due to improvements in energy production, which had underperformed in the first quarter due to a mild winter: Growth in production of goods dropped in April though and capital goods production even declined. While the monthly data for production is volatile, this does show that industry continues to struggle on its way up. The outlook for industry does remain bright though as businesses have been indicating that backlogs of work are increasing as new orders are coming in at a faster pace. This will likely translate into accelerating growth over the course of Q2. Still, while backlogs of work have been increasing, this does not mean that Eurozone industry is overheating. Capacity utilisation has been improving over 2016 and is getting closer to peaks seen in previous expansions, but businesses are also still indicating that a lack of demand is limiting production far more than a lack of labour, funding or equipment. Meanwhile eurozone employment grew by 0.4% quarter on quarter and 1.5% year on year in the first quarter. In all, statistics office Eurostat said 154.8m people were employed in the eurozone in the first quarter, the highest number on record. Here are the Liberal Democrats on the fall in real wages. The party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader Tim Farron joined the calls for an end to the freeze on public sector pay rises: For a government that used to bang on about the Just About Managing, they are doing diddly squat to help them. This represents the biggest fall in real wages since August 2014. Staff are working more hours, for less pay and with higher levels of stress. More people are living pay cheque to pay cheque and having to struggle at the end of every month to get by. Britain needs a pay rise and it is time the government delivered it, especially for the public sector. Our nurses, care workers, teachers and soldiers have bared the brunt of the economic crisis and seen their pay capped and wages squeezed. Enough is enough. We need to raise the wages of our public sector workers. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment report: The pound has now dropped into the red, as the City shows its disappointment with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor wage growth. Sterling is now down 0.2% today at $1.2725. The wage squeeze is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153headache\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government (on top of everything else) says the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Helen Barnard, JRF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of analysis, says the labour market has now reached a tipping point which can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply be ignored by Westminster. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouraging to see that employment levels continue to rise and unemployment has fallen again. But the troubling news for the government is the continued squeeze on wages for those are in work. This is the first time that there has been a year-on-year decrease in real total pay since 2014. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have reached a tipping point where rising costs are outstripping earnings, leaving millions of just managing families in a precarious position. The election campaign paid precious little attention to the squeezed living standards of low income households and their prospects of finding secure, well-paid work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It means the new government must act to ease the strain by lifting the damaging freeze on tax credits, and prioritising plans to drive up pay and productivity across the country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd UNISON, the union, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows how much stress the public sector is facing, as it also calls for the 1% pay cap to be ditched. General secretary Dave Prentis warns: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Demand for public services continues to rise, but these figures confirm that the workforce is still being cut. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Services are being starved of funds and staff shortages mean nurses, paramedics, teaching assistants and council employees are having to work even harder, but for less money. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Public sector workers have not had a proper pay rise since 2011. It is no wonder they feel so undervalued. The public sector pay cap must go.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The governent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Secretary of State for Work &amp; Pensions, David Gauke, is encouraged that employment remains at record levels. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This government wants to give everyone the opportunity to succeed, regardless of where they live or their background. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is yet another strong set of record-breaking figures with employment up and unemployment down, fuelled by full-time opportunities. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is good news for families as we continue to build a stronger, fairer Britain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But opposition parties are alarmed by the fall in real wages. Debbie Abrahams MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We welcome the overall increase in employment, but are deeply concerned that millions remain in low paid, insecure work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government has also failed to close the employment gap faced by women, disabled people and BAME groups, who have too often borne the brunt of austerity cuts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the cost of basic essentials rising by 2.9 per cent, while wages stagnate, too many of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s families are struggling to get by while Theresa May focuses on holding her unstable coalition of chaos together. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Only a Labour government will ensure working people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s living standards are protected with a real Living Wage of \u00c2\u00a310 per hour, and an immediate end to austerity spending cuts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Prime Minister must stand aside and let a Labour government build an economy that works for the many, not the few.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, suggests the government may have to bow to pressure and end its 1% cap on public sector pay rises, as the TUC and others demand. With inflation likely to be heading above 3% later this year, the squeeze on real pay growth is now getting serious and is likely to dampen real consumer spending growth for some time to come. The cost of Brexit to people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s living standards due to the fall in the pound is becoming ever more apparent. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The squeeze is even more severe in the public sector, where pay is only rising at around 1%. The sustainability of this pay policy for nurses, doctors, teachers and other key public service workers will come increasingly into doubt as inflation rises to 3% and above later this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also shows how the public sector has shrunk since the financial crisis. Just 17.0% of all people in work were employed in the public sector, which is the lowest proportion since comparable records began in 1999. There are now 5.42 million people employed in the public sector, down 20,000 in the last year, and the lowest since June 1999. The rise of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGig economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, with its low-paid, precarious jobs, is surely a factor behind the weak wage growth. Dr John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, says it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remarkable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that pay is so weak when the employment rate is at a record high of nearly 75%. Hard times and near full employment make strange bedfellows, highlighting the extent to which a de-regulated labour market with an abundance of workers available to fill low wage vacancies has altered the UK jobs landscape.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 The Resolution Foundation have crunched today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures, to show how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pay is still below its levels before the financial crisis (once you adjust for inflation). They also show how the economy is still creating jobs, although some parts of the country aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feeling the benefits as much as others: Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, also fears that the pay squeeze will hurt growth: The UK economy faces a dangerous cocktail of political uncertainty, slowing growth and shrinking real wages. First-quarter GDP figures were disappoining, while a recent report from VISA confirmed consumers are under pressure, with spending falling 0.8% year-on-year in May. Households are being squeezed from both directions, with inflation rising faster than expected and wages rising more slowly. This doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bode well for economic growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the UK economy is heavily reliant on the consumer and falling real incomes will eventually translate into lower retail sales. The pay squeeze puts more pressure on the Bank of England to consider raising interest rates to curb inflation, argues Neil Wilson of ETX Capital (whose hopes of stronger wage growth have been firmly dashed). He writes: Wages are climbing at a rate of just 2.1%, or just 1.7% when you excluded bonuses. This run rate is just not enough to sustain consumer spending where it has been of late when inflation is accelerating. Average earnings in real terms slumped by 0.6%, or 0.4% including bonuses. This will have a material effect on GDP growth in the second quarter. The pay-inflation gap is widening despite record low unemployment, which is also a sign of structural problems for the UK economy. Total pay growth was running above 3% in the first half of 2015, when inflation was anchored at around zero. That sweet spot is well and truly over. Real pay is falling across the economy, points out Professor Geraint Johnes, Director of Research at the Work Foundation: On the three month average measure, pay settlements fell from 2.3% in March to 2.1% in April [that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s including bonuses]. The fall in the single month measure is more dramatic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from 2.4% to 1.2% - though it should be noted that this measure is generally held to be less reliable. On the single month measure, there were falls in average weekly earnings in both the finance and construction sectors in April. There is no sector of the economy in which wages are currently rising as fast as prices. The squeeze in real wages is back, and there seems to be little prospect of an immediate recovery.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, has a few theories for why real wages are shrinking again. One could be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcslack in the labour market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - which is economist speak for the fact that the jobs market isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working as well as it could. This is usually down to underemployment: people working part-time who want a full-time job or hidden unemployment: people who are not actively looking for work but who would rejoin the workforce if the jobs market were stronger. Another factor is the problem of poor productivity. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t unique to the UK and has been an issue in many developed world economies since the financial crisis. While most economists concur that slowing productivity is one of the most serious problems in their field today, few can agree on the cause and still less on the right response. Whatever the reason, the situation looks pretty bad: The TUC, which represents Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workers, is calling on the government to act now and end its curbs on public sector pay. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says the policy (which restricts pay rises to 1%) must go. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Real wages have fallen for the second month in a row. Unless the government gets its act together, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll soon be in the middle of another cost of living crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ministers must focus on delivering better-paid jobs across the UK. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to bin the artificial pay restrictions on nurses, midwives and other public sector workers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Britain needs a pay rise, not more pressure on household budgets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The fall in UK real wages is likely to hurt economic growth, warns Naeem Aslam of Think Markets. It is the UK consumers who have been pulling the UK economy and if we see them slowing down, it surely means that economy cannot do well Brexit is certainly on the centre stage when it comes to this and I personally believe that investors are feeling the impact of this. Dutch bank ING is alarmed by the slowdown in UK pay growth, at a time when Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political future is so unclear. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sarah Rappaport is worried about the impact on the public: Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group is concerned that the link between wages and unemployment appears to have broken down (with unemployment at a 42-year low, labour scarcity should drive earnings up). Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also shows that British workers are suffering the worst wage squeeze in two and a half years. The ONS says: Between February to April 2016 and February to April 2017 in real terms (that is, adjusted for consumer price inflation) total pay for employees in Great Britain fell by 0.4%, the lowest growth rate since July to September 2014. If you include bonuses, average pay grew by 2.1%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than the 1.7% rise in regular pay, but still not enough to keep up with inflation. The Office for National Statistics says: Latest estimates show that average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain in real terms (that is, adjusted for price inflation) fell by 0.4% including bonuses, and fell by 0.6% excluding bonuses, compared with a year earlier. Breaking! Basic pay in the UK economy grew by a meagre 1.7% year-on-year in the three months to April. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much worse than expected, and also the lowest rise in regular pay since February 2016. It means that real wages are shrinking at an even faster rate than feared -- inflation was 2.7% in April (and 2.9% in May!) so pay simply isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep pace with the cost of living. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report also shows that the unemployment rate remained at a 42-year low of 4.6%. The number of people out of work fell by 50,000 in the three months to April. The employment total jumped by 109,000 during the quarter, to 31.954. More to follow! The pound is dipping back as City traders brace for the jobs report... The pound should strengthen if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage figures are less grim than feared. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says: Unemployment is likely to be decent so the focus is on earnings. Stronger-than-expected wage growth could help support sterling a touch as it will help offset concerns that falling real wages is destroying consumer spending. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation beat at 2.9% highlights the problems facing the economy so a sign that earnings are at least trying to keep pace will be welcome and allay concerns that consumers stop spending. City economists expect that total pay rose by 2.4% in the three months to April - but only by 2.0% if bonuses are stripped out. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right in 20 minutes... You can get up to speed on the state of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market with these charts from economist Rupert Seggins: The US dollar is under some pressure today ahead of the Federal Reserve decision, which is helping nudge the pound up. With an interest rate hike today \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpriced in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, traders are focusing on the tone of the decision from the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Open Market Committee. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale expects the Fed to sound cautious about the long-term path for interest rates. The FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response is likely to be a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdovish hike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s priced in, to a large degree. Uncertain about how much slack there is in the economy or the labour market, FOCM members are inclined to want to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnormalise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rates while they have the chance, but they seem very pragmatic about the longer-term outlook. So more likely to raise rates now, without overlay hawkish commentary, and then lay the groundwork for another hike in the autumn if markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take fright in the weeks ahead. In the City, the FTSE 250 index - which contains medium-sized UK-focused firms - has jumped by 0.5% in early trading. Housebuilder Bellway is the biggest riser, up 3.6%, after reporting that customer demand for new homes is still strong. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index is flat, although its housebuilders (Taylor Wimpey, Barratt and Persimmon) are all rising. Guardian Business has launched a daily email.

For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Sterling is rising in early trading, hitting its highest level since Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock general election results landed. The pound has gained a third of a cent to $1.278, as traders brace for this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK jobs report. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a little higher against the euro, at just below \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.14. The possibility that Britain could now seek a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsofter Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from the European Union is helping the pound recover. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga explains: Currency investors remained cautiously optimistic over a softer Brexit following last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK election outcome, resulting in a hung parliament. Although the political uncertainty in the UK and pending Brexit negotiations are still in focus, much attention will be directed towards the UK jobs report this morning. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living squeeze will be dragged back into the spotlight today, when the latest employment data is released. City economists fear today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures will show that wages are falling further behind inflation, which has been driven up to 2.9% in May by the weak pound (as we learned yesterday). Basic pay rises (excluding bonuses) are expected to have fallen to 2.0% in the three months to April. That would mean real wages have kept falling this year, bringing more pain to struggling families across the country. On a more positive note, the unemployment rate may remain at a 42-year low (last month it fell to 4.6% , the lowest since 1975), and the employment total probably kept rising in the last quarter. RBC Capital Markets say: Unless last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains somehow turn out to be a total blip, it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too surprising if the level of employment rises again by close to a triple-digit number of thousands in the three months to April. The rotation of workers out of part-time roles into full-time employment is now an established theme and if we see this trend once more it would imply that slack is being partially eroded as a result of reduced \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunderemployment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a big day for the US economy. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, the Federal Reserve, is widely expected to raise interest rates today - to a target range of 1% to 1.25% (from 0.75% to 1%). Fed chair Janet Yellen will then face the press and give her views on the state of the economy. Wall Street experts predict she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try to squash speculation that the Fed is too hawkish. As Lew Alexander, chief economist at Nomura, put it (via Marketwatch): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We do expect her to try to be somewhat forceful in conveying...to market participants that their skepticism over hikes after the June meeting may not be warranted.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We also get new eurozone unemployment figures, plus new retail sales and inflation statistics from America. European stock markets are expected to be flattish, as investors hunker down ahead of the Fed decision tonight. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9.30am BST: UK labour market report 10am BST: Eurozone employment report for Q1 2017 1.30pm BST: US inflation report for May 1.30pm BST: US retail sales for May 7pm BST: US Federal Reserve interest rate decision 7.30pm BST: Fed chair Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference",

One reason he suggests for the crisis is that workers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially those who are underemployed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c may be trapped into thinking a wage rise is a trade-off for less job security.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/15/universal-basic-income-could-greatly-improve-workers-lives-report-argues\">Universal basic income could greatly improve workers' lives, report argues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Coming as they did after the rather dismal GDP figures, the May unemployment figures out last week were a nice bit of economic sunshine. </p> <p>In seasonally adjusted terms, Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate has fallen from 5.9% in March to 5.5% just two months later:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1hN3E/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And while the figures are certainly good news, it always pays to be a little bit sceptical. </p> <p>The main reason for the fall in unemployment was the rise of women in full-time employment in New South Wales.</p> <p>In May, the ABS estimates that total employment increased by 42,000, and 92% of that increase was due to 39,000 women in NSW gaining full-time work. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty impressive given full-time working women in NSW account for just 8% of all people employed in Australia.</p> <p>The 4.1% increase in women in NSW working full-time was the second biggest monthly jump ever recorded in NSW, </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jpMfB/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So as ever we should treat the seasonally adjusted figures with some scepticism, but even the trend figures are looking good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the annual growth of both employment and hours is now in sync:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/j9KYs/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But with these figures came the rather less happy news that in May there was a record 1.13m people underemployed.</p> <p>Underemployment is a relatively new problem.

                "bodyText":"The current record low wages growth is something that not only concerns workers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, has also expressed dismay given its impact on household consumption. During a panel session at ANU yesterday, Lowe suggested that there was a real wage \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. One reason he suggests for the crisis is that workers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially those who are underemployed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c may be trapped into thinking a wage rise is a trade-off for less job security. Coming as they did after the rather dismal GDP figures, the May unemployment figures out last week were a nice bit of economic sunshine. In seasonally adjusted terms, Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate has fallen from 5.9% in March to 5.5% just two months later: And while the figures are certainly good news, it always pays to be a little bit sceptical. The main reason for the fall in unemployment was the rise of women in full-time employment in New South Wales. In May, the ABS estimates that total employment increased by 42,000, and 92% of that increase was due to 39,000 women in NSW gaining full-time work. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty impressive given full-time working women in NSW account for just 8% of all people employed in Australia. The 4.1% increase in women in NSW working full-time was the second biggest monthly jump ever recorded in NSW, So as ever we should treat the seasonally adjusted figures with some scepticism, but even the trend figures are looking good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the annual growth of both employment and hours is now in sync: But with these figures came the rather less happy news that in May there was a record 1.13m people underemployed. Underemployment is a relatively new problem. Back when I was studying economics in the late 1980s and early 1990s it barely rated a mention. The reason was there was so little of it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c over 80% of workers worked full-time and the much bigger problem was unemployment. And while the 1990s recession saw a massive change in the level of full-time employment, even then underemployment did not become a major issue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it stayed relatively flat throughout the 1990s: Even when the number of underemployed overtook unemployed in 2004, underemployment still was not a massive issue. The reason was no longer because there was so little of it, but because it largely moved in sync with unemployment. From 2004-2014, through the mining boom, the GFC and the recovery, when the unemployment rate fell or rose, the underemployment rate fell or rose \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the correlation between the two was almost perfect: It was clear if you wanted to reduce underemployment all you needed to do was reduce unemployment. Certainly easier said than done, but it was nice that the two problems could be solved at the same time. And then at the end of 2014 things went bonkers: Had the nice 2004-14 relationship held, with an unemployment rate of 5.7%, underemployment would be around 7.7%. And yet instead it is a record high 8.8%, with 140,000 more people underemployed than we would have expected just three years ago. So much for two problems, one solution. One reason is that part-time employment has grown much faster than full-time employment. And yet not everyone who works part-time wants more hours. Only around 27% of part-time workers consider themselves underemployed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that level has not risen since 2014: But obviously if you have more of the labour force working part-time you will also have more of the labour force wanting more hours. In the past decade the percentage of employed people working part-time has risen from 28.3% to 31.9% - equivalent to around 430,000 more people working part-time. Part of the reason is also Western Australia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which has seen a massive spike in underemployment: And yet while it would be nice to put all the blame on the end of the mining boom out west, even if we excluded WA from the national figures, the underemployment rate would still be a record high of 8.6% and the relationship between unemployment and underemployment over the past three years would still be out of whack: The big concern is that while the underemployed have work, the growing number of those wanting more hours is causing the weak growth in wages, even while the unemployment rate is falling. In terms of the spare capacity in the labour market, reducing unemployment is a much bigger issue. The Reserve Bank recently noted that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unemployed people seek 33 hours of work per week compared with 14 additional hours per week for underemployed people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This is why in normal times reducing unemployment has the bigger impact on wages growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c less unemployed leads to a higher growth of wages because it sees a big increase in the total hours of work being done. The recent improvement in the unemployment rate would normally mean wages growth would start to pick up. And yet there is little sign that it has. It would seem that underemployment is now having a greater impact on wages than is unemployment. The RBA suggests that this might be because underemployment might have a different impact on wages.

So firms are able to increase hours not through employing new workers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and having to pay them more to entice them to work for that company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but by giving more hours to existing workers without needing a pay rise to entice them. Philip Lowe doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want workers to accept that trade off. For if that remains the decision \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more hours versus better wages \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then as underemployment grows so too will the downward pressure on wages growth. And while it is good to hear the head of the RBA argue for greater worker activism for higher wages, in a world where little over 10% of private sector workers are in a union it is hard to see where the impetus for this change is to come. For now it appears that while underemployment grows, it is unlikely to see real wages improve.",

Business investment was expected to hold up over the near term, with CBI surveys pointing to an improvement in investment intentions since the referendum. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But with uncertainty still holding back larger spending projects, we expect investment to wane over the course of 2018,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the outlook added. The forecasts were compiled before the general election, which resulted in Theresa May losing her parliamentary majority. Some economists have said that has weakened May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hand in Brexit talks. Fairbairn said the CBI and other lobby groups were pushing the government to give the business community a stronger say and more formal role in talks about future trade deals for the UK outside the EU. She said imitating countries such as Australia and Canada, where business groups are formally consulted in trade negotiations, would be a major benefit to Britain. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They have confidential and formal structures and we have been calling for exactly that here. I think that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing real signs of progress,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fairbairn said.",

                "bodyText":"Global markets are red across the board this afternoon as lower oil prices have accelerated losses in Europe and the US. Here is how the major indices across Europe closed: FTSE 100: -0.7% at 7,473 FTSE 250: -0.5% at 19,772 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.6% at 12,815 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.3% at 5,294 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -1% at 20,810 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -1% at 10,746 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.7% at 389 Brent crude oil is down 2.2% at $45.86 a barrel. Over in the currency markets the pound is still sharply lower against the dollar and the euro, after Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the UK economy was not yet ready for a rise in interest rates. Sterling is 0.9% down against the dollar at $1.2617, and at one point was as low as $1.2603, the lowest since 18 April. Against the euro then pound is down 0.7% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1343. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today folks. Thanks for reading the blog and for all your comments. Please join us again tomorrow. AM Unison\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual conference is underway in Brighton and the squeeze on living standards is on the agenda. The trade union, which represents more than 1.3 million workers who provide public services, is calling for an end to pay freezes and austerity. Here is what Dave Prentis, general secretary, had to say: We live in a kingdom dangerously divided into the haves and the have-nots. Some are living in misery and poverty \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or even in extreme danger as we have seen last week. The catastrophe at Grenfell Tower was the epitome of a tale of two cities. People living in wealth and luxury side by side with those living in poverty. The Prime Minister appears to be unable to give the support people need or be the leader this country wants. This contrasts with the warmth and compassion shown by the public, and the bravery shown by the heroes of the emergency services. Public service champions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including nurses, hospital porters and council workers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are working together and supporting each other. We live in a country full of heroes. Jeremy Corbyn is the man capable of taking this country in the right direction. Some said he was unelectable but people saw hope and someone worth voting for. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a man who can be Prime Minister.It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for a Labour government with our values and our manifesto. A manifesto against job cuts, police cuts and pay freezes that ends the senseless pain of austerity. This government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity pay policies have crushed public services under their heel. They have ground down public service employees. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re worried about their jobs, their families and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go through another five years of poverty pay. Now is the time to shout enough is enough. This is the year to smash the pay cap. The Scottish National Party says Bank of England governor Mark Carney delivered a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153blunt Brexit reality check\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when he made his annual Mansion House speech this morning. Stewart Hosie MP: Today the governor of the Bank of England confirmed that Brexit is beginning to bite hard \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that our economy and people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wages are bearing the brunt. His speech paints an extremely depressing picture. It is fundamentally unfair, when Scotland voted expressly against this eventuality, that the Tories continue to drag us towards the hard Brexit cliff edge, putting jobs and growth at risk. The SNP has set out our position in clear terms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we want Scotland to maintain our place in the single market, to maintain our place in the customs union and will work hard to protect jobs and wages. The need for this approach has been underlined by Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Tories cannot continue to ignore Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voice. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, has given his take on the latest market moves. Here in the UK... The FTSE 100 erased early forex-induced gains by the afternoon when energy sector shares slumped alongside the price of oil. Investors were also weighing up the implications of fraud charges against former Barclays executives. Broader stock markets have been weathering the three-week slide in the oil price on the assumption prices will stay within the price range seen over the past 12 months. The further we move below $50 per barrel, the more worrisome the bruising taken by oil prices gets for stocks. And over in the US: Stocks in the US turned lower in early trading. Another day of record highs might be scuppered by concern around the persistent downtrend in oil and other commodity prices. Apart from sending Amazon shares to new stratospheric levels, the deal to buy Whole Foods has been a negative force on the US stock market. US markets are slightly down in early trading: Dow Jones: -0.03% at 21,521 S&amp;P 500: -0.3% at 2,446 Nasdaq: -0.2% at 5,758 Oil prices have fallen to seven-month lows after news of increases in supply from several key producers. Brent crude is down sharply: Elsewhere in Europe, major markets are mixed. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.04% at 12,894 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.2% at 5,320 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.5% at 20,909 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.5% at 10,799 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.2% at 391 The FTSE 250, which is more UK-focused than the FTSE 100, is down 0.4% at 19,796. A weaker pound is often a plus for the FTSE 100 where companies tend to be internationally focused. It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the case at the moment however as a falling oil price in dragging down commodity stocks. Brent crude is down 2.6% at $45.68 a barrel. The FTSE 100 is currently down 16 points or 0.2% at 7,508. Here is the list of the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest fallers: Labour MP Chuka Umunna has commented on Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mansion House speech. Speaking as a supporter of Open Britain, the campaign against a so-called hard Brexit, Umunna said: The chancellor is absolutely right that nobody voted in the referendum to become poorer. That is why it is vital that the government negotiates a Brexit deal that puts jobs and our economy first. To do so, the government needs to recognise that it cannot continue to threaten a Brexit with no deal at all. And they should reopen the possibility of keeping Britain in the single market and customs union, which would be the best option for our economy. Time for a recap: The pound has fallen sharply after Bank of England governor Mark Carney argued against raising UK interest rates. In his delayed Mansion House speech, Carney argued that the UK economy is too weak to support higher borrowing costs, especially as Brexit is at a critical point. Carney told an audience in London that: From my perspective, given the mixed signals on consumer spending and business investment, and given the still subdued domestic inflationary pressures, in particular anaemic wage growth, now is not yet the time to begin that adjustment. In the coming months, I would like to see the extent to which weaker consumption growth is offset by other components of demand, whether wages begin to firm, and more generally, how the economy reacts to the prospect of tighter financial conditions and the reality of Brexit negotiations. This has knocked almost a cent off the pound, to $1.2654 - close to a two-month low. City analysts say Carney has calmed speculation that interest rates could rise soon, after three policymakers voted for a hike last week. Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s added to the pressure on sterling, by warning that it needn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait for Brexit to be concluded before changing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating. Chancellor Philip Hammond also used the Mansion House speech to argue for UK businesses to be protected from Brexit damage, through a transition deal. The car industry has voiced its concerns too; saying that a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccliff-edge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit would be the worst option for the sector. And in other news, Tesco is facing customer complaints after a computer problem led to home delivery orders being cancelled. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says concerns over Brexit are weighing on the pound. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on top of Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech arguing against raising UK interest rates anytime soon. Otunuga explains: Sterling was in trouble during Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading session with prices tumbling to a weekly low at 1.266 after Mark Carney suggested that interest rates should be kept on hold amid Brexit uncertainty. It is becoming clear that the rising fears of Brexit negotiations negatively impacting economic growth continues to weigh heavily on sentiment while prolonged periods of uncertainty has ensured Pound weakness remains a recurrent theme. With both consumer spending and business investments dishing out mixed signals, and tepid wage growth still a cause for concern, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153now is not yet the time to raise interest rates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd according to Mark Carney. The pound is falling further against the euro too, down almost one eurocent at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.134. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a one-week low, and close to the eight-month low of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1276 hit after June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK general election. Rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have warned that it could downgrade the UK before the terms of the Brexit deal are known, putting even more pressure on the pound. S&amp;P sovereign ratings chief Moritz Kraemer told Reuters that S&amp;P needn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait until the negotiations have been concluded in 2019. Asked if it would wait until the end of the Brexit negotiations to take another ratings action on Britain, Kraemer said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will review the UK every six months... and if necessary more often... We will be watching the economic implications, the implications for the public finances, the constitutional implications like the whole Scotland situation...and things like the currency and if it will maintain its reserve status.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd S&amp;P slashed the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating by two-notches to AA , from Triple A, after the Brexit vote last summer. It currently has a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnegative outlook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the debt, suggesting another cut is possible. That has given currency traders another reason to sell the pound, which is still bruised by Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments this morning. This \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccandlestick formation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shows how sterling has fallen to a one-week low of $1.266, down 0.5%, and is barely above the two-month low struck after the UK election results. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carmakers have added their weight to calls for Britain to agree a transition deal after it leaves the EU. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders warned that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cliff-edge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit was the worst possible outcome for the automotive industry. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We accept that we are leaving the European Union and we share the desire for that departure to be a success. But our biggest fear is that, in two years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time, we fall off a cliff edge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no deal, outside the single market and customs union and trading on inferior WTO terms. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This would undermine our competitiveness and our ability to attract the investment that is critical to future growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The auto industry provides 12.0% of total UK export of goods, according to the SMMT, with 169,000 people employed directly in manufacturing, and over 800,000 in the wider industry. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Tesco is busy apologising to customers caught up in its home delivery problems. It says: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re currently experiencing an IT issue which is affecting some Grocery Home Shopping orders. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working hard to fix this problem and apologise to customers for any inconvenience this may cause.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Its social media team are handling a lot of criticism too: In other news....Tesco customers are reporting problems with the supermarket giant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home delivery service. Many are complaining on social media that their orders have been cancelled. According to a company spokesman, around 10% of orders have been affected. Tesco is blaming a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153computer glitch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and offering a \u00c2\u00a310 voucher as compensation, according to the BBC. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a few of the customers affected: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, on Mark Carney and Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speeches this morning: For analysts who were awaiting Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to the BoE policy meeting last week, this announcement has dampened expectations of a significant policy change in the near future, with the governor citing low wage growth and mixed signals on consumer spending as the reasons for his decision. There were some positives for investors from Hammond however, as he proposed arrangements for a transitionary period during the Brexit process and beyond which would see the customs union rules remain in place for the UK until new rules are implemented and other measures agreed that would protect the city and prevent disruption.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Taken at face value, Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insistence that interest rates would stay at rock bottom levels until the smoke had cleared from the Brexit talks was quite a rebuke to colleagues who voted for a rate rise only last week. The Bank of England governor was in combative mood as he listed the many reasons for keeping the base rate at 0.25%, not least the febrile atmosphere inside City trading rooms. Michael Saunders, Kristin Forbes and Ian McCafferty were the three members on the monetary policy committee to warn that rising inflation needed to be calmed by an increase in rates. You might think they would seem foolish now that a slap from the governor is visible on their livid cheeks. But it is more likely that the governor was quite content to see the huge amount of coverage in the news media for the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dissenting minority. The slap, if we can call it that, was staged. Knowing that rates cannot rise without thousands of businesses going bust and millions of households getting into financial trouble, Carney is playing a game. With the economy struggling as Brexit talks begin, the dangers are apparent. For this reason he must talk tough to prevent consumers heaping more cheap credit on their already huge borrowing, thereby creating a dangerous lending bubble. At the same time he wants to keep the credit wheels turning to keep the economy from falling over. He can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do this alone. The committee needs to play its part. We must assume that Forbes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacement, the London School of Economics professor Silvana Tenreyro, and whoever takes over from Charlotte Hogg, have been briefed. The drop in the pound has pushed up the value of multinational companies listed in London, as their overseas earnings are now more valuable. Global advertising giant WPP is leading the way, up 2.2%. Other gainers include luxury fashion chain Burberry (+1.5%) and consumer good titan Unilever (+1.2%). This has nudged the FTSE 100 up by 11 points to 7535, close to the alltime closing high of 7547. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcintraday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 high for the FTSE 100 is 7598. Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s caution suggests that UK interest rates will remain at their current record low throughout 2017, and possibly until 2019, says Howard Archer of the EY Item Club. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious stance fuels our belief that interest rates will not be rising any time soon, given a stuttering UK economy and uncertainties over its outlook.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We maintain the view that the Bank of England will hold off from raising interest rates in 2017. A tightening in 2018 also looks highly questionable given the cloudy outlook Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Mark Carney has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153emphatically\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd distanced himself from the three hawkish MPC members who voted to raise interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% last week. So says Sam Hill of Royal Bank of Canada. He adds: Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reference to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coming months\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd implies that his vote for an unchanged policy stance is set to prevail at the August Inflation Report, and beyond whilst these uncertainties are resolved. Whilst there are still many members we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heard from since the election purdah period ended (Haldane comments will be published tomorrow), it is significant that the Governor has now shown that the range of views on the Committee is broad, with his own being distinctly different to those who voted for a hike last week. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also worth remembering that the most hawkish MPC member, Kristin Forbes, steps down at the end of the month. Her replacement, Silvana Tenreyro, is expected to be more dovish. Mark Carney comments come just a week after UK inflation rate jumped to 2.9%, well over the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target, and much faster than wages. So if the Bank resists pressure to raise interest rates to curb inflation, workers may suffer falling real wages for even longer. Kathleen Brooks, currency expert at cityindex.co.uk, explains: This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments are important because they suggest that the Bank of England will look through the period of high inflation, headline CPI is running at 2.9%, blaming the rise on the sharp drop in sterling last year. This could spell more woe for the UK consumer, if the BOE is not going to take action to bring down prices, this could keep the squeeze on pay packets for some time. She also suspects that the pound could keep falling: In the very short term we are looking at $1.2650 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the bottom of the range from the last 10-days - if we break below here it would be a short-term bearish development.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mark Carney has laid a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a thick layer of dovishness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over the City today, says Neil Wilson of ETX Capital. He writes: Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnow is not the time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to tighten should hardly be a surprise, given his record of favouring looser monetary policy, but it does reiterate the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preference for looking through the current high levels of inflation for the time being. However, inflationary pressure could still force the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hand, he adds: There are plenty who think that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to cut last summer following the Brexit vote was folly and rising inflation offers a chance to correct that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcerror\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. However the departure of arch-hawk Kristin Forbes leaves those calling for tightening in a greater minority than before This is from Alpesh Paleja, the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s principal economist: Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments show that the Bank of England is not inching close to a rate hike, says Mike Bird of the WSJ: Allie Renison of the Institute of Directors is struck by Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctransitional deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to help firms cope with Brexit. The Telegraph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Deacon knows exactly who Carney was aiming for, with his comment about Brexit being a piece of cake: Apologies, there was a daft typo in that earlier entry about the pound. To be clear, the pound has fallen to $1.2675, a one-week low, down from $1.275 before Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech hit the wires. Sterling is also down 0.5% against the euro, to 87.9p from 87.4p. That means one pound buys \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.137, from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.142 earlier this morning. Hope that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear! Many thanks to all those who pointed it out. Carney concludes his speech by questioning whether Brexit will be a cakewalk - a mischievous nod to Brexiteers who argued that Britain can \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchave its cake and eat it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 after it leaves the EU. The governor says the success, or otherwise, of Brexit depends on whether the two sides can agree a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctransition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 arrangement (something Philip Hammond also called for today). Carney says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Depending on whether and when any transition arrangement can be agreed, firms on either side of the channel may soon need to activate contingency plans. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Before long, we will all begin to find out the extent to which Brexit is a gentle stroll along a smooth path to a land of cake and consumption.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney has a chilly warning for Britons -- Brexit is going to hurt the economy, and he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop that happening. However, the Bank can balance how this pain is shared; either through unemployment, or inflation, depending on how it sets interest rates. Monetary policy cannot prevent the weaker real income growth likely to accompany the transition to new trading arrangements with the EU. But it can influence how this hit to incomes is distributed between job losses and price rises. Carney has also warned that Britain will suffer badly if the City of London faces higher barriers to trade: One million people across this country work in financial services. The industry contributes 7% of output and pays taxes that cover almost two thirds of the cost of the NHS. At a time when the UK is running a 5% current account deficit, financial services runs a 1.5% trade surplus with Europe alone. The entire service sector runs a 5% surplus with the world and employs 85% of UK workers. We could take these realities for granted. And it would be all too easy to give into protectionism. But as we learned in the 1930s, that road leads neither to equity nor prosperity. Raising barriers to trade disproportionately hurts the least well off through higher prices and fewer opportunities. Carney is also warning against the creeping tide of protectionism, saying that stronger trade is the key to boosting global growth. The governor says countries need to look outwards, not impose new barriers. The G20 faces a choice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c between levelling down by putting more restrictions on goods trade, or levelling up by liberalising trade in services. Evidence from within countries suggests that there may be substantial scope to increase trade in services if barriers are removed. For example, in Canada \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of the few countries to track trade flows within its borders \u00e2\u20ac\u201c services account for around 50% of all inter-provincial trade compared with only 25% of Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international exports. If Canada were able to replicate the pattern of trade within its borders with other countries then services exports would triple. Breaking: Sterling has fallen sharply to a one-week low as Mark Carney declares that Britain isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready for higher interest rates. The pound shed half a cent to $1.2675 against the US dollar, and is down against the euro too. The Bank of England governor is arguing that it would be wrong to raise borrowing costs now, before we know how the Brexit negotiations will play out. He also tells the audience at Mansion House this morning that wage growth is too weak to justify a rate hike. Carney acknowledges that his monetary policy committee are split on this issue (they voted 5-3 to leave rates on hold last week). But he is not ready to join the three hawks pushing for higher borrowing costs. Carney says: Different members of the MPC will understandably have different views about the outlook and therefore on the potential timing of any Bank Rate increase. But all expect that any changes would be limited in scope and gradual in pace. From my perspective, given the mixed signals on consumer spending and business investment, and given the still subdued domestic inflationary pressures, in particular anaemic wage growth, now is not yet the time to begin that adjustment. In the coming months, I would like to see the extent to which weaker consumption growth is offset by other components of demand, whether wages begin to firm, and more generally, how the economy reacts to the prospect of tighter financial conditions and the reality of Brexit negotiations. Now Mark Carney is on his feet. The Bank of England governor begins his speech by touching on the tragic events of recent weeks, which have reminded us of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fine balance between hope and despair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He says: Despair at the murder of Jo Cox [one year ago last week]. Hope in her remarkable life of service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an inspiration that lives on in her family, friends, colleagues and many admirers. Despair at the terrorist attacks in Manchester, Borough Market and Finsbury Park. Despair at the tragedy of Grenfell Tower. Hope in the heroism, resiliency and the community of the responses. Hope when we recognise our common humanity. The best tribute this City and this Country can give to the memories of those lost is to renew our shared commitment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whatever our differences \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to promote the common good. And that includes pursuing a Brexit, and building an economy, that works for all, he adds..... The key message from Philip Hammond today is that Britain can achieve a Brexit that works for the people. But it must have four strands: A comprehensive agreement on trade and services. A mutually beneficial transitional arrangement, avoiding disruption and dangerous cliff edges. Frictionless customs arrangements. An implementation period, when the UK will be outside the customs union, but customs rules will remain in place pending the new rules coming into force. Andy Sparrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Politics Liveblog is covering all the details too (in a frictionless, mutually beneficial arrangement....) Hammond fires a warning shot at those who want to take EU derivatives trading out of London. This will lead to a lower-quality, higher-priced financial services, he warns. As expected, Hammond says Britain will almost certainly need an implementation period after Brexit, so that customs border arrangements can continue. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s land border must stay open and freeflowing too, he continues -- a very hot issue, as Theresa May continues to negotiate with Northern Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DUP party. On trade, Hammond says Britain needs to be able to trade effectively with EU members after Brexit. And on migration, the chancellor reads from the (notorious) Conservative manifesto that Britain needs to keep recruiting the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brightest and the best from around the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Britain has benefitted from globalisation, he continues, but it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn a blind eye to the hostility to it in parts of the developed world. Britain is tired of austerity after seven years of it, the chancellor continues - perhaps a nod that he will loosen the pursestrings in the autumn budget. But he is still committing to eliminating the budget deficit by the end of the next decade. He also promises to provide assurances to the European Investment Bank (EIB) to ensure that funds keep flowing to UK businesses after Brexit. Onto fiscal issues. Hammond says the Conservatives are committed to keeping taxes as low as possible, to encourage growth. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also opposed to raising borrowing to fund current consumption, as that only passes the bill onto future generations. Stronger growth is the only sustainable way to deliver better public services and jobs, says Hammond. I thought we had won that argument, but the general election has shown that we must make a new case for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a market economy and sound money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Hammond (a nod to Jeremy Corbyn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than expected performance). Hammond now turns to Brexit, saying that there is much work to do. But the UK has a solid foundation, he argues. It was one of the fastest growing G7 economies in 2016. He then takes a pop at his predecessor, adding that Britain has created millions of new jobs in the last few years \u00e2\u20ac\u0153even if you only count George Osborne once\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Philip Hammond is speaking now. He begins by thanking the City of London corporation for rescheduling today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s event, after the appalling tragedy that was unfolding at Grenfell Tower. The chancellor says that Britain has suffered a series of shocking events in recent weeks - terror attacks at Manchester, London Bridge, Finsbury Park yesterday, and at Grenfell. Grenfell was an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unimaginable tragedy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Hammond continues, and his thought are with all those affected by it. The immediate priority is to make sure that that the survivors have everything they need. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all. We must also get to the bottom of the failure at Grenfell and take decisive action to make sure nothing like this happens again. You should be able to watch the Mansion House speeches on the TV news. Bloomberg are streaming it. Bloomberg expect Hammond to make the case for a softer Brexit that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause as much damage to the economy. The room at Mansion House is filling up nicely, to hear from Hammond and Carney. Helena Morrissey, head of personal investing at LGIM and a driving force to get more women into the boardroom, is there. So is conservative MPs Steve Barclay and Vicky Ford. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The great and the good of the City of London are heading to Mansion House this morning, to hear from Bank of England governor Mark Carney and chancellor Philip Hammond. The two men, who between them handle the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal and monetary levers, are expected to outline their plans to protect Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth prospects in the face of Brexit. These speeches were originally scheduled for last Thursday night, before the City of London corporation cancelled the Mansion House event altogether following the Grenfell Tower disaster. It was hardly appropriate to have City grandees hobnobbing in black tie and quaffing expensive vintages. So instead, it has been rescheduled as a breakfast event this morning. This is the first time we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard from Carney since the Bank of England was dramatically split over interest rates last week. Three policymakers voted to hike borrowing costs, startling the City, while five voted for no-change. Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech will also be closely watched. He had been expected use last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech to argue against a Hard Brexit, and call on prime minister Theresa May to ensure Britain gets a significant \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transition period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after Brexit, to help businesses adapt. Over the weekend, the chancellor hinted that he might ease up on austerity following the Conservative Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election bloody nose. As Reuters put it: Hammond had looked set to lose his job until May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election flop. He has now re-emerged as big business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leading proponent in government and might provide more details on Tuesday on how he thinks the two-year Brexit process should run. Hammond may also give more details of his budget plans after saying on Sunday that he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not deaf\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the weariness of voters to nearly a decade of spending cuts for many services and tight controls on public sector pay. Also coming up today... The other big news this morning is that the Serious Fraud Office has charged Barclays, and four former top executives, over its fundraising from Qatar during the 2008 financial crisis. We should also get more details of Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s innovative plan to issue 100-year bonds, despite having defaulted on its debts more than once....

                "bodyText":"Government-backed inspectors should be able to investigate companies and entire industries to prevent unscrupulous companies falsely labelling workers as self-employed, according to a leading legal body. In a submission to the independent review of employment practices led by Matthew Taylor, the Law Society also recommends the immediate scrapping of employment tribunal fees, which have led to a 70% fall in claims in the last three years. It also says every worker should receive written clarification of their employment status. It suggests that the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, which already has some investigatory powers over food and farming operators, could be handed responsibility to carry out investigations into employment status in all businesses. The Taylor review, which was commissioned by the government last year, is expected to publish recommendations in the next few weeks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our rights at work are not optional \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they are the minimum standard to which we are entitled,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the Law Society president, Robert Bourns. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our law relies on individuals taking their employer to court to get their rights recognised \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a task that is simply beyond most people. Bad employers know this and take advantage of it to cut corners and underpay people, knowing they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably get away with it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An independent government inspector who can go into a business to ensure staff are being given their proper workplace rights will help put a stop to this exploitation, and put everyone on a fair and even playing field.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The rise of platforms including Uber, Deliveroo and online retailers, most of which say their drivers and riders are independent contractors, has led to growing concern that millions are stuck in insecure and stressful work in the gig economy. Self-employed independent contractors are not entitled to holiday pay, sick pay or pension contributions. In contrast those categorised as workers have a degree of independence and can be self-employed but they are also entitled to limited rights including the national minimum wage and holiday pay. The most secure are employees, who have full rights including entitlements to flexible working, maternity pay and sick pay. The importance of these categories has been highlighted by a string of tribunals led by trade unions questioning the status of drivers and riders including successful cases brought by cycle couriers at CitySprint and Excel and drivers for taxi app Uber. All three cases found the riders and drivers were workers. Evidence suggests a significant minority of employers are circumventing employment protection legislation. Research from Citizens Advice in 2015 suggested that one in 10 people, or about 460,000, have been mislabelled self-employed. In January, the TUC reported that the number of people without guaranteed hours or baseline employment rights had risen by more than 660,000 (27%) over the past five years.

It would even be a sign of confidence in the UK recovery.</p> <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key section from Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Having weighed the evidence, I think that the balance of risks associated with tightening \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too early\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, on the one hand, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too late\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, on the other, has swung materially towards the latter in the past six to nine months. The risks of tightening \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too early\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have shrunk as growth and, to lesser extent, inflation have shown greater resilience than expected. And if policy tightened \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too late\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, this could result in a much steeper path of rate rises later on, contrary to the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collective expectation that Bank Rate would increase \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcat a gradual pace and to a limited extent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.</p> <p>As the balance point between these risks has shifted over the past 9 months, that has left me judging that a partial withdrawal of the additional policy insurance the MPC put in place last year would be prudent relatively soon, provided the data come in broadly as expected in the period ahead. </p> <p>Certainly, I think such a tightening is likely to be needed well ahead of current market expectations.</p> <p>How soon is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153relatively soon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? I considered the case for a rate rise at the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s June meeting. I felt then there were strong grounds for holding back until later in the year, for two reasons. First, despite upwards pressure on inflation, there are still few signs of higher wage growth. And despite robust surveys, there is still some chance of a sharper than expected slowing in the economy. Both are reasons for monetary policy not to rush its fences. Nor does it need to do so, given the slow build of nominal pressures in the economy.</p> <p>Second, there is the election. This has thrown up a dust-cloud of uncertainty. Financial markets-wise, that is manifesting itself in a weaker exchange rate. It is unclear what twists and turns lie ahead, with potentially important implications for asset prices and, at least potentially, confidence among businesses and consumers. I do not think adding a twist or a turn from monetary policy would, in this environment, be especially helpful in building confidence, at least until the dust-cloud has started to settle.</p> <p>Provided the data are still on track, I do think that beginning the process of withdrawing some of the incremental stimulus provided last August would be prudent moving into the second half of the year.</p> </blockquote> <p>That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important intervention. Last week, three MPC policymakers (but not Haldane) voted for a rate hike. But just yesterday, governor Mark Carney argued forcefully that it is too early....</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-06-21T11:34:04.718Z\">at 12.34pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-594a457ee4b01a490fd244e7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-21T10:47:55.176Z\">11.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back in the markets, shares in doorstep lender Provident Financial have slumped by 16% this morning after a shock profits warning.</strong></p> <p>The FTSE 100-listed lender admitted last night that its recent reorganisation - which eliminated around 2,000 - had caused more disruption than expected.</p> <p>Provident appears to have botched its attempts to persuade self-employed debt collectors to become full-time staff instead.</p> <p>CEO Peter Crook told analysts today that too few workers made the switch.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it right.

                "bodyText":"And finally....the latest US oil inventory figures are just out, showing that US crude and gasoline inventories fell last week. The US Energy Information Administration reports that US oil stocks shrank by 2.5 million barrels, more than the 1.01 million which the markets had expected. In another surprise, gasoline inventories fell 578,000 barrels - compared to expectations of a 345,000 rise in gasoline stocks. This has help to push the oil price up a little, away from this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seven-month lows. Brent crude is now up 0.25% today at $46.13. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The US housing market has strengthened unexpectedly last month, according to new figures. Sales of US homes, excluding new builds, rose by 1.1% in May to an annual rate of 5.62 million sales. Average house prices also jumped during the month to record levels, suggesting demand was stronger too. This has pushed up the US dollar, pulling the pound back down below $1.27. Supermarket giant Tesco are back in the news again today, for the wrong reasons. Tesco Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online banking service has suffered a glitch today, that has left some customer unable to access their accounts. Yesterday, Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online shopping scheme hit a pothole, leaving scores of customers without their deliveries. And in another blow today, Tesco has proposed closing its customer service centre in Cardif, putting 1,100 jobs at risk. It is planning to consolidate its two customer engagement centres into a single expanded operation in Dundee, Scotland, and creating 250 new jobs there. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says Andy Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech has been the main event of the morning. Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns about not waiting too long to normalise policy could help the pound strengthen against the euro in the next few weeks, he says - just in time for the summer holiday season! Razaqzada says: Forget the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Speech, it was all about Andy Haldane this morning. The pound jumped and the FTSE dropped after the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist and Monetary Policy Committee member said he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ready to vote for an increase in interest rates \u00e2\u20ac\u0153relatively soon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This came as a major surprise because Mr Haldane has long been a known dove. He is going head-to-head against the Governor Mark Carney, who is fast losing support on his dovish stance. He said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a partial withdrawal of the additional policy insurance the MPC put in place last year would be prudent relatively soon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mr Haldane said that the risk was that the Bank tightened its belt too late rather than too early. This is something which the Bank of Canada is also worried about and what the US Federal Reserve had long been wary of, and the European Central Bank better be ready for. The latter came across pretty dovish at its last meeting. With the BoE turning hawkish and ECB remaining dovish, the EUR/GBP could come under pressure in the coming days and weeks. He also sent this image of the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac-\u00c2\u00a3 exchange rate, showing how the euro hit eight month highs against the euro recently, but couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t break through 88.8p. Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkishness has helped the pound to recovery almost all of the losses suffered yesterday, after BoE governor Mark Carney explained why interest rates ought to remain at record lows. Lena Komileva of G+ Economics reckons there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now a 50% chance of a UK interest rate rise this year. She says: The growing split on the MPC signals a much higher risk of tightening this year than previously expected in the markets. With two new members joining the MPC in the second half of the year, an active policy debate on the merits of tightening, against the optics of a strong inflation overshoot, overheating consumer credit growth, and a tight labour market, may well tilt the vote in favour of a rate hike by the year-end. The Haldane effect has pushed the pound back over $1.27, a whole cent higher than this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows. Following Andy Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech, there are now at least four Bank of England policymakers who are likely to vote for rate rises this year. However... one of them, Kristin Forbes, leaves on 30 June. That leaves Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders, who both voted to raise interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% at this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Forbes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacement, Silvana Tenreyro, may not be as hawkish (but who knows?). So the monetary policy committee could be split 6-3*, unless other members are thinking along the same lines as Haldane. The next MPC meeting is in early August. * - Or 5-3, until the vacancy for a deputy governor is filled. Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group thinks Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s change of mind is an important sign.. Andy Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hint that UK interest rates may rise this year is particularly interesting as he had been seen as the most dovish policymaker at the Bank of England. With one speech, Haldane has shed his dovish feathers in favour of a hawkish summer plumage. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says there is a big split at the Bank of England. Ben Chu of the Independent flags up that Haldane has sounded hawkish before, only to flip when the facts changed... Rupert Harrison of asset management firm BlackRock (and a former top Treasury official) suggests that Haldane may be trying to annoy his boss. Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Economics wonders if the Bank of England is trying to push the pound up, in an attempt to keep inflation down (something usually associated with emerging markets). Jeremy Cook of World First suggests that Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments caused some ructions on FX trading desks in the City: Newsflash: The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist has declared that UK interest rates may have to rise later this year. Speaking in Yorkshire, Andy Haldane argued that the recent spike in inflation, to 2.9%, means the risks of waiting too long to tighten monetary policy have increased. As such, he says, rates may need to rise \u00e2\u20ac\u0153well ahead\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of City expectations. It may make sense, Haldane adds, to start withdrawing some of last summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus (injected after the Brexit vote) later this year. It would even be a sign of confidence in the UK recovery. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key section from Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech: Having weighed the evidence, I think that the balance of risks associated with tightening \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too early\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, on the one hand, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too late\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, on the other, has swung materially towards the latter in the past six to nine months. The risks of tightening \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too early\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have shrunk as growth and, to lesser extent, inflation have shown greater resilience than expected. And if policy tightened \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too late\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, this could result in a much steeper path of rate rises later on, contrary to the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collective expectation that Bank Rate would increase \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcat a gradual pace and to a limited extent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. As the balance point between these risks has shifted over the past 9 months, that has left me judging that a partial withdrawal of the additional policy insurance the MPC put in place last year would be prudent relatively soon, provided the data come in broadly as expected in the period ahead. Certainly, I think such a tightening is likely to be needed well ahead of current market expectations. How soon is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153relatively soon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? I considered the case for a rate rise at the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s June meeting. I felt then there were strong grounds for holding back until later in the year, for two reasons. First, despite upwards pressure on inflation, there are still few signs of higher wage growth. And despite robust surveys, there is still some chance of a sharper than expected slowing in the economy. Both are reasons for monetary policy not to rush its fences. Nor does it need to do so, given the slow build of nominal pressures in the economy. Second, there is the election. This has thrown up a dust-cloud of uncertainty. Financial markets-wise, that is manifesting itself in a weaker exchange rate. It is unclear what twists and turns lie ahead, with potentially important implications for asset prices and, at least potentially, confidence among businesses and consumers. I do not think adding a twist or a turn from monetary policy would, in this environment, be especially helpful in building confidence, at least until the dust-cloud has started to settle. Provided the data are still on track, I do think that beginning the process of withdrawing some of the incremental stimulus provided last August would be prudent moving into the second half of the year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important intervention. Last week, three MPC policymakers (but not Haldane) voted for a rate hike. But just yesterday, governor Mark Carney argued forcefully that it is too early.... Back in the markets, shares in doorstep lender Provident Financial have slumped by 16% this morning after a shock profits warning. The FTSE 100-listed lender admitted last night that its recent reorganisation - which eliminated around 2,000 - had caused more disruption than expected. Provident appears to have botched its attempts to persuade self-employed debt collectors to become full-time staff instead. CEO Peter Crook told analysts today that too few workers made the switch. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it right. The incentives we had in place and the other management actions and communications that were there, were not sufficient to retain the number of agents that we anticipated.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound has recovered its early losses following this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finance figures. Sterling is back at $1.263, as traders watch for any surprises in the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Speech, which begins shortly. Our Politics Liveblog will have all the details: John Hawksworth, PwC chief economist, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finance figures are a boost to Philip Hammond, at a crucial time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finance data brought some good news for the Chancellor as estimated borrowing was revised down by around \u00c2\u00a32 billion in the last financial year and a further \u00c2\u00a31 billion in April. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Taking April and May together, the deficit of around \u00c2\u00a316 billion was very similar to the same two months last year, whereas the OBR had forecast that borrowing would rise this financial year as one-off favourable factors unwound. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of course, it is very early days in this financial year, but the Chancellor will take some cheer from these figures. However, Hawksworth is also concerned that the UK economic picture is darkening: The economy is slowing and considerable uncertainties remain around the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. At the same time, political pressures for higher spending on health, social care, education, policing, social housing and public pay more generally have increased. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Chancellor therefore still faces some tough challenges ahead if he is to meet his target of a balanced budget by 2025. But his interim target of getting the structural budget deficit below 2% of GDP by 2020/21 looks much easier to achieve and gives him some room for manoeuvre on tax and spending over the next few years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The \u00c2\u00a3300m drop in the deficit in May shows that the UK public finances started the year on a solid footing, says Capital Economics. However, they also expect total borrowing to rise during this financial year. Their UK economist, Scott Bowman, says: The strong revenue growth partly reflected a 4.3% rise in VAT receipts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perhaps a sign that consumer spending growth hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t slowed too sharply recently. That said, we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read too much into the borrowing figures for the first few months of the fiscal year as they are based on a significant amount of forecast data. Accordingly, we still think that borrowing for the fiscal year as a whole will increase by several billion pounds (the OBR expects a \u00c2\u00a37bn rise) as a number of one-off factors that lowered borrowing in 2016-17 unwind. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance ministry has welcomed the drop in borrowing last month, but admitted that the task of repairing the public finances isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complete. A Treasury spokesperson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe have reduced the deficit by three-quarters since 2010 but there is still further to go. We are committed to bringing the public finances back to balance by the middle of next decade, building a stronger economy that can deliver higher living standards for people across the country.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Fact check: That \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthree-quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 claim refers to borrowing as a share of the national economy. The deficit was 9.9% of GDP in 2010, and fell to 2.6% of GDP in 2016. Yesterday, chancellor Philip Hammond said the government aims to eliminate the deficit by the middle of the next decade. A far cry from George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal of balancing the books by 2015..... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to the news that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit fell to \u00c2\u00a36.7bn last month: Economist Rupert Seggins points out that UK public sector borrowing has dropped, a little, so far this financial year: KPMG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Yael Selfin, fears that the public finances may deteriorate in the months ahead: Howard Archer of EY Item Club believes VAT receipts rose in May thanks to a pickup in retail sales in April: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finance report also shows that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total national debt is now \u00c2\u00a31.737 trillion -- or 86.5% of annual GDP. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit fell by \u00c2\u00a3300m in May, giving a glimmer of hope to the UK government as it wrestles with Brexit. New figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the UK borrowed \u00c2\u00a36.7bn to balance the books last month. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from \u00c2\u00a37bn in May 2016, and rather less than April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a39.4bn deficit. The public finances were boosted by an increase in the tax takes. VAT receipts rose by 4.3% to \u00c2\u00a311.2bn in May, which looks to be the highest for any May on record. The figures show that Britain has borrowed \u00c2\u00a3100m less since the start of this financial year than in 2016-2017. OK, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only two months in, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a disastrous start... I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull together some reaction now... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been an exciting day on the Chinese stock market. The CSI 300 index, which contains the biggest companies traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen, jumped 1.2% to its highest closing level since the end of 2015. Traders rushed to buy shares after US stock index provider MSCI announced it would add some China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mainland domestic shares to its emerging markets index. That move will have been warmly welcomed in Beijing as it attempts to open up its financial markets and attract foreign capital. Jamie McGeever of Reuters shows how the pound has fallen back to two-month lows since the general election delivered a hung parliament. Breaking! The pound has slipped to a fresh two-month low against the US dollar. Sterling has just fallen below $1.26 for the first time since mid-April, when Theresa May took the fateful decision to call a general election. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lost a third of a cent today to $1.2593. Yesterday, the pound weakened after Bank of England governor Mark Carney said it was too early to raise interest rates. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff may be due to political instability in Westminster, and tensions between the Conservative party and the DUP over a possible deal. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Sterling also had a miserable open this Wednesday, the pound falling 0.3% against the dollar and 0.2% against the euro. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because, despite the state opening of parliament being just a few hours away, Theresa May is yet to fully secure the support of the DUP, the Irish party unhappy with what they see as a lack of respect from certain sections of the Conservatives. Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly publicised production cuts have actually turned into a win for US oil producers. American shale oil firms have raised their own output as the oil price recovered earlier this year, undermining efforts to cut the global glut of oil (leading to this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price falls). The Wall Street Journal explains: U.S. producers ramped up production when the world was already swimming in oil as OPEC members, Russia and other producing nations curtailed output. U.S. oil production is up 7.3% to 9.3 million barrels a day since OPEC announced plans in November to cut output, and the number of active rigs in the U.S. is at a two-year high. The cartel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output cut \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has been deemed an OPEC failure and a U.S. production win,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Tony Headrick, energy analyst at CHS Hedging. Oil prices are coming under more pressure this morning, knocking 1% off the price of Brent crude and Nymex. European stock markets are falling in early trading, as oil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop worries investors. The FTSE 100 has shed 22 points, or 0.3%. BP and Royal Dutch Shell are among the big fallers, down over 1% each. Big news from America: Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick has resigned after a series of scandals at the ride-hailing business he co-founded in 2009. Kalanick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure comes a week after he announced he would take an indefinite leave of absence as the embattled company released a damning report on its workplace culture. According to the New York Times, five of Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major investors demanded that the chief executive resign immediately, following revelations about its workplace culture and reports of harassment and discrimination. In a statement, Kalanick said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I love Uber more than anything in the world and at this difficult moment in my personal life I have accepted the investors request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Nordic bank Danske say that oil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide into a bear market is worrying investors worldwide: FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga predicts that prices will keep falling: Oil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing oversupply woes reached an ear-piercing crescendo during Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading session as WTI Crude plunged into a bear market after growing signs of rising production across the globe. WTI Crude was already extremely sensitive and vulnerable to losses amid the bearish sentiment with reports of an unexpected supply increase by Libya sending prices below $43. Although OPEC initially displayed good intentions when it exempted some members from the production cuts, this has come back to haunt them with more production from Libya, Nigeria, and Iran. With the bias towards oil heavily tilted to the downside, further losses should be expected as bears exploit persistent oversupply concerns to ruthlessly attack the commodity. This is from Jonny Bo Jakobsen of Nordea Markets: Michael Hewson of CMC Markets also expects oil to keep sliding this summer: The risk is we could see further declines, particularly if shale producers continue to add rigs, and demand continues to slow in Asia, and there are no further supply disruptions. The key support levels sit down at the November lows at $43 on Brent and $42 on US WTI, which if they give way $40 could come into view very quickly indeed and drag equity markets down with them, especially if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weekly inventory data disappoints. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Traders are edgy this morning after the oil prices tumbled to seven-month lows. The cost of a barrel of Brent crude has slumped below $46 per barrel for the first time since November 2016, dragged down by signs that the market is oversupplied. US crude prices also took a bath, falling 20% from their recent highs to around $43.50 per barrel. That put oil into a bear market for the first time since August, on signs that the global supply glut of oil isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going away. These moves show that the oil market is losing faith in the Opec cartel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to prop up prices, despite producers recently agreeing to extend production curbs until March 2018. Amanda Cooper, Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 oil expert, tweets that bearish oil traders have the upper hand. The selloff was partly triggered by signs that Libya has tripled its production levels in the last year. Libya is an Opec member, but exempt from its production cuts deal, as Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: As for the black gold, investors are becoming a little anxious towards the rising production out of Libya, however, OPEC has stated it before that the production level out of Libya is already taken into account in the part of their production cut strategy. Saudi Arabia also reported higher export data on Tuesday. It is important that not only production cuts are under control but also the export numbers as well. New oil inventory figures are released by the US government later today, which could move the markets again.... Also coming up today. Never exactly a shrinking violet, the UK economy will gambol back into the spotlight this morning when public finance figures for May are released. The City predict that public sector net borrowing fell to around \u00c2\u00a37bn, from over \u00c2\u00a39bn in April a year ago , as the long drudge of deficit reduction continues. Over in parliament, the Queen will outline the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legislative programme - even though prime minister Theresa May hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agreed a deal with the DUP to prop up her government. The Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech is likely to be dominated by Brexit, as the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Norman Smith explains... The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Andy Haldane, is visiting Yorkshire and the Humber. Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speeches are always good value (remember the one about the dog chasing the frisbee?), so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be scrutinising this one closely. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK public finances for May released 11.30am BST: Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Speech 12pm BST: Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Andy Haldane speaks in Yorkshire 3pm BST: US home sales 3.30pm BST: US crude oil inventory figures",

                "bodyText":"Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers are enjoying the strongest demand for their products in almost 30 years as a recovering global economy and a weaker pound boost order books. The monthly snapshot from the CBI found that export and total order books were both at their highest for decades \u00e2\u20ac\u201c providing some hope that a stronger manufacturing sector would cushion the effect of higher inflation on consumer spending. The employers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation said that particularly strong performances by the food, drink, tobacco and chemicals industries had spearheaded a pick-up in orders in 13 of the 17 industrial sub-sectors tracked each month. As a result, the balance of companies reporting that order books were above normal rose from +9 percentage points in May to +16 points in June \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the highest since the height of the late 1980s boom in August 1988. The balance for export orders rose from +10 points to +13 points \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the joint highest in 22 years. But the CBI warned that manufacturers were still being affected by rising prices. The balance of companies expecting prices to rise in the coming months remained unchanged at +23 points between May and June, but was up from +1 point a year ago.

                "body":"<p>A decade ago, Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady thought she had seen just about the worst conditions possible for workers in 21st-century Britain. As part of a team investigating vulnerable employment, the trades union leader held clandestine meetings in churches with intimidated workers that exposed life at the sharp end of the jobs market.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We had stories about people working up to their knees in water in white meat factories on zero hours. Pretty shocking stuff,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she recalls.</p> <p>Now on the 10th anniversary of that landmark commission into vulnerable employment, the general secretary of the TUC seems exasperated that for all the evidence of workers being mistreated, little has changed. And yet for the past fortnight her frustrations have been mixed with a glint of optimism. The election shock was a clear signal people have had enough, O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady tells the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ten years on we are forced to take stock, and what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happened? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gone backwards,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says before a TUC conference on Monday to launch a campaign for better jobs and pay.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153My feeling is that the government needs to get its act together pretty fast. I am not overly optimistic on this front. But if they learned anything from that election campaign, then they should have learned there is a real appetite for real change in the workplace.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Sitting in her airy central London office, clasping an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I love unions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mug full of tea, the 57-year-old reels off a sorry list of statistics. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The number of people in precarious work has rocketed by over a quarter over the last five years. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got over three million people at the sharpest of the sharp end \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 This is people who are not only on low pay: they have also got no rights, and even if they had rights they would be too scared to enforce them,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says.</p> <p>The new campaign, called the Great Jobs Agenda, is targeting the millions of people in precarious work in the so-called gig economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where, rather than having fixed permanent roles, workers tend to be given tasks as and when they are needed. That kind of work has grown hand in hand with the rise of online shopping, and platforms such as the taxi-hailing app Uber and the takeaway delivery service Deliveroo.</p> <p>Most of those companies say they hire independent contractors, who miss out on rights such as the minimum wage and sick pay. They are often paid per job rather than by the hour. Other workers in the gig economy, for example in care homes and pubs, are on zero-hours contracts with no guaranteed work and therefore no guaranteed income. They also tend to be on lower pay.</p> <p>O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady also highlights the army of people getting work in warehouses through temporary employment agencies, such as with Sports Direct. An investigation by the <em>Guardian</em> highlighted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">a climate of fear</a> at the retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire, prompting a select committee of MPs to say it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/22/mike-ashley-running-sports-direct-like-victorian-workhouse\">being run like a Victorian workhouse</a>.</p> <p>O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady reaches for a similar description. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am personally shocked about how technology is used as a tyrant in the workplace. Tracking people going to the toilet. Tracking the work they do \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 All of that feels Dickensian in its failure to respect workers as human beings. They are just commodities. There is something really sickening about it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abb47e060d405ab09aac509d56110a0c5db03bbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abb47e060d405ab09aac509d56110a0c5db03bbd/0_267_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Deliveroo rider on the road in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Deliveroo rider on the road in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trade unions and journalists have exposed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exactly what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on in high street names like Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she says, and now there is widespread anger. But Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise of an economy that works for everyone seems to have made little difference so far.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are people across the spectrum who are pretty outraged at what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on in 21st-century Britain. But nothing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happened. We had the prime minister on the steps of Downing Street, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had promise after promise, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had no action. So I think patience is wearing thin and I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important that politicians do listen \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but more importantly that they act. And there is no reason for delay. How much more evidence do people need?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>The TUC wants zero-hours contracts banned and for everyone on regular hours to have a right to a written contract guaranteeing their normal working hours. It wants an end to bogus self-employment and believes the law should change to give people a default right to qualify for all employment rights, unless the employer can demonstrate they are genuinely self-employed.</p> <p>O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anger goes further than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/22/brexit-economy-uk-slowdown-living-standards-costs\">squeeze on living standards</a> that has been sparked by meagre wage growth and a rise in living costs since the Brexit vote. She also points to the \u00c2\u00a34bn a year the TUC reckons insecure work is costing the public coffers in lost tax and higher benefits.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes it is about falling real wages, yes it is about people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anxieties about what sorts of jobs their kids are going to go into \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but there are these immediate, urgent issues of some employers running riot with exploitative contracts that are not just robbing those workers of a decent job and livelihood but robbing the exchequer too,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says.</p> <p>The TUC wants workers to go on to its new website, <a href=\"http://greatjobsquiz.org.uk\">https://greatjobsquiz.org.uk</a>, where they can rate their workplace by checking, among other things, if it pays the living wage, recognises trade unions and is safe. It is a kind of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tripadvisor for bosses\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady.</p> <p>The site will also tell workers what their rights are. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady, who has two grown-up children, feels that kind of information is urgently needed to prevent a culture of precarious work becoming entrenched.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153For me, the heartbreaking bit is the generation of workers who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know any better \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who think that this is normal,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says.</p> <p>As for where unions fit into the world of rising self-employment and short-term contracts, O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady insists that collective action will remain the best route to change. She also rebuts the idea that falling trade union membership leaves them without a mandate, but she wants better access to workplaces.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Surely it should be possible for workers to have the right to be represented by a union and also to have a right for unions to bargain on their behalf. Because in the end, particularly with vulnerable workers, banding together is your only chance of resetting that power and balance,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23dce8daca5a35b26c7bd16391aa691b73dd8dd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23dce8daca5a35b26c7bd16391aa691b73dd8dd4/0_36_6144_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s driver service centre in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s driver service centre in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The prime minister made a nod to changing culture in workplaces last year when she appointed Matthew Taylor, the former head of Tony Blair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy unit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-hires-former-tony-blair-policy-boss-to-review-workers-rights\">to head a review into modern employment</a>. He is due to report soon. So is O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady hopeful the review will mark a turning point?</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Matthew\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job is to make recommendations to government,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think governments of any colour can duck their responsibility or outsource their responsibility or use reports to delay. They should be getting on with the job.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>There is a worry, however, that getting on will prove more difficult as Brexit negotiations finally get under way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a year on from a referendum in which O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady made the case for staying in the EU to protect workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am very conscious about civil servants being dragooned into Brexit work and what does that mean for everything else? There is still a country to run. There are still injustices to tackle.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Yet she remains optimistic that May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakened government knows it cannot let workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights fall by the wayside.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government would pay a big political price for not acting to tackle insecurity at work. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think of too many elections where work issues were so high on the agenda,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says.</p> <h2>Case studies</h2> <p><strong>Liz Lee</strong><br><strong>Care home worker</strong><br>Lee has been on zero-hours contracts with care homes for four years and wants to keep things that way until her teenage children are older. The 48-year-old mother of two says she prefers not having to commit to fixed hours. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It fits my lifestyle, really. It slots in nicely,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says.</p> <p>Lee is on a zero-hours contract with a care home in Warwickshire and also on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bank\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd list, where different homes can call on her to cover shifts when they are short of staff. She likes having the option of topping up her family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s income but also being able to say no when she needs to be with her children, Shannon, 15, and Ciaran, 13.</p> <p>Her husband, Carl, runs his own business fitting professional kitchens in top-end restaurants around the country and is often away from home. Flexible working allows her to support the children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activities, such as dance, music and karate, says Lee. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also school holidays where there is nobody else to have the children \u00e2\u20ac\u201c otherwise I would have to be paying out what I earn in childcare costs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>As a carer Lee earns around \u00c2\u00a39 per hour in the daytime, \u00c2\u00a39.50 per hour at night and a little more at weekends. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Luckily, in Carl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job he can support us anyway but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice to have that little extra for things like dance and singing lessons for my daughter, and to help pay for holidays.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Some carers have said they are nervous about turning down work for fear of not getting further offers in the future. But Lee says she has never found that a problem. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always managed to get some form of work, and they still offer shifts to me,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The only downside is that if I am off sick you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get sick pay, but Carl can still support me.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42aa9b3b90e9291bceb0e29e3d87bfc251def6bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42aa9b3b90e9291bceb0e29e3d87bfc251def6bf/0_121_2576_1546/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Syed Khalil\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Syed Khalil: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI have no pensions and no savings at all.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Syed Khalil</strong><br><strong>Taxi driver</strong><br>Khalil, who lives in Dagenham, east London, has worked as a driver for Addison Lee and Uber over the past eight years, and experienced the downside of life in the gig economy.</p> <p>When he first joined Uber, the fast-growing ride hailing app, Khalil said he had high hopes, given promises of decent pay and the ability to work whatever hours he chose. He bought a car on hire purchase and initially paid no commission on rides secured via the app.</p> <p>But when he had a problem with his car and then got sick, Khalil says his situation changed. As a self-employed contractor he did not receive sick pay and, because he was the owner of the car, he continued to have to make hire purchase and insurance payments. He had to claim benefits.</p> <p>Before long, he had to go back to work in order to cover his rising bills. With his vehicle off the road, Khalil went to work for Addison Lee, where he could rent one of the taxi firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own cars.</p> <p>But he says he had to work long hours to cover the cost of renting the car. He remained self-employed, so when he got ill again, with a kidney problem, he did not receive sick pay and had to continue to make rental payments. He says Addison Lee required him to wear a smart shirt and trousers, and he could be fined if spotted not meeting the dress code, so he felt like an employee without any of the benefits.</p> <p>He has now returned to Uber, as his own car is back on the road. But he says Uber has gradually raised the commission it takes and signed up more drivers so that his earnings have dropped. He says it regularly introduces new terms and conditions, with drivers having to agree to them before they can access the app.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you say no, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t log in.

The vast majority of drivers tell us the reason why they signed up to Uber is so they can control their hours and be their own boss. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re always acting on feedback from drivers, which is why we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re investing in discounted illness cover and savings schemes alongside other improvements.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p>",

Pretty shocking stuff,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she recalls. Now on the 10th anniversary of that landmark commission into vulnerable employment, the general secretary of the TUC seems exasperated that for all the evidence of workers being mistreated, little has changed. And yet for the past fortnight her frustrations have been mixed with a glint of optimism. The election shock was a clear signal people have had enough, O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady tells the Observer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ten years on we are forced to take stock, and what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happened? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gone backwards,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says before a TUC conference on Monday to launch a campaign for better jobs and pay. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My feeling is that the government needs to get its act together pretty fast. I am not overly optimistic on this front. But if they learned anything from that election campaign, then they should have learned there is a real appetite for real change in the workplace.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sitting in her airy central London office, clasping an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I love unions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mug full of tea, the 57-year-old reels off a sorry list of statistics. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The number of people in precarious work has rocketed by over a quarter over the last five years. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got over three million people at the sharpest of the sharp end \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 This is people who are not only on low pay: they have also got no rights, and even if they had rights they would be too scared to enforce them,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. The new campaign, called the Great Jobs Agenda, is targeting the millions of people in precarious work in the so-called gig economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where, rather than having fixed permanent roles, workers tend to be given tasks as and when they are needed. That kind of work has grown hand in hand with the rise of online shopping, and platforms such as the taxi-hailing app Uber and the takeaway delivery service Deliveroo. Most of those companies say they hire independent contractors, who miss out on rights such as the minimum wage and sick pay. They are often paid per job rather than by the hour. Other workers in the gig economy, for example in care homes and pubs, are on zero-hours contracts with no guaranteed work and therefore no guaranteed income. They also tend to be on lower pay. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady also highlights the army of people getting work in warehouses through temporary employment agencies, such as with Sports Direct. An investigation by the Guardian highlighted a climate of fear at the retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire, prompting a select committee of MPs to say it was being run like a Victorian workhouse. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady reaches for a similar description. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am personally shocked about how technology is used as a tyrant in the workplace. Tracking people going to the toilet. Tracking the work they do \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 All of that feels Dickensian in its failure to respect workers as human beings. They are just commodities. There is something really sickening about it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trade unions and journalists have exposed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exactly what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on in high street names like Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she says, and now there is widespread anger. But Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise of an economy that works for everyone seems to have made little difference so far. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are people across the spectrum who are pretty outraged at what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on in 21st-century Britain. But nothing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happened. We had the prime minister on the steps of Downing Street, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had promise after promise, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had no action. So I think patience is wearing thin and I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important that politicians do listen \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but more importantly that they act. And there is no reason for delay. How much more evidence do people need?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The TUC wants zero-hours contracts banned and for everyone on regular hours to have a right to a written contract guaranteeing their normal working hours. It wants an end to bogus self-employment and believes the law should change to give people a default right to qualify for all employment rights, unless the employer can demonstrate they are genuinely self-employed. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anger goes further than the squeeze on living standards that has been sparked by meagre wage growth and a rise in living costs since the Brexit vote. She also points to the \u00c2\u00a34bn a year the TUC reckons insecure work is costing the public coffers in lost tax and higher benefits. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes it is about falling real wages, yes it is about people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anxieties about what sorts of jobs their kids are going to go into \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but there are these immediate, urgent issues of some employers running riot with exploitative contracts that are not just robbing those workers of a decent job and livelihood but robbing the exchequer too,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. The TUC wants workers to go on to its new website, https://greatjobsquiz.org.uk, where they can rate their workplace by checking, among other things, if it pays the living wage, recognises trade unions and is safe. It is a kind of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tripadvisor for bosses\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady. The site will also tell workers what their rights are. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady, who has two grown-up children, feels that kind of information is urgently needed to prevent a culture of precarious work becoming entrenched. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For me, the heartbreaking bit is the generation of workers who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know any better \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who think that this is normal,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. As for where unions fit into the world of rising self-employment and short-term contracts, O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady insists that collective action will remain the best route to change. She also rebuts the idea that falling trade union membership leaves them without a mandate, but she wants better access to workplaces. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Surely it should be possible for workers to have the right to be represented by a union and also to have a right for unions to bargain on their behalf. Because in the end, particularly with vulnerable workers, banding together is your only chance of resetting that power and balance,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. The prime minister made a nod to changing culture in workplaces last year when she appointed Matthew Taylor, the former head of Tony Blair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy unit, to head a review into modern employment. He is due to report soon. So is O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady hopeful the review will mark a turning point? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Matthew\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job is to make recommendations to government,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think governments of any colour can duck their responsibility or outsource their responsibility or use reports to delay. They should be getting on with the job.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There is a worry, however, that getting on will prove more difficult as Brexit negotiations finally get under way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a year on from a referendum in which O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady made the case for staying in the EU to protect workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am very conscious about civil servants being dragooned into Brexit work and what does that mean for everything else? There is still a country to run. There are still injustices to tackle.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yet she remains optimistic that May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakened government knows it cannot let workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights fall by the wayside. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government would pay a big political price for not acting to tackle insecurity at work. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think of too many elections where work issues were so high on the agenda,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. Case studies Liz Lee Care home worker Lee has been on zero-hours contracts with care homes for four years and wants to keep things that way until her teenage children are older. The 48-year-old mother of two says she prefers not having to commit to fixed hours. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It fits my lifestyle, really. It slots in nicely,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. Lee is on a zero-hours contract with a care home in Warwickshire and also on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bank\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd list, where different homes can call on her to cover shifts when they are short of staff. She likes having the option of topping up her family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s income but also being able to say no when she needs to be with her children, Shannon, 15, and Ciaran, 13. Her husband, Carl, runs his own business fitting professional kitchens in top-end restaurants around the country and is often away from home. Flexible working allows her to support the children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activities, such as dance, music and karate, says Lee. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also school holidays where there is nobody else to have the children \u00e2\u20ac\u201c otherwise I would have to be paying out what I earn in childcare costs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As a carer Lee earns around \u00c2\u00a39 per hour in the daytime, \u00c2\u00a39.50 per hour at night and a little more at weekends. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Luckily, in Carl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job he can support us anyway but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice to have that little extra for things like dance and singing lessons for my daughter, and to help pay for holidays.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some carers have said they are nervous about turning down work for fear of not getting further offers in the future. But Lee says she has never found that a problem. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always managed to get some form of work, and they still offer shifts to me,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The only downside is that if I am off sick you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get sick pay, but Carl can still support me.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Syed Khalil Taxi driver Khalil, who lives in Dagenham, east London, has worked as a driver for Addison Lee and Uber over the past eight years, and experienced the downside of life in the gig economy. When he first joined Uber, the fast-growing ride hailing app, Khalil said he had high hopes, given promises of decent pay and the ability to work whatever hours he chose. He bought a car on hire purchase and initially paid no commission on rides secured via the app. But when he had a problem with his car and then got sick, Khalil says his situation changed. As a self-employed contractor he did not receive sick pay and, because he was the owner of the car, he continued to have to make hire purchase and insurance payments. He had to claim benefits. Before long, he had to go back to work in order to cover his rising bills. With his vehicle off the road, Khalil went to work for Addison Lee, where he could rent one of the taxi firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own cars. But he says he had to work long hours to cover the cost of renting the car. He remained self-employed, so when he got ill again, with a kidney problem, he did not receive sick pay and had to continue to make rental payments. He says Addison Lee required him to wear a smart shirt and trousers, and he could be fined if spotted not meeting the dress code, so he felt like an employee without any of the benefits. He has now returned to Uber, as his own car is back on the road. But he says Uber has gradually raised the commission it takes and signed up more drivers so that his earnings have dropped. He says it regularly introduces new terms and conditions, with drivers having to agree to them before they can access the app. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you say no, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t log in. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been working as a minicab driver since 2009 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m nearly 40 and I have no pension and no savings at all,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no way you can plan anything, for a holiday or for the future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tom Elvidge said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Licensed drivers who use our app are totally free to choose if, when and where they drive with no shifts or minimum hours. The vast majority of drivers tell us the reason why they signed up to Uber is so they can control their hours and be their own boss. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re always acting on feedback from drivers, which is why we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re investing in discounted illness cover and savings schemes alongside other improvements.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

                "bodyText":"And finally (probably), European stock markets have ended the day in the red. In London the FTSE100 lost 12 points to 7434, despite mining shares rallying, and there were deeper losses in Europe. Currency moves are to blame; the euro strengthened after ECB president Mario Draghi spoke about reflation returning to the Eurozone as its recovery picked up. The pound gained against the US dollar after the IMF cut its growth forecasts. Political developments in Scotland also nudged sterling up, as Josh Mahony of IG explains: News that the SNP have formally abandoned their plan for a second referendum before the completion of Brexit has helped the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ascent, with GBPUSD hitting the highest level in a week. The IMF cut their outlook for the US economy today, which when considering the negative path of core PCE inflation, makes a September rate hike increasingly unlikely. Newsflash: American consumer morale has jumped this month, despite the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns about the US economy. The Conference Board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer confidence index rose in June to 118.9, defying expectations that it would fall to 116.0 this month. Optimism is close to a 16-year high, says Lynn Franco of the The Conference Board: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Expectations for the short-term have eased somewhat, but are still upbeat. Overall, consumers anticipate the economy will continue expanding in the months ahead, but they do not foresee the pace of growth accelerating.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Howard Archer, Chief Economic Advisor to the EY ITEM Club, is struck by the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to bring forwards its consumer credit stress tests by a couple of months: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The risk to financial stability coming from the recent rapid growth in consumer credit would undoubtedly be magnified if there is a near-term interest rate hike. While any interest rate hike would be small with further increases some way off, even small increases could cause problems for some consumers given their high borrowing levels. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is notable that the Bank of England is bringing forward its testing of banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to cope with major losses on consumer loans to September from November. Additionally, regulators will in July publish their expectations for lenders in the consumer credit market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wall Street has opened lower, with the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgraded growth forecasts dampening the mood in New York. The main indices are all in the red, with shares in Alphabet (Google) shedding more than 1.2% after it was slapped with a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.4bn fine by Brussels today. The news that the IMF has downgraded its US growth forecasts and criticised Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget plans, has sent a ripple through the financial markets. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some snap reaction: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more reaction to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report, from Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank of England is right to flag our debt binge as a big concern. Rock bottom interest rates have made borrowing cheap and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve definitely been making the most of it. The harsh reality is many households would struggle to pay back what they owe if interest rates went up. Many are just about managing now and have little in savings to fall back on. Banks need to be prepared for this worst case scenario so they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on shaky ground if rates go up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has cut its US growth forecasts, and concluded that Donald Trump won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t boost economic activity after all. The IMF now expects US GDP to rise by 2.1% in 2017, down from 2.3% back in April. For 2018, it also sees growth of 2.1%, down from 2.5% three months ago. The IMF had hoped that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to boost fiscal spending, and cut taxes, would deliver a economic boost. But having seen the president in action, the Fund has had a rethink. Importantly, it criticises Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent budget proposals, warning that they benefit the richest Americans more than the rest. Reuters explains: The IMF said the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest budget plans would place a disproportionate share of spending cuts onto low-and middle-income households, adding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this would appear counter to the budget\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goals of promoting safety and prosperity for all Americans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Instead, the Fund suggested a tax policy that would improve the federal revenue-to-GDP ratio, more balanced cuts that strengthen the social safety net\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efficiency, and efforts to contain healthcare cost inflation. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been an eventful couple of days in Greece, where prime minister Alexis Tsipras has held emergency talks with striking municipal rubbish collectors over demands for expiring short-term contracts to be replaced with permanent jobs. With the sweltering heat fuelling mounting concerns that mounds of uncollected rubbish could soon become a public health risk, Tsipras invited unionists representing the workers to his office for talks last night. In a statement his office said the invitation was addressed to unionists \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to find a solution to the claims of the refuge workers and to avoid the dangers to public heath\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd posed by the prolonged strike\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and very high temperatures that are expected in the coming days.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Earlier today, scuffles broke out between unionists and security guards outside the building housing the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarters when attempts were made to unfold banners emblazoned with slogans and demands. The meeting is being described as critical by insiders who say given the heat wave now gripping Greece - and the arrival of hundreds of thousands of tourists in the capital alone - the strike has become a major political issue. How Tsipras will be able to negotiate his way out of the crisis - and keep labour reform demanding international creditors on board - is anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guess. Alex Buttle, director of car buying website Motorway.co.uk, argues that Mark Carney is right to worry about the boom in car loans. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The growth of Personal Contract Plans over the past few years has been astronomical, and the level of consumer debt this is causing is getting out of hand. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite the many hidden costs, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to resist the temptation of owning a new luxury car without having to find tens of thousands of pounds upfront to pay for it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The problem is that household finances are starting to get stretched and many people are probably living beyond their means because of readily available credit, including car loans. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If people really do start to struggle financially, then the priority will be keeping a roof over their heads, and they are far more likely to default on a car loan than a mortgage. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We could well see a spike in people defaulting on their car loans in favour of losing their home if the economic climate takes a turn for the worst.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound has inched higher against the US dollar through the day, and is currently 0.3% higher at $1.2764. However, it is still down 0.5% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1314, after ECB chief Mario Draghi gave an optimistic view of the eurozone economy. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153barrage of information\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability review didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually move the markets that much. He says: The FTSE maintained its 15 point drop, the gains in the commodity and banking sectors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the former benefiting from a Brent Crude bounce, the latter from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian bank bailout \u00e2\u20ac\u201c failing to counteract the effects of the drop in consumer confidence revealed by YouGov. As for the pound, while it suffered some serious losses against the euro, it still managed to climb 0.2% against the dollar. That wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the most illuminating press conference with Mark Carney, but here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we learned. The Bank of England is pushing the UK financial sector to prepare for a downturn, by making them hold an extra \u00c2\u00a311bn of capital. But.... Carney says this won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a problem, as banks already hold more capital than required, since the rule were relaxed after the Brexit vote. As Carney puts it: We want to move the levels of capital back up to the level they should be -- any time you move into more benign credit conditions there have been fewer defaults. The BoE is concerned that some lenders are becoming too reckless, saying that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumer credit has increased rapidly. Lending conditions in the mortgage market are becoming easier. Lenders may be placing undue weight on the recent performance of loans in benign conditions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key target appears to be complacency, as it scrambles to bring its consumer credit stress tests forward by three months to September. It is particularly interested in the car market, following the boom in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Personal Contract Purchase\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd deals. These allow customers to pay a monthly fee for a new car, and then either pay a hefty \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcballoon payment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to actually own it, or switch to a new deal with a new vehicle. The fear is that customers could be left high and dry if financial conditions tighten. However (and this is where the confusion starts) the Bank doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want consumers to cut up their credit cards and stop trying to shimmy up the housing ladder. Instead, it wants them to be sensible when borrowing, and trust that the Bank is keeping the financial system strong. Those families who are most over-extended, and wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cope with higher borrowing costs, are a concern, though: On Brexit, Carney repeatedly said the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contingency planning is focusing on the most disruptive scenario, in which Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean the BoE expects such a cliff-edge exit..... If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jill Treanor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story about the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report: Final question: Q: You say you expect to raise the counter-cyclical buffer to 1% in November, but could Brexit force a cut back from 0.5% to 0% (reversing today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move) Mark Carney says the BoE thinks the buffer should be around 1% in stable times. The BoE had started the process of raising the buffer last year, before the Brexit vote, which led it to be cut back to 0% to take worries about lending \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoff the table\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. So.... we could have decided to hike the buffer to 1% today, but it was more sensible to allow a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgradual build\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (to 0.5% today, and 1% in November) On Brexit, we want the system to be as resilient as possible to prepare for any outcome in 640 days time, he concludes. I think that means the BoE want the banking sector to be well capitalised, in case of any Brexit shock in March 2019, when Britain leaves the EU. Q: You say that West End asset prices are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunsustainable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122; when might they return to reality, and what impact would that happen? Carney reiterates his earlier point that Britain currently have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Very low risk-free rates, and high valuation levels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So either those rates should rise, or asset prices should fall. It would be foolish to put a timescale on it - prices can stay unsustainable for a long time, and then correct quickly, he warns. Q: The report talks about the need for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconsistent implementation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of international standards; are you particularly worried about the Trump administration? Carney says it is important to have open global standards, and even more important that they are implemented, to avoid another financial crisis. You also need supervisory co-operation between regulators...and we want to reinforce that where possible. On the US, we have had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very productive discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with regulators about it. Carney explains how many countries have some unique rules (such as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Volcker rule, or bank ring-fencing in the UK), which they can change without affecting other nations. But there needs to be more co-ordination when it comes to global standards, if there are areas of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinconsistency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that need to be addressed. [Explainer: Donald Trump has vowed to cut regulations in the financial sector, such as the Volcker rule which is meant to prevent banks taking dangerous trading risks. Trump is also keen to repeal Dodd-Frank, which was brought in after the financial crisis. ] Q: You point out that commercial real estate assets are overvalued, and could unwind if people try to sell them in a rush. That happened after the Brexit vote - has anything changed since? [explainer: several property funds froze redemptions after the EU referendum, to stop investors cashing out, exposing the dangers of investing in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcilliquid assets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 such as shopping centres] Carney says there is a disconnect between the market expectations for future growth, and the value of commercial buildings. So either those expectations will rise, or commercial asset values will fall. Q: Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the boom in consumer credit due to you keeping interest rates so low? Carney insists he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not to blame, and points to the broader context of a UK economy that has grown solidly over the last 12 months (despite slowing in the first quarter of 2017). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing how consumer debt has grown: Carney says the boom in car loans is a major factor behind the pick-up in consumer debt recently, but he remains \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sanguine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the banking sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall exposure to it. Q: Your charts show that consumer finance has been growing faster than household income since 2014, so shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you have issued today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning sooner? Deputy governor Sir John Cunliffe says consumer borrowing actually picked up in 2013, but overall household lending actually grew slower than the UK economy. Consumer borrowing is \u00c2\u00a3200bn, compared to \u00c2\u00a31.4 trillion in mortgage lending, he explains - so the BoE has to decide when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a serious worry. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been watching consumer credit for a while, and now is the time to look at whether underwriting standards are starting to slip, and bring forwards our stress test (by three months, to September) Q: Are banks misbehaving and gaming the system, and is there a cultural problem? They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not gaming the system, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not learning the lessons of the past, Carney says. Q: Which consumer borrowing are you most worried about? Carney cites the sharp build up in car financing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both in volume, and the move towards \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpersonal contract purchasing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 deals (where buyers pay monthly repayments, and then face a large balloon payment to actually own their car) Q: How confident are you that banks can raise the extra capital you are demanding? They all have this capital on their books at present, Carney replies. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a question of reallocating capital from other areas (and perhaps choosing to raise more capital) The extra capital buffer will mean UK banks must meet a 4% leverage ratio, Carney explains, but the current leverage ratio is actually 5.25%. In other words, Banks shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t face a massive challenge meeting the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demands. Q: Has the general election changed your view of how the Brexit talks will evolve, and raised the risks from political instability? The short answer is no, governor Carney replies. Our job is to work out what might go wrong and prepare for it, rather than assessing quite how likely various scenarios are. So June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contingency planning for Brexit. Q: How worried are you about the British banking sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exposure to China? Risks from China are at the top end of global risks, Carney replies. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to the build-up of debt, structural issues in the financial system, and the challenge of growing the economy while also maintaining stability. Q: What role are interest rates playing in exaggerating or reining in financial stability risks? Monetary policy is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclast line of defence\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, says Carney, and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need monetary policy to do our job of ensuring financial stability, Carney continues. If the Financial Policy Committee does its job properly, then the MPC can focus on its job of getting inflation back to target. Q: And what would you say to those who think that being responsible for financial stability is distracting you from the job of setting interest rates and controlling inflation? Carney (who chairs both the FPC and the Monetary Policy Committee which sets borrowing costs) denies that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got too much on his plate. It takes as long to decide to raise rates as to cut then as to leave them on hold, he replies. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been doing this job for many years at two central banks (the BoE and the Bank of Canada). And he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not biting.... Q: You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re telling banks that times are changing, and they should set aside more capital, but shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t consumers also recognise that times are changing and rein in our borrowings? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to give individual financial advice, says Mark Carney (you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on your own, folks, sorry). He then explains that the Bank is trying to strengthen the resilience of the core of the system, in case a crisis strike. The message for the public is that if things become bumpy, in the Brexit transition or because of problems in the global economy, then the financial system will be there for them, says the governor, adding: Individuals must take the judgement whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the right time to buy a property, or invest in a business, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to ensure that the financial system is there to help them with that. Q: You seem to be blaming lenders, rather than consumers, for the rise in consumer credit - but shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t people be more cautious about how much debt they take on? Carney says that UK households have deleveraged a lot since the financial crisis, and only releveraged recently. He wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that households as a whole are taking elevated risks. The first line of defence is that lenders themselves are responsible; the second line of defence is banks set aside enough capital incase of a downturn. Q: How concerned are you that UK consumers are borrowing too much, and will find themselves in difficulties when interest rates rise? Mark Carney replies that the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message, in good times or bad ones, is that anyone who takes out a loan should consider that they could face adverse conditions in the future, such as weaker growth and higher interest rates. This \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stating the obvious, which is often what you get from a central banker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, is particularly appropriate today, the governor adds smilingly. On cybercrime, Carney says the Bank is setting out the framework that will be needed to protect the UK financial system from computer attacks. On Brexit, Carney says the Bank is making contingency plans for all possible outcomes, and concentrating on those would have the greatest impact on the economy. That includes the possibility that Britain leaves the European Union without a deal (this is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccliff-edge Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that many firms fear). Carney says that forcing banks to hold more capital (by raising the counter-cyclical buffer to 0.5% today, and probably to 1% in November) will more protection to losses. Mark Carney begins his press conference by saying that financial stability has been strengthened since the 2008 crisis. But the job of tackling financial dangers is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153never done, and risks are evolving.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The financial policy committee thinks that the overall risks from the domestic environment are at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153standard level\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with most indicators neither \u00e2\u20ac\u0153particularly elevated nor subdued\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But there are some risks that require particular vigilance, he continues One is consumer credit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c growth has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153far outpaced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd household income in the last year, including credit cards and loans to buy new homes. And with the market competitive, lenders are vulnerable to a downturn. The second worry is Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the range of possible outcomes as Britian leaves the EU, and the paths to them. Mark Carney is facing financial reporters at the Bank of England now, to explain the thinking behind today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report. You can watch it live here: Google has been handed a record \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.42bn fine by Brussels over alleged abuse of its market dominance. It was a much bigger than expected fine, with most predicting a penalty in the region of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn. EU antitrust officials have accused the search engine giant of illegally favouring its shopping service. It is the biggest fine for a single company in an EU antitrust case, and follows a seven-year investigation. European commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: Google has come up with many innovative products and services that have made a difference to our lives. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good thing. But Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy for its comparison shopping service wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just about attracting customers by making its product better than those of its rivals. Instead, Google abused its market dominance as a search engine by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results, and demoting those of competitors. What Google has done is illegal under EU antitrust rules. It denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation. More soon... And here is the background: City experts are trawling through the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report. Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group has spotted a chart showing how consumer credit losses rise when unemployment increases. No wonder the Bank is forcing lenders to stash more capital in their vaults now, in case an economic downturn forces more consumers to default on their loans. Alistair McQueen of Aviva points to another chart, showing how a drop in house prices can ripple through the system, triggering \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfire sales\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and further losses. Steve Hawkes of The Sun has a pithy summary: The BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report is online here. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an infographic form the Bank, setting the scene: The Bank of England is also boosting its work on cybercrime and continuing its work on Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on top of ordering UK banks to set aside more capital, and rushing forwards its consumer stress tests. Here are the five key points from the financial stability report. The Bank of England is.... \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Increasing the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate to 0.5%, from 0%. Absent a material change in the outlook, and consistent with its stated policy for a standard risk environment and of moving gradually, the FPC expects to increase the rate to 1% at its November meeting. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Bringing forward the assessment of stressed losses on consumer credit lending in the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2017 annual stress test. This will inform the FPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment at its next meeting of any additional resilience required in aggregate against this lending. The FPC further supports the intentions of the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority to publish, in July, their expectations of lenders in the consumer credit market. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Clarifying its existing insurance measures in the mortgage market, designed to prevent excessive growth in the number of highly indebted households. This will promote consistency across lenders in their application of tests to assess whether new mortgage borrowers can afford repayments. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Consistent with its previous commitment, restoring the level of resilience delivered by its leverage ratio standard to the level it delivered in July 2016 before the FPC excluded central bank reserves from the leverage ratio exposure measure. The FPC intends to set the minimum leverage requirement at 3.25% of non-reserve exposures, subject to consultation. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Overseeing contingency planning to mitigate risks to financial stability as the United Kingdom withdraws from the European Union. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Building on the programme of cyber resilience testing it instigated in 2013, by setting out the essential elements of the regulatory framework for maintaining cyber resilience. It will now monitor that each element is being fulfilled by the relevant UK authorities. Another important point: the Bank of England is also bringing forwards its planned stress test on consumer credit lending to September, from November. That test will assess whether UK banks can handle a jump in consumer credit losses. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s change means that UK banks will have to set aside more than \u00c2\u00a311bn of extra capital to cover potential losses if the economy weakens: From the BoE, my colleague Jill Treanor explains: The Bank of England is to force banks to hold more capital in the face of rapid growth in lending on credit cards, car finance and personal loans. The intervention by Threadneedle Street, which could amount to banks needing \u00c2\u00a311.4bn of extra capital in the next 18 months, is one of a number of measures intended to protect the financial system from the growth in consumer finance. Here we go! The Bank of England has told Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks to start setting aside more capital to protect themselves from a financial downturn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the key lines from the Financial Stability Report. As predicted, the BoE is raising the counter-cyclical capital buffer (CCyB), so that banks must set aside 0.5% of their assets as capital in case of a rainy day. That means it is reversing one of measures taken after the Brexit vote, a year ago. Interestingly, the BoE says it expecs to raise CCyB again, in November, to 1%. More to follow.... Tension is building in the City as traders wait for the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report to hit the wires, in just five minutes. The rise in the euro has pushed Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets down. Ever index is now in the red, with the Stoxx 600 losing 0.6%. A stronger euro isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great news for eurozone exporters, of course. But the key point is that Draghi is being optimistic -- that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no reason to dump shares. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says traders shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too skittish: Draghi suggested inflation is becoming more sustainable and deflationary forces have been replaced by reflationary forces. Importantly he suggests deflationary forces are external, temporary shocks and the ECB can overlook. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what happens when you open the taps on a massive stimulus programme. The question is whether the Eurozone would survive without the QE support. Draghi sounded more circumspect on that front, arguing that he is confident that monetary policy is working but still needs to remain very loose. Again it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a stretch to describe it as hawkish \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Draghi is simply affirming that loose monetary policy is working without significant adverse consequences and therefore should be maintained. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not advocating tightening any time soon. The European commission just dropped a loud hint that the Google antitrust fine is coming this morning.... This tweet is from EC press officer Yizhou Ren: Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bullish talk has also sent the pound down against the euro, shedding 0.4% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.133. That means one euro buys 88.2p, up from 87.9p on Monday. Good news for eurozone holidaymakers heading to the UK this summer, but a blow to Britons planning a continental jaunt. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters take on Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech: The euro zone still needs \u00e2\u20ac\u0153considerable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd monetary support from the European CentralBank even as its economy recovers steadily and inflation picks up, ECB President Mario Draghi said on Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All the signs now point to a strengthening and broadening recovery in the euro area. Deflationary forces have been replaced by reflationary ones,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Draghi said at the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual policy forum in Sintra, Portugal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, a considerable degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for inflation dynamics to become durable and self-sustaining.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing how the euro spiked as Draghi spoke in Portugal: Oooh. The euro is rallying as Mario Draghi tells the ECB Forum that reflationary pressures in the eurozone are building, as the economy recovers. The single currency has jumped by half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.1235, with Draghi sounding more upbeat and hawkish than expected. Draghi has also told his audience that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a considerable degree\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of stimulus is still needed in the eurozone, and that the ECB must be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprudent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in how it unwinds it. Draghi has previously talked about a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsubstantial degree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of help being needed, and Arne Petimezas, analyst at AFS Group in the Netherlands, thinks this wording is significant. Not for the first (or last) time, Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message is that his policies are delivering the goods.... Over in Sintra, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is giving the keynote speech at the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Forum now. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being streamed here. Draghi says there are clear signs of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strengthening and broadening\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd recovery underway in the eurozone area. There have been 16 straight quarters of growth in the euro area, he says. But this nascent growth needs to become sustainable, and that means higher productivity growth. Central bankers face an unusual challenge today, Draghi continues \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they face growth that is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153above trend and well distributed across the euro area\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But at the same time, inflation is more muted than you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect. To decide the right approach (ie, when to cut the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus package), you need to understand the causes, Draghi cautions. And Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment is that monetary policy is working to build up reflationary pressures. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being slowed by external price shocks, slack in the labour market, and a change in how the labour market and inflation interact, he concludes. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Giles has pulled together a list of key issues to watch for today, when the Bank of England releases its twice-yearly report on financial stability. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Will the BoE remove its emergency support for banks? It could raise its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153counter-cyclical capital buffer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, to force banks to hold more capital. A year ago, after the EU referendum, the BoE reduced this buffer to zero, but it may now conclude that this emergency help is no longer needed. Will it try to curb consumer borrowing? The FPC may tell banks to cut back on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153teaser\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd interest rates, to prevent a surge in defaults. Is car finance out of control? UK car sales have been strong for many months, thanks to cheap credit and new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal contract payment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd deals that make it easier to buy a new vehicle. Is the mortgage market a worry? A housing crash would have very serious consequences for the economy, so investors will want to hear Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views Brexit blues? With negotiations with Brussels finally underway, will the Bank say anything about the risks of a drop in confidence in UK assets? More here. UK consumer confidence has plunged since June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election, as the shock of a hung parliament hits households. It gives the Bank of England a fresh headache as it considers the health of the UK economy, ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Stability Report. Pollsters at YouGov found that UK citizens are fretting about political uncertainty, rising inflation, falling real wages, and the state of the housing market. YouGov found there was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pronounced collapse in consumer confidence following the election\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The sight of Theresa May losing her majority sent its consumer morale index sliding to 105.2 from 109.1. For June as a whole, consumer confidence dropped to 106.9, its second-lowest level since the summer of 2013. Stephen Harmston, head of YouGov, says that the UK housing slowdown is causing particular alarm (Nationwide says prices have fallen for the last three months) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The hung parliament seems to have further dampened consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 spirits, which were already sinking following the continued squeeze on household finances. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the real cause for alarm will be the cooling of the property market, as this is one of the key things that has propped up consumer confidence over the past few years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re facing central bank overload today, with monetary policy chiefs speaking in London, and the Portuguese town of Sintra. All eyes will be on the Bank of England, as its powerful Financial Policy Committee releases its latest report followed by a press conference with Governor Mark Carney. The FPC, which is charged with maintaining financial stability, could order banks to rein in their riskier lending, following growing fears that consumer borrowing is getting out of hand. The Bank could also tell City banks to start restocking their capital buffers, having previously told banks to lend more after the Brexit vote. Meanwhile in sunny (ish) Sintra, the European Central Bank is holding its annual forum. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be hearing from Mario Draghi, ECB president, who last night told students in Portugal that his massive stimulus scheme was creating employment. Challenged over the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge money-printing programme, Draghi declared that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The millennials that found a job because of our policy, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pretty sure they are okay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [with the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies] . And he also denied that savers had been unfairly treated, arguing that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also benefitting from the recovery, as: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recessions are not good for anybody, savers or non-savers, It could be a busy morning, as there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a strong chance that Google will be hit with a whopping fine this morning, of over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn, for breaching Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition rules. That would end a long inquiry into whether Google used its dominant search engine to unfairly promote its Google Shopping service, but could spark an angry response from America. And then tonight, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful central banker, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, is speaking at London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Royal Academy. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re promised a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wide-ranging discussion about global economic issues.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On the corporate front, retail group Debenhams and car hire chain Northgate are reporting results, plus there are retail sales figures in the UK and consumer confidence stats from America to keep us on our toes.
