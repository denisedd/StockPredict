The election outcome looks set to further complicate the process of negotiating the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the EU, as the government only has a narrow majority in parliament \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and even this looks vulnerable in the context of Conservative MPs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 widely differing views on post-Brexit UK-EU relations. Given the backdrop of an already slowing economy (the UK posted the lowest real GDP growth of all 28 EU economies in Q1 2017), it is not surprising that businesses are beginning to express a lack of confidence.

The time frame for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU in March 2019 remains unchanged, reducing still further the time available to achieve the transition agreement needed to avoid a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit.<br></li> <li><strong>We expect fiscal risks to increase because consolidation will have a lower priority, a credit negativ</strong>e. In our view, the budget deficit will increase this year and next, as the government reacts to the economic slowdown under way. The election outcome, with significant gains for the Labour Party which had campaigned for increased public spending, will likely be seen as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vote against austerity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The public debt ratio will rise further and for longer than we had expected, placing the UK among the few highly rated European sovereigns whose public debt is still rising.<strong><br></strong></li> <li><strong>However, the election outcome also means that the government may now consider \u00e2\u20ac\u0153softer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit options, which could be credit positive</strong>. While we still expect Brexit to happen and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cliff\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd risk of sudden exit remains, the election result suggests an electoral shift away from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit that the Prime Minister had ostensibly sought.

Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows: \u00c2\u00a31 = \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1280, lowest since November 2016 \u00c2\u00a31 = $1.1265, close to the eight-week low set in Friday The selloff came as rumours swirled through Westminster that next Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Speech might be postponed. This has highlighted that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position in Downing Street remains vulnerable (and potentially creates a very awkward diary clash with the monarch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s duties at Royal Ascot.) Political insiders are also reporting that the cabinet is split, with some members pushing for a softer Brexit plan. Business leaders have warned that confidence has been badly hit by the hung parliament delivered by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election, which has left May chasing some sort of deal with the Democratic Unionist Party, which won 10 seats in Northern Ireland. The Institute for Directors said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if not addressed immediately \u00e2\u20ac\u201c be disastrous for the UK economy. The needs of business and discussion of the economy were largely absent from the campaign, but this crash in confidence shows how urgently that must change in the new government. Rating agencies have weighed in too. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warned that the hung parliament was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccredit negative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the UK; a hint that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating could be downgraded. They said: Election result heightens uncertainty over Brexit negotiations and increases fiscal risks, a credit negative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist predicted that UK growth would be hurt. Harvard University added to the mix, with a study finding that most businesses want to remain in the single market. The Resolution Foundation warned that UK firms are worryingly unprepared for migration curbs. Meanwhile on Wall Street, US technology giants are suffering a second day of losses, with the Nasdaq down 1% in early trading. Is it the end of the tech boom?... ...not necessarily! Chris Beauchamp of IG says: Attention is concentrated on the ongoing rout in US tech stocks. Having been such a one-way bet so far this year, this sudden turn to the downside will have caught out more than a few over-eager latecomers. However, those rushing to proclaim the demise of one of the big rallies of not only the past year but the past eight years too need to be careful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there will be plenty of dip buyers out there who have been waiting for a pullback of this kind of size. And in Europe, the markets have just closed for the day. The FTSE 100 shed 15 points, or 0.25%, to 7511 - failing to get any benefit from the cheaper pound. The the German DAX shed almost 1% and the French CAC lost 1.2% That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Dr Mike Ellington of the University of Liverpool has written an interesting article on how sterling will suffer from the political crisis in Westminster. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysed UK economic uncertainty (measured by recording how many articles on economic and political unrest appear in the media each day), and tracked it against the value of the pound. He conclude that there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnegative relationship\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 between the two, with sterling suffering losses whenever It is clear that the negative relationship between policy uncertainty and the euro to sterling exchange rate is intensifying. This implies that increases in economic policy uncertainty are met with depreciations in the sterling to euro exchange rate running up to June 9, 2017. This indicates that currency markets do not feel the government has a strong negotiation position for Brexit (otherwise sterling wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be so volatile). Ellington concludes that this means trouble ahead.... This, coupled with May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lack of support in the general election, should put her leadership into question, particularly when it comes to entering divorce talks with the EU. The very fact that the domestic political landscape of the UK is shrouded by yet another layer of uncertainty suggests that economic policy, the exchange rate, and indeed the wider economy, is in for a rough ride. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full piece: Why the hung parliament spells economic turbulence for the UK economy The Institute of Director\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that UK business confidence has plunged since the general election has caused quite a stir. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some of the best reaction: Markus Kuger, senior economist at business services firm Dun &amp; Bradstreet \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After the surprising election result, political and economic uncertainty in the UK has risen considerably. The election outcome looks set to further complicate the process of negotiating the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the EU, as the government only has a narrow majority in parliament \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and even this looks vulnerable in the context of Conservative MPs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 widely differing views on post-Brexit UK-EU relations. Given the backdrop of an already slowing economy (the UK posted the lowest real GDP growth of all 28 EU economies in Q1 2017), it is not surprising that businesses are beginning to express a lack of confidence. We believe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly unlikely that the first round of Brexit talks between the British government and the EU (scheduled for 19/20 June) will deliver more clarity or significant results. This means that companies will have to wait even longer to assess the impact of these negotiations on their business. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our analysis indicates that uncertainty will remain high in the next 18 months, regardless of what happens in the wake of the election, and we are maintaining our risk rating of DB2d and our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeteriorating\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 risk outlook for the UK economy. We predict that, in the long run, the election result could make a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit - which we believe would be harmful for the British economy - impossible. Jenni Hibbert, Managing Partner for Financial Services Europe &amp; Africa at executive headhunters Heidrick &amp; Struggles \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Worries about the future are not just relegated to those in financial services: we recently conducted a wide-ranging survey with hospitality CEOs, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth largest employer accounting for 180,000 businesses in the UK, with less than one in ten confident about the future and almost half describing themselves as concerned.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Former UK shadow chancellor Ed Balls has also weighed in on Brexit today by co-authoring a report which found that a bad deal would be a disaster for the UK. A survey of small UK businesses by Harvard University found that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153almost all\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd business leaders wanted to retain membership of the single market and customs union, to make it easier to keep trading with the EU. Balls says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the time of the referendum, many British companies thought that Brexit might lead to a reduced regulatory burden. But now they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re worried that if Britain leaves the single market and the customs union, the opposite will be true.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: During the election campaign, both the Labour and Conservative leadership said Britain would leave the single market after Brexit - in order to impose migration controls. However, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit secretary, Sir Kier Starmer, has suggested today that the UK could stay inside the single market; a reminder that there are differing views on Brexit in both major parties... Newsflash: Shares in tech companies are falling again at the start of trading on Wall Street. The Nasdaq has shed 1%, losing 64 points to 6,143, at the start of trading. That adds to Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.8% tumble, Amazon, Alphabet/Google and Apple are all leading the fallers, as concerns grow that these tech giants have become overvalue. Ouch! The pound has just hit a new seven-month low against the euro, and is falling further against the dollar too. Sterling dropped as low as \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1280, down almost one euro cent today. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest level since last November. Sterling is also continuing to lose ground against the US dollar; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now down 0.5% at $1.2671- close to the eight-week low hit after the general election. The selloff comes as Theresa May government fails to show a great deal of strength and stability - with the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech reportedly postponed. FXTM Vice President of Market Research, Jameel Ahmad, argues that the pound will suffer fresh losses as Brexit talks begin next week. He isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced that a move towards a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsofter Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will provide much support. I personally still see downside risks for the Sterling and see the potential for the market to become encouraged towards selling in the likelihood that the UK is set to begin negotiations next week and looks very unprepared for such complex negotiations. The whole reason for the UK election in the first place was so that Theresa May would have more powers to influence the Brexit process, but not only has this play backfired, the UK looks more unprepared than ever to go head-to-head with the EU as it currently stands. I personally remain bearish on the Sterling. Carolyn Fairbairn, the director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, has also weighed in on the issue of EU migrants. She warns that British firms can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be expected to replace EU nationals with UK citizens, at a time when employment in Britain is already at record high levels. Fairbairn also told the Resolution Foundation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conference that politicians need to concentrate on the economy again.. Speaking of EU migration.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s businesses are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153totally unprepared\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the drop in migration after Brexit, according to a new report from the Resolution Foundation today. The think tank polled more than 500 UK businesses who employ EU workers, and found that 17% expect no change to the current system of freedom of movement for EU/EEA nationals to the UK. Another 30% believe this system will be maintained for anyone from the EU who arrives in Britain with a job offer. These are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153totally unrealistic expectations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, warns Resolution, because: The Prime Minister in contrast has ruled out either option, stating that her government \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rather than firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 demand for workers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will control migrant numbers. The Conservative Manifesto recommitted the government to reducing net migration down to the tens of thousands. The report was presented to a conference in London today, which also heard that the UK agriculture sector needs tens of thousands of season workers each year. The National Farmers Union is urging the government to consider this issue during the Brexit talks: Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Another dollop of uncertainty has just landed on our plates; Downing Street are hinting that the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Speech might not take place next Monday after all. Our political liveblogger Andrew Sparrow has just returned from the regular lobby briefing with Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman, and reports: The spokesman said that the new leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom, would be making a statement about the date of the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech in due course. The spokesman would not say anymore, but he would not confirm that it will go ahead as planned on Monday next week. It may be that the government has decided to delay it until it has agreed its deal with the DUP. A delay would be most unusual - and rather irksome for Queen Elizabeth II, who is expecting to spend most of next week at the Royal Ascot races. Sterling has fallen against every other major currency today, according to Bloomberg, which explains: The pound fell against all its Group-of-10 peers on the prospect of an unstable coalition government heading into Brexit talks with the European Union in a week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. Betfair reckon there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a one-in-three chance that Britain will hold a second general election this year. Here are the latest odds: Year of Next General Election 2017 3.0 (2/1 or 33% chance) 2018 4.0 (3/1 or 25% chance) 2019 4.9 (4/1) 2020 8.8 (8/1) 2021 9.4 (17/2) 2022 7.6 (13/2) They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also provided some odds for Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely replacement: Next Conservative Leader Boris Johnson 3.4 (12/5) David Davis 4.7 (7/2) Amber Rudd 9.0 (8/1) Ruth Davidson 10.0 (9/1) Phillip Hammond 17.5 (16/1) Michael Gove 23.0 (22/1) Speculation that Theresa May might change her Brexit stance is propping up sterling, says Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The rise of softer Brexit speculation is another reason why the pound has not declined more sharply following the UK general election result\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More here: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unstable political situation means the pound will remain volatile for some times, says investment bank JP Morgan. It told its clients that: The UK delivered another electoral surprise this week with the Conservative party losing its majority in Parliament. This means the Conservatives would be reliant on the Northern Irish DUP with its 10 seats to establish a thin parliamentary majority. This raises questions about PM May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to deliver a hard Brexit given the desire in Northern Ireland for a frictionless border with the Republic of Ireland. For sterling rates, this means markets are likely to be caught between the opposing forces of political instability associated with a Conservative minority government, and a potential softening of the Brexit stance. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy report on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election has knocked the pound, says Neil Wilson of ETX Capital: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sentiment around the pound took a bit of a dive in morning trading in London. After treading water around $1.274 for the last few days since the election, cable eased back below the $1.27 handle after Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warned that the election result is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccredit negative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the UK. This seems to have woken traders from their slumber and the pound is on the defensive as we start the week. It wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take much bad news from the UK political scene to force cable to take another leg lower. Still there is plenty of bid to catch on the way down as the dips are being viewed as short-term buying opportunities. Sentiment remains pretty bearish. As Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s points out there is a chance of a softer Brexit but we must also think there is a heightened risk of a cliff-edge exit from the EU.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sterling is also dropping against the euro, losing 0.6% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1322. On Friday it hit an eight-month low of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1285 before recovering a little. Update: the pound had now dropped below $1.27, towards the eight-week low struck on Friday morning as the election results came in. The pound is dipping back towards $1.27, down 0.2% today, as investors analyse these warnings from Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and S&amp;P and wait for developments in Westminster. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says the drop in business confidence, and the slowdown in household spending, are worrying the City: This decline in economic indicators may have been a long time coming, yet with a weakened political mandate and Brexit negotiations about to start, it is likely that we will see the UK continue to struggle. The fallout from the UK election continues and will remain key to expectations for the pound. Newsflash from the Bank of England: Andy Haldane, the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, has been reappointed to the Monetary Policy Committee. That means Haldane will continue to vote on UK interest rates and the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus programme until 2020. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a big surprise, but it is worth noting as Haldane is one of the most dovish members of the committee. Speaking of Brexit delays..... The formal Brexit talks are due to begin on 19 June, the same day as the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech.... Rating agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has also issued a report on the UK election, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not very cheery reading. It is titled: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Election result heightens uncertainty over Brexit negotiations and increases fiscal risks, a credit negative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And it warns that negotiating to leave the EU will now be a more complicated process. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fears that those talks (which are due to start next week) may be delayed, or may not focus on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantive issues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a while as the Conservative Party tries to agree a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is also worried that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national debt will keep rising for longer, as the government wrestles with a slowing economy and the public backlash against austerity. That could be bad for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating, which is currently Aa1 with Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, one notch below AAA. But.... Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also suspects that Theresa May (or her successor) will now steer away from a hard Brexit, which would be good for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating. Here are the key points from the report Inconclusive election outcome will complicate and probably delay Brexit negotiations, a credit negative. The negotiations with the EU were due to begin on 19 June, but we now expect a delay to the start of those negotiations or at least a period during which no substantive issues will be discussed. The time frame for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU in March 2019 remains unchanged, reducing still further the time available to achieve the transition agreement needed to avoid a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit. We expect fiscal risks to increase because consolidation will have a lower priority, a credit negative. In our view, the budget deficit will increase this year and next, as the government reacts to the economic slowdown under way. The election outcome, with significant gains for the Labour Party which had campaigned for increased public spending, will likely be seen as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vote against austerity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The public debt ratio will rise further and for longer than we had expected, placing the UK among the few highly rated European sovereigns whose public debt is still rising. However, the election outcome also means that the government may now consider \u00e2\u20ac\u0153softer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit options, which could be credit positive. While we still expect Brexit to happen and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cliff\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd risk of sudden exit remains, the election result suggests an electoral shift away from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit that the Prime Minister had ostensibly sought. Hence, a move towards \u00e2\u20ac\u0153softer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd versions of Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c potentially with continued access of some sort to the Single Market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c might now be considered. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing why Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is worried about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national debt: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth is likely to be damaged by the current political instability, according to the European chief economist of ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Jean-Michel Six told the AJEF association of financial journalists in Paris that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the time being, the outlook remains negative.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In terms of the outlook for growth, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that things are not going in the right direction. This latest bit of instability can only weaken the business environment and consumer confidence,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thanks to Reuters for the quotes....and this chart, showing how the UK economy has deteriorated recently: The shock election result has fuelled speculation that Britain may aim for a less \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit than Theresa May had planned. Kalum Pickering of Berenberg Bank explains: On the continent, most observers have taken the UK election result as a rebuke of Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard Brexit rhetoric of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal is better than a bad deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd kind. For example, EU Commission \u00c3\u2013ttinger has expressed hope that the UK may now agree to stay in the Customs Union and the Common Market, possibly by joining EFTA. To remain in the Common Market and thus maintain preferential access to the EU27 market (except for some financial products where regulators will insist that some activities have to be carried out under the direct sway of EU regulators), the UK would have to accept the free movement of labour and continue to pay into the EU budget like EFTA members do. Whether or not a Tory-led government could agree to that remains a very open question, though, to put it mildly. Indeed! And in the last few minutes, Brexit secretary David Davis has played down the idea that the government could soften its stance - insisting that leaving the EU meant leaving the single market. More in our Politics Live blog: Buzzfeed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alberto Nardelli tweets: Traders will be watching Wall Street nervously when it opens later today, to see if technology stocks keep falling. Apple fell by 4% on Friday, while Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook all shed 3% - wiping almost $100bn off their market value. The selloff comes after a long surge in tech stocks, so investors are wondering if the rally is over. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says other assets could be spooked.... Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell off in some of the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest tech names was sharp and severe on Friday. But was this just a bit of profit taking after a note from Goldman Sachs questioned the $600bn increase in some tech firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 market cap in the past year? This is an important question that we need answered as tech stock weakness is having an impact on other growth assets today. The MSCI emerging markets index fell on Friday, yet the Aussie dollar, which is correlated with growth assets, was relatively stable on Monday. The BBC has a good take on the IoD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business confidence survey: The uncertainty caused by the general election has led business confidence to sink \u00e2\u20ac\u0153through the floor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to a lobby group. A snap poll of 700 members of the Institute of Directors found a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dramatic drop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in confidence following the hung parliament. Members saw no clear way to resolve the political impasse quickly, the IoD said. However, it found there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no desire\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for another election this year.... More here: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are a sea of red this morning, as investors digest the tumble in UK business confidence in the last couple of days. Shares are being pulled down by worries over UK politics, and the selloff in the tech sector. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much optimism in the City this morning. Falling around half a percent the UK index found itself back below the 7500 mark, if only just, as the Institute of Directors warned that its members were feeling pretty damn pessimistic about the state of the UK economy in the next 12 months. The pound, meanwhile, neither continued last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline nor substantially recovered any of those election-losses, opening 0.1% higher against the dollar and flat against the euro. The FTSE 250 index, which is more UK-focused than the FTSE 100, has dropped by 50 points (or 0.25%) in early trading to 19,719. The IoD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy warning on business confidence is helping to keep a lid on the pound this morning. Sterling is hovering around $1.274, close to Friday night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. It tumbled by over two cents when the election exit polls came out on Thursday night. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, warns that the pound is vulnerable to political uncertainty, as prime minister May tries to cling onto power. With Theresa May scrambling to repair the self-inflicted damage suffered as a result of the election, there remains a huge amount of uncertainty around her position and with only a week to go before Brexit talks with the EU begin, I feel there may be a few more twists to come yet. May has not delivered the strong and stable government she wanted and instead looks weak and vulnerable. I find it hard to see how she recovers from this. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets agrees, saying: Sentiment remains dented by politics following the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hung parliament and shift in the balance of UK political power. European stock markets have opened in the red, with the FTSE 100 losing 27 points (or 0.4%). Technology stocks are the biggest fallers, following a selloff on Wall Street on Friday night. Manish Singh of CrossBridge Capital, an investment advisory firm, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprised that business confidence has fallen since the UK election. He says many business leaders are now pondering the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister, after he smashed expectations and gained 32 seats. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Singh says: If you are a business, you really need to start thinking \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhat is in the Labour manifesto?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.... It will have some businesses worrying about Mr Corbyn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manifesto included raising income tax on those earning over \u00c2\u00a380,00 per year, increasing corporation tax, and renationalising the water companies, as well as free childcare, ending the freeze on welfare benefits and abolishing tuition fees. Singh says political instability can deter businesses from investing, especially when the Brexit talks are also hanging over them. But he also agrees that younger voters are right too feel aggrieved, as yound people in Europe will be poorer than previous generations. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European stock markets are set to fall this morning, as evidence piles up that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mounting political uncertainty is hurting the economy. The Institute of Directors have issued a stark warning that business optimism has plunged after Theresa May lost her House of Commons majority last week. A new survey of IoD members found that 57% are either quite pessimistic or very pessimistic about the UK economy over the next 12 months. Just a fifth described themselves as optimistic -- which gives a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnet confidence\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 score of minus 37. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a serious deterioration compared to the previous month, when 34% were optimistic and 37% pessimistic. The poll, conducted over the weekend, found that many business leaders are alarmed by the prospect of a hung parliament, just as the Brexit negotiations begin. Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, says British politicians need to urgently refocus on the state of the economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if not addressed immediately \u00e2\u20ac\u201c be disastrous for the UK economy. The needs of business and discussion of the economy were largely absent from the campaign, but this crash in confidence shows how urgently that must change in the new government. This chart might focus a few minds in Westminster: The IoD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only cause for concern this morning. Visa have reported that household spending fell last month, for the first time in almost four years. It highlights how consumers are being squeezed by rising inflation and political uncertainty, and cutting back on non-essential items. As things stand this morning, May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grip on Number 10 is looking precarious, with insiders saying she cannot lead the Conservative Party into another election. Yesterday she was savaged as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dead woman walking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by former chancellor George Osborne (who seems to be enjoying his new career in journalism). But the game isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over, yet. Later today May will appeal to her MPs for support, in an attempt to remain as prime minister. Our political editor Heather Stewart explains: The prime minister is expected to signal to her parliamentary colleagues that she will run her government in a more collegiate, less controlling way, after sacrificing her two closest advisers, Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy. With many backbenchers blaming May for the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor performance at the polls, one senior Conservative said she would have to give a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153barnstorming\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd performance at the meeting of the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1922 committee of MPs to hold on to her job. Spread-betting firm IG expect the main European markets to fall by up to 0.5% this morning. While Britain is gripped by May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crisis-of-her-own-making, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Emmanuel Macron is showing us how to lead a country. The French president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s En Marche party is on track for a landslide win in parliamentary elections, giving him enough muscle to start pushing through economic reforms. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very little in the economic calendar today, alas.",

                "bodyText":"Amazon, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful online retailer, has taken a giant stride into traditional retailing, spending $13.7bn (\u00c2\u00a310.7bn) to take over organic food chain Whole Foods Market. The all-cash deal could be game-changing for the traditional supermarket business. Amazon has long had ambitions to move into the grocery business and launched its food delivery service, Fresh, in the US 10 years ago. It introduced the service in the UK last year after signing a wholesale deal with British supermarket Morrisons. Amazon is the fourth biggest business in the US and accounts for 43% of online sales there. Whole Foods, founded in 1980, has about 460 stores, including nine in the UK where it has operated since 2004. Supermarket share prices in the US and Europe went into reverse after news of the deal, while Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock rose 3.5%, taking it close to $1,000 a share. The online retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is close to overtaking Bill Gates as the richest person in the world. Walmart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares dived 6%, wiping about $13bn off the value of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest retailer as the deal ramped up pressure on traditional chains already hit by a rapid change in shopping habits.

Today that changed: Amazon has moved squarely onto the turf of traditional supermarkets and poses a much more significant threat.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Until now, Amazon has had a limited impact on the grocery market. In the US, it still only accounts for less than 0.5% of grocery spending, according to GlobalData.

It is understood that following talks with potential suitors, which included the Co-op and Morrisons, Nisa is poised to recommend Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to its members as its preferred bidder.</p> <p>Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/27/tesco-budgens-londis-booker-supermarket-wholesaler\">takeover of Booker</a>, the wholesaler behind the Londis and Budgens chains, has set a cat among the pigeons in a market where around 80% of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 41,000-plus convenience stores are still independent or belong to buying groups such as Nisa or Costcutter - known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153symbol groups\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the industry. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/03/sainsburys-considers-franchise-deals-to-expand-local-stores-network\">Sainsbury's weighs up franchise deals to boost Local network</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Booker has around 5,400 stores in its network, which trade under the Premier, Londis, Budgens and Family Shopper brands. Tesco, meanwhile, operates nearly 2,500 convenience stores under its Express and One Stop banners. Tesco and Booker say the deal, which is the subject of a competition investigation, is not about stores but cashing in on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd food market which is growing faster than retail sales as more Britons opt to eat out. </p> <p>A decision to sell up is likely to cause controversy among Nisa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s members, because its raison d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122etre is to help them compete with supermarket giants such as Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Nisa describes itself as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153family of independent grocers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and when it launched in the late 70s, the goal of the Northern Independents Supermarket Association was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to protect the interests of independents against the insurgence of the national supermarket chains\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. </p> <p>Nisa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1,400 members operate 2,500 shops, and some entrepreneurs run small chains.

According to last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual report, the retailer has around 1,400 members who hold between 1 and 250 shares each. According to the 2016 annual report, there are just under 60,000 shares in issue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/27/tesco-budgens-londis-booker-supermarket-wholesaler\">Tesco to buy Budgens and Londis owner Booker in \u00c2\u00a33.7bn deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nisa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unusual ownership structure could block any deal, however, because 75% of members, many of whom are fiercely proud of their independence, must back it. They rejected bids from Nisa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arch rival Costcutter in both 2006 and 2009.

                "bodyText":"Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is closing in on a \u00c2\u00a3130m deal to acquire the convenience chain Nisa as the industry rushes to consolidate following Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a33.7bn swoop on rival Booker. The board of Nisa, which is owned by its shopkeeper members, recently hired bankers to advise on its strategic options in light of the proposed Tesco-Booker alliance, which some regard as a tectonic shift in UK convenience retailing. It is understood that following talks with potential suitors, which included the Co-op and Morrisons, Nisa is poised to recommend Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to its members as its preferred bidder. Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover of Booker, the wholesaler behind the Londis and Budgens chains, has set a cat among the pigeons in a market where around 80% of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 41,000-plus convenience stores are still independent or belong to buying groups such as Nisa or Costcutter - known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153symbol groups\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the industry. Booker has around 5,400 stores in its network, which trade under the Premier, Londis, Budgens and Family Shopper brands. Tesco, meanwhile, operates nearly 2,500 convenience stores under its Express and One Stop banners. Tesco and Booker say the deal, which is the subject of a competition investigation, is not about stores but cashing in on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd food market which is growing faster than retail sales as more Britons opt to eat out. A decision to sell up is likely to cause controversy among Nisa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s members, because its raison d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122etre is to help them compete with supermarket giants such as Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Nisa describes itself as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153family of independent grocers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and when it launched in the late 70s, the goal of the Northern Independents Supermarket Association was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to protect the interests of independents against the insurgence of the national supermarket chains\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Nisa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1,400 members operate 2,500 shops, and some entrepreneurs run small chains. The group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest customer is the McColl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s convenience chain. The sale of Nisa, which would include members receiving a payout, would be akin to a demutualisation. According to last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual report, the retailer has around 1,400 members who hold between 1 and 250 shares each. According to the 2016 annual report, there are just under 60,000 shares in issue. Nisa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unusual ownership structure could block any deal, however, because 75% of members, many of whom are fiercely proud of their independence, must back it. They rejected bids from Nisa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arch rival Costcutter in both 2006 and 2009. Industry sources suggest it is not a done deal yet from Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s point of view because it is yet to carry out due diligence. Nisa members own their own stores, and their potential trading relationship with a Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s-owned entity remains unclear. Some suggest it could form the basis of the supermarket\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed franchise network.

Indeed, Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s purchase of Argos last year already looks a smart effort to get ahead of the game. But investors also know that Aldi and Lidl destroyed profit margins in the sector, slowly but steadily. An Amazonian attack \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when it arrives \u00e2\u20ac\u201c threatens to be similarly relentless.</p> <h2>Good news on pensions: auto-enrolment</h2> <p>News stories about the future of pensions tend to come under the category of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all doomed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, peppered with references to deficits and timebombs. How refreshing, then, to see some strikingly positive figures on pensions emerge last week.</p> <p>The number of private-sector workers saving into a pension has rocketed from 55% to 78% of all employees in just the past four years. Among the young, the number is even more impressive; just 24% of 22-to-29-year-olds in the private sector were saving for a pension in 2012, but this almost tripled to 68% by 2016.</p> <p>The reason? The quietly successful roll-out of a gigantic government programme, supported by all major political, called auto-enrolment. Employers now have to offer a pension, put their staff into it, and pay money in. Unlike Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state-mandated scheme, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not compulsory for employees to pay in, but opt-out rates have been \u00e2\u20ac\u2039thankfully \u00e2\u20ac\u2039low. Only one in 10 employees say they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to make any contributions.</p> <p>The first test of auto-enrolment was administrative: opening millions of accounts, often with low contributions, and keeping costs capped. By any measure, the scheme has passed.</p> <p>The next test will be increasing the contribution rate. No one pretends that the contributions into auto-enrolled pensions are anything other than puny. Currently, employers only have to pay in 1% of salary, and employees another 1%. Between now and 2019 the contribution rate will be stepped up to 8%, with employees paying 3% of that.</p> <p>Yet even when we reach 8%, the sums still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t add up. Experts say that you need to put aside at least 15% of salary to fund a decent retirement. We also need to find ways to push self-employed workers into the scheme.</p> <p>So far, auto-enrolment has caused near-zero political controversy. But now politicians need to face up to more painful choices. We need to step the contributions up to 15%, and acknowledge to employers, and employees, that this is going to hurt.</p> <h2>Doing the decent thing<br></h2> <p>At a time when the Grenfell Tower fire has made corporate&#xa0;accountability a political issue, it is refreshing to see a company acknowledge the impact of a tragedy involving its own operations.</p> <p>Investigators have not concluded exactly why a FirstGroup-operated tram was speeding so fast when it derailed on a sharp bend in Croydon last November, killing seven people. But in the meantime, FirstGroup boss Tim O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Toole has had his \u00c2\u00a3723,415 bonus withheld. It is not exactly a Gandhi-esque sacrifice: the decision leaves him with \u00c2\u00a31.26m in salary and benefits. And should the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tram subsidiary emerge in the clear, O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Toole will receive that bonus in shares in 2020 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which\u00e2\u20ac\u2039, if he can start to drag his ailing company upwards, could well be worth a lot more then.</p> <p>Yet viewed beside the buck-passing and absent leadership with which London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent disaster has been met, this is, at least, the decent&#xa0;thing.</p>",

An Amazonian attack \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when it arrives \u00e2\u20ac\u201c threatens to be similarly relentless. Good news on pensions: auto-enrolment News stories about the future of pensions tend to come under the category of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all doomed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, peppered with references to deficits and timebombs. How refreshing, then, to see some strikingly positive figures on pensions emerge last week. The number of private-sector workers saving into a pension has rocketed from 55% to 78% of all employees in just the past four years. Among the young, the number is even more impressive; just 24% of 22-to-29-year-olds in the private sector were saving for a pension in 2012, but this almost tripled to 68% by 2016. The reason? The quietly successful roll-out of a gigantic government programme, supported by all major political, called auto-enrolment. Employers now have to offer a pension, put their staff into it, and pay money in. Unlike Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state-mandated scheme, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not compulsory for employees to pay in, but opt-out rates have been thankfully low. Only one in 10 employees say they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to make any contributions. The first test of auto-enrolment was administrative: opening millions of accounts, often with low contributions, and keeping costs capped. By any measure, the scheme has passed. The next test will be increasing the contribution rate. No one pretends that the contributions into auto-enrolled pensions are anything other than puny. Currently, employers only have to pay in 1% of salary, and employees another 1%. Between now and 2019 the contribution rate will be stepped up to 8%, with employees paying 3% of that. Yet even when we reach 8%, the sums still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t add up. Experts say that you need to put aside at least 15% of salary to fund a decent retirement. We also need to find ways to push self-employed workers into the scheme. So far, auto-enrolment has caused near-zero political controversy. But now politicians need to face up to more painful choices. We need to step the contributions up to 15%, and acknowledge to employers, and employees, that this is going to hurt. Doing the decent thing At a time when the Grenfell Tower fire has made corporate accountability a political issue, it is refreshing to see a company acknowledge the impact of a tragedy involving its own operations. Investigators have not concluded exactly why a FirstGroup-operated tram was speeding so fast when it derailed on a sharp bend in Croydon last November, killing seven people. But in the meantime, FirstGroup boss Tim O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Toole has had his \u00c2\u00a3723,415 bonus withheld. It is not exactly a Gandhi-esque sacrifice: the decision leaves him with \u00c2\u00a31.26m in salary and benefits. And should the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tram subsidiary emerge in the clear, O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Toole will receive that bonus in shares in 2020 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which, if he can start to drag his ailing company upwards, could well be worth a lot more then. Yet viewed beside the buck-passing and absent leadership with which London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent disaster has been met, this is, at least, the decent thing.",

Like Seattle, Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main base, Austin has boomed and gentrified, a process boosted by the wealth of ambitious technology outfits whose global-minded corporate cultures can seem to chafe with the cities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cherished quirky, independent characters.</p> <p>When Mackey was starting out four decades ago, the metropolitan area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population was under 600,000.

A shelf-stocker at the Whole Foods flagship store said he and colleagues were waiting for more information before drawing any conclusions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As of now, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not worried,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be fine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unless something drastic happens, but we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know until it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approved in a few months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The shelf-stocker said he hoped the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benefits package, generous for the sector, would not be affected. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Here it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great, I get full benefits and everything,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd another worker said, adding that he had heard negative reports about the work environment at an Amazon warehouse but was not worried about potential job losses if Bezos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drone-loving company pursues a more automated approach. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m more just worried about general changes and how the salary works and benefits,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It seems the CEO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remaining and all the administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remaining so it shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already said they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to keep the same message and stuff, which is I guess what really matters in the end, because that is the whole point of the store.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIt changed the culture here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Austin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s progress has mirrored, and is linked to, one of its most important companies: from small, idealistic and provincial to big, moneyed and internationally renowned, with inevitable growing pains. Like Seattle, Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main base, Austin has boomed and gentrified, a process boosted by the wealth of ambitious technology outfits whose global-minded corporate cultures can seem to chafe with the cities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cherished quirky, independent characters. When Mackey was starting out four decades ago, the metropolitan area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population was under 600,000. Now it is over two million. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whole Foods has blown up,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Athena Hathaway Meskimen, a 28-year-old selling all-natural popsicles at the farmer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen it get big here.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She also works for a local hibiscus tea company that sells its drinks through Whole Foods. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153From that perspective I think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done a pretty good job of trying to integrate [small businesses],\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. Gage, 35, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It changed the culture here and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll ever go back. I think it promoted early food culture here because now, while there are a lot of fine dining options here in Austin, a lot of emphasis on farm to table, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really exist until I would say 1995, here in Austin. I think they were part of the impetus, that and also the influx of people from California, with the high-tech boom in the late 90s.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dell is headquartered in the region; Google expanded its Austin presence in 2015, the same year Amazon moved into a big corporate space in the city. It currently has nearly 200 open jobs there. Though Whole Foods has hit turbulence as bigger rivals have expanded their organic offerings, Austin at least is expanding its population of young professionals likely to be drawn to the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ethos and products, and unlikely to balk at the cost. At the farmer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market on Saturday, as shoppers browsed cakes, jams, fruit and vegetables in the searing heat, a guitar band strummed mellow tunes that helped mask construction noise from surrounding blocks. The market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three-dozen little white canopies were dwarfed by cranes and shiny new residential towers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the balance continually adjusts as more and more people come to the city,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Benjamin Weaver, a 32-year-old pouring ginger beer made from locally sourced ingredients, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153especially since a lot of newcomers are, I guess, a bit more moneyed, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of tech coming into the city and that kind of drives up everything. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You see it in the real estate market, you see it in prices of food, you see it in the number of restaurants. Everything becomes a bit more pricey.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Huge corporations might have the potential to destroy small businesses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but their heft can also create conditions where boutique retailers can flourish. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Small operations like this may not have thrived as well 10 or 15 years ago,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Weaver said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure you could still be around but I feel like there is more money in the city now and more people willing to spend on pricier things.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

There is still uncertainty about the scope and consequences that Brexit will have on the economy. (Let us not forget that Brexit has not happened yet!).

They saw their standards of living deteriorate since the late 1970s, while at the same time salaries at the top of the distribution rocketed. Inequality is a critical issue in the UK and the West that needs to be addressed.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap. Britain has a new interest rate policymaker, after the government appointed LSE professor Silvana Tenreyro to the Bank of England. City experts have welcomed appointment of Tenreyro, who studied at Harvard and has Argentinian, Italian and UK citizenship, to the Monetary Policy Committee. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been described as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit critic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, given her concerns over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU and the impact of rising inequality. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what the papers are saying. Economists reckon she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less likely to vote for an interest rate rise than her predecessor, Kristin Forbes (one of three MPC members who wanted to raise borrowing costs this week). European stock markets are enjoying their best day in two months, after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s French parliamentary elections proved another triumph for Emmanuel Macron. Paris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC index has lead the way, up 1.2%, with other markets also gaining ground. The euro faded, though, after a small bounce when the results came in last night. Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s La R\u00c3\u00a9publique En Marche (La REM) party, and its centre-right ally Modem, won 350 of the 577 lower house seats between them. This leaves Macron with a clear mandate to reshuffle his cabinet and implement economic reforms, say City experts. Some also predict protests from unions, though. Sterling has remained steady, as UK and EU officials began the Brexit talks in Brussels. The pound is hovering around $1.2765, down just 0.1% today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to know whether Britain will \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchave its cake and eat it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, or end up swallowing humble pie. But we do know that the two sides have had cake for lunch - in what looks like some tongue-in-cheek humour by the EU side. The Brexit talks haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t caused any alarm in the City, yet. The FTSE 100 has gained 65 points, or almost 1%, in a sweltering session. Chris Beauchamp at IG says: The long-awaited beginning of discussions between the UK and the EU has been greeted with an impressive bounce for both UK and European stocks. The rally today has been broad-based, with European markets seeing a return of buyers after weeks of indecision. An ongoing fall in the euro is certainly helping to make life easier for European stocks, while further sterling weakness is helping to lift the FTSE 100. The summer is supposed to be a tough period for stocks, with gains fleeting in duration, but the solid pickup in risk appetite at the beginning of the week is very encouraging, despite the lightness of the macro and corporate calendars. US tech stocks are also recovering from last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff, with Amazon hitting a fresh record high. The rally may not be over yet.... That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Professor Costas Milas, of the Management School at the University of Liverpool, tells me that Silvana Tenreyro is a well-respected economist with a deep understanding of monetary policy. He believes Tenreyro could take a dovish approach at the Bank England, if the UK economic picture deteriorates. Professor Milas writes: She has pretty robust knowledge of monetary policy issues and, in fact she has researched on this very area finding that (in the US) monetary policy is more powerful in expansions than in recessions. So, if she believes her work (which I think she does) and to the extent that changes in the policy rate have limited impact in a recession, then central banks will be more likely to need to resort to other (unconventional) monetary policy measures to achieve the desired expansionary effect! Hence, she will turn out a dove if she believes that a slowdown is imminent! In other news... Argentina is planning to issue 100-year bonds to the market. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister has announced the plan over Twitter today: According to Bloomberg, the debt will yield a tasty 8.25% - a much better rate than you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get from most other government bonds. But investors should tread carefully. Argentina has defaulted several times in the past, most famously during the financial crisis of 2001. Bloomberg has more details. The Financial Times says the government have appointed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a staunch critic of Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee. [Professor Tenreyno\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] views on Brexit are that it will damage the UK economy and she has said this in public \u00e2\u20ac\u201d in her response to the FT survey and in signing a letter from economists urging a vote to remain in the EU, ahead of the referendum last year. In response to the FT New Year survey she said her pessimism about Brexit had not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moved much\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd since the EU referendum. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it will have a negative impact on the UK economy and Europe more generally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she added. She added that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit of leaving the single market and the customs union might substantially reduce immigration. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The effects on the UK economy will certainly be negative \u00e2\u20ac\u201d many firms will need to rethink and reorganise production as they lose talented workers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Independent describes her views on monetary policy as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunconservative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. In July 2015, she said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reforming the monetary system to allow negative policy interest rates will equip the [Bank of England] with an additional tool to face potential crises in the future\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She also said that it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worth experimenting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with an increase in the minimum wage and that this could help stimulate the wider economy. Further, she opposed the plans of the former Chancellor, George Osborne, to run a budget surplus by 2020, saying that this consolidation was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too brisk and could hamper a healthy recovery\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Reuters call Tenreyro a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trade-focused economist\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, who will join the Bank at a critical time. She will replace the strongest advocate for a rate hike on the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee, meaning economists will scrutinise her opinions even more closely than usual. Tenreyro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work has focused on issues including trade and wage growth, both of which are important factors for the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking as Britain prepares to leave the European Union and as pay increases have fallen behind inflation. Technology shares are leading the rally on Wall Street today. Amazon are up 1.44%, as traders continue to applaud its takeover of Whole Foods, while Apple have gained 1.7%. Newsflash: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones industrial average has hit a record high at the start of trading in New York. The Dow gained 70 points to 21,454, up 0.33%. The Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 are also climbing higher at the open. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Silvana Tenreyro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CV is most impressive. Seven pages long, it includes more than twenty positions (not including her current job at the LSE), a dozen honours, grants and awards, and 17 published papers. Veteran City economist George Magnus is also a fan: Harvard economics professor Robert Barro has told Reuters that Silvana Tenreyro is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgreat appointment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the Bank of England. Barro supervised Tenreyro when she was studying for her PhD (which she got in 2002), and says she is very knowledgeable about \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceconomic fluctuations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and the role that monetary policy can play: Ben Chu of the Independent has spotted that professor Tenreyro was critical of the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity programme..... ...and in favour of negative interest rates being imposed in a crisis: Some more snap analysis from the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Giles (based on her answers to the CFM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surveys) Silvana Tenreyro has argued that Britain needs a new industrial policy to help it cope with Brexit. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to a regular survey by the Centre For Macroeconomics, who poll a range of economic experts. In February, Tenreyro said: Brexit will change many aspects of the UK economy. There is still uncertainty about the scope and consequences that Brexit will have on the economy. (Let us not forget that Brexit has not happened yet!). I think the UK needs to think about industrial policy among many other policies. It is far from clear, however, that industrial policy will solve the problems the economy will likely face or that it will be enough to boost long term growth. The shape industrial policy takes will matter a lot. With industrial policy, the devil is in the details. And last July, she said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153misleading politicians\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had encouraged people to vote for Brexit. Asked for the most likely reason that a majority of UK voters went against the near unanimous advice of the economics profession, she replied: Immigration certainly played a role in the exit vote, and many voters (partly encouraged by misleading politicians) thought immigration was to be blamed for their problems, while those problems are more complex and date longer. Skill-biased technological progress, globalization, and the fall of unions have created winners and losers, and the latter have not been compensated for their losses. They saw their standards of living deteriorate since the late 1970s, while at the same time salaries at the top of the distribution rocketed. Inequality is a critical issue in the UK and the West that needs to be addressed. Brexit was mostly an angry vote against the lack of progress of the bottom half. More details here. Andreas Wallstr\u00c3\u00b6m, chief analyst at Nordea Markets, thinks the Treasury have made an astute hire: Andy Bruce of Reuters flags up that Tenreyro signed a letter in May 2016 warning that Brexit would harm the economy. Chris Giles of the Financial Times points out that she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change her view after the referendum.... Jordan Rochester of Nomura reckons that Tenreyro is less likely to push for an interest rate rise than the outgoing Kristen Forbes, who voted for a rate hike last week. Relative to the hawkish person she is replacing (Forbes) and the view that new members do not usually jump straight into a bias, we would assume a slight swing to a more dovish vote. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am delighted to appoint Professor Silvana Tenreyro as the new external member of the Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of England. I am confident that Professor Tenreyro will be a strong addition to the MPC, bringing a wealth of economic experience and academic rigour to the Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deliberations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: Britain has a new interest rate setter -- London School of Economics professor Silvana Tenreyro. Professor Tenreyro has just been named as the next external member of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). She will join the MPC on 1 July, replacing Kristin Forbes whose term expires on 30 June 2017. Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, says Tenreyro has important skills in the dynamics of the labour market -- an important issue, given Britain is struggling with weak productivity and falling real wages. Carney says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am delighted to welcome Silvana Tenreyro to the Monetary Policy Committee and am very much looking forward to working with her. Her extensive and varied academic experience \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on the monetary transmission mechanism, the dynamics of productivity, trade, housing issues as well as wage dynamics, to name just a few \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will be invaluable to the Committee as it seeks to promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom through maintaining monetary stability.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tenreyro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CV shows that she has British, Italian and Argentine citizenships. She has a degree from the National University of Tucuman, Argentina, and a PhD from Harvard University. She lists her academic interest as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Macroeconomics, growth, macro-development, monetary economics, international economics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She has written academic papers on a wide range of issues including the impact of monetary policy, wage dynamics and currency unions (all important issues of the day). Shares in almost every major company listed on the Paris stock market have risen this morning. Thirty six members of the CAC40 index of blue-chip French companies are up, with just four lagging behind. This means the CAC is holding onto this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1% jump; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently 35 points higher at 4173. Industrial firms are leading the rally, including steelmaker ArcelorMittal and aeroplane maker Airbus. Banks, such as BNP Paribas, Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale,and Credit Agricole, are also gaining ground. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, gives the credit to Emmanuel Macron: European equity markets are in positive territory this morning as the political success of Emmanuel Macron in France has boosted investor confidence. Mr Macron was tipped to gain a majority and that he did, and traders welcomed the news as political stability in Europe is a welcome change. With his parliamentary majority secured, Emmanuel Macron has flown to the Paris Air show in a military transport jet. The French president landed at the Bourget airfield in an Airbus A400-M military transport plane to launch the aviation showcase. His arrival was followed by a flypast by the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest passenger plane, the Airbus A380, and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aerial display team. Reuters suggests that Macron was keen to signal his support for Airbus: The ceremony lent high-level support to two ambitious European aerospace projects tarnished by problems in recent years: the A400M because of chronic cost overruns and delays and the A380 because of weak sales that threaten its future. The Paris Air show is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest air show, and a major event for the industry. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains what to expect: Since 1909 it has been held every two years at Le Bourget Airport in north Paris \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where Charles Lindbergh landed after making the first solo, non-stop transatlantic flight in 1927, between New York and Paris. Crowds will be wowed by spectacular flying displays, but in business terms the 52nd air show is likely to be a more subdued affair. Aviation experts say aircraft makers will bag far fewer orders than in previous years, as low oil prices have relieved pressure on airlines to replace older planes. In any case, Airbus and Boeing have been struggling to deliver due to problems with their supply chains. As usual, the two arch rivals will be seeking to outdo each other at the air show. Boeing will reveal the new 737 Max-10, an upgraded version of its bestselling single-aisle 737 plane. The American company is also expected to unveil plans for a new highly efficient medium-sized aircraft. Airbus, for its part, will unveil plans for an enhanced A380, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A380plus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with new large winglets that will save fuel. Airbus and Boeing face new competitors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Comac C-919 and Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s United Aircraft Corporation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MC-21 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which will not be at the show. A new arrival at the event is Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which will show off Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first commercial aircraft in 50 years, the MRJ regional jet, which has been beset with delays. In another highlight, Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Embraer is showing three aircraft \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the military transport plane KC-390, the commercial E195 airliner and the Legacy 450 business jet. But when the event opens to the public at the end of the week, the Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jet looks to dazzle spectators with its circus acrobatics. Back in Brussels, David Davis and Michel Barnier have shaken hands for the cameras as the Brexit negotiations begin. Both men struck a positive tone before the press, Davis pledged to do everything possible to achieve a deal that works for all citizens, while Barnier said he hopes to agree a timetable for the negotiations today: My colleague Jennifer Rankin has the details: Our Politics Live blog will be tracking all the action: Just in: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building sector outperformed the rest of Europe in April. New figures from Eurostat show that French construction output jumped by 3.5% during April, after a 5.3% slump in March. Across the whole eurozone, output rose by just 0.3% month-on-month, with housebuilding activity picking up but civil engineering contracting. Output across the wider European Union was flat month-on-month. Eurostat explains: Among Member States for which data are available, the highest increases in production in construction were recorded in Sweden (+3.8%), France (+3.5%) and the Czech Republic (+1.6%), and the largest decreases in Romania (-7.7%), Italy (-4.1%) and Hungary (-2.6%). The pound is crept back over $1.28 this morning, up 0.25%. Traders are watching events in Brussels, as David Davis and Michel Barnier begin negotiating Brexit. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect any major developments The UK position is as clear as mud\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 beyond growing signs that the UK wants free trade without being part of the customs union or conceding grounds on border controls. Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably range-bound. Any rally triggered by \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hopes is probably temporary. Julien Manceaux, senior France economist at ING, predicts that Macron will kick off his most \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unpopular\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd labour reforms in the first few months of his presidency. That would let him capitalise on his honeymoon with voters; even so, there is still likely to be resistance to cutting workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 protections and entitlements. As Manceaux puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The mandate for reform is not extremely strong for Mr Macron who could hence endure strong civil opposition, especially to his labour and pension reforms. (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s via the FT) Here are the official results from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s French parliamentary election, showing how Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s REM party, and his allies in the Modem party, won a substantial majority. The French stock market has jumped by almost 1% at the start of trading, as Parisian traders applaud Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win. The CAC 40 index has gained 39 points, or 0.95%, to 4177, which is a two-week high. Other markets are also showing healthy gains, on relief that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new president won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t face a deadlocked parliament (there had been worries that his new party wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to win a majority). In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 52 points to 7515. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: The positive opening comes as traders welcome another Macron victory in France, this time in Parliamentary elections, which give hope to him passing reforms that can help both the French economy and thus Europe, There is also optimism about a positive start to UK-EU Brexit negotiations which kick off today in Brussels. But.... the poor turnout in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election is causing some analysts to question whether Macron has really energised France. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services warns: The focus will be on how French President Macron turns words into action after securing a solid parliamentary majority, though not as large as opinion polls had suggested, and with a very poor 43.5% turnout underlining a great deal of scepticism among the general public as a whole. Emmanuel Macron now has a free hand to drive his policies through, say Royal Bank of Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategists. We reiterate our view that there is no real opposition to the proposed economic reforms left on the political side - with only the street and unions likely to oppose the measures. The scale of En Marche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory gives Macron an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incredible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd position to push reforms through, says Elliot Hentov, head of policy and research for EMEA at State Street Global Advisors. But there could still be protests on the streets, he adds, against Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to make it easier to lay off workers or cut wages. Macron will enjoy one of the largest majorities in French history. A large portion of these new parliamentarians are new to national politics and this reinforces the sense that a wholesale political revolution has taken place. Most importantly, it affirms that Macron will have incredible leeway in pushing his domestic agenda. Markets should therefore expect that labour reforms should pass, as should changes to the tax code and pension system. The impact could be structural and two-fold, both in boosting French investment and productivity gains as well as in setting the stage for more audacious reforms of the Eurozone. Nonetheless, Macron will still face public hostility to his reforms, possibly in the streets but not in parliament, but after yesterday, that will likely be expressed in burning tires rather than parliamentary machinations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With an absolute majority comes absolute responsibility, says Le Figaro, as it splashes on Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relief in European financial markets this morning after French president Emmanuel Macron won another landmark victory. The La R\u00c3\u00a9publique en Marche (La REM) party, and its centrist allies the Democratic Movement (Modem), have secured a large majority in the French parliament, claiming around 350 of the 577 seats up for grabs. This gives Macron the muscle he needs to implement his plans to change French labour law, and overhaul unemployment benefits and pensions. Getting those reforms enacted will be a struggle - as previous French leaders have discovered. Investors, though, will be pleased to see that Macron is now in a position to push through the promises he made during his successful presidential bid this year. That relief has sent all Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main stock markets up in early trading, by around 0.75% (full details to follow). Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government spokesman Christophe Castaner, said the new party (created less than two years ago) now has to deliver: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The French people have given us a clear majority, but they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to give us a blank cheque. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a responsibility. The real victory will be in five years time when things will have really changed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a strong majority, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a will for things to change.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, there are also concerns that the turnout slumped to a record low - showing how many voters are disenchanted with politics. The pound could be skittish today, as the formal talks over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union begin (nearly a year after the historic Brexit referendum). David Davis, UK Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, will sit down with Michel Barnier, the European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Negotiator, to lay out their opening positions. Given Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fragile political situation, EU leaders fear that talks will collapse - resulting in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brutal Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Guardian reports this morning that: As officials began gathering in Brussels on Sunday night, the long-awaited start of negotiations was overshadowed by political chaos back in Westminster, where chancellor Philip Hammond warned that failing to strike a deal would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a very, very bad outcome\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The EU side fears that, in reality, the British government will struggle to maintain any position without falling apart in the coming months, because, without support from the Democratic Unionist party, May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiating hand is limited. There are also concerns that any DUP backing to give May a majority in the House of Commons would come with strings attached. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit fears that the talks could be tough: Also coming up, a new healthcheck on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders and the start of the Paris Air Show. 10am BST: Eurozone construction output for April All day: Paris Air Show, Day 1",

AM Unison\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual conference is underway in Brighton and the squeeze on living standards is on the agenda. The trade union, which represents more than 1.3 million workers who provide public services, is calling for an end to pay freezes and austerity. Here is what Dave Prentis, general secretary, had to say: We live in a kingdom dangerously divided into the haves and the have-nots. Some are living in misery and poverty \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or even in extreme danger as we have seen last week. The catastrophe at Grenfell Tower was the epitome of a tale of two cities. People living in wealth and luxury side by side with those living in poverty. The Prime Minister appears to be unable to give the support people need or be the leader this country wants. This contrasts with the warmth and compassion shown by the public, and the bravery shown by the heroes of the emergency services. Public service champions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including nurses, hospital porters and council workers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are working together and supporting each other. We live in a country full of heroes. Jeremy Corbyn is the man capable of taking this country in the right direction. Some said he was unelectable but people saw hope and someone worth voting for. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a man who can be Prime Minister.It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for a Labour government with our values and our manifesto. A manifesto against job cuts, police cuts and pay freezes that ends the senseless pain of austerity. This government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity pay policies have crushed public services under their heel. They have ground down public service employees. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re worried about their jobs, their families and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go through another five years of poverty pay. Now is the time to shout enough is enough. This is the year to smash the pay cap. The Scottish National Party says Bank of England governor Mark Carney delivered a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153blunt Brexit reality check\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when he made his annual Mansion House speech this morning. Stewart Hosie MP: Today the governor of the Bank of England confirmed that Brexit is beginning to bite hard \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that our economy and people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wages are bearing the brunt. His speech paints an extremely depressing picture. It is fundamentally unfair, when Scotland voted expressly against this eventuality, that the Tories continue to drag us towards the hard Brexit cliff edge, putting jobs and growth at risk. The SNP has set out our position in clear terms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we want Scotland to maintain our place in the single market, to maintain our place in the customs union and will work hard to protect jobs and wages. The need for this approach has been underlined by Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Tories cannot continue to ignore Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voice. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, has given his take on the latest market moves. Here in the UK... The FTSE 100 erased early forex-induced gains by the afternoon when energy sector shares slumped alongside the price of oil. Investors were also weighing up the implications of fraud charges against former Barclays executives. Broader stock markets have been weathering the three-week slide in the oil price on the assumption prices will stay within the price range seen over the past 12 months. The further we move below $50 per barrel, the more worrisome the bruising taken by oil prices gets for stocks. And over in the US: Stocks in the US turned lower in early trading. Another day of record highs might be scuppered by concern around the persistent downtrend in oil and other commodity prices. Apart from sending Amazon shares to new stratospheric levels, the deal to buy Whole Foods has been a negative force on the US stock market. US markets are slightly down in early trading: Dow Jones: -0.03% at 21,521 S&amp;P 500: -0.3% at 2,446 Nasdaq: -0.2% at 5,758 Oil prices have fallen to seven-month lows after news of increases in supply from several key producers. Brent crude is down sharply: Elsewhere in Europe, major markets are mixed. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.04% at 12,894 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.2% at 5,320 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.5% at 20,909 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.5% at 10,799 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.2% at 391 The FTSE 250, which is more UK-focused than the FTSE 100, is down 0.4% at 19,796. A weaker pound is often a plus for the FTSE 100 where companies tend to be internationally focused. It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the case at the moment however as a falling oil price in dragging down commodity stocks. Brent crude is down 2.6% at $45.68 a barrel. The FTSE 100 is currently down 16 points or 0.2% at 7,508. Here is the list of the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest fallers: Labour MP Chuka Umunna has commented on Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mansion House speech. Speaking as a supporter of Open Britain, the campaign against a so-called hard Brexit, Umunna said: The chancellor is absolutely right that nobody voted in the referendum to become poorer. That is why it is vital that the government negotiates a Brexit deal that puts jobs and our economy first. To do so, the government needs to recognise that it cannot continue to threaten a Brexit with no deal at all. And they should reopen the possibility of keeping Britain in the single market and customs union, which would be the best option for our economy. Time for a recap: The pound has fallen sharply after Bank of England governor Mark Carney argued against raising UK interest rates. In his delayed Mansion House speech, Carney argued that the UK economy is too weak to support higher borrowing costs, especially as Brexit is at a critical point. Carney told an audience in London that: From my perspective, given the mixed signals on consumer spending and business investment, and given the still subdued domestic inflationary pressures, in particular anaemic wage growth, now is not yet the time to begin that adjustment. In the coming months, I would like to see the extent to which weaker consumption growth is offset by other components of demand, whether wages begin to firm, and more generally, how the economy reacts to the prospect of tighter financial conditions and the reality of Brexit negotiations. This has knocked almost a cent off the pound, to $1.2654 - close to a two-month low. City analysts say Carney has calmed speculation that interest rates could rise soon, after three policymakers voted for a hike last week. Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s added to the pressure on sterling, by warning that it needn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait for Brexit to be concluded before changing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating. Chancellor Philip Hammond also used the Mansion House speech to argue for UK businesses to be protected from Brexit damage, through a transition deal. The car industry has voiced its concerns too; saying that a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccliff-edge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit would be the worst option for the sector. And in other news, Tesco is facing customer complaints after a computer problem led to home delivery orders being cancelled. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says concerns over Brexit are weighing on the pound. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on top of Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech arguing against raising UK interest rates anytime soon. Otunuga explains: Sterling was in trouble during Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading session with prices tumbling to a weekly low at 1.266 after Mark Carney suggested that interest rates should be kept on hold amid Brexit uncertainty. It is becoming clear that the rising fears of Brexit negotiations negatively impacting economic growth continues to weigh heavily on sentiment while prolonged periods of uncertainty has ensured Pound weakness remains a recurrent theme. With both consumer spending and business investments dishing out mixed signals, and tepid wage growth still a cause for concern, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153now is not yet the time to raise interest rates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd according to Mark Carney. The pound is falling further against the euro too, down almost one eurocent at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.134. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a one-week low, and close to the eight-month low of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1276 hit after June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK general election. Rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have warned that it could downgrade the UK before the terms of the Brexit deal are known, putting even more pressure on the pound. S&amp;P sovereign ratings chief Moritz Kraemer told Reuters that S&amp;P needn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait until the negotiations have been concluded in 2019. Asked if it would wait until the end of the Brexit negotiations to take another ratings action on Britain, Kraemer said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will review the UK every six months... and if necessary more often... We will be watching the economic implications, the implications for the public finances, the constitutional implications like the whole Scotland situation...and things like the currency and if it will maintain its reserve status.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd S&amp;P slashed the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating by two-notches to AA , from Triple A, after the Brexit vote last summer. It currently has a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnegative outlook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the debt, suggesting another cut is possible. That has given currency traders another reason to sell the pound, which is still bruised by Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments this morning. This \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccandlestick formation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shows how sterling has fallen to a one-week low of $1.266, down 0.5%, and is barely above the two-month low struck after the UK election results. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carmakers have added their weight to calls for Britain to agree a transition deal after it leaves the EU. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders warned that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cliff-edge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit was the worst possible outcome for the automotive industry. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We accept that we are leaving the European Union and we share the desire for that departure to be a success. But our biggest fear is that, in two years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time, we fall off a cliff edge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no deal, outside the single market and customs union and trading on inferior WTO terms. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This would undermine our competitiveness and our ability to attract the investment that is critical to future growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The auto industry provides 12.0% of total UK export of goods, according to the SMMT, with 169,000 people employed directly in manufacturing, and over 800,000 in the wider industry. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Tesco is busy apologising to customers caught up in its home delivery problems. It says: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re currently experiencing an IT issue which is affecting some Grocery Home Shopping orders. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working hard to fix this problem and apologise to customers for any inconvenience this may cause.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Its social media team are handling a lot of criticism too: In other news....Tesco customers are reporting problems with the supermarket giant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home delivery service. Many are complaining on social media that their orders have been cancelled. According to a company spokesman, around 10% of orders have been affected. Tesco is blaming a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153computer glitch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and offering a \u00c2\u00a310 voucher as compensation, according to the BBC. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a few of the customers affected: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, on Mark Carney and Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speeches this morning: For analysts who were awaiting Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to the BoE policy meeting last week, this announcement has dampened expectations of a significant policy change in the near future, with the governor citing low wage growth and mixed signals on consumer spending as the reasons for his decision. There were some positives for investors from Hammond however, as he proposed arrangements for a transitionary period during the Brexit process and beyond which would see the customs union rules remain in place for the UK until new rules are implemented and other measures agreed that would protect the city and prevent disruption.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Taken at face value, Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insistence that interest rates would stay at rock bottom levels until the smoke had cleared from the Brexit talks was quite a rebuke to colleagues who voted for a rate rise only last week. The Bank of England governor was in combative mood as he listed the many reasons for keeping the base rate at 0.25%, not least the febrile atmosphere inside City trading rooms. Michael Saunders, Kristin Forbes and Ian McCafferty were the three members on the monetary policy committee to warn that rising inflation needed to be calmed by an increase in rates. You might think they would seem foolish now that a slap from the governor is visible on their livid cheeks. But it is more likely that the governor was quite content to see the huge amount of coverage in the news media for the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dissenting minority. The slap, if we can call it that, was staged. Knowing that rates cannot rise without thousands of businesses going bust and millions of households getting into financial trouble, Carney is playing a game. With the economy struggling as Brexit talks begin, the dangers are apparent. For this reason he must talk tough to prevent consumers heaping more cheap credit on their already huge borrowing, thereby creating a dangerous lending bubble. At the same time he wants to keep the credit wheels turning to keep the economy from falling over. He can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do this alone. The committee needs to play its part. We must assume that Forbes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacement, the London School of Economics professor Silvana Tenreyro, and whoever takes over from Charlotte Hogg, have been briefed. The drop in the pound has pushed up the value of multinational companies listed in London, as their overseas earnings are now more valuable. Global advertising giant WPP is leading the way, up 2.2%. Other gainers include luxury fashion chain Burberry (+1.5%) and consumer good titan Unilever (+1.2%). This has nudged the FTSE 100 up by 11 points to 7535, close to the alltime closing high of 7547. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcintraday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 high for the FTSE 100 is 7598. Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s caution suggests that UK interest rates will remain at their current record low throughout 2017, and possibly until 2019, says Howard Archer of the EY Item Club. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious stance fuels our belief that interest rates will not be rising any time soon, given a stuttering UK economy and uncertainties over its outlook.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We maintain the view that the Bank of England will hold off from raising interest rates in 2017. A tightening in 2018 also looks highly questionable given the cloudy outlook Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Mark Carney has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153emphatically\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd distanced himself from the three hawkish MPC members who voted to raise interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% last week. So says Sam Hill of Royal Bank of Canada. He adds: Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reference to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coming months\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd implies that his vote for an unchanged policy stance is set to prevail at the August Inflation Report, and beyond whilst these uncertainties are resolved. Whilst there are still many members we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heard from since the election purdah period ended (Haldane comments will be published tomorrow), it is significant that the Governor has now shown that the range of views on the Committee is broad, with his own being distinctly different to those who voted for a hike last week. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also worth remembering that the most hawkish MPC member, Kristin Forbes, steps down at the end of the month. Her replacement, Silvana Tenreyro, is expected to be more dovish. Mark Carney comments come just a week after UK inflation rate jumped to 2.9%, well over the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target, and much faster than wages. So if the Bank resists pressure to raise interest rates to curb inflation, workers may suffer falling real wages for even longer. Kathleen Brooks, currency expert at cityindex.co.uk, explains: This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments are important because they suggest that the Bank of England will look through the period of high inflation, headline CPI is running at 2.9%, blaming the rise on the sharp drop in sterling last year. This could spell more woe for the UK consumer, if the BOE is not going to take action to bring down prices, this could keep the squeeze on pay packets for some time. She also suspects that the pound could keep falling: In the very short term we are looking at $1.2650 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the bottom of the range from the last 10-days - if we break below here it would be a short-term bearish development.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mark Carney has laid a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a thick layer of dovishness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over the City today, says Neil Wilson of ETX Capital. He writes: Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnow is not the time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to tighten should hardly be a surprise, given his record of favouring looser monetary policy, but it does reiterate the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preference for looking through the current high levels of inflation for the time being. However, inflationary pressure could still force the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hand, he adds: There are plenty who think that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to cut last summer following the Brexit vote was folly and rising inflation offers a chance to correct that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcerror\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. However the departure of arch-hawk Kristin Forbes leaves those calling for tightening in a greater minority than before This is from Alpesh Paleja, the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s principal economist: Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments show that the Bank of England is not inching close to a rate hike, says Mike Bird of the WSJ: Allie Renison of the Institute of Directors is struck by Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctransitional deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to help firms cope with Brexit. The Telegraph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Deacon knows exactly who Carney was aiming for, with his comment about Brexit being a piece of cake: Apologies, there was a daft typo in that earlier entry about the pound. To be clear, the pound has fallen to $1.2675, a one-week low, down from $1.275 before Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech hit the wires. Sterling is also down 0.5% against the euro, to 87.9p from 87.4p. That means one pound buys \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.137, from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.142 earlier this morning. Hope that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear! Many thanks to all those who pointed it out. Carney concludes his speech by questioning whether Brexit will be a cakewalk - a mischievous nod to Brexiteers who argued that Britain can \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchave its cake and eat it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 after it leaves the EU. The governor says the success, or otherwise, of Brexit depends on whether the two sides can agree a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctransition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 arrangement (something Philip Hammond also called for today). Carney says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Depending on whether and when any transition arrangement can be agreed, firms on either side of the channel may soon need to activate contingency plans. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Before long, we will all begin to find out the extent to which Brexit is a gentle stroll along a smooth path to a land of cake and consumption.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney has a chilly warning for Britons -- Brexit is going to hurt the economy, and he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop that happening. However, the Bank can balance how this pain is shared; either through unemployment, or inflation, depending on how it sets interest rates. Monetary policy cannot prevent the weaker real income growth likely to accompany the transition to new trading arrangements with the EU. But it can influence how this hit to incomes is distributed between job losses and price rises. Carney has also warned that Britain will suffer badly if the City of London faces higher barriers to trade: One million people across this country work in financial services. The industry contributes 7% of output and pays taxes that cover almost two thirds of the cost of the NHS. At a time when the UK is running a 5% current account deficit, financial services runs a 1.5% trade surplus with Europe alone. The entire service sector runs a 5% surplus with the world and employs 85% of UK workers. We could take these realities for granted. And it would be all too easy to give into protectionism. But as we learned in the 1930s, that road leads neither to equity nor prosperity. Raising barriers to trade disproportionately hurts the least well off through higher prices and fewer opportunities. Carney is also warning against the creeping tide of protectionism, saying that stronger trade is the key to boosting global growth. The governor says countries need to look outwards, not impose new barriers. The G20 faces a choice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c between levelling down by putting more restrictions on goods trade, or levelling up by liberalising trade in services. Evidence from within countries suggests that there may be substantial scope to increase trade in services if barriers are removed. For example, in Canada \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of the few countries to track trade flows within its borders \u00e2\u20ac\u201c services account for around 50% of all inter-provincial trade compared with only 25% of Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international exports. If Canada were able to replicate the pattern of trade within its borders with other countries then services exports would triple. Breaking: Sterling has fallen sharply to a one-week low as Mark Carney declares that Britain isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready for higher interest rates. The pound shed half a cent to $1.2675 against the US dollar, and is down against the euro too. The Bank of England governor is arguing that it would be wrong to raise borrowing costs now, before we know how the Brexit negotiations will play out. He also tells the audience at Mansion House this morning that wage growth is too weak to justify a rate hike. Carney acknowledges that his monetary policy committee are split on this issue (they voted 5-3 to leave rates on hold last week). But he is not ready to join the three hawks pushing for higher borrowing costs. Carney says: Different members of the MPC will understandably have different views about the outlook and therefore on the potential timing of any Bank Rate increase. But all expect that any changes would be limited in scope and gradual in pace. From my perspective, given the mixed signals on consumer spending and business investment, and given the still subdued domestic inflationary pressures, in particular anaemic wage growth, now is not yet the time to begin that adjustment. In the coming months, I would like to see the extent to which weaker consumption growth is offset by other components of demand, whether wages begin to firm, and more generally, how the economy reacts to the prospect of tighter financial conditions and the reality of Brexit negotiations. Now Mark Carney is on his feet. The Bank of England governor begins his speech by touching on the tragic events of recent weeks, which have reminded us of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fine balance between hope and despair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He says: Despair at the murder of Jo Cox [one year ago last week]. Hope in her remarkable life of service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an inspiration that lives on in her family, friends, colleagues and many admirers. Despair at the terrorist attacks in Manchester, Borough Market and Finsbury Park. Despair at the tragedy of Grenfell Tower. Hope in the heroism, resiliency and the community of the responses. Hope when we recognise our common humanity. The best tribute this City and this Country can give to the memories of those lost is to renew our shared commitment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whatever our differences \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to promote the common good. And that includes pursuing a Brexit, and building an economy, that works for all, he adds..... The key message from Philip Hammond today is that Britain can achieve a Brexit that works for the people. But it must have four strands: A comprehensive agreement on trade and services. A mutually beneficial transitional arrangement, avoiding disruption and dangerous cliff edges. Frictionless customs arrangements. An implementation period, when the UK will be outside the customs union, but customs rules will remain in place pending the new rules coming into force. Andy Sparrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Politics Liveblog is covering all the details too (in a frictionless, mutually beneficial arrangement....) Hammond fires a warning shot at those who want to take EU derivatives trading out of London. This will lead to a lower-quality, higher-priced financial services, he warns. As expected, Hammond says Britain will almost certainly need an implementation period after Brexit, so that customs border arrangements can continue. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s land border must stay open and freeflowing too, he continues -- a very hot issue, as Theresa May continues to negotiate with Northern Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DUP party. On trade, Hammond says Britain needs to be able to trade effectively with EU members after Brexit. And on migration, the chancellor reads from the (notorious) Conservative manifesto that Britain needs to keep recruiting the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brightest and the best from around the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Britain has benefitted from globalisation, he continues, but it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn a blind eye to the hostility to it in parts of the developed world. Britain is tired of austerity after seven years of it, the chancellor continues - perhaps a nod that he will loosen the pursestrings in the autumn budget. But he is still committing to eliminating the budget deficit by the end of the next decade. He also promises to provide assurances to the European Investment Bank (EIB) to ensure that funds keep flowing to UK businesses after Brexit. Onto fiscal issues. Hammond says the Conservatives are committed to keeping taxes as low as possible, to encourage growth. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also opposed to raising borrowing to fund current consumption, as that only passes the bill onto future generations. Stronger growth is the only sustainable way to deliver better public services and jobs, says Hammond. I thought we had won that argument, but the general election has shown that we must make a new case for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a market economy and sound money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Hammond (a nod to Jeremy Corbyn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than expected performance). Hammond now turns to Brexit, saying that there is much work to do. But the UK has a solid foundation, he argues. It was one of the fastest growing G7 economies in 2016. He then takes a pop at his predecessor, adding that Britain has created millions of new jobs in the last few years \u00e2\u20ac\u0153even if you only count George Osborne once\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Philip Hammond is speaking now. He begins by thanking the City of London corporation for rescheduling today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s event, after the appalling tragedy that was unfolding at Grenfell Tower. The chancellor says that Britain has suffered a series of shocking events in recent weeks - terror attacks at Manchester, London Bridge, Finsbury Park yesterday, and at Grenfell. Grenfell was an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unimaginable tragedy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Hammond continues, and his thought are with all those affected by it. The immediate priority is to make sure that that the survivors have everything they need. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all. We must also get to the bottom of the failure at Grenfell and take decisive action to make sure nothing like this happens again. You should be able to watch the Mansion House speeches on the TV news. Bloomberg are streaming it. Bloomberg expect Hammond to make the case for a softer Brexit that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause as much damage to the economy. The room at Mansion House is filling up nicely, to hear from Hammond and Carney. Helena Morrissey, head of personal investing at LGIM and a driving force to get more women into the boardroom, is there. So is conservative MPs Steve Barclay and Vicky Ford. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The great and the good of the City of London are heading to Mansion House this morning, to hear from Bank of England governor Mark Carney and chancellor Philip Hammond. The two men, who between them handle the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal and monetary levers, are expected to outline their plans to protect Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth prospects in the face of Brexit. These speeches were originally scheduled for last Thursday night, before the City of London corporation cancelled the Mansion House event altogether following the Grenfell Tower disaster. It was hardly appropriate to have City grandees hobnobbing in black tie and quaffing expensive vintages. So instead, it has been rescheduled as a breakfast event this morning. This is the first time we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard from Carney since the Bank of England was dramatically split over interest rates last week. Three policymakers voted to hike borrowing costs, startling the City, while five voted for no-change. Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech will also be closely watched. He had been expected use last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech to argue against a Hard Brexit, and call on prime minister Theresa May to ensure Britain gets a significant \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transition period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after Brexit, to help businesses adapt. Over the weekend, the chancellor hinted that he might ease up on austerity following the Conservative Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election bloody nose. As Reuters put it: Hammond had looked set to lose his job until May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election flop. He has now re-emerged as big business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leading proponent in government and might provide more details on Tuesday on how he thinks the two-year Brexit process should run. Hammond may also give more details of his budget plans after saying on Sunday that he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not deaf\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the weariness of voters to nearly a decade of spending cuts for many services and tight controls on public sector pay. Also coming up today... The other big news this morning is that the Serious Fraud Office has charged Barclays, and four former top executives, over its fundraising from Qatar during the 2008 financial crisis. We should also get more details of Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s innovative plan to issue 100-year bonds, despite having defaulted on its debts more than once.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda: From 8am: Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech at Mansion House 8.30am: Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech at Mansion House 9am: Eurozone current account for April",

If successful, the Ocado Smart Platform could prove crucial for the company, which was founded in April 2000 and has grown to a valuation of almost \u00c2\u00a32bn. It faces competition not only from established supermarkets in the UK, but also from US retail titan Amazon, which launched its own grocery delivery service in the UK in June 2016. This month, Amazon expanded its grocery portfolio by buying organic foods chain Whole Foods for $13.7bn (\u00c2\u00a310.7bn). Ocado hopes that its Smart Platform offering, which lets other retailers outsource their online sales, will be key to beating the Seattle-based firm. For partnering retailers, it offers an end-to-end integrated service, starting with a white-label app, and placing Ocado technology in their warehouses, shops and delivery vehicles. This month, the company announced its first customer for the platform, a European retailer that requested anonymity \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to retain competitive advantage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.",

Bottled colas: up 12.8% The result of rising sugar prices as a result of poor harvests, changes in EU production rules, and a fall in the value of the pound which has piushed up the cost of imported ingredients and packaging. Cat food: up 7.1% Due to the rising price of wheat, used to bulk up products, and of imported packaging. Instant coffee: up 6.4% A poor harvest last year is only now feeding through to instant coffee which is also affected by the declining value of the pound. Fruit: up 5.7% Largely the result of the rising cost of importing fruit such as bananas, which are priced in dollars Salmon: up 23.8% Industrial action in Iceland and a serious outbreak of salmon lice in Scotland and Norway has hit production, while the decline in sterling has increased the price of imports.",
