Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also suspects that Theresa May (or her successor) will now steer away from a hard Brexit, which would be <strong>good</strong> for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating.</p> <p> Here are the key points from the report</p> <ul> <li><strong>Inconclusive election outcome will complicate and probably delay Brexit negotiations, a credit negative. </strong>The negotiations with the EU were due to begin on 19 June, but we now expect a delay to the start of those negotiations or at least a period during which no substantive issues will be discussed. The time frame for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU in March 2019 remains unchanged, reducing still further the time available to achieve the transition agreement needed to avoid a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit.<br></li> <li><strong>We expect fiscal risks to increase because consolidation will have a lower priority, a credit negativ</strong>e. In our view, the budget deficit will increase this year and next, as the government reacts to the economic slowdown under way. The election outcome, with significant gains for the Labour Party which had campaigned for increased public spending, will likely be seen as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vote against austerity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The public debt ratio will rise further and for longer than we had expected, placing the UK among the few highly rated European sovereigns whose public debt is still rising.<strong><br></strong></li> <li><strong>However, the election outcome also means that the government may now consider \u00e2\u20ac\u0153softer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit options, which could be credit positive</strong>. While we still expect Brexit to happen and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cliff\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd risk of sudden exit remains, the election result suggests an electoral shift away from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit that the Prime Minister had ostensibly sought. Hence, a move towards \u00e2\u20ac\u0153softer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd versions of Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c potentially with continued access of some sort to the Single Market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c might now be considered.</li> </ul> <p>And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing why Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is worried about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national debt:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50b814a37f829e3a931623cb4525f4a85ad62a89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50b814a37f829e3a931623cb4525f4a85ad62a89/0_0_656_262/500.jpg\" alt=\"UK fiscal profile\" width=\"500\" height=\"200\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-593e4dc7e4b0be3ed1925881\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-12T08:19:43.943Z\">9.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">S&amp;P: Election uncertainty will hurt growth</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth is likely to be damaged by the current political instability, according to the European chief economist of ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.</strong></p> <p>Jean-Michel Six told the AJEF association of financial journalists in Paris that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the time being, the outlook remains negative.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153In terms of the outlook for growth, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that things are not going in the right direction.</p> <p>This latest bit of instability can only weaken the business environment and consumer confidence,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> </blockquote> <p>Thanks to Reuters for the quotes....and this chart, showing how the UK economy has deteriorated recently:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/874178376399028224\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">UK economic surprises index - now negative, a 1-year low, and down sharply from (admittedly high levels) just a few months ago. <a href=\"https://t.co/1XpAhs98Di\">pic.twitter.com/1XpAhs98Di</a></p>&mdash; Jamie McGeever (@ReutersJamie) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/874178376399028224\">June 12, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-593e4317e4b0be3ed192585c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-12T08:15:48.241Z\">9.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The shock election result has fuelled speculation that Britain may aim for a less \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit than Theresa May had planned.</strong></p> <p><strong>Kalum Pickering</strong> of<strong> Berenberg Bank</strong> explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the continent, most observers have taken the UK election result as a rebuke of Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard Brexit rhetoric of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal is better than a bad deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd kind.</p> <p>For example, EU Commission \u00c3\u2013ttinger has expressed hope that the UK may now agree to stay in the Customs Union and the Common Market, possibly by joining EFTA.

                "bodyText":"Time for a quick recap Sterling has lost ground today as fresh signs of UK political instability rattled investors. The pound has hit a seven-month low against the euro and is close to an eight-week low against the US dollar. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows: \u00c2\u00a31 = \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1280, lowest since November 2016 \u00c2\u00a31 = $1.1265, close to the eight-week low set in Friday The selloff came as rumours swirled through Westminster that next Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Speech might be postponed. This has highlighted that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position in Downing Street remains vulnerable (and potentially creates a very awkward diary clash with the monarch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s duties at Royal Ascot.) Political insiders are also reporting that the cabinet is split, with some members pushing for a softer Brexit plan. Business leaders have warned that confidence has been badly hit by the hung parliament delivered by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election, which has left May chasing some sort of deal with the Democratic Unionist Party, which won 10 seats in Northern Ireland. The Institute for Directors said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if not addressed immediately \u00e2\u20ac\u201c be disastrous for the UK economy. The needs of business and discussion of the economy were largely absent from the campaign, but this crash in confidence shows how urgently that must change in the new government. Rating agencies have weighed in too. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warned that the hung parliament was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccredit negative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the UK; a hint that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating could be downgraded. They said: Election result heightens uncertainty over Brexit negotiations and increases fiscal risks, a credit negative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist predicted that UK growth would be hurt. Harvard University added to the mix, with a study finding that most businesses want to remain in the single market. The Resolution Foundation warned that UK firms are worryingly unprepared for migration curbs. Meanwhile on Wall Street, US technology giants are suffering a second day of losses, with the Nasdaq down 1% in early trading. Is it the end of the tech boom?... ...not necessarily! Chris Beauchamp of IG says: Attention is concentrated on the ongoing rout in US tech stocks. Having been such a one-way bet so far this year, this sudden turn to the downside will have caught out more than a few over-eager latecomers. However, those rushing to proclaim the demise of one of the big rallies of not only the past year but the past eight years too need to be careful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there will be plenty of dip buyers out there who have been waiting for a pullback of this kind of size. And in Europe, the markets have just closed for the day. The FTSE 100 shed 15 points, or 0.25%, to 7511 - failing to get any benefit from the cheaper pound. The the German DAX shed almost 1% and the French CAC lost 1.2% That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Dr Mike Ellington of the University of Liverpool has written an interesting article on how sterling will suffer from the political crisis in Westminster. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysed UK economic uncertainty (measured by recording how many articles on economic and political unrest appear in the media each day), and tracked it against the value of the pound. He conclude that there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnegative relationship\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 between the two, with sterling suffering losses whenever It is clear that the negative relationship between policy uncertainty and the euro to sterling exchange rate is intensifying. This implies that increases in economic policy uncertainty are met with depreciations in the sterling to euro exchange rate running up to June 9, 2017. This indicates that currency markets do not feel the government has a strong negotiation position for Brexit (otherwise sterling wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be so volatile). Ellington concludes that this means trouble ahead.... This, coupled with May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lack of support in the general election, should put her leadership into question, particularly when it comes to entering divorce talks with the EU. The very fact that the domestic political landscape of the UK is shrouded by yet another layer of uncertainty suggests that economic policy, the exchange rate, and indeed the wider economy, is in for a rough ride. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full piece: Why the hung parliament spells economic turbulence for the UK economy The Institute of Director\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that UK business confidence has plunged since the general election has caused quite a stir. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some of the best reaction: Markus Kuger, senior economist at business services firm Dun &amp; Bradstreet \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After the surprising election result, political and economic uncertainty in the UK has risen considerably. The election outcome looks set to further complicate the process of negotiating the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the EU, as the government only has a narrow majority in parliament \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and even this looks vulnerable in the context of Conservative MPs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 widely differing views on post-Brexit UK-EU relations. Given the backdrop of an already slowing economy (the UK posted the lowest real GDP growth of all 28 EU economies in Q1 2017), it is not surprising that businesses are beginning to express a lack of confidence. We believe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly unlikely that the first round of Brexit talks between the British government and the EU (scheduled for 19/20 June) will deliver more clarity or significant results. This means that companies will have to wait even longer to assess the impact of these negotiations on their business. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our analysis indicates that uncertainty will remain high in the next 18 months, regardless of what happens in the wake of the election, and we are maintaining our risk rating of DB2d and our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeteriorating\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 risk outlook for the UK economy. We predict that, in the long run, the election result could make a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit - which we believe would be harmful for the British economy - impossible. Jenni Hibbert, Managing Partner for Financial Services Europe &amp; Africa at executive headhunters Heidrick &amp; Struggles \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Worries about the future are not just relegated to those in financial services: we recently conducted a wide-ranging survey with hospitality CEOs, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth largest employer accounting for 180,000 businesses in the UK, with less than one in ten confident about the future and almost half describing themselves as concerned.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Former UK shadow chancellor Ed Balls has also weighed in on Brexit today by co-authoring a report which found that a bad deal would be a disaster for the UK. A survey of small UK businesses by Harvard University found that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153almost all\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd business leaders wanted to retain membership of the single market and customs union, to make it easier to keep trading with the EU. Balls says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the time of the referendum, many British companies thought that Brexit might lead to a reduced regulatory burden. But now they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re worried that if Britain leaves the single market and the customs union, the opposite will be true.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: During the election campaign, both the Labour and Conservative leadership said Britain would leave the single market after Brexit - in order to impose migration controls. However, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit secretary, Sir Kier Starmer, has suggested today that the UK could stay inside the single market; a reminder that there are differing views on Brexit in both major parties... Newsflash: Shares in tech companies are falling again at the start of trading on Wall Street. The Nasdaq has shed 1%, losing 64 points to 6,143, at the start of trading. That adds to Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.8% tumble, Amazon, Alphabet/Google and Apple are all leading the fallers, as concerns grow that these tech giants have become overvalue. Ouch! The pound has just hit a new seven-month low against the euro, and is falling further against the dollar too. Sterling dropped as low as \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1280, down almost one euro cent today. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest level since last November. Sterling is also continuing to lose ground against the US dollar; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now down 0.5% at $1.2671- close to the eight-week low hit after the general election. The selloff comes as Theresa May government fails to show a great deal of strength and stability - with the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech reportedly postponed. FXTM Vice President of Market Research, Jameel Ahmad, argues that the pound will suffer fresh losses as Brexit talks begin next week. He isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced that a move towards a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsofter Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will provide much support. I personally still see downside risks for the Sterling and see the potential for the market to become encouraged towards selling in the likelihood that the UK is set to begin negotiations next week and looks very unprepared for such complex negotiations. The whole reason for the UK election in the first place was so that Theresa May would have more powers to influence the Brexit process, but not only has this play backfired, the UK looks more unprepared than ever to go head-to-head with the EU as it currently stands. I personally remain bearish on the Sterling. Carolyn Fairbairn, the director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, has also weighed in on the issue of EU migrants. She warns that British firms can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be expected to replace EU nationals with UK citizens, at a time when employment in Britain is already at record high levels. Fairbairn also told the Resolution Foundation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conference that politicians need to concentrate on the economy again.. Speaking of EU migration.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s businesses are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153totally unprepared\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the drop in migration after Brexit, according to a new report from the Resolution Foundation today. The think tank polled more than 500 UK businesses who employ EU workers, and found that 17% expect no change to the current system of freedom of movement for EU/EEA nationals to the UK. Another 30% believe this system will be maintained for anyone from the EU who arrives in Britain with a job offer. These are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153totally unrealistic expectations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, warns Resolution, because: The Prime Minister in contrast has ruled out either option, stating that her government \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rather than firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 demand for workers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will control migrant numbers. The Conservative Manifesto recommitted the government to reducing net migration down to the tens of thousands. The report was presented to a conference in London today, which also heard that the UK agriculture sector needs tens of thousands of season workers each year. The National Farmers Union is urging the government to consider this issue during the Brexit talks: Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Another dollop of uncertainty has just landed on our plates; Downing Street are hinting that the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Speech might not take place next Monday after all. Our political liveblogger Andrew Sparrow has just returned from the regular lobby briefing with Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman, and reports: The spokesman said that the new leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom, would be making a statement about the date of the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech in due course. The spokesman would not say anymore, but he would not confirm that it will go ahead as planned on Monday next week. It may be that the government has decided to delay it until it has agreed its deal with the DUP. A delay would be most unusual - and rather irksome for Queen Elizabeth II, who is expecting to spend most of next week at the Royal Ascot races. Sterling has fallen against every other major currency today, according to Bloomberg, which explains: The pound fell against all its Group-of-10 peers on the prospect of an unstable coalition government heading into Brexit talks with the European Union in a week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. Betfair reckon there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a one-in-three chance that Britain will hold a second general election this year. Here are the latest odds: Year of Next General Election 2017 3.0 (2/1 or 33% chance) 2018 4.0 (3/1 or 25% chance) 2019 4.9 (4/1) 2020 8.8 (8/1) 2021 9.4 (17/2) 2022 7.6 (13/2) They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also provided some odds for Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely replacement: Next Conservative Leader Boris Johnson 3.4 (12/5) David Davis 4.7 (7/2) Amber Rudd 9.0 (8/1) Ruth Davidson 10.0 (9/1) Phillip Hammond 17.5 (16/1) Michael Gove 23.0 (22/1) Speculation that Theresa May might change her Brexit stance is propping up sterling, says Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The rise of softer Brexit speculation is another reason why the pound has not declined more sharply following the UK general election result\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

It told its clients that: The UK delivered another electoral surprise this week with the Conservative party losing its majority in Parliament. This means the Conservatives would be reliant on the Northern Irish DUP with its 10 seats to establish a thin parliamentary majority. This raises questions about PM May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to deliver a hard Brexit given the desire in Northern Ireland for a frictionless border with the Republic of Ireland. For sterling rates, this means markets are likely to be caught between the opposing forces of political instability associated with a Conservative minority government, and a potential softening of the Brexit stance. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy report on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election has knocked the pound, says Neil Wilson of ETX Capital: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sentiment around the pound took a bit of a dive in morning trading in London. After treading water around $1.274 for the last few days since the election, cable eased back below the $1.27 handle after Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warned that the election result is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccredit negative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the UK. This seems to have woken traders from their slumber and the pound is on the defensive as we start the week. It wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take much bad news from the UK political scene to force cable to take another leg lower. Still there is plenty of bid to catch on the way down as the dips are being viewed as short-term buying opportunities. Sentiment remains pretty bearish. As Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s points out there is a chance of a softer Brexit but we must also think there is a heightened risk of a cliff-edge exit from the EU.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sterling is also dropping against the euro, losing 0.6% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1322. On Friday it hit an eight-month low of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1285 before recovering a little. Update: the pound had now dropped below $1.27, towards the eight-week low struck on Friday morning as the election results came in. The pound is dipping back towards $1.27, down 0.2% today, as investors analyse these warnings from Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and S&amp;P and wait for developments in Westminster. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says the drop in business confidence, and the slowdown in household spending, are worrying the City: This decline in economic indicators may have been a long time coming, yet with a weakened political mandate and Brexit negotiations about to start, it is likely that we will see the UK continue to struggle. The fallout from the UK election continues and will remain key to expectations for the pound. Newsflash from the Bank of England: Andy Haldane, the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, has been reappointed to the Monetary Policy Committee. That means Haldane will continue to vote on UK interest rates and the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus programme until 2020. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a big surprise, but it is worth noting as Haldane is one of the most dovish members of the committee. Speaking of Brexit delays..... The formal Brexit talks are due to begin on 19 June, the same day as the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech.... Rating agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has also issued a report on the UK election, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not very cheery reading. It is titled: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Election result heightens uncertainty over Brexit negotiations and increases fiscal risks, a credit negative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And it warns that negotiating to leave the EU will now be a more complicated process. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fears that those talks (which are due to start next week) may be delayed, or may not focus on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantive issues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a while as the Conservative Party tries to agree a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is also worried that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national debt will keep rising for longer, as the government wrestles with a slowing economy and the public backlash against austerity. That could be bad for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating, which is currently Aa1 with Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, one notch below AAA. But.... Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also suspects that Theresa May (or her successor) will now steer away from a hard Brexit, which would be good for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating. Here are the key points from the report Inconclusive election outcome will complicate and probably delay Brexit negotiations, a credit negative. The negotiations with the EU were due to begin on 19 June, but we now expect a delay to the start of those negotiations or at least a period during which no substantive issues will be discussed. The time frame for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU in March 2019 remains unchanged, reducing still further the time available to achieve the transition agreement needed to avoid a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit. We expect fiscal risks to increase because consolidation will have a lower priority, a credit negative. In our view, the budget deficit will increase this year and next, as the government reacts to the economic slowdown under way. The election outcome, with significant gains for the Labour Party which had campaigned for increased public spending, will likely be seen as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vote against austerity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The public debt ratio will rise further and for longer than we had expected, placing the UK among the few highly rated European sovereigns whose public debt is still rising. However, the election outcome also means that the government may now consider \u00e2\u20ac\u0153softer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit options, which could be credit positive. While we still expect Brexit to happen and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cliff\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd risk of sudden exit remains, the election result suggests an electoral shift away from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit that the Prime Minister had ostensibly sought. Hence, a move towards \u00e2\u20ac\u0153softer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd versions of Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c potentially with continued access of some sort to the Single Market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c might now be considered. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing why Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is worried about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national debt: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth is likely to be damaged by the current political instability, according to the European chief economist of ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Jean-Michel Six told the AJEF association of financial journalists in Paris that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the time being, the outlook remains negative.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In terms of the outlook for growth, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that things are not going in the right direction. This latest bit of instability can only weaken the business environment and consumer confidence,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thanks to Reuters for the quotes....and this chart, showing how the UK economy has deteriorated recently: The shock election result has fuelled speculation that Britain may aim for a less \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit than Theresa May had planned. Kalum Pickering of Berenberg Bank explains: On the continent, most observers have taken the UK election result as a rebuke of Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard Brexit rhetoric of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal is better than a bad deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd kind. For example, EU Commission \u00c3\u2013ttinger has expressed hope that the UK may now agree to stay in the Customs Union and the Common Market, possibly by joining EFTA. To remain in the Common Market and thus maintain preferential access to the EU27 market (except for some financial products where regulators will insist that some activities have to be carried out under the direct sway of EU regulators), the UK would have to accept the free movement of labour and continue to pay into the EU budget like EFTA members do. Whether or not a Tory-led government could agree to that remains a very open question, though, to put it mildly. Indeed! And in the last few minutes, Brexit secretary David Davis has played down the idea that the government could soften its stance - insisting that leaving the EU meant leaving the single market. More in our Politics Live blog: Buzzfeed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alberto Nardelli tweets: Traders will be watching Wall Street nervously when it opens later today, to see if technology stocks keep falling. Apple fell by 4% on Friday, while Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook all shed 3% - wiping almost $100bn off their market value. The selloff comes after a long surge in tech stocks, so investors are wondering if the rally is over. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says other assets could be spooked.... Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell off in some of the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest tech names was sharp and severe on Friday. But was this just a bit of profit taking after a note from Goldman Sachs questioned the $600bn increase in some tech firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 market cap in the past year? This is an important question that we need answered as tech stock weakness is having an impact on other growth assets today. The MSCI emerging markets index fell on Friday, yet the Aussie dollar, which is correlated with growth assets, was relatively stable on Monday. The BBC has a good take on the IoD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business confidence survey: The uncertainty caused by the general election has led business confidence to sink \u00e2\u20ac\u0153through the floor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to a lobby group. A snap poll of 700 members of the Institute of Directors found a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dramatic drop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in confidence following the hung parliament. Members saw no clear way to resolve the political impasse quickly, the IoD said. However, it found there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no desire\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for another election this year.... More here: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are a sea of red this morning, as investors digest the tumble in UK business confidence in the last couple of days. Shares are being pulled down by worries over UK politics, and the selloff in the tech sector. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much optimism in the City this morning. Falling around half a percent the UK index found itself back below the 7500 mark, if only just, as the Institute of Directors warned that its members were feeling pretty damn pessimistic about the state of the UK economy in the next 12 months. The pound, meanwhile, neither continued last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline nor substantially recovered any of those election-losses, opening 0.1% higher against the dollar and flat against the euro. The FTSE 250 index, which is more UK-focused than the FTSE 100, has dropped by 50 points (or 0.25%) in early trading to 19,719. The IoD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy warning on business confidence is helping to keep a lid on the pound this morning. Sterling is hovering around $1.274, close to Friday night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. It tumbled by over two cents when the election exit polls came out on Thursday night. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, warns that the pound is vulnerable to political uncertainty, as prime minister May tries to cling onto power. With Theresa May scrambling to repair the self-inflicted damage suffered as a result of the election, there remains a huge amount of uncertainty around her position and with only a week to go before Brexit talks with the EU begin, I feel there may be a few more twists to come yet. May has not delivered the strong and stable government she wanted and instead looks weak and vulnerable. I find it hard to see how she recovers from this. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets agrees, saying: Sentiment remains dented by politics following the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hung parliament and shift in the balance of UK political power. European stock markets have opened in the red, with the FTSE 100 losing 27 points (or 0.4%). Technology stocks are the biggest fallers, following a selloff on Wall Street on Friday night. Manish Singh of CrossBridge Capital, an investment advisory firm, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprised that business confidence has fallen since the UK election. He says many business leaders are now pondering the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister, after he smashed expectations and gained 32 seats. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Singh says: If you are a business, you really need to start thinking \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhat is in the Labour manifesto?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.... It will have some businesses worrying about Mr Corbyn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manifesto included raising income tax on those earning over \u00c2\u00a380,00 per year, increasing corporation tax, and renationalising the water companies, as well as free childcare, ending the freeze on welfare benefits and abolishing tuition fees. Singh says political instability can deter businesses from investing, especially when the Brexit talks are also hanging over them. But he also agrees that younger voters are right too feel aggrieved, as yound people in Europe will be poorer than previous generations. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European stock markets are set to fall this morning, as evidence piles up that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mounting political uncertainty is hurting the economy. The Institute of Directors have issued a stark warning that business optimism has plunged after Theresa May lost her House of Commons majority last week. A new survey of IoD members found that 57% are either quite pessimistic or very pessimistic about the UK economy over the next 12 months. Just a fifth described themselves as optimistic -- which gives a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnet confidence\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 score of minus 37. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a serious deterioration compared to the previous month, when 34% were optimistic and 37% pessimistic. The poll, conducted over the weekend, found that many business leaders are alarmed by the prospect of a hung parliament, just as the Brexit negotiations begin. Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, says British politicians need to urgently refocus on the state of the economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if not addressed immediately \u00e2\u20ac\u201c be disastrous for the UK economy. The needs of business and discussion of the economy were largely absent from the campaign, but this crash in confidence shows how urgently that must change in the new government. This chart might focus a few minds in Westminster: The IoD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only cause for concern this morning. Visa have reported that household spending fell last month, for the first time in almost four years. It highlights how consumers are being squeezed by rising inflation and political uncertainty, and cutting back on non-essential items. As things stand this morning, May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grip on Number 10 is looking precarious, with insiders saying she cannot lead the Conservative Party into another election. Yesterday she was savaged as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dead woman walking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by former chancellor George Osborne (who seems to be enjoying his new career in journalism). But the game isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over, yet. Later today May will appeal to her MPs for support, in an attempt to remain as prime minister. Our political editor Heather Stewart explains: The prime minister is expected to signal to her parliamentary colleagues that she will run her government in a more collegiate, less controlling way, after sacrificing her two closest advisers, Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy. With many backbenchers blaming May for the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor performance at the polls, one senior Conservative said she would have to give a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153barnstorming\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd performance at the meeting of the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1922 committee of MPs to hold on to her job. Spread-betting firm IG expect the main European markets to fall by up to 0.5% this morning. While Britain is gripped by May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crisis-of-her-own-making, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Emmanuel Macron is showing us how to lead a country. The French president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s En Marche party is on track for a landslide win in parliamentary elections, giving him enough muscle to start pushing through economic reforms. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very little in the economic calendar today, alas.",

                "bodyText":"Shares in technology companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the driver behind recent record stock market gains \u00e2\u20ac\u201c kept falling on Monday as investors worried the sector was running out of steam. On Friday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index, home to Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and others, fell 1.8% and the slide continued on Monday, with the index down another 0.52% as market analysts anticipated more wobbles ahead of a crucial meeting of the Federal Reserve this week. Technology stocks have done far better than the rest of the market this year and they were trading close to all-time highs before Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop. The S&amp;P 500 technology index shed 2.7% on Friday for one of its worst days of the year. The climb has made fortunes for investors, and for tech entrepreneurs. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has seen his net worth soar by almost $20bn (\u00c2\u00a316bn) in the past five months to $85.2bn. Bezos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fortune is closing in on that of Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, whose net worth is $89.3bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Bezos could become the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest man if the tech stocks continue to grow. Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, said it was too early to say whether the last two days of trading would develop into something worse for the tech sector but added that there were worrying signs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The tech sector has been the stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best performer, and some people may be taking profits or rotating their investments into different sectors,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But there is also some concern about what the Fed will do.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stock markets have been bolstered by the huge amounts of money the Fed and other central banks have poured into bond markets in an attempt to keep interest rates at record lows. Low rates have made stock investments more attractive but the Fed has signaled that rates in the US are now on the rise, albeit from a low base. The Fed meets on Tuesday and Wednesday this week and its chairwoman, Janet Yellen, is expected to announce another rate rise at her press conference when the meeting concludes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everyone fully expects a rate rise this time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ablin. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What matters is what the Fed says about the rest of the year. Given their gains, tech is probably going to be the most sensitive sector to be affected by that. We will know more after Wednesday.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Strong quarterly earnings have helped technology stocks fill a void left by financial and industrial stocks after a post-election rally faded.

                "bodyText":"That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today, I think. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story on the inflation data: Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, argues that the government must respond to the pickup in inflation, and reverse some of its austerity measures. He writes: Had Theresa May won the landslide she was clearly expecting, the government would have been able to ride out this difficult period. Inflation is likely to go up a bit further, but the ONS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s separate figures for producer output prices, which measure the cost of goods leaving factory gates and provide a guide to inflationary pressure early in the pipeline, appear to have peaked. Moreover, weaker consumer spending will result in lower growth and this will eventually feed through into a fall in inflation. But May is a weakened prime minister heading a minority administration and she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time on her side. The government has recognised that voters are unhappy about falling living standards and have had enough of cuts. Deficit reduction will now play second fiddle to the need to raise real incomes, so expect a generous uplift in the minimum wage and an easing of curbs on public sector pay as signs that the age of austerity is over. More here: Rising prices are bad news for those who have managed to save money, particularly if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re relying on savings income (as many pensioners are). M&amp;S have calculated that the gap between the interest rate on cash savings and inflation is the widest since November 2011. That means savings, as well as wages, are shrinking in real terms. Ritu Vohora, Investment Director at M&amp;G, has the details: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At this rate, \u00c2\u00a35,000 left in an average bank account would lose \u00c2\u00a3137.50, in real terms after the effects of inflation, over the next 12 months. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All investments come with some risk, but these rock bottom net savings rates carry the very real risk of eroding wealth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now could be the right time to consider whether investing in stocks and shares could be a better way to protect against inflation, and achieve your long-term financial goals.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The head of the Confederation of British Industry has called Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election a political earthquake, but said it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an opportunity for a different kind of Brexit in which the voice of common sense is heard. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, also warned Theresa May that for businesses across the UK, particularly in Northern Ireland, a soft border in the country was fundamental. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Clearly it was just a political earthquake last Thursday. What we saw and realised is a lot of the consensus we thought we had we actually don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fairbairn told the Fortune Most Powerful Women International Summit in London on Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My biggest message is this is a time to broaden the church, listen to and work through the biggest issues. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know we really care about the strength of our economy, about the regions of the UK growing. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just be focused on London. The young turned out in their thousands, listen to that young voice.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fairbairn said the soft border in Ireland was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely fundamental\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, because it had helped understanding between people and the peace process. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m hoping from a business and practically human point of view that there is a commitment to that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. She added that there was much unhelpful language around Brexit ahead of the commencement of negotiations next week, such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard and soft\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know we want access to the single market, jobs depend on it. We also know there is a dilemma we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re facing, there is real public concern around immigration. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also seeing companies with skills shortages, a 96% reduction in nurses applying [as revealed yesterday]. We need to open up that dilemma again and come up with ways to address the public concern.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked why businesses were quiet during the referendum campaign, Fairbairn said they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t but their voice wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heard enough. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We learnt through the referendum how strong this sense of feeling left out of prosperity and growth a lot of the country felt,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she continued. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand enough the concerns around immigration.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd What was needed now was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a reset\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she explained. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In terms of the migration issue, I think people were saying we want control back. Is that served by a single number, a cap? If not, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s go back to problem solving.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a fundamental confidence in common sense prevailing through all this,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fairbairn said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think nobody in this room would think the referendum campaigns were good. The information and understanding... I think we can get to a better place now, where there are more voices coming through. Universities, young people. The chips are falling a different way now and we can have a different outcome. The fact is the EU will be our trading partner for a long time and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an opportunity to protect our relationship.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But she added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s be very clear, everybody I speak to in business accepts Brexit is happening. But what we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have is a consensus about how it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She stressed that there was a lot of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153really fantastic stuff\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd going on in businesses across the country, and urged people \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not get too down on ourselves in terms of the economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which has huge potential. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to get Brexit right and make sure we have access to the single market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While Britain faces the prospect of falling real wages, squeezed households and ongoing child poverty, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has just hit a new all-time high. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped by around 70 points to 21,307, a new record. Investment bank Goldman Sachs is the biggest riser (+1.5%), followed by credit card firm VISA (1.2%). Tech firms Apple, Microsoft and Cisco have all gained around 1%, after two days of losses. UK government bond prices have hit their lowest levels in a month since the inflation data was released. The pound has also risen, now up 0.7 of a cent at $1.2720. Those two facts suggests that traders see a higher chance that the Bank of England tightens monetary policy sooner, because of the risk of inflation. However, several economists are suggesting that the BoE will be content to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclook through\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the inflation figures. The FTSE, meanwhile, is almost flat at 7519 points, up 0.1%. Ashwin Kumar, Chief Economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, has joined the ranks of the experts calling for the government to end its benefits freeze. He points out that the policy becomes particularly harsh when prices start to accelerate: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People on low incomes face challenging times. Inflation is up by the highest rate in five years, continuing a sharp rise since the Brexit vote, and employment figures out tomorrow are likely to show that wages are barely keeping up. With increases of 2 per cent in food, nearly 5 per cent in energy and 3 percent in clothing and footwear, families are facing very difficult choices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The benefit freeze will squeeze family budgets even further. This was a policy designed in an era of very low inflation. This is no longer the case and low-income households are suffering. As the cost of essentials rises, the new Government could help struggling families by ending the freeze on benefits.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Given the current economic uncertainty, Brits should plan for this wage squeeze to last for some time. Calum Bennie, savings expert at Scottish Friendly, says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The seemingly perpetual squeeze on UK households continues. The rise of inflation to 2.9% means no end is in sight for hard-pressed consumers who see prices rising but growth in their wages failing to keep pace. It is no surprise then that consumers are reining back on spending or in many cases are turning to credit to get by as day-to-day living gets more expensive.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Prices will continue to rise due to the falling pound and the higher costs of imports so the message has to be try to be prudent with spending and stash more cash. You will need more bang for your buck in the next few months and having more money in your financial armoury can only help.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real pay crisis is a sign that austerity has failed, argues the GMB Union. Tim Roache, GMB general secretary, says Theresa May must take the opportunity to ditch polities such as the public sector pay freeze: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yet again, we are seeing the cost of living rise faster than wages. Inflation has risen to almost ten times its rate 12 months ago. In the real world, that increase means that no matter how hard people work, increasingly they are struggling to pay their bills. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Too often there is more month than money left after pay day. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is further proof, if any was needed, that austerity has failed and that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s working people paying the price. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the Prime Minister is to take anything away from her election embarrassment, it should be that people are fed up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re fed up with working hard to stand still and with a system set up to benefit those who already have more than enough. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ending the public sector pay freeze and making sure all workers are paid a decent wage is an absolutely must, and it needs to be on the agenda for the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Speech.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A neat summary of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data: House price inflation has also risen, thanks to a pick-up in prices in London. The average house price rose by 5.6% in the 12 months to April, to \u00c2\u00a3220,000. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 4.5% in the year to March 2017. The Office for National Statistics cautions that: While up against March 2017, there has been a general slowdown in the annual growth rate since mid-2016. London continues to be the region with the highest average house price at \u00c2\u00a3483,000, followed by the South East (\u00c2\u00a3315k) and the East of England, (\u00c2\u00a3281k). The North East still has the lowest average price (123k). In London, prices have risen by 4.7% in the last 12 months -- up from just 1.5% a month ago. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Evening Standard is splashing on the rise in inflation, and blaming it on the EU referendum. It warns that there is now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clear blue water\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between wages and inflation, adding that: There was growing concern in the City today that the hit to consumer spending power combined with political uncertainty following the loss of Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Commons majority will further undermine already slowing economic growth. Strangely, the front page doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mention that real wages also fell through most of their editor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time as chancellor (2010-2016)..... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a danger that the political deadlock in Westminster could push inflation higher in the months ahead, warns Stephen Clarke, economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation. And that could be particularly bad news for poorer families, if essential purchases like food and clothes keep climbing while benefits remain capped. Clarke says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest rise in inflation adds further pressure to already shrinking pay packets. The uncertain political environment, coupled with Brexit negotiations beginning in six days\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time, is already having an impact on sterling and could create further inflationary pressures down the track. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest rise in inflation will be a double blow to low-income working families, who are also seeing their tax credits fall in value as they have been frozen in cash terms. Many will wonder whether the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcend of austerity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 announced by the Prime Minister last night could mean a softening of the ongoing benefits freeze. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With no sign yet of pay settlements responding to rising inflation, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s renewed pay squeeze looks set to be longer and deeper than many originally expected.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ben Lord, who manages M&amp;G\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK Inflation Linked Corporate Bond Fund, predicts that CPI inflation will peak at 3% later this year. He also believes the Bank of England will resist any pressure to raise interest rates in response: At this point, with such high uncertainty about the direction of travel into Brexit negotiations, but with very significant downside risks, it seems extremely unlikely the Bank of England will tighten policy at this point. With so little evidence of domestic inflation pressures, and with most inflation coming from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctransient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and exogenous forces, governor Mark Carney will look through CPI at 3%, 4% even 5% perhaps. In fact, if Brexit negotiations commence poorly, and if the government can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get anything done without a workable majority and now with a viable and sizeable opposition, I would still argue that Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last move at the helm may be in the looser direction. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has been driven higher by the slump in the pounce since June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum, tweets Conservative MP George Freeman: Freeman argued we should remain in the EU. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, has sent over some advice on coping with inflation: check you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on a fixed rate energy tariff (one that guarantees the price you pay per unit) and if not switch make sure your savings are earning an interest rate that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s higher than the rate of inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c otherwise they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll lose buying power over time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you might need to think about high interest current accounts shop around for food and fuel so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not paying any more than you need to check whether you could cut your mortgage repayments by switching to a fixed rate deal if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on your lender\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s SVR The Child Poverty Action Group is urging the government to help struggling families cope with the ravages of inflation. Chief executive Alison Garnham says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unless there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an urgent re-think of the current freeze on benefits, the living standards of ordinary families will slip and slide downwards with serious consequences, particularly for children. Families are saying they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t manage. They need some leeway. Now is the time to ensure that benefits for working and non-working families once again reflect their needs and so rise with inflation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The failure to uprate benefits in line with inflation is the single biggest driver behind child poverty rising to 4 million and why it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s set to rise to over 5 million by the end of the new parliament.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This chart from Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ed Conway shows how Britain is now experiencing its second real wage squeeze since the financial crisis: The Telegraph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ben Wright points out that inflation is higher than the City, or the Bank of England, expected: Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, says inflation has hit \u00e2\u20ac\u0153eye-watering\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd levels. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rising prices coupled with lacklustre earnings growth means our wages aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keeping up with the rising cost living. Our real income are being squeezed and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re witnessing this impacting UK consumer spending, which fell for the first time in nearly four years in May as consumers tightened their belts. This is bad news for an economy which relies on confident consumers spending on goods and services - already we are seeing signs of a stagnating economy as confidence among companies and consumers falter. Election result paralysis will only add to the UK economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes. Readers may remember that inflation was rather higher back in the 1970s -- but the key point is that wages aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keeping pace. Currie explains why inflation is a concern: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation never seems like a problem until suddenly it is and while it may be good news for borrowers, as it erodes the value of their debts, it has detrimental implications for savers, investors and retirees, chipping away at the value of future interest and dividend payments and eroding the worth of your capital pot. Once pricing pressures become entrenched, consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 feel the pain, businesses don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t invest and the stock market gets worried. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says the government must respond to the wage squeeze by ending the 1% cap on public sector pay rises: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The election showed that working people are struggling. And the biggest price rises in four years won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide any comfort. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Working people are still \u00c2\u00a320 a week off worse, on average, than they were before the crash \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and now rising prices are hammering their pay packets again. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The new government must stop the real wage slide. Ministers must focus on delivering better-paid jobs all around the UK. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to lift the artificial pay restrictions in the public sector. Our hardworking nurses and teachers are long overdue a pay rise.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Britains\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 household finance squeeze has intensified, warns Ben Brettell, senior economist at financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers from the ONS showed inflation jumped to a fresh four-year high of 2.9%, as a fall in the price of motor fuels failed to offset higher prices for energy, food and recreational goods. Lower air fares also had a downward effect as the Easter holiday drops out of the calculation. Economists had expected the rate to remain at 2.7%. Wage data out tomorrow is expected to confirm pay is shrinking in real terms, and a report out yesterday from Visa confirms consumers are under pressure, with spending falling 0.8% year-on-year in May. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report: UK inflation jumped to a four-year high of 2.9% in May, signalling a sustained fall in living standards as prices rose faster than wages. The consumer prices index went up from 2.7% in April and has been steadily increasing since the Brexit vote a year ago, which triggered a sharp drop in the value of the pound and pushed up the cost of goods imported from abroad. Inflation was 0.3% in May 2016, a month before the EU referendum. At 2.9%, inflation is higher than average year-on-year wage growth of 2.1% in the three months to March, putting pressure on household budgets. It is also well above the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. Economists had expected inflation to stay at 2.7%. Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec, said inflation was likely to rise further in the coming months, as the weaker pound continues to feed through to higher shop prices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our view is that inflation will rise steadily to a little above 3% by the summer,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, should sterling resume an upward trend and energy prices slip further in US dollar terms, there is a chance that inflation remains below the 3% level.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A Treasury spokesperson has responded to the jump in inflation, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe government is helping families with the everyday cost of living by keeping taxes low, freezing fuel duty and increasing the National Living Wage. A typical basic rate taxpayer now pays \u00c2\u00a31,000 less income tax than in 2010 and increases in the National Living Wage mean \u00c2\u00a31,400 extra a year for a worker since its introduction.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more detail from the Office for National Statistics about why inflation jumped to 2.9% last month: The largest upward effect came from a variety of recreational and cultural goods and services with prices rising, overall, by 0.9% between April and May 2017 compared with a fall of 0.4% a year ago. Within this category the major contribution came from games, toys and hobbies, particularly computer games. Food prices rose slightly between April and May this year compared with a fall a year ago. The latest rise continues the upward movement observed from late 2016 and comes from a variety of product groups, particularly sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery where prices of cartons and boxes of chocolates rose between April and May this year. Prices for clothing rose by 0.6% between April and May this year compared with a fall of 0.3% a year ago. The upward effect came principally from children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothing. Sales patterns may have contributed to the price movements, as the proportion of items on sale fell between April and May this year, having risen a year ago. Prices for furniture and household goods rose by 1.2% between April and May this year, the largest rise between these two months since 2008. Between the same two months in 2016, prices rose by 0.4%. The main upward contributions came from lounge furniture and household textiles. There was also a significant upward effect from electricity as further price increases entered the index in May. This is a part of the broader housing and household services heading within which the effect is partially offset by a downward contribution from owner occupiers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 housing costs. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more inflation coming down the pipeline, warns Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group: Inflation is now rising faster than the Bank of England expected, points out Ben Chu of the Independent. This chart, from Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jamie McGeever, shows the impact of higher inflation on pay packets: The rise in inflation means that the cost of living squeeze has worsened. Earnings figures due tomorrow are expected to show that basic pay only rose by 2.0% in the last quarter, meaning they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have kept pace with inflation. This charts hows how the Consumer Price Index has jumped to its highest level since June 2013 (the yellow line). This shows how the cost of living has risen over the last year: Food, energy and recreational costs all helped to push inflation up in May. The Office for National Statistics say: Rising prices for recreational and cultural goods and services (particularly games, toys and hobbies) was the main contributor to the increase in the rate. There were smaller upward contributions from increased electricity and food prices. These upward contributions were partially offset by falls in motor fuel prices, and air and sea fares, the latter two influenced by the timing of Easter in April this year. Breaking! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has jumped to 2.9% in May - a new four-year high. More to follow.... The pound has now crept back over $1.27, a gain of half a cent today. Economist Rupert Seggins has tweeted some handy charts on inflation, ahead of May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer prices index report (due in around 10 minutes). This shows how inflation has risen sharply in recent months: This shows how it can take up to two years for a change in the value of the pound to fully feed into the economy: This shows how global food prices have stopped rising recently: And this show how the price of oil, in pound, surged after the Brexit vote: Merlin Entertainment, which runs many of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest theme parks and tourists attractions, has warned that demand has fallen since the terror attacks in London and Manchester. Shares in Merlin have fallen by 3%, to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, after it told that City that fewer domestic tourists have been making day trips to its sites - whihc include Alton Towers, the Sea Life centres, and Legoland. Nick Varney, Merlin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, struck a suitably upbeat and uncowed tone, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The impact of recent terror attacks on our London attractions is unclear at this stage.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What is clear, however, is that London has bounced back before and will do again. I have every confidence in the longer term resilience and growth trajectory of the market. London is very much open for business, welcoming visitors from the UK and from around the world to this exciting and vibrant city.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: European stock markets have risen in early trading, with the FTSE 100 gaining around 0.25%. The pound is also pushing back towards $1.27 ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation data. Connor Campbell of SpreadEX believes the City is welcoming the prospect of a softer Brexit (assuming Michael Barnier finally gets some company at the negotiating table): The pound has woken in a better mood than it did yesterday, lifting 0.2% against the dollar and 0.3% against the euro. The FTSE also looked a bit chirpier, rising 0.3% to sit at 7530. art of that positivity will stem from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters poll stating that the risk of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit has fallen following Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to secure a Tory majority; that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the same as the PM now chasing a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exit from the EU, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still good news for sterling. Cabinet minister Michael Gove, who campaigned to leave the EU last year, has dropped a hint that Britain is inching away from a hard Brexit. City traders should also take note that Michel Barnier, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief Brexit negotiator, is running out of patience. Barnier has told the Financial Times that Britain risks crashing out of the EU in March 2019 without a deal on future relations if it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wastes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd more time. Barnier pointed out that no progress has been made since Britain triggered Article 50 in March, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Next week, it will be three months after the sending of the Article 50 letter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t negotiated, we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t progressed. Thus we must begin this negotiation. We are ready as soon as the UK itself is ready.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In a sign of exasperation, Barnier even pointed out that he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t negotiate with himself! Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction from our Brussels correspondent, Jennifer Rankin: Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada agree that last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election shock has changed the Brexit landscape. But they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not sure, though, that Britain can maintain in the Single Market: Calls for a so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit need to be weighed against the reality that both Labour and the Conservatives had manifesto commitments to take the UK out of the Single Market. In any case, it looks as though the existence of a minority government with less authority in the House of Commons is set to fuel expectations that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit strategy could be modified in some way. During the campaign, Theresa May repeatedly said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal was better than a bad deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But there are signs that this position is, well, softening. My colleagues Anushka Asthana and Jessica Elgot reported last night that: Senior insiders say one of the ideas actively being considered to win backing across parliament was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not to major\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the controversial \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal is better than a bad deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd position taken by May before the election. Also under consideration is whether to exclude overseas students from the immigration numbers and even possibly to abandon the target to reduce immigration to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tens of thousands\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Although nothing has been agreed, any softening of the position on immigration could maximise the chance of a closer economic relationship with the EU. As the dust settles from last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election, economists are coming to the conclusion that Britain is less likely to exit the EU with a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to a new poll of City experts from Reuters, who say: The chances of Britain ending up outside the single market when Brexit talks are concluded have receded somewhat after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election, although the pound might weaken further against other currencies, a Reuters poll of economists found. Around two-thirds of the economists polled this week, 33 out of 49, said the chance of a hard Brexit had receded somewhat. Three said it had receded significantly, while eight said there was no change. Five said it had increased somewhat and none said increased significantly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The prime minister may have to change her stance and approach to Brexit following the election outcome,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Nikesh Sawjani at Lloyds Banking Group. More here: Likelihood of hard Brexit recedes after UK election - Reuters poll of economists Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about to find out how much damage the weak pound did to UK household budgets. New inflation data, due at 9.30am, is expected to show that prices rose by 2.7% year-on-year in May. That would match the four-year high struck in April, and mean that prices in the shops are rising faster than wages [which only rose by 2.1% in the year to March]. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says the figures come at a crucial time for the economy: We get to look under the bonnet of the UK economy this week, at a time when there is rising evidence that the UK consumer having enjoyed a post Brexit shopping spree is now scaling back as inflation starts to eat away at average earnings. Having started this year at 1.8% CPI inflation hit 2.7% in April and looks set to stay at this level in the latest May numbers which are due out later this morning. Core prices have also jumped sharply since the beginning of the year from 1.6% to 2.4% in April, though we are expected to see a slight moderation in the May numbers to 2.3%. There could be a silver lining given recent falls in oil prices, which might suggest that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a short term plateau for prices which could see prices start to fall back. Input prices in the last few months have shown some signs of falling back, and in both the US and the EU inflation has shown some signs of falling back which would be good news for hard pressed consumers, when wages are currently lagging behind. We also get a new report on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market, which may show that prices rose at a slower rate in April. So it will be a busy morning for City traders, who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have one eye on the economic data, and the other one on political developments after Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election. The pound has clawed back a little ground this morning, after hitting eight-month lows against the euro yesterday. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently trading around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.132, up 0.2%. Today, prime minister Theresa May is meeting DUP leader Arlene Foster to discuss a possible deal to prop up a minority Conservative administration. Last night, the PM apologised to her backbenchers for leading the party into such a mess. Senior colleagues have been making supportive noises, but May still looks weak and vulnerable - even if her premiership isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over quite yet. Also coming up today.. Brussels is expected to announce new proposals for how euro-denominated securities are cleared. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important for London, which currently dominates this market but could lose this lucrative (and important) business after Brexit. City AM has the details: The City is bracing itself for the European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed changes to the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir), due out on Tuesday morning. Brussels sources told City A.M. the proposals will include a mechanism giving the EU power to force relocation of euro clearing activity, which is currently dominated by London. A source familiar with the plans told City A.M.: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The commission is not going for the nuclear option.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nuclear option\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd would have seen the commission require all clearing of euro-denominated derivatives to take place within the EU... European stock markets are expected to rise this morning, with the FTSE 100 index called up 33 points. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9.30am BST: UK inflation report for May 9.30am BST: UK house price index for April 10am BST: German ZEW investor confidence report",

It is also now liable to face civil actions for damages by any person or business affected by its anti-competitive behaviour.</p> <p>As<strong> </strong>the EU official in charge of competition policy, commissioner Margrethe Vestager<strong>, </strong>spelled out the case against Google, she denied accusations that Brussels had a bias against US firms, claiming the tech giant had been guilty of an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153old school\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd form of illegality.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Google has come up with many innovative products and services that have made a difference to our lives.

A company spokesman said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you shop online, you want to find the products you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for quickly and easily.

                "bodyText":"The European Union has handed Google a record-breaking \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.42bn (\u00c2\u00a32.14bn) fine for abusing its dominance of the search engine market in building its online shopping service, in a dramatic decision that has far-reaching implications for the company. By artificially and illegally promoting its own price comparison service in searches, Google denied both its consumers real choice and rival firms the ability to compete on a level playing field, European regulators said. The Silicon Valley giant has 90 days to stop its illegal activities and explain how it will reform its ways or face fines of up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.6m a day, which equates to 5% of the average daily worldwide turnover of its parent company Alphabet. On the back of the finding that Google is the dominant player in the European search engine market, the EU regulator is further investigating how else the company may have abused its position, specifically in its provision of maps, images and information on local services. The commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision, following a seven-year probe into Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominance in searches and smartphones, suggests the company may need to fundamentally rethink the way it operates. It is also now liable to face civil actions for damages by any person or business affected by its anti-competitive behaviour. As the EU official in charge of competition policy, commissioner Margrethe Vestager, spelled out the case against Google, she denied accusations that Brussels had a bias against US firms, claiming the tech giant had been guilty of an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153old school\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd form of illegality. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Google has come up with many innovative products and services that have made a difference to our lives. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good thing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Vestager told reporters, as she announced the fine, the largest ever made in an antitrust case. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy for its comparison shopping service wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just about attracting customers by making its product better than those of its rivals. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Instead, Google abused its market dominance as a search engine by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results, and demoting those of competitors. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What Google has done is illegal under EU antitrust rules. It denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In the wake of the announcement, shares in Alphabet fell 1.5% in pre-market trading in New York. Vestager brushed off suggestions that the move could harm transatlantic relations, adding that the EU was not willing to give Google a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free pass\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She confirmed, however, that the EU regulator had stopped cooperating with the US Federal Trade Commission when it decided not to pursue charges in 2013. Google immediately rejected the commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings, and signalled its intention to appeal, in an indication of the gruelling legal battle to come between the two sides. A company spokesman said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you shop online, you want to find the products you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for quickly and easily. And advertisers want to promote those same products. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why Google shows shopping ads, connecting our users with thousands of advertisers, large and small, in ways that are useful for both. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today.
