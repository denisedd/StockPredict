Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ADP payrolls number has really grabbed investor attention, with the 253,000 reading providing yet more clues that we will see the Fed raise rates once more this month. Tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls figure is undoubtedly the big release of the week, as this will largely provide confirmation of whether the Fed will actually act this month.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US dollar got a significant uplift after a bumper ADP payrolls report for May which showed that 253k new jobs were added, with most of them in the services sector. As a bellwether for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official payrolls report it could well rubber stamp the prospect of a move in June, but also raise expectations of a further hike as soon as September. The main puzzle for a lot of people given the number of jobs being added is the weak nature of wage growth which still remains lacklustre. </p> </blockquote> <p>Despite the dollar strength, sterling has not been hit too hard. Hewson again:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound has managed to hold up fairly well despite another poll showing a narrow lead for the Conservative party, as the focus returns to the UK economy. Another decent manufacturing report for the month of May saw decent gains in new orders as well as employment. Rising prices remained a concern but they also showed further signs of easing back. </p> </blockquote> <p>The latest election poll shows an 8 point lead for the Conservatives over Labour, down from 15 points on May 23.</p> <p><strong> <br></strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59302157e4b0be3ed1921ce6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-01T14:16:32.561Z\">3.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The ISM survey adds more impetus for the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this months, says ING Bank economist James Knightley:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The key manufacturing survey suggests strong order books will keep output robust with employment picking up nicely.</p> <p>The US ISM manufacturing index for May has barely changed from April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rising to 54.9 from 54.8. The consensus had expected it to hold steady. Production slipped marginally to stand at 57.1 versus 58.6 previously, but new orders rose to 59.5 from 57.5 so it looks as though the pipeline for output remains very strong given both readings are well above the break-even 50 level. The employment component moved higher to 53.5 from 52.0, which offers encouragement for the jobs story as well. As such, the manufacturing sector is clearly a source of strength right now and the report boosts the case for a Fed rate hike at the June 14 FOMC meeting.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59301fede4b0be3ed1921cdb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-01T14:14:26.981Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Meanwhile US construction spending recorded its biggest drop in a year in April.</strong></p> <p>With slowing investment in both public and private projects, spending fell by 1.4% compared to expectations of a 0.5% rise.</p> <p>But the March figure was revised up from an initial 0.2% decline to a rise of 1.1%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59301e1ae4b0bdd87e2f22b8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-01T14:08:36.491Z\">3.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US manufacturing edges higher - ISM</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In fact the second manufacturing survey has confounded expectations by showing a slight rise rather than a slight dip.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/ismreport/mfgrob.cfm?SSO=1\">ISM manufacturing activity index </a>has increased from 54.8 in April to 54.9 last month, better than the 54.5 forecast by analysts.

Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ADP payrolls number has really grabbed investor attention, with the 253,000 reading providing yet more clues that we will see the Fed raise rates once more this month. Tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls figure is undoubtedly the big release of the week, as this will largely provide confirmation of whether the Fed will actually act this month. However, with markets already pricing in a 100% chance of a rate rise, there is reason to believe we could see a lower degree of volatility than usual. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 23.82 points or 0.32% higher at 7543.77 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.4% to 12,664.92 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.66% higher at 5318.67 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB climbed 0.99% to 20,936.07 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.01% better at 10,881.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.85% to 781.85 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 54 points or 0.27% higher. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. After a nervous opening, Wall Street has the wind in its sails. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 46 points or 0.22% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have both hit new highs. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Crude inventories are tanking if the latest data from the EIA is anything to go by, with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading providing the biggest weekly draw-down in 2017. The recent OPEC decision to extend production cuts was treated with disdain, yet there is reason to believe that their actions are gradually managing to reduce global crude inventories despite rising output in the likes of the US. More signs of growing demand for oil, with US crude stocks falling last week by the biggest amount so far this year. Crude supplies fell by 6.43m barrels to 509.91m, compared to expectations of a 2.5m decline. Gasoline stocks were also down by more than analysts had been forecasting, according to the Energy Information Administration. The news has pushed crude prices higher, with West Texas Intermediate up 0.56% to $48.59 a barrel and Brent crude 0.37% better at $50.95. Sterling is now moving higher against both the dollar and the euro, shrugging off worries about the latest election opinion polls and buoyed by the decent UK manufacturing data. It is now up 0.12% against the dollar at $1.2905 and 0.29% higher against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1490. More on the currency markets. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The US dollar got a significant uplift after a bumper ADP payrolls report for May which showed that 253k new jobs were added, with most of them in the services sector. As a bellwether for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official payrolls report it could well rubber stamp the prospect of a move in June, but also raise expectations of a further hike as soon as September. The main puzzle for a lot of people given the number of jobs being added is the weak nature of wage growth which still remains lacklustre. Despite the dollar strength, sterling has not been hit too hard. Hewson again: The pound has managed to hold up fairly well despite another poll showing a narrow lead for the Conservative party, as the focus returns to the UK economy. Another decent manufacturing report for the month of May saw decent gains in new orders as well as employment. Rising prices remained a concern but they also showed further signs of easing back. The latest election poll shows an 8 point lead for the Conservatives over Labour, down from 15 points on May 23. The ISM survey adds more impetus for the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this months, says ING Bank economist James Knightley: The key manufacturing survey suggests strong order books will keep output robust with employment picking up nicely. The US ISM manufacturing index for May has barely changed from April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rising to 54.9 from 54.8. The consensus had expected it to hold steady. Production slipped marginally to stand at 57.1 versus 58.6 previously, but new orders rose to 59.5 from 57.5 so it looks as though the pipeline for output remains very strong given both readings are well above the break-even 50 level. The employment component moved higher to 53.5 from 52.0, which offers encouragement for the jobs story as well. As such, the manufacturing sector is clearly a source of strength right now and the report boosts the case for a Fed rate hike at the June 14 FOMC meeting. Meanwhile US construction spending recorded its biggest drop in a year in April. With slowing investment in both public and private projects, spending fell by 1.4% compared to expectations of a 0.5% rise. But the March figure was revised up from an initial 0.2% decline to a rise of 1.1%. In fact the second manufacturing survey has confounded expectations by showing a slight rise rather than a slight dip. The ISM manufacturing activity index has increased from 54.8 in April to 54.9 last month, better than the 54.5 forecast by analysts. Timothy Fiore, ISM chair, said: Comments from the panel generally reflect stable to growing business conditions, with new orders, employment and inventories of raw materials all growing in May compared to April. The slowing of pricing pressure, especially in basic commodities, should have a positive impact on margins and buying policies as this moderation moves up the value chain. And here are some comments from the survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s respondents: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sales have picked up compared to the last two months. Customer demand has increased.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Plastics &amp; Rubber Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Economy is still strong, but [the] political climate can change things very quickly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Transportation Equipment) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Global price increases for commodities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Electrical Equipment, Appliances &amp; Components) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business (sales/production) is steady. Pricing pressures on raw materials. Skilled labor in short supply.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Furniture &amp; Related Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Agricultural demand very strong.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Chemical Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our business is definitely paying attention to developments with the Canadian lumber tariff announcement. The final outcome could change our fiber pricing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Paper Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153OEM longer lead parts possibly longer lead time due to more orders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Nonmetallic Mineral Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business conditions are steady, and with competition increasing, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s making negotiations even more intense to reduce costs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Machinery) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business is booming, and getting direct employees is increasingly difficult.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Fabricated Metal Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Difficult to find qualified labor for factory positions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products) Commenting on the US PMI, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: Manufacturing growth momentum continued to ebb in May, down to its weakest since just before the presidential election. Manufacturing output, order books and employment all grew at only modest rates as sluggish sales prompted firms to scale back hiring. Exports sales remained especially lacklustre, hampered in part by the relatively strong dollar. The survey also brought signs of companies becoming more cautious about holding inventory. Factories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 raw material prices meanwhile rose at a sharply reduced rate, which should at least help take pressure off profit margins and also feed through to weaker pressure on consumer price inflation. The rival ISM survey is due shortly, and is also expected to show a slight dip from the April figure. The first of the two US manufacturing surveys has come in better than the initial reading but has shown a very slight dip from the previous month. The Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index has slipped from 52.8 in April to 52.7 last month, compared to a first estimate of 52.5. While this is still in expansion territory it is the lowest reading since September. US markets have made a tentative start to the new month, despite the strong private sector jobs data and ahead of two rival manufacturing surveys for May. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 9 points while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have edged marginally higher at the open. The dollar is rallying after the stronger than expected private sector jobs figures, ahead of the non-farm payrolls due on Friday. The US currency is up 0.5% against the yen and 0.2% better against the euro. And the pound is currently 0.13% lower at $1.2874. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen plenty of encouraging economic news this morning, with factory output rising in the UK and also in the eurozone, strong job creation in America, and an upgrade to Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP. But this is no time for complacency. The chief executive of the World Bank has just warned governments to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuckle up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, ready for the next crisis. Kristalina Georgieva warned an audience at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum that the rise in financial, economic and terror-related emergencies is becoming the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She explained: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m asking myself what has changed in this decade and my conclusion is what has changed probably can be summed up with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuckle up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are now at the point when shocks are more frequent. Unexpected crises are maybe not more dramatic than they used to be before, but they are very impolite, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait their turn.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In the past, Georgieva argued, governments would be faced with one \u00e2\u20ac\u0153massive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd crisis at a time. Now, they come in battalions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you just look at the last years, we had financial crisis, economic crisis, eurozone crisis, terrorism, geopolitical crises, and neither institutions or businesses are well tuned to deal with more than one shock at a time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have to really figure out - if this is the new normal, and I happen to think this is the new normal - how we can have more resilient , more agile and more adaptable government policies, (and) private sector behaviour so that (work) security can be put on a sound foundation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thanks to the Press Association for the quotes. More American employment data just landed. And it shows that the number of US citizens filing new claims for unemployment benefit has risen to 248,000, from 235,000 a week ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than expected, but remains low by historical standards. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector created 253,000 new jobs in May, substantially more than expected. Economists had predicted that the monthly ADP payroll would rise by 185,000, and these blow-out figure suggest tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll could also be impressive. More than 200,000 jobs were created in the service sector, including 88,000 in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprofessional and business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sector. There were also small gains in manufacturing and mining, and 37,000 new hires in construction. Brian Wesbury, chief economist at First Trust Portfolios, says the report shows that the US economy is motoring along quite nicely. But economists are also looking for signs that wage growth is picking up. International Airlines Group CEO Willie Walsh has broken his silence over the disruption that grounded over a thousand British Airways flights last weekend. Speaking to the BBC, Walsh said he was pleased that BA has recovered from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant disruption\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that it faced on Saturday. And he insist that the IT meltdown was caused by a power outage, rather than a problem with BA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology, saying: We clearly apologise to any customers who were disrupted. It was not an IT failure. It was a problem caused by the failure of electrical power to our IT systems. We understand what happened, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still investigating why it happened, and that investigation will take some time. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that IT experts have told us that a power surge could not cause such a catastrophic outage. Walsh added that the team at BA did \u00e2\u20ac\u0153everything they could\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to recover the situation. Clearly we will do everything we can to make up for the disruption that passengers suffered, he concludes. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got bad news for wine lovers out there. The average price of a bottle in the UK has risen over \u00c2\u00a35.50 for the first time ever. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122a according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, which blames the fall in sterling following last June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. Miles Beale, WSTA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Last year the WSTA predicted that Brexit and the fall in the value of the pound, compounded by rising inflation, would force the UK wine industry to up their prices. Sadly this is now a reality as an average priced bottle of wine in the UK is at an all-time high. Unfortunately, for both British businesses and consumers, we are clear that this is not a one off adjustment, but rather that wine prices will continue to rise. What is even more concerning is that this does not take into account the inflationary duty rise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at a painful 3.9% - on alcohol inflicted by the Chancellor in the March Budget. Billionaire-turned-philanthropist George Soros has weighed in on Brexit this morning, saying the European Union needs to be radically re-invented. Soros also argued that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the EU will take much longer than the two-year window set under the Lisbon Treaty. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Negotiating the separation with Britain will divert the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention from its own existential crisis, and the talks are bound to last longer than the two years allotted to them. Five years seems more likely.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Our Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin has more details: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unrest at the Bank of England this morning. Workers at Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank are to be balloted on strike action, after being offered a pay rise of just 1%. Unite regional officer Mercedes Sanchez has blasted the BoE, calling it arrogant and out of touch: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disgraceful snub of low paid staff stinks of arrogance and represents an organisation thoroughly out of touch with the reality of the pressure staff face meeting their costs of living. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a source of shame that an iconic symbol of financial services in the UK is choosing to ride roughshod over the concerns of its dedicated and hardworking staff and impose this derisory pay deal. In effect, staff are facing a real terms pay cut. A 1% rise in wages won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep pace with inflation, which has just jut a four-year high of 2.7%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ahead of the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own target of 2%. Unite represent security, catering, legal, and human resource staff at the Bank. Update: Apparently Unite represent 2% of all BoE staff. Sky News has more details. Economists have welcomed the news that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing PMI dipped to 56.7 in May, from 57 in April, showing solid growth. Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply says manufacturers are shrugging off political uncertainty: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While not quite hitting the heights of April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound in activity, the manufacturing sector didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disappoint with a sustained rise in purchasing activity, output and new orders, optimism at a 20- month high, and storming ahead unfazed by the looming election. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The domestic market persisted as the driving force, but the weak pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continuing bounty meant levels of export orders also increased, for the thirteenth month, as export markets made use of the competitiveness of UK firms. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation, agrees that UK manufacturing is in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood shape\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Output and orders expansion is being driven by resilient demand coming through UK supply chains and a better looking global economy than UK manufacturers have been used to for some time. Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays, says the weak pound is helping exporters, but could bite UK customers in the pocket: Exporters have continued to take advantage of a weak sterling, which has kept British exports competitive on a global stage, and at a time when the world economy is showing signs of improvement. However, rising cost pressures are still circling, not only from elevated import costs but also from the growing effect of domestic costs from sources such as energy and staffing which will all contribute to fuelling inflation. Although manufacturers have resisted passing on these costs to date, the expectation of price rises is becoming more apparent in the sector.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chris Leyland, analyst at investment firm True Potential, says factory bosses face some pressures: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure is above 50, meaning expansion is still happening, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just that the rate has slowed compared to last month. There are a number of reasons for that, mostly stemming from the weaker pound pushing up import cost for factories and therefore prices for the end consumer. It also means consumers have less disposable income, because their food and fuel bills have risen. The price of oil has also increased, leading to higher fuel costs for manufacturers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The key will be exports, because the weaker pound means factories may receive more orders from abroad, which could offset some domestic pain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Williamson flags up that export growth slowed a little in May: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector has continued to shrug off Brexit, by posting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153further marked growth in May\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI survey from Markit, which shows that UK factory growth was close to April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three-year high. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the topline: UK factory bosses reported that they benefitted from domestic demand, and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153solid increase\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in new export business. Optimism regarding the outlook for production levels in one year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time rose to a 20-month high. This is also feeding into the jobs market; factory employment rose for the tenth consecutive month in May, at the fastest rate since June 2014. In short, it all suggests that the manufacturing sector is holding up well. Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The strong PMI numbers suggest the manufacturing sector has gained growth momentum in the second quarter after the sluggish start of the year. The ongoing strength of the domestic market remains the main driver of the upturn. Growth of new export business played a lesser role in comparison, with the trend in foreign demand continuing to improve only in fits and starts, despite the assistance of a historically weak sterling exchange rate.

Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate has been revised sharply higher, in another sign that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery is strengthening. Italian GDP rose by 0.4% in January-to-March, new figures show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twice as fast as first estimated. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also twice as fast as Britain managed in Q1, and confirms that the UK was the weakest-performing G7 member at the start of this year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details of the surge in manufacturing employment across the eurozone last month: Staffing levels rose at quicker rates in Germany (six- year high), Italy (just below October 1999\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s series- record), Spain (fastest in 19 years), Ireland (two-year peak) and Austria (two-month high). Slower increases were registered in France and the Netherlands, while Greece reported jobs growth for the first time in six months. Newsflash: Eurozone factories have just racked up their fastest growth in six years. The euro-area manufacturing PMI has come in at 57.0, up from 56.7 in April, thanks to faster growth in output and new orders. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector led the way, with growth at a 73-month high. Most other eurozone countries also posted growth, but Greece brought up the rear with another contraction. And the really good news is that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories have created more jobs in May than at any time since this survey began, 20 years ago. Markit says: The ongoing expansion of the eurozone manufacturing sector gathered further momentum in May. Growth in output and new orders accelerated to the best seen for around six years, to underpin the strongest job creation in the 20-year survey history. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, says the surveys show Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery is strengthening: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The eurozone upturn is developing deeper roots as factories enjoy a spring growth spurt. Demand for goods is growing at the steepest rate for six years, encouraging manufacturers to step up production and take on extra staff at a rate not previously seen in the two-decade history of the PMI survey. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fact that the upturn is being accompanied by such strong jobs growth sends a signal that increasing numbers of companies are moving away from a focus on cost cutting towards investing in expansion, underscoring the elevated levels of business optimism seen across the region. The record hiring adds to the sense that the upturn is looking more and more robust as each month goes by. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories have expanded faster than their French rivals last month: Good news from Spain! Spanish factories are taking on new staff at the fastest rate since 1998, after posting another month of growth. The Spanish manufacturing PMI hit a four-month high of 55.4 in May, up from 54.5 in April. Firms reported a rise in output and new orders, encouraging them to take on extra workers to deal with the demand. Spain has suffered one of the worst unemployment crisis of any eurozone country since the financial crisis, so this is very encouraging. Andrew Harker, senior economist at IHS Markit, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153May was an excellent month for workers in the Spanish manufacturing sector as firms took on staff at the strongest pace for 19 years. Moreover, with new work rising healthily again and further signs of capacity coming under pressure, the likelihood is that jobs will continue to be created at a decent clip over the near-term at least. The first eurozone manufacturing report of the day was quite a belter. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory PMI jumped to 55.9 in May from 55.0 in April, signalling \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a marked improvement in business conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level in 22 months. Investec, which produces the report, says: Respondents linked higher output to rising new orders and improving economic conditions. New business also rose at a faster pace in May amid reports of stronger client demand. We have fresh evidence that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market is cooling. House prices fell by 0.2% in May, reports Nationwide, which is the third monthly fall in a row. That hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happened since 2009 - the dark days of the financial crisis. On an annual basis, prices are only 2.1% higher than a year ago - another sign that demand is cooling off. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Economist, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153House prices recorded their third consecutive monthly fall in May \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first time this has occurred since 2009. The annual rate of growth slowed to 2.1%, the weakest in almost four years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is still early days, but this provides further evidence that the housing market is losing momentum. Moreover, this may be indicative of a wider slowdown in the household sector, though data continues to send mixed signals in this regard. Worries over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy are intensifying this morning after new data showed its manufacturing sector is shrinking. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index (PMI) fell to 49.6 in May, from 50.1 in April. That signals that activity contracted last month, for the first time in nearly a year. Chinese firms reported that output grew at the weakest level in 11 months, due to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmuted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 growth in new orders from domestic and overseas customers. Firms also slashed jobs again, at the fastest rate since last September. Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, said there are signs that Chinese factories are struggling. The sub-index of stocks of purchases signalled a renewed decline, while the sub-index of stocks of finished goods rebounded, indicating that companies have stopped actively restocking as inventories began to stack up. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector has come under greater pressure in May and the economy is clearly on a downward trajectory.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Caixin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey is weaker than the official Chinese PMIs.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new month, and that means a new flurry of economic data. June is kicking off with new surveys of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories, from China to the US via Europe. The Purchasing Manager Indexes are expected to show that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery continued last month, with eurozone manufacturing growth possibly hitting a six-year high. The UK data will also be closely scrutinised. Economists predict a small slowdown in growth last month. RBC Capital Markets say: Another set of robust numbers would make the Q1 slowdown seem potentially transitory, whereas softer data would instead leave the April upturn looking like a positive blip amidst mounting evidence of a slowing economy. Our economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 central expectation remains that the consumer-led slowdown will be more durable, so our bias is to look for a pullback in the PMIs to confirm this. The City has already woken up to some disappointing data from China, where factory activity contracted for the first time in 11 months (more on that shortly). The pound continues to bob around like a cork in a stormy sea, as the UK general election approaches. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shed almost half a cent this morning, to $1.285, after a new YouGov poll showed a mere 3 point gap between the Conservatives and Labour. Other polls, though, have given Theresa May a larger lead, so traders are suitably cautious. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 8.15am to 9am: Eurozone manufacturing PMIs are released 9.30am: UK manufacturing PMIs 1.15pm: US ADP payroll of private sector jobs 1.30pm: US weekly jobless figures 3pm: US manufacturing PMIs",

So most stock markets have fallen back again, while the dollar has hit a seven month low. Oil has recovered some of its early losses after the latest tensions in the Middle East, with Brent crude edging up 0.2% to $49.57 a barrel having fallen as low as $49.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 has ended virtually flat, outperforming the bulk of its European peers, as the latest polls show a Conservative lead. The FTSE 250, hit by weakness in sterling, has lost 1%, its worst daily performance since the middle of April. The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 edged down 0.81 points or 0.01% at 7524.95</strong></li> <li><strong>The FTSE 250 fell 1.08% to 19,654.84</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.04% to 12,690.12</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.73% at 5269.22</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished up 0.19% at 20,760.01</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.05% at 10,879.7</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market dropped 1.15% to 777.53</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 21 points or 0.1%.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day.

Marchel Alexandrovich, senior European economist at Jefferies, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On Thursday the ECB is widely expected to change some of the language around its forward guidance, but the implications of these changes are likely to be downplayed by Mario Draghi during the Q&amp;A session.</p> <p>In the last two meetings the ECB hinted that a further cut to the depo rate was unlikely \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and we expect this position to be formally confirmed in the Monetary Policy Decisions statement. However, the shift to a more neutral policy stance with regards to interest rates will not affect the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other key messages: the depo rate will remain at present level until after QE comes to an end; and QE will carry on until the end of the year \u00e2\u20ac\u0153or beyond, if necessary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>All in all, the take-away is expected to be that while the ECB is taking a small step toward eventual policy normalisation, this process is not on a predetermined path. For the markets, Draghi is unlikely to provide any useful guidance in terms of when tapering may start, or what form it may take.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5acae04e7749d6fda38f88309732f6c55f0cd55f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5acae04e7749d6fda38f88309732f6c55f0cd55f/0_148_3080_1849/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Draghi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Draghi</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5936c681e4b00493c8279f62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-06T15:13:33.943Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Reuters take on the US job openings figures:</p> <blockquote> <p>U.S. job openings surged to a record high in April while hiring slowed, suggesting a recent moderation in job growth was the result of employers having difficulties finding qualified workers.</p> <p>The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released by the Labor Department on Tuesday showed there were 6.0 million job openings on the last day of business in April, an increase of 259,000 from March.

Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There has been a clear shift into haven trades to protect against any fireworks following key events on Thursday. Brits heading to the polls, central bankers deciding interest rates in Europe and testimony from FBI Director Comey all pose a threat. With three big events clustered in one day, it only takes one to go way to set things off.</p> <p>Stocks mostly retreated with a tendency for more defensive areas of the market to outperform. Utilities, a typical haven when staying invested in stocks rose over half-a-percent on the Euro Stoxx 600 while most other sectors were lower...</p> <p>A 1% decline in the FTSE 250 while FTSE 100 was essentially flat on the day was notable. Investors appear to be shunning UK domestic shares before the election. Within the broader FTSE 350, retail shares were biggest decliners, which are typically closely tied to the health of the British economy. While a Labour victory remains a distant outlier, polls would indicate a hung parliament is possible. The fear is that with the country entering at least two-years of economic uncertainty because of the Brexit negotiations, higher personal and business taxes under a new government could tip the economy over the edge.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5936bb8be4b0bdd87e2f3e75\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-06T14:33:18.889Z\">3.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nick_bunker/status/872097945117655041\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JOLTS?src=hash\">#JOLTS</a> Graph time!

The Job Openings and Labor Turnovers Survey (JOLTS) gives another snapshot of the state of the employment market, with indications on job openings, hiring, layoffs and the quit rate. The latter in particular, if it is increasing, shows a more optimistic market, if employees feel confident enough to leave their jobs in search of new ones.

Repeated weakness from the Rand should encourage a further incline towards 13.0000 on the USDZAR.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-06-06T12:06:25.606Z\">at 1.06pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59368fece4b0bdd87e2f3d78\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-06T11:37:46.847Z\">12.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jun/06/uk-retail-sales-us-dollar-eurozone-confidence-business-live?page=with:block-593679d3e4b0bdd87e2f3cf3#block-593679d3e4b0bdd87e2f3cf3\">South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide into recession</a> piles more pressure on president Jacob Zuma.</strong></p> <p>Zuma was already feeling the heat over his links to the wealthy and influential Gupta family. </p> <p>Last week, leaked emails purported to show that the Gupta family had used their friendship with Zuma to advance their business interests.</p> <p>Zuma had previously repeatedly denied <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/28/guptagate-family-sells-south-africa-holdings-after-jacob-zuma-influence-claims\">allegations that the Guptas had unfairly won state contracts, and even influenced the choice of government ministers</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59368b19e4b00493c8279e1b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-06T11:16:18.513Z\">12.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Magda_Wierzycka\">Magda Wierzycka</a>, CEO of financial services group <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sygnia\">Sygnia</a>, says South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaders need to focus on fixing its economy:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Magda_Wierzycka/status/872042618687025154\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">South Africa in an official recession.

                "bodyText":"Investors are being rather cautious ahead of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK election, ECB meeting and the testimony by ex-FBI boss James Comey. So most stock markets have fallen back again, while the dollar has hit a seven month low. Oil has recovered some of its early losses after the latest tensions in the Middle East, with Brent crude edging up 0.2% to $49.57 a barrel having fallen as low as $49. The FTSE 100 has ended virtually flat, outperforming the bulk of its European peers, as the latest polls show a Conservative lead. The FTSE 250, hit by weakness in sterling, has lost 1%, its worst daily performance since the middle of April. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 edged down 0.81 points or 0.01% at 7524.95 The FTSE 250 fell 1.08% to 19,654.84 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.04% to 12,690.12 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.73% at 5269.22 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished up 0.19% at 20,760.01 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.05% at 10,879.7 In Greece, the Athens market dropped 1.15% to 777.53 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 21 points or 0.1%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. One of the big events on Thursday is the latest meeting of the European Central Bank, with president Mario Draghi expected to make a minor shift in the tone of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message. Marchel Alexandrovich, senior European economist at Jefferies, said: On Thursday the ECB is widely expected to change some of the language around its forward guidance, but the implications of these changes are likely to be downplayed by Mario Draghi during the Q&amp;A session. In the last two meetings the ECB hinted that a further cut to the depo rate was unlikely \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and we expect this position to be formally confirmed in the Monetary Policy Decisions statement. However, the shift to a more neutral policy stance with regards to interest rates will not affect the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other key messages: the depo rate will remain at present level until after QE comes to an end; and QE will carry on until the end of the year \u00e2\u20ac\u0153or beyond, if necessary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. All in all, the take-away is expected to be that while the ECB is taking a small step toward eventual policy normalisation, this process is not on a predetermined path. For the markets, Draghi is unlikely to provide any useful guidance in terms of when tapering may start, or what form it may take. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Reuters take on the US job openings figures: U.S. job openings surged to a record high in April while hiring slowed, suggesting a recent moderation in job growth was the result of employers having difficulties finding qualified workers. The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released by the Labor Department on Tuesday showed there were 6.0 million job openings on the last day of business in April, an increase of 259,000 from March. Hiring decreased by 253,000 jobs to 5.1 million. Investors are shying away from risk at the moment, with precious metals and defensive shares reaping the benefit. Gold is at its highest level in seven weeks, up $14 to $1293 an ounce, while silver is up from $17.54 to $17.68 an ounce. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: There has been a clear shift into haven trades to protect against any fireworks following key events on Thursday. Brits heading to the polls, central bankers deciding interest rates in Europe and testimony from FBI Director Comey all pose a threat. With three big events clustered in one day, it only takes one to go way to set things off. Stocks mostly retreated with a tendency for more defensive areas of the market to outperform. Utilities, a typical haven when staying invested in stocks rose over half-a-percent on the Euro Stoxx 600 while most other sectors were lower... A 1% decline in the FTSE 250 while FTSE 100 was essentially flat on the day was notable. Investors appear to be shunning UK domestic shares before the election. Within the broader FTSE 350, retail shares were biggest decliners, which are typically closely tied to the health of the British economy. While a Labour victory remains a distant outlier, polls would indicate a hung parliament is possible. The fear is that with the country entering at least two-years of economic uncertainty because of the Brexit negotiations, higher personal and business taxes under a new government could tip the economy over the edge. And here are the job openings figures, and they have come in at a record high. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, job openings rose from a revised 5.78m in March to 6m in April, the highest level since the survey began. But hires were weaker, falling from 5.3m to 5m while the quits rate edged marginally lower from 2.2% to 2.1%. Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US non-farm payroll numbers were much weaker than expected, but analysts agreed they were unlikely to prevent the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates next week. But some observers suggested they could slow down the pace of any further rises. Another set of US jobs data is due shortly, and it is one that Fed chair Janet Yellen is known to pay particular attention too, even if it is not as well followed as the non-farm numbers. The Job Openings and Labor Turnovers Survey (JOLTS) gives another snapshot of the state of the employment market, with indications on job openings, hiring, layoffs and the quit rate. The latter in particular, if it is increasing, shows a more optimistic market, if employees feel confident enough to leave their jobs in search of new ones. However David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, said the job opening figure could see a decline on last month: The expectation is for 5.65 million, and that compares with 5.74 million in March. This report will be of particular importance given the disappointing non-farm payroll figure last week. Ahead of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s triple whammy of the UK election, European Central Bank meeting and ex-FBI director James Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony, US markets are following the trend elsewhere and heading lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 57 points or 0.28% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.26% lower and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.22%. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is down 0.26%, the FTSE 250 has fallen 0.95%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 1% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is 0.8% lower. The weakness in the pound is a factor behind a drop in the FTSE 250. At one point, the mid-cap index was on track for its worst day since November although it has recovered from its worst levels. Even so, the index is down 0.9% and currently sitting at a near three week low as jitters about the UK election continue to unsettle investors. To be fair, the mid-cap index has been hitting new highs in recent days so the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall needs to be seen in that context. After a bright start to the morning, the British pound has taken a lurch lower. Sterling is now down 0.2% today at $1.2875, as traders worry about Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, says sterling is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coming under renewed pressure from polls showing the Conservative Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s out-sized lead dwindling.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Those polls have left investors scratching their heads. Last night, Survation released a phone poll giving the Conservatives a lead of just 1 percentage point. Other pollsters have reported a much wider gap, with ICM putting Theresa May 11 points ahead. And then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s YouGov, whose controversial daily seat projections suggests the Conservatives will fall short of a majority. Back in the UK, one of the bankers at the centre of the 2008 financial crisis is being spared from giving evidence about his actions in court. A group of Royal Bank of Scotland shareholders have settled their claim that they were misled when they backed its rights issue in 2008, shortly before its collapse. That means that Fred Goodwin, who lost his knighthood after RBS was nationalised, will not have to answer questions about the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demise. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: The South African rand has slumped to 12.875 to the US dollar, down from 12.7 yesterday. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM suspects it could fall further: Sentiment towards the South African economy took a hit on Tuesday following reports of the nation falling into a technical recession for the first time since 2009. The latest GDP data released by Stats SA showed that the economy declined by 0.7% in the first quarter of 2017 with all industries excluding agriculture and mining contracting. Despite this decline, there remains some optimism over GDP growth finding some ground and rebounding to 0.7% in the second quarter of 2017 amid the stabilizing economic data seen in recent months. The South African Rand weakened following this news with the USDZAR edging towards 12.9000. Repeated weakness from the Rand should encourage a further incline towards 13.0000 on the USDZAR. South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide into recession piles more pressure on president Jacob Zuma. Zuma was already feeling the heat over his links to the wealthy and influential Gupta family. Last week, leaked emails purported to show that the Gupta family had used their friendship with Zuma to advance their business interests. Zuma had previously repeatedly denied allegations that the Guptas had unfairly won state contracts, and even influenced the choice of government ministers. Magda Wierzycka, CEO of financial services group Sygnia, says South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaders need to focus on fixing its economy: The full South African GDP report is online here. This neat graphic sums it up: Here are the key points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s South African growth report. In the first quarter of 2017, both the secondary and tertiary sectors recorded negative growth rates. Trade growth shrank by 5.9% and manufacturing by 3,7%. On the positive side, the agriculture and mining industries both contributed positively to growth in the first quarter, but not enough to avoid recession. Trade experienced production falls across the board, particularly in catering and accommodation and wholesale trade. Manufacturing found itself hamstrung by lower production levels in seven of its 10 divisions, most notably petroleum and chemical products (accounting for over 20% of the manufacturing industry). It was the third consecutive quarter of decline in total manufacturing. The tertiary sector, which is make up of finance, transport, trade, government and personal services, recorded its first quarter of decline since the second quarter of 2009, when South Africa was in a recession as well. Social media users in South Africa have been reacting to the news: Emerging markets analyst John Ashbourne confirms that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures are much worse then expected: Statistics South Africa deputy director general Joe de Beer has confirmed that the country is in recession, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can now pronounce that the economy is in recession,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The major industries that contracted in the economy were the trade and manufacturing sectors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bloomberg is reporting that South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has been dragged into recession by political infighting. That row saw the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s respected finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, sacked three months ago, alarming international investors. Bloomberg says: While rains are helping Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most-industrialized economy recover from a 2015 drought that was the worst since records started more than a century earlier, political uncertainty has hampered implementing reforms aimed at boosting growth. President Jacob Zuma changed his cabinet and fired Pravin Gordhan as finance minister in March, a move that saw the nation lose its investment-grade status with two ratings companies for the first time in 17 years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a risk that these contractions are not over and we could see another negative coming out in the second quarter of this year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Annabel Bishop, the chief economist at Investec Ltd., said by phone from Johannesburg.

Africa Has Second Recession in 8 Years as Economy Shrinks The South African rand has has slumped by 1% on the foreign exchange markets, as traders react with alarm to the disappointing GDP figures. Breaking: South Africa has fallen back into recession, for the second time in eight years. South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy shrank by 0.7% in the first quarter of 2017, figures just released show. That follows a 0.3% contraction in the final three months of 2016; two consecutive quarters of contraction mean a recession. The downturn was caused by a sharp contraction in trade. Manufacturing output also shrank, while government and household spending both fell too. Government agency Stats SA has tweeted the key points: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something of a shock. Economists had expected growth to rebound in the last quarter. Details and reaction to follow..... European markets have weakened this morning, dragged down by worries over America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and the diplomatic row between Qatar and its neighbours. Despite the jump in eurozone investor confidence, all the main indices are in the red today. Risk aversion is gripping the markets, driving money out of shares and into gold and the Japanese yen. Signs that the Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election race is tightening are also gripping the City. Joshua Mahony of IG explains: On a day which is largely devoid of major economic releases, the focus remains firmly fixed on Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blockbuster schedule and what it could mean for the future of politics either side of the Atlantic. UK election polls have been widely conflicting of late, reflecting the significant impact different methodology has upon results. Previously we have seen the pound fall with any mention of a hung parliament, yet with the pound rising gradually over recent weeks, it is clear that the markets continue to foresee a Tory majority. More eurozone data just landed, showing that retail sales crept higher in April. Retail spending across the eurozone rose by 0.1%, weaker than the 0.2% which the City expects. On an annual basis, spending was 2.5% higher than in April 2016. Breaking: Investors across the eurozone are at their most confident in a decade! The monthly gauge of investor morale produced by Sentix has risen to 28.4 points this month, up from 27.4 in May. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest reading since July 2007 (just before the credit crunch struck, triggering the financial crisis). Investors reported that the current economic situation has improved, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also more optimistic about future economic prospects. The data suggest that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery is gathering pace, Sentix says: The assessment of the current situation has climbed to the highest level since January 2008, underlining that it is not just ephemeral expectations, but increasingly hard data, that are driving the upswing in the eurozone. The cost of renting a home in the UK has fallen for the first time since the financial crisis, as the slowdown in the sector gathers pace. Average rents were down 0.3% in May, compared with a year earlier, at \u00c2\u00a3901, according to industry body HomeLet. This is the first annual decline since 2009, Rents in London are 3% lower than a year ago; they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also down in the North-East of England, the South-East, Yorkshire &amp; Humberside, and Scotland. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for tenants, but a painful time for landlords. HomeLet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Executive Officer, Martin Totty, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153May 2017 saw average rents nationally fall for the first time in eight years when the economy had suffered the shock of the financial crisis. HomeLet rental data suggests landlords are now facing a difficult balancing act between ensuring rents are affordable for tenants in a low real wage growth environment whilst covering their own rising costs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Financial advisor Claire Walsh reckons Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the EU is now rippling through the economy: The Japanese yen has hit a six-week high against the US dollar, as traders dash for safe-haven assets. Russian intrigue and the looming UK general election are to blame, says FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed: In currency markets, the dollar fell to lowest levels in six weeks against the Yen. This shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprising given the scale of event risks this Thursday, specifically UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election and former FBI director James Comey testifying before the US Senate intelligence committee about potential Russian interference in 2016\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US election. The weakening dollar is good news for the pound, which has gained 0.3% to $1.293 this morning. The US dollar has fallen to its lowest level since Donald Trump won the US presidential election. Investors appear to be increasingly anxious about the American economy, after learning yesterday that its services sector grew slower than expected in May. That followed Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s underwhelming US labour report, showing fewer jobs created than expected. Markets are also bracing for potential bombshells on Thursday, when former FBI chief James Comey is due to testify to Congress. That appearance could provide more problems for president Trump. As Reuters puts it: It has been reported that Comey plans to testify to conversations in which U.S. President Donald Trump pressured him to drop his investigation into former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn, who was fired for failing to disclose conversations with Russian officials. Online electrical chain AO World has added to the gloom in the retail sector this morning, with an underwhelming set of results. AO World, which sells domestic appliances as well as computers, has warned the City that sales will slow \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significantly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between April and June, its first quarter. It said the tough trading environment in the UK that hit sales in the second half of last year had continued into its new financial year. Its operating loss for the year to 31 March widened to \u00c2\u00a312m from \u00c2\u00a310.6m, as a \u00c2\u00a315.6m profit in the UK was offset by losses in Germany and the Netherlands. The company was founded in 2000 by John Roberts, a former kitchen salesman, who ran the business as chief executive until February. When it floated on the stock market three years ago the shares soared \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but soon dipped below the 285p offer price. They are now worth just 136p, after tumbling by 6% in early trading today. Brushing aside the difficulties, the new chief executive Steve Caunce said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We remain relentless in pursuing our goal to be the best electrical retailer in Europe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With two days to go until the UK general election, we have new evidence that parts of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy are slowing. UK retail sales shrank by 0.4% in May, according to the latest healthcheck from the British Retail Consortium. The report found that households are cutting back as rising inflation hits them in the pocket. Worryingly, people have less to spend on discretionary items once they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve covered essentials such as food. Online sales -- typically a big growth area -- also slowed. They only rose by 4.3% during the month, compared to over 13% a year ago. Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said many shoppers are now suffering from falling real wages, leaving them less to spend in the shops. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The impact of inflationary pressures on the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s purse continues to play out in this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures, with shoppers evidently spending more on food and drink than on non-food purchases. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With inflation continuing to rise and wage growth stagnating, consumers are starting to feel the pinch - although the highly competitive nature of the UK grocery market continues to play out in the consumer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favour. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Katie Allen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full report: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s set the tone for a rather subdued day, with many stock markets in Asia dipping and the US dollar coming under pressure. The agenda: Today we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out whether eurozone retail sales kept growing in April, and whether investors across Europe remain confident. 9:30am BST: Sentix\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone investor confidence survey for June 10:00am BST: Eurozone retail sales for April 3pm BST: US Jolts report, showing how many job vacancies were created in America last month",

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said there were also other factors at work in sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favour: The pound found some extra energy this afternoon, though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not quite clear whether the currency is being driven higher by home-grown news or events elsewhere. Against both the dollar and the euro sterling jumped half a percent, suggesting that the election-jitters that have bothered the pound for the last fortnight or so have subsided. However, there are potentially other explanations for its growth. The euro has been hit by reports that the ECB is preparing to cut its inflation forecasts, something that would further kick the rate hike can down the road. In the US, meanwhile, the dollar is gearing up for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony from former FBI chief James Comey, an event that could destabilise an already shaky White House. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters on the rise in US crude stocks: Oil prices slid more than 3 percent on Wednesday after the U.S. government reported an unexpected increase in inventories of crude and gasoline, fanning fears that output cuts by major world oil producers have not drained the global crude glut very much. Crude stocks in the United States grew 3.3 million barrels to 513 million barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). That confounded forecasters who had predicted a drop of 3.5 million barrels, especially a day after preliminary data from the American Petroleum Institute indicated an even bigger drop. Gasoline inventories also unexpectedly rose, imports increased, and exports dropped, the EIA data showed... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Flagging gasoline demand continues to bedevil the market. With gasoline currently the seasonal leader of the complex, its weakness is dragging everything down,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York. Prices slid even as some in the market remained concerned about the move by OPEC members Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar, an OPEC member that had agreed to cut only about 30,000 barrels a day as part of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreement to reduce output. However, analysts saw a risk that rivalries between OPEC members could weaken the production cut agreement. Some were already concerned about rising production from Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt from the agreement. OPEC has pledged to cut almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to help reduce global inventories. More on the US inventory figures: The drop in the oil price following the unexpected increase in US crude stocks has also had an impact on stock markets. The FTSE 100, which had been just marginally lower, is now down 41 points or 0.56% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dipped into the red. In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now virtually unchanged after its earlier gains, up just 1.2 points. Brent crude is now down more than 3% at $48.46 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has dropped 4.6% to $45.95. The surprise rise in US crude stocks contradicts Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report from the API showing a decline in inventories. Oil prices were already on the slide after the blockade imposed on Qatar by its neighbours, with analysts concerned the rift could impede Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement to curb production. Now they have come under more pressure following a surprise rise in US crude stocks. According to the Energy Information Administration, US crude inventories rose by 3.3m barrels last week to 513.21m, compared to forecasts of a 3.46m decline. Gasoline stocks rose 3.32m, well ahead of the expected 0.58m increase. Brent crude has fallen to its lowest level since early May following the EIA report. Meanwhile the pound is now up 0.2% against the dollar at $1.2933, while the dip in the euro on reports that the European Central Bank might cut its inflation outlook on Thursday has helped the pound gain 0.59% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1512 against the single currency. US markets have opened in positive territory, but investors remain cautious ahead of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s triple whammy of the UK election, the European Central Bank meeting and - of more concern to Wall Street - the testimony of ex-FBI boss James Comey. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 24 points or 0.12%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.13% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.27%. WPP, whose boss Sir Martin Sorrell earlier received a rough ride from shareholders over his pay packet and his own future at the company, is the biggest faller in the FTSE 100. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less to do with the annual meeting outcome and more to do with the trading statement issued alongside it. This showed a slightly slowdown in like for like sales growth of 0.7% in the first four months of the year (January to April), down from 0.8% in the first quarter (January to March). Analysts at Jefferies said: One month is not a trend, but these numbers are in focus given the concern around FMCG [fast moving consumer group] spending, US growth in light of the account losses (VW and AT&amp;T) and the weaker start to the year that WPP had in Asia. Later come the latest weekly US oil stocks figures from the Energy Information Administration, a day after an industry survey showed a bigger than expected fall. But the worries over the Middle East after the rift between Qatar and other Gulf states has continued to see oil prices slide, and a positive EIA report may have little impact. Craig Erlam, market analyst at Oanda, said: The only notable data to come today is EIA crude oil inventories which follow an API release on Tuesday that reported a drawdown of 4.62 million barrels. With oil already under pressure as traders appear to question the suitability of the output deal and the latest geopolitical issues in the region weigh, it will be interesting to see whether another large drawdown will offer any support. Having broken below $50 though, Brent continues to look vulnerable to further downside. Manuel Lopez, regulation partner at law firm Ashurst in Madrid, has declared that Santander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue of Banco Popular is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153landmark moment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It shows that the Single Resolution Board is determined to resolve failing banks, without involving state money, he says. This signals that SRB and other EU regulators will take major steps to ensure that taxpayers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bear the cost of bank failures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait until the situation deteriorates too far before doing so. The shareholders of Popular have seen, overnight, the results of the lessons learned in 2008. This will not be the last such case, and investors will certainly study the result and the financial consequences of this important decision.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top advertising magnate, Sir Martin Sorrell, received a rough ride from shareholders today over his pay package, and his own future. One fifth of WPP shareholders refused to back Sorrell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest bumper pay deal, worth \u00c2\u00a348m, even though the company has tightened its remuneration policy after earlier protests. Investors also demanded more action on a succession plan for life after Sorrell, who is 76, especially as either side can end his contract with no notice. Businesses who are fretting about the election could consider protecting themselves against the pound suffering wild swings when the results come in. Roy Williams, managing director at supply chain firm, Vendigital, explains why sterling volatility could be a problem. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never too late for businesses to hedge against unpleasant currency-related post-Election surprises. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The currency markets appear to be banking on a Tory win but the polls are more ambivalent. Businesses operating on low margins with significant imports or exports should consider a late hedge to protect their trading position from exchange rate volatility in the immediate aftermath of the General Election. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Prior to deciding what to do, businesses need to understand if they are a net importer or exporter to each of their various markets. For manufacturers that are net exporters for example, it would be worth considering locking in their exchange rate for a fixed period of time as part of a bank agreement. This will at least allow them a period of financial certainty to plan against. Another option is to line up suppliers in different regions, to give flexibility depending how the foreign exchange markets move, Williams adds. UBS Wealth Management have fired over some analysis of how the financial markets will respond to the result of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election: None of their scenarios sound particularly appealing, frankly, but here goes.... Conservative enhanced majority Back to business as usual for government. Established trends of rising inflation and weak growth in household incomes unlikely to change, weighing on growth in coming quarters. Conservative majority, in the case of less than stellar performance Prime Minister beholden to backbenchers in her party who favour a swift exit and hard Brexit. Less likely to see a transition deal. This results in sharp slowdown in growth as trade falters. Firms shift investment from the UK into the EU. Labour-led minority government Complete change of economic programme for the UK. Domestic policy takes a backseat amid Brexit negotiations, with lack of clarity over which aspects of Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposals will be implemented. Sharp drop in business and consumer confidence amid prospect of unstable coalition, muddled Brexit stance, and higher corporate and business taxes. Downside risks to already below-consensus estimates of 1.4% GDP growth for this year and 0.7% for next. The pound has done its best impression of a somnolent sloth this morning. Sterling is unchanged on the day, at $1.2907, on the final trading session before Britons trudge to the polls to elect our next government. Traders are eager to find out which (if any) of the rival opinion polls have actually predicted the result correctly. The pound could rally if Theresa May gets an increased majority, but likely slide if the PM manages to actually lose seats. Paresh Davdra of RationalFX says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The pound has remained steady on the eve of the general election. As campaigning reaches its climax, the pound has retreated slightly from the two-week highs seen yesterday but remains stable, as analysts await the election results. The markets are positive about the prospects of Prime Minster Theresa May emerging the winner of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote, as current polls indicate a secure lead for the Conservatives. However, there is still caution over the remote possibility of a hung parliament or a Labour victory, which investors fear would sink the pound in the aftermath of the election. Most European stock markets have crept a little high this morning, as traders enjoy a quiet day ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excitement. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX is lagging behind, with Banco Santander down 2% following its plan to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn in new capital to cover Banco Popular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-performing assets. Thursday will include Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election, a European Central Bank meeting, and ex-FBI chief James Comey testifying to Congress. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, says: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing mild gains in the FTSE in what is otherwise a mixed European session this morning. US futures are pointing a little higher ahead of the open, with little direction coming from across the pond. The UK index has stabilised in the weeks leading up to the election, with the sudden uncertainty around the outcome appearing to be contributing to the moves. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suddenly some drama in the markets, as the euro slides to a four-day low. The single currency shed half a cent to $1.122 after Bloomberg reported that the ECB is preparing to cut its inflation forecasts. Government bond prices are also jumping, pushing down the yield (interest rate) on that debt. Lower inflation forecasts means less chance of the ECB tightening monetary policy soon, and unwinding its huge bond purchase scheme. The Financial Times also argue that the Banco Popular bailout has bolstered the credibility of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector. Their Madrid bureau chief Tobias Buck writes: Analysts said that the ability of eurozone authorities to decisively step in to wind down Popular and safeguard its assets gives the EU regime new credibility after questions were raised during the tortuous struggle to clean up Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubled banks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s essentially a case of the regulation doing exactly what it was created for,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Laurent Frings, head of credit research at Aberdeen Asset Management. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But it does show that there is real risk in investing in these second tier names in the banking sector. The rescue of Banco Popular means that attention will now turn to Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sector. Some analysts are speculating on whether any Italian banks will fall into Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resolution mechanism, as some regional lenders are struggling to raise fresh capital. Analysts at ABN Amro, though, fear that some Italian banks aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as attractive as Popular. The deal is facilitated by the fact that Banco Popular is actually strong enough to have buyers. Especially their loan book, and diversification to Portugal was of interest. Crucially, the deal could be performed without the need for state assistance. However, in Italy, the banks of Veneto and Vicenza are not in the equivalent balance sheet position as the Banco Popular. It would seem that the large institutions in Italy would be unwilling to take over the banks without the interaction of the Italian state, either via the Atlante fund or another mechanism. The question now is, if Banco Popular has now been stated as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfailing or likely to fail\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by the SRB, what does this mean for the arguably weaker banks of Veneto and Vicenza banks This chart, from M&amp;S\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bond Vigilantes team, shows how Banco Popular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s risky bonds have been wiped out by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal (the orange line). But senior debt (which is further down the pecking order when a company fails) is not being \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbailed-in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue, so its value has actually risen. Once upon a time, a failing eurozone bank would have sparked mayhem in the financial markets. Not today, though. The news that Banco Popular has been acquired for one shiny euro by Santander has caused a notable lack of drama. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bank resolution mechanism is acting like it was meant to. Shareholders in a failed bank have been wiped out, and crucially so have the riskier bondholders. Various Banco Popular debt instruments have been written down, or converted into equity which was then handed to Santander, as part of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal. That means that bondholders who took a risk by holding this debt (which offered attractive returns) are suffering losses, rather than the taxpayer. James Mackintosh of the Wall Street Journal has tweeted the details: The OECD also hiked its growth forecasts for the eurozone and Japan, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t nudge its UK forecasts. Angel Gurria, head of the OECD, says we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too excited that global growth is heading for a six-year high of 3.5%. He told Reuters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everything is relative. What I would not like us to do is celebrate the fact that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re moving from very bad to mediocre. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that we have to get used to it or live with it. We have to continue to strive to do better.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Something to ponder.... This shows why global growth still isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood enough\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, in the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view. This chart shows how the OECD expects the global economy to grow faster, but with many of the benefits heading to the richest: The OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest global economic outlook is just out, and it gives a mixed picture. On the upside, the Paris-based thinktank has hiked its global growth forecast this year to 3.5%, from 3.3% previously. That would be the best performance in six years. The OECD sees growth rising further to 3.6% in 2018. But it is also concerned by persistent inequality in the global economy, lacklustre wage growth, and signs that the public are losing faith in their governments. And it says the outlook is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better, but not good enough\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The OECD has cut its US growth forecasts, but it now more optimistic about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic prospects. My colleague Katie Allen has read the report, and explains: The OECD devoted a significant proportion of its latest report to the possible forces behind a backlash against globalisation. That discontent was seen as a key factor behind Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory in the race for the US presidency, since when he has pledged to put \u00e2\u20ac\u0153America first\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Anti-globalisation sentiment also appears to have boosted protectionist politicians in other countries, including France where the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen made it to the final round of the presidential election but lost to the centrist Emmanuel Macron. The OECD said international trade had been a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153powerful engine of global economic growth and convergence in living standards between countries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but that despite those gains, the backlash against it had been rising. Readers may remember that Santander has a track record on rescuing ailing and troubled banks, including in the UK. It took over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Abbey National and Alliance &amp; Leicester before the financial crisis in 2008, and then added Bradford &amp; Bingley savers to its businesses when B&amp;B\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mortgage book was nationalised. Santander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, Ana Botin, has insisted that she came under \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely no pressure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from regulators to rescue Banco Popular. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, she says This is a transaction that is very good for our franchise in Spain and Portugal. It creates the best bank in both markets. Botin says that an opportunity arose yesterday to present an offer to the Single Resolution Board, to take over Popular, and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impressed by how quickly the rescue was handled. This is really great news for Europe, for the financial system, for Spain, and for Santander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders. Botin says that the deal won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hurt Santander -- it is sticking with all its financial targets for 2017 and 2018, and will be able to improve on its targets from 2019. The \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn of fresh capital is coming from a rights issue, she points out, so Santander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital reserves won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be depleted. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no word on any potential job cuts or branch closures. Botin says: We are fully committed to supporting both the team and the customers from today. But what about Popular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-performing real estate loans - does Santander really know what it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taking on? Botin says her staff did have time to do due diligence on Popular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets, prior to making its offer. And with Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy growing strongly, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confident this deal will be a success. Elke K\u00c3\u00b6nig, chair of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Single Resolution Board (which triggered Banco Popular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue), says that the deal will protect the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s savers. K\u00c3\u00b6nig also argues that the deal vindicates Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to avoid another financial crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decision taken today safeguards the depositors and critical functions of Banco Popular. This shows that the tools given to resolution authorities after the crisis are effective to protect taxpayers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 money from bailing out banks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official statement: The Single Resolution Board adopts resolution decision for Banco Popular Back in the UK, the Halifax bank building society has reported that house prices rose by 0.4% in May. That ends a run of four monthly falls in a row, and means prices are 3.3% higher than a year ago. But prices were still 0.2% lower in the March-to-May quarter than in the previous three months, highlighting how the UK housing market has cooled. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Luis de Guindos, has welcomed Santander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue of Banco Popular. In a statement, de Guindos says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good outcome for the bank, given the situation it had arrived at in recent weeks, as it implies maximum protection for depositors and continuity of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added that taxpayer money is not involved, and there is no danger of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccredit risk contagion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 spreading to other banks. Shares in Santander have dropped by 3% at the start of trading in Madrid. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because investors are reacting to its plan to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn in new capital to fund its rescue of Banco Popular. Popular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have been suspended, following their sale to Sandander If Banco Popular is in such trouble, why did Santander buy it? Popular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attraction is its retail banking division, and its small business customers. They can bolster Santander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existing business, and give it a larger share of the Spanish banking market. Bloomberg reporter Rodrigo Orihuela says: On the one hand, Popular has a very strong SME business and a very strong retail business, which is what Santander wants. The real estate business is the big big question....Everyone will have to wonder whether Sandander can solve it. They probably have a plan. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of Orihuela explaining the situation: Banco Popular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse into the arms of Santander today was primarily due to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctoxic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 real estate loans on its books, and its failure to raise fresh capital. The bank made some seriously bad loans before the financial crisis triggered a major Spanish housing crash, and its management have been unable to fix the damage. Back in February, Popular posted a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.5bn annual loss due to bad debts, restructuring costs and various writedowns. Then in May it admitted that it was setting aside even more money to cover real estate losses. Its new chairman, Emilio Saracho, has been trying to sell assets and issue more shares to raise capital, but the market has proved unreceptive to his efforts. The crisis escalated in recent days, as a series of potential buyers dropped out of an auction to buy Banco Popular. With capital levels running dangerously low, and its shares in freefall, the ECB was forced to step in and trigger today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue, to Sandander. Karen Tso of CNBC points out that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t costing the taxpayer anything, because Santander will raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn of new capital from the markets. Nick Leeson, the rogue trader who broke Barings Bank in the 1990s, is struck by the symbolic price of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal: Breaking news from Spain: Banco Santander has bought Banco Popular for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1, rescuing its fellow Spanish lender from from the brink of collapse. Santander said it would raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn to cover the capital shortfall and strengthen the balance sheet of Popular, after the European Central Bank deemed it to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153failing or likely to fail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The ECB (which supervises the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest banks) triggered the move after concluding yesterday that Banco Popular was running out of cash. It says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The significant deterioration of the liquidity situation of the bank in recent days led to a determination that the entity would have, in the near future, been unable to pay its debts or other liabilities as they fell due. Santander said it was making the purchase after \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a competitive sale process\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to rescue the ailing bank. Popular lost more than half of its market value in recent days as investors grew increasingly fearful over its ability to deal with its capital shortfall. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgraded the lender on Tuesday. Details and reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. You have to take your hat off to Australia. Despite the economic challenges of the last decade, it has just racked up its 103rd successive quarter of growth - dating all the way back to 1991. However, these latest growth figures aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too impressive. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.3% in the first three months of this year, a little faster than Britain but slower than France or Germany. That means annual growth is now just 1.7%; the weakest since 2009. Bad weather is partly to blame, with some economists pointing to the disruption caused by Cyclone Debbie in Match. But others are concerned. Michael Workman, a Commonwealth Bank senior economist, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Australian economy began 2017 with a whimper following a decent pace of expansion in the final quarter of 2016.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The weakness in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data extends beyond the weather, and the slowdown in the domestic economy has occurred at a time when the global economic backdrop has improved. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details: That sets the scene for this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main economic event, the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest assessment of the global economy. The Paris-based thinktank will update its growth forecasts, and highlight the key threats it sees ahead. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not expecting much drama in the London markets today. The pound is hovering around the $1.29 mark, and the FTSE 100 is forecast to open unchanged. Oil remains volatile, though, as the diplomatic crisis in the region rumbles on.

The IMF has confirmed that the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director will attend next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s critical meeting of eurozone finance ministers as efforts intensify to resolve the rift over how to lighten the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt load. Helena Smith reports from Athens:</p> <blockquote> <p>Its official: Christine Lagarde will attend the June 15 eurogroup meeting in Luxembourg according to IMF spokesman Gerry Rice.

The IMF has made clear it will not contribute to disbursements until a debt relief formula is devised permitting Largarde to make the case for further bailout participation before the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We would still be insisting on reforms and debt relief before the IMF would disburse any of its funds,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rice told reporters this afternoon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So this is not a backing down or a walking away in any respect.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>The EU and IMF have been at loggerheads over how to make Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gargantuan debt load sustainable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a prerequisite for the ECB to accept the country into its stimulus programme.

Late on Wednesday he said EU investment programs should now be used to heal the rift between the EU and IMF by igniting the sort of growth that would bring concordance on debt relief.</p> <p>Citing data released by the labour ministry, the leftist leader told the inaugural European Concordia summit in Athens that indices were improving with 89,500 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real jobs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd being created in May in addition to the 92,000 work places created in April.

This time around, all eyes were on the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forward guidance on interest rates and the risk assessment for the economic outlook. On both, the ECB delivered some changes. As regards the forward guidance on interest rates, it was not about what the ECB said but what it actually didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say. The ECB omitted the reference that interest rates could even be lower than their present levels and therefore dropped the easing bias for interest rates. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not forget, however, that at the same time, the ECB kept the easing bias on QE, sticking to the formulation that the ECB would be willing to step up its monthly asset purchases if need be. Also, Draghi remarked that the ECB will remain in the market for a long while and the QE tapering was not discussed at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. As regards the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s macro-economic assessment, the ECB upgraded the risk to the growth outlook from negative to now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broadly balanced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Actually the first time since 2011 that the ECB calls the outlook for growth balanced.</p> <p>The improved economic outlook, however, has not yet led to any significant inflationary pressure in the Eurozone. This picture was reflected in the ECB staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic projections which were marginally upgraded to 1.9% (during the Q&amp;A session, Draghi said that due to the upward revision of 1Q GDP, growth would actually now come in at 2%), 1.8% and 1.7% in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. At the same time, the inflation projections were revised downwards to 1.5%, 1.3% and 1.6% for 2017, 2018 and 2019. Even though the downward revision was mainly the result of lower oil prices and a slightly stronger exchange rate, subdued inflation rates remain the biggest concern for the ECB. Reasons for low inflation rates are in our view not only the slack in the Eurozone economy, still high unemployment and a high number of (involuntary) part-time and low-wage employment but also globalisation and digitalisation. </p> <p>In our view, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB meeting was a very first baby step towards eventual tapering. It is obvious that the ECB is trying to be as cautious as possible to very gradually get out of the unconventional monetary policy measures. Therefore, this process of preparing markets extremely carefully with words and changes in the communication will continue and can take a long while before the ECB delivers new action. In this context, the low inflation forecasts in our view argue in favour of only a mild tapering and probably a tapering without an end date on it.

If there is a landslide for the Conservatives, the markets will be stable, as they have already priced in for this scenario and thus there is not much leverage for it to rally further. The pound on the other hand will perform well over the news and can well trade over $1.3100. If there is a marginal victory, the markets will await for further clarity on the Brexit prospects and developments. So whichever the outcome in the Tory victory, the markets will be stable.<br></li> <li>\u00c2\u00b7 <strong>Labour Win:</strong> This will be a major political upset but is highly unlikely. This could see pressure on the GBP and on Gilts in particular. UK shares may also decline though some sectors will gain on the back of expectations of higher government spending.<br></li> <li>\u00c2\u00b7 <strong>Hung Parliament:</strong> This scenario is probably the most difficult for the markets, as it will could lead to a coalition government. This will also weaken the new government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position in handling the Brexit negotiations, and can be particularly damaging for the pound.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Jeremy Cook of currency firm World First is predicting (or possible hoping for) a relatively quiet night:</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/World_First/status/872763353676034048\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GeneralElection17guesses?src=hash\">#GeneralElection17guesses</a> Sterling has one of its quietest political nights in a while</p>&mdash; World First (@World_First) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/World_First/status/872763353676034048\">June 8, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>Craig Erlam, senior analyst at foreign exchange firm OANDA, says the pound will plunge if the election didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide a clear winner:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>From a markets perspective, this election is huge and could produce some substantial moves, particularly in sterling, the FTSE and UK debt.

                "bodyText":"Finally, away from the Triple Threats, there are developments concerning Greece. The IMF has confirmed that the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director will attend next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s critical meeting of eurozone finance ministers as efforts intensify to resolve the rift over how to lighten the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt load. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Its official: Christine Lagarde will attend the June 15 eurogroup meeting in Luxembourg according to IMF spokesman Gerry Rice. Her presence now leaves the door open to the Fund approving a program \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in principle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if the impasse over debt relief isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resolved at the meeting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an effective get-out clause that would allow the EU more time to come to an agreement while emergency loans were disbursed to Greece in time for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.5bn worth of debt repayments in July. The IMF has made clear it will not contribute to disbursements until a debt relief formula is devised permitting Largarde to make the case for further bailout participation before the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We would still be insisting on reforms and debt relief before the IMF would disburse any of its funds,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rice told reporters this afternoon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So this is not a backing down or a walking away in any respect.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The EU and IMF have been at loggerheads over how to make Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gargantuan debt load sustainable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a prerequisite for the ECB to accept the country into its stimulus programme. Earlier Thursday, the EU economic affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici cautioned against \u00e2\u20ac\u0153playing with fire\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd saying it was vital a debt relief agreement was secured on June 15. Lagarde had stayed away from the last and inconclusive meeting of euro area finance ministers on May 22 amid concerns the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt crisis was poised to flare up again. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras legislated further pension cuts and tax rises recently telling sceptical MPs a debt deal would be reached that would put Greece back on the road to economic recovery. Late on Wednesday he said EU investment programs should now be used to heal the rift between the EU and IMF by igniting the sort of growth that would bring concordance on debt relief. Citing data released by the labour ministry, the leftist leader told the inaugural European Concordia summit in Athens that indices were improving with 89,500 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real jobs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd being created in May in addition to the 92,000 work places created in April. On Thursday, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics agency, Elstat, said unemployment had dropped from a record high of 27.9% in September 2013 to 22.5% in March. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and for the latest on the UK election we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be following events through the night. Otherwise we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back here as usual tomorrow to cover the aftermath of the vote. The testimony of ex-FBI director James Comey certainly does not appear to be troubling the US markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has just hit a new peak of 21,265. Its last record was just under a week ago on 2 June. Triple Threat Thursday has so far pass off without too much market drama. Ahead of the close of polls in the UK election, the FTSE 100 and the pound have both slipped back, with investors nervous about the possible outcome. The general feeling is that a Conservative majority is on the cards, but traders are not ruling out a surprise, given the Brexit and Trump shocks. In Europe, the euro has weakened as the European Central Bank ruled out lowering interest rates, a change in its policy. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 28.64 points or 0.38% lower at 7449.98 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax closed 0.32% higher at 12,713.58 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac slipped 0.02% to 5264.24 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 1.46% to 21,042.41 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.75% higher at 10,953.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.61% to 779.05 On Wall Street, as James Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony continues, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 29 points or 0.14%. On the latest market reaction to the UK election, David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The FTSE 100 is sliding today as dealers are concerned about the UK general election. If you take an average of the polls conducted, it points to a Conservative win but some investors have less confidence in the polls, in the wake of Brexit and President Trump. The UK stock market would prefer a Tory victory as the party is more in favour of free market economics than Labour. The ground lost by the Conservatives in the past couple of weeks has rattled some traders. So far markets seem to be taking the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big events in their stride. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a bit more movement this afternoon, but nothing to quite deliver on the promise of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctriple threat Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. So far James Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance in front of the Senate intelligence committee has done little to disrupt the US markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if anything the dollar is looking pretty perky, rising against both the pound and the euro. Of course it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early days yet, with a couple of hours to go until the former FBI chief\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public testimony is finished. Who knows what it will uncover? Elsewhere the ECB largely went through the motions this afternoon. Though the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation forecasts cuts had already been leaked, the central bank did still pull a mild surprise out of the bag by dropping the reference to lowering interest rates, stating that they would \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcremain at their present levels for an extended period of time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Yet Draghi made sure that this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken as too hawkish, something that only ended up disappointing the euro, which fell half a percent against the dollar and 0.1% against the pound. And what of the UK? Well, the FTSE found itself down by around 0.2%, while the pound gradually shed its early growth, both saving any major movements until they get a glimpse at the first trickle of results this evening. A reminder that ex-FBI head James Comey is testifying at the moment. So far there has been little market reaction, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down just a couple of points. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour of the meeting, with Comey explaining why he started making contemporaneous notes about his discussions with President Trump: Why did Comey decide to document that [first] discussion. What was it about that meeting? Comey replies: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A combination of things. The circumstances, the subject matter and the person I was interacting with.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Comey says he was alone with the president-elect discussing weighty matters. Then: I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting, and so I thought it was important to document it. Our live blog is here: The European Central Bank has got the eurozone economy moving again, but will it last, asks our economics editor Larry Elliott: Growth forecasts revised up. Inflation forecasts revised down. Jobs being created. Take a bow Mario Draghi. Urged on by its proactive boss, the European Central Bank has achieved what looked impossible until recently: it has got the eurozone economy moving again. Draghi should milk the applause while he can because the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sweet spot won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last for ever. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the US and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the UK, two countries that pursued exactly the same macro-economic strategy as the ECB, only earlier. His full analysis is here: More reaction to Draghi and the ECB: Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at Forex.com, said: There was so much fuss made about this key ECB meeting and it ended up being a bit of a damp squib. The central bank and its president Mario Draghi delivered contradictory statements about inflation and probably left many market participants feeling somewhat disappointed that there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything concrete announced. To be fair, the leaked inflation and growth forecasts earlier this week had already taken the edge out of this meeting and many people had already prepared to hear a more dovish than a hawkish ECB. Hence, the euro didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly fall off a cliff. Back with the European Central Bank, and Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank has commented again following Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference: It was a bit like in the good old days when ECB watchers looked out for code words like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vigilance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This time around, all eyes were on the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forward guidance on interest rates and the risk assessment for the economic outlook. On both, the ECB delivered some changes. As regards the forward guidance on interest rates, it was not about what the ECB said but what it actually didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say. The ECB omitted the reference that interest rates could even be lower than their present levels and therefore dropped the easing bias for interest rates. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not forget, however, that at the same time, the ECB kept the easing bias on QE, sticking to the formulation that the ECB would be willing to step up its monthly asset purchases if need be. Also, Draghi remarked that the ECB will remain in the market for a long while and the QE tapering was not discussed at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. As regards the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s macro-economic assessment, the ECB upgraded the risk to the growth outlook from negative to now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broadly balanced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Actually the first time since 2011 that the ECB calls the outlook for growth balanced. The improved economic outlook, however, has not yet led to any significant inflationary pressure in the Eurozone. This picture was reflected in the ECB staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic projections which were marginally upgraded to 1.9% (during the Q&amp;A session, Draghi said that due to the upward revision of 1Q GDP, growth would actually now come in at 2%), 1.8% and 1.7% in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. At the same time, the inflation projections were revised downwards to 1.5%, 1.3% and 1.6% for 2017, 2018 and 2019. Even though the downward revision was mainly the result of lower oil prices and a slightly stronger exchange rate, subdued inflation rates remain the biggest concern for the ECB. Reasons for low inflation rates are in our view not only the slack in the Eurozone economy, still high unemployment and a high number of (involuntary) part-time and low-wage employment but also globalisation and digitalisation. In our view, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB meeting was a very first baby step towards eventual tapering. It is obvious that the ECB is trying to be as cautious as possible to very gradually get out of the unconventional monetary policy measures. Therefore, this process of preparing markets extremely carefully with words and changes in the communication will continue and can take a long while before the ECB delivers new action. In this context, the low inflation forecasts in our view argue in favour of only a mild tapering and probably a tapering without an end date on it. There is clearly room for another \u00e2\u20ac\u0153longer but lower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd announcement for 2018 later this year. All in all, the ECB today delivered two important linguistic changes to its official communication which were more than only words. These changes marked the official start of a taper tiptoeing. A tiptoeing which will still take a long while before it could be called policy normalisation. With the third element of Triple Threat Thursday - the testimony of ex-FBI head James Comey - due shortly, US markets have got off to an uncertain start. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down just 5 points, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both edged higher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Following the release of James Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement on Wednesday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which suggested Trump pressured him for a pledge of loyalty and implied his job was in peril if he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drop the Michael Flynn investigation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all eyes will be on the former FBI chief\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony in front of the Senate intelligence committee. Presently neither the dollar nor Dow Jones seems too fussed by the recent revelations, though that could all change when Comey takes the stand. For those wanting to follow Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony, our US live blog is here: Q: The economy has started to improve nicely; is that because of QE or despite QE? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because of QE - we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re here because of that, smiles Draghi (perhaps inwardly fuming at this implied criticism of his precious stimulus package). And then he reels off the evidence that QE has worked: Eurozone growth in the first quarter of 2017 has been revised up today from 0.5% to 0.6%. The PMI indices, which track private sector output, are at their highest level since April 2011. The eurozone economic sentiment is close to its highest level, set in 2007. And unemployment is the lowest since 2009....and five million jobs have been created in the last three and a half years, more than in America. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the ECB press conference. Another nudge to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elected leaders to crack on with the job: Draghi is trying to cool speculation that the ECB is inching towards the exit of its stimulus programme.... Q: Could the ECB increase its QE programme if the economy weakens? Draghi says that there is adequate \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flexibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the asset purchase scheme. An Estonian journalist asks if her country is unfairly missing out from the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s asset purchase scheme, because it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any government debt for the ECB to mop up. Draghi argues that Estonia benefits from QE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive impact on the euro area, as it is an open economy. Q: Why did the ECB decide that Santander was the best candidate to take over Banco Popular? Vice-president V\u00c3\u00adtor Const\u00c3\u00a2ncio says that the ECB concluded that Popular was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153failing or likely to fail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as a bank run was taking hold and liquidity was running low. But the final decision on its future was taken by the Single Resolution Board (an independent agency) not the ECB Q: Did the ECB discuss when to start normalising monetary policy? No, says Draghi.... but then he remembers that two council members made some observations about this issue. I suspect that one of them was Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker, Jens Weidmann. Q: Could a prolonged lower inflation rate force the ECB to change its forward guidance and raise its negative deposit rate before ending its QE programme? [currently it promises to complete the asset purchase scheme before tackling interest rates] \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No, no\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Draghi, emphatically. Nothing substantial has happened to inflation, other than changes to the oil price, he insists. Q: Should we expect the ECB to outline its tapering strategy in September, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to drop your pledge to cut interest rates? It was not discussed, president Mario Draghi snaps back. Q: Last month, ECB governing council member Ewald Nowotny questioned whether the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation target was achievable. Should the markets share his concerns? Draghi says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to look at the reasons behind Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low inflation. One problem is that wage growth is modest, because negotiations are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153backward looking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd -- ie, bosses only offer small pay rises because inflation has been so low recently. Draghi also points out that many of the jobs created recently are of relatively poor quality -- many are temporary, or part-time. So \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to be patient....and persistent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Draghi insists. The euro has shed half a cent against the US dollar after Mario Draghi announced the ECB has slashed its inflation forecasts. Q: Did the ECB act quickly enough to tackle Banco Popular (the Spanish bank which was rescued by Santander this week). Draghi says he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on individual institutions, but he hails the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153timely action\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the regulators who handled the sale. Onto questions Q: Were today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions unanimous? We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a vote, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear any dissenting voices, Draghi replies (presumably he hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stuck his fingers in his ears....) Draghi ends his statement with his traditional call on European governments to do more to tackle structural problems in their economics, and underpin the recovery. The leaks were true! The ECB has cut its forecasts for inflation over the next few years. Here are the new forecasts for CPI inflation: 2017: 1.5%, down from 1.7% previously 2018: 1.3%, down from 1.6% 2019: 1.6%, down from 1.7% Draghi says this is mainly due to lower oil prices. More encouraging news. The ECB has raised its growth forecasts for the next few years. It now expects GDP to rise by 1.9% this year, up from 1.8% expected back in March. It has also raised its growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019 by 0.1 percentage points, to 1.8% and 1.7% respectively. But while the eurozone economy is recovering, there are still \u00e2\u20ac\u0153downside risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, predominately due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153global factors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Draghi says. Boom! Mario Draghi says that the eurozone recovery is enjoying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stronger momentum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and now growing at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhat faster pace than previously expected. Risks to the growth outlook are now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broadly balanced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he declares -- dropping the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous warning that risks were to the downside. Over in Tallinn, Mario Draghi has arrived to explain the decisions taken at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB governing council meetings. He confirms that the ECB left interest rates on hold, adding: The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation that the pledge to cut rates to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lower levels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if needed has been dropped. Draghi also confirms that the ECB agreed to maintain its asset purchase programme at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn per month, adding: If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration. The ECB president then turns to the economic situation. Our stimulus programme has created the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very favourable financing conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that are needed to get inflation back to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of close to but below 2%. Away from the ECB for a moment, and more positive signs from the US economy. Weekly jobless claims fell to 245,000 compared to 255,000 the previous week. That however was slightly worse than the 240,000 figure that had been expected. And the previous week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure was revised up from the original estimate of 248,000. This really is a historic day..... You might have expected the euro to rally, after the ECB dropped its pledge to cut interest rates to fresh lows if needed. But actually the single currency has fallen a little, down 0.3% today at $1.1225, after a sudden spike when the ECB announcement hit the wires. That shows that investors expected today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s change in language, and are also anticipating a dovish performance from ECB chief Mario Draghi in a few minutes. Fred Ducrozet of Pictet Bank says the ECB has taken a symbolic step towards tightening monetary policy in the eurozone, for the first time in many years. Carsten Brzeski of ING calls it a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbaby step\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 towards tapering (or trimming the size of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE programme down from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn per month). It was not about what the ECB said but what it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say. In fact, the ECB omitted the reference that interest rates could be lower than their present levels. This easing bias is now gone. Starting at 2.30pm CET, Draghi will present the new ECB staff macro-economic projections, the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment on growth and inflation and possibly some hints at the future path of monetary policy. In our view, some tweaks to the macro-economic risk assessment as a clear statement that the current recovery does still not show any inflationary signs are the most likely outcomes of the press conference. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the ECB appears to have ruled out the prospect of further rate cuts. We still need to hear from Mario Draghi, but the initial assessment of the early statement is that the ECB may have made some tiny, tentative steps towards policy normalisation by dropping a reference that it could cut interest rates further. We still need to see the ECB staff forecasts for growth and inflation, and there is a big expectation that the ECB will sharply cut its inflation forecast to the 1.5% level, way below the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target rate. Reto Foellmi, Professor of International Economics at University of St.Gallen, says interest rates will still remain at record lows for some time, despite the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspillover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 effects on the global economy. While the short-term costs of prolonging the ongoing monetary regime for a quarter or so seem small, it is not without incident. The longer we stay in this regime the more severe consequences it has on related currencies, such as the Swiss Franc. The actions of the ECB force them to set very low interest rates and to engage in huge bond buying programmes on their own. This spillover effect to other currencces makes it more difficult it is to change the course of action afterwards.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ECB has also voted to keep creating \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn of new money each month, to buy government and corporate bonds in an attempt to get inflation up. The bank has also pledged to boost this QE programme if needed, saying: If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration. Newsflash: The European Central Bank has dropped its pledge to cut interest rates to fresh record lows if needed. Following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council meeting, the ECB has (as expected) voted to leave borrowing costs at their current levels. But importantly, it has adjusted the language in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement. It now says that it expects interest rates to remain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at their present levels for an extended period of time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Previously, the ECB promised that rates would remain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at their present levels or lower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So this is the first step towards tightening monetary policy in the euro area - although we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still a long way from an actual interest rate hike. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision means that the headline interest rate in the eurozone remains at 0.0%, and banks must pay a negative interest rate of -0.4% when they leave money in the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaults rather than lending it to businesses and households. Reaction to follow.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly time for the first of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctriple threats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 -- the results of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European Central Bank meeting, followed by Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference. Investors across the eurozone, and beyond, will be looking closely for signs that the ECB could adjust its monetary policy stance, especially after today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth upgrades. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, explains: While investors have their eyes and ears glued to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU GDP release and this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision could have big ramifications for financial markets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most were expecting the upward revision of 0.6% to be confirmed and the latest estimate of EU GDP, although positive, is unlikely to alter Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking ahead of his lunchtime press conference. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When Draghi speaks later today, investors will be listening out for any dovish tones on interest rates. The ECB has previously stated that rates will remain \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcat present or lower\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and any removal of the potential to loosen monetary policy further could perk up markets significantly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says the City is facing the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccalm before the storm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, ahead of tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election results. The polls are open, and despite what is expected to be an incredibly volatile 24 hours ahead, we have seen a remarkably calm start to the day for the FTSE 100... Amid a remarkable Corbyn resurgence in the polls, FTSE traders would do well to remember the confusion caused around the US election and EU referendum, where the predicted demise of stocks in the eventuality of a Trump win or Brexit really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come to fruition, catching many off-guard. Ultimately the worst eventuality here would be a hung parliament, given that Brexit negotiations are due to start in just 11 days. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is basically becalmed right now, with the FTSE 100 currently down 9 points at 7469. It has gained around 4.5% since today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election was called in mid-April, so traders are now waiting to see if the pollsters have got this one right. The pound is also failing to provide any excitement, and is currently down 0.1% at $1.2945. With Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s polling stations doing a brisk trade, City experts have been analysing how the results of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote will shift the markets. Here are some predictions from Mihir Kapadia of Sun Global Investments, who expects Theresa May to be returned with an increased majority. \u00c2\u00b7 Conservative Win: This is largely expected, however, it is the scale of the victory that matters. If there is a landslide for the Conservatives, the markets will be stable, as they have already priced in for this scenario and thus there is not much leverage for it to rally further. The pound on the other hand will perform well over the news and can well trade over $1.3100. If there is a marginal victory, the markets will await for further clarity on the Brexit prospects and developments. So whichever the outcome in the Tory victory, the markets will be stable. \u00c2\u00b7 Labour Win: This will be a major political upset but is highly unlikely. This could see pressure on the GBP and on Gilts in particular. UK shares may also decline though some sectors will gain on the back of expectations of higher government spending. \u00c2\u00b7 Hung Parliament: This scenario is probably the most difficult for the markets, as it will could lead to a coalition government. This will also weaken the new government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position in handling the Brexit negotiations, and can be particularly damaging for the pound. Jeremy Cook of currency firm World First is predicting (or possible hoping for) a relatively quiet night: Craig Erlam, senior analyst at foreign exchange firm OANDA, says the pound will plunge if the election didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide a clear winner: From a markets perspective, this election is huge and could produce some substantial moves, particularly in sterling, the FTSE and UK debt. As we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned from similar events previously \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Brexit, US election - not only is the outcome not always obvious but the market reaction can also catch people off guard and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had traders acting with such caution all week. The most undesirable outcome is surely a hung parliament that produces both domestic political uncertainty and, more importantly, uncertainty and delays in Brexit negotiations. With the currently deadline being March 2019, any delay will be detrimental to the UK in negotiations and could therefore be devastating for sterling. While the knee jerk reaction to this may also be bad for the FTSE, as we saw after the EU referendum, we could see this bounce back quite quickly with the weaker currency benefiting its mostly outward facing companies. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown at the start of this year was due to faltering demand in the services sector, especially among businesses that relied on consumer spending. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that higher inflation, due to the weak pound, is hitting households. It also highlights the risks posed by Brexit, argues Ben Chu of the Independent. He writes: The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump in GDP growth in the first quarter has been attributed by economists to a sharp slowdown in consumer spending, owing to the spike in inflation that has followed the drop in the pound in the wake of the Brexit vote last June. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP growth rate is expected to pick up slightly in the next quarter, but most analysts believe that leaving the EU will set back the economy, with the damage depending on the nature and scope of future trade arrangements with the EU, our biggest trade partner. Some economists warn that a failure to secure any form of deal - a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cliff-edge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit in 2019 - could cost the economy up to 9 per cent of GDP, relative to otherwise, by 2030. The UK has been growing more strongly than the rest of the EU for most of the past seven years but that partly reflects stronger population growth in the UK. The pound has shed its early gains, following the news that Britain was the slowest-growing member of the EU in the last quarter. Sterling is now hovering around $1.295, falling away from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-week high. Some early reaction to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European growth figures: Breaking! The eurozone economy grew even faster than first thought at the start of this year. Statistics body Eurostat has just updated its figures, to show that GDP in the euro area expanded by 0.6% in January-to-March. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from an initial reading of 0.5%, and is the fastest growth in a year. The figures also show that Britain was the worst-performing member of the European Union in Q1, growing by just 0.2%. In contrast, Germany expanded by 0.6%, France and Italy grew by 0.4%, and many Eastern European states grew by over 1%. We shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read too much into one quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures, though. On an annual basis, the eurozone has expanded by 1.9%, which is actually a bit slower than Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% growth over the same period. But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures do underline how Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is (finally) gathering speed, helping to bring unemployment down across the region to the lowest levels since the debt crisis starter. This chart shows how the cost of insuring against the pound tumbling, or soaring, overnight has surged today - to the highest level since last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned over the years that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wise to treat opinion polls with caution, which is why traders are rather nervous today. Jasslyn Yeo, JP Morgan market strategist, says that younger voters (who typically have a lower turnout than older ones) could catch the City out. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets appear to be pricing in a Conservative Party majority victory. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, we still see much uncertainty surrounding the UK election, where a higher turnout vote of young people could potentially turn the tables on investors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Last week, YouGov showed the scale of the generational split in UK politics: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another chart showing how the markets might react to the UK election result: There will be drama in the markets if Theresa May doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t manage to increase her majority today (she currently has a working majority of just 17). Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services reckons 40 is the magic number to avoid internal Tory party strife. Barring a surprise the key question is how large the Conservative majority might be, with anything below 40 seats likely to embolden the ever restive elements, whose penchant for internecine warfare is well documented, to embark on a fresh leadership challenge, given the incompetence of the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign. Ostwald also pints out that the next UK government faces a very tough job: Even if a substantially larger majority is achieved, there is little doubt that it will make not a iota of difference to the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance on Brexit negotiations, though it will heighten the risk that both sides continue to talk AT, rather than TO each other, and end in a complete breakdown. There is also little doubt that the UK economy is now facing some significant headwinds, above all consumers that are facing higher inflation, weak wage growth and the pressures associated with a far too rapid pace of credit growth, the more so given an increasingly soggy housing market, above all in the populous south east. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is rather subdued this morning, with the FTSE 100 dipping by a mere 3 points to 7473. Investors are sitting on their hands (or possibly nipping off to the polling booth), while they anticipate the three big events of today. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says traders need to bring their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A game\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to work today. Voters over in the UK are going to vote for their new Prime Minister, the European Central Bank will deliver their verdict about their monetary policy and James Comey will testify in front of senate. It is difficult to say which event will have create more volatility but it would be sensible thing to be ready for all kind of outcomes. The outcome of UK elections does matter because the new Prime minister will have arduous task ahead \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the negotiation process of Brexit. Moreover, the winning candidate is not going to have a glittering economic prize because the country is facing significant slow growth, tepid wage gains and a currency which has its back broken and productivity issue which is cursed. City analysts believe the pound will rise over $1.30 if Theresa May increases her majority (which was the whole reason for calling the election). But a hung parliament could send sterling plunging by over six cents - a really sizeable move. Bloomberg has crunched forecasts from several investment banks: The cost of insuring against sharp swings in the value of the pound has soared today. That shows that City traders are preparing for sterling to move sharply when the exit polls are released at 10pm tonight. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details via Reuters: STERLING/DOLLAR OVERNIGHT IMPLIED VOLATILITY JUMPS TO 30.75 PCT ON DAY OF UK ELECTION, HIGHEST SINCE JULY EURO-STERLING OVERNIGHT IMPLIED VOLATILITY HIGHEST SINCE BREXIT VOTE AT 31.55 Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Connor Campbell of SpreadEx agrees that sterling is getting a small lift from the general election: As Britain heads to the ballot box the markets got off to a relatively quiet start this Thursday, with the pound very gently building on yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains. Cable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which, despite some big swings, has been climbing since the beginning of June \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rose another 0.2%, sending sterling to a its best price in a fortnight. Against the euro the pound has been less successful of late; nevertheless, despite being a long way from recovering the losses it has incurred since mid-May, a 0.1% increase has nudged the currency to a one and a half week peak. The pound is assumedly benefiting from the final round of polls, all of which \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to varying degrees \u00e2\u20ac\u201c point to a Tory win. The pound has hit a two-week high in early trading, as City investors anticipate a Conservative win in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election. Sterling has hit $1.2976, its highest level since 25 May, after the last wave of opinion polls suggested that Theresa May is heading back to Number 10 Downing Street with a larger majority. As this chart shows, the pound has been wallowing below $1.30 in mid-May, as the election campaign heated up and investors started wondering if Britain could end up with a hung parliament. But late last night, YouGov reported that the Conservatives have a seven-point lead over Labour: Sterling traders are now pricing a Theresa May victory, says FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed: The higher the margin Conservatives win by, the more negotiation power May will have on Brexit terms, and the higher the Pound goes from here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re calling it Triple Threat Thursday in the City. A pivotal day lies ahead, with plenty of political and economic drama in Europe and the US that could send the markets lurching. In the City, investors are on edge as Britain heads to the polling stations. The latest opinion polls point to a Conservative victory, and an increased majority for Theresa May -- but a shock result could have seismic impact on shares and the pound. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a big day for the European Central Bank as its governing council holds a monetary policy meeting. Investors had been expecting the ECB to take its first step towards tightening monetary policy, by tweaking the language in its outlook statement. However, leaks yesterday claimed that the ECB is actually going to revise down its inflation outlook -- making any exit from its stimulus programme even less likely. ECB president Mario Draghi will reveal all in his eagerly awaited press conference at lunchtime. We also get updated eurozone GDP figures, which could possibly see growth revised UP to 0.6% in the last quarter, from 0.5%, so it could be a volatile day for the euro. The third threat? Former FBI boss James Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony to Congress (from 3pm BST). It could be a historic event, with Comey facing questions from the Senate Intelligence Committee over the investigation into ties between president Trump and Russia. Our world affairs editor Julian Borger explains why it really really matters: When James Comey, the former FBI director, stands before a Senate committee on Thursday to give evidence about the president who fired him, it will be one of the most dramatic moments in US political history. The stakes will be as high as they have ever been at a congressional hearing. The questions Comey will be asked by the Senate intelligence committee include whether Donald Trump tried to persuade him to stop an investigation into improper contacts between a top adviser and Russian officials, whether Trump sought to extract a vow of personal loyalty, and whether Comey was fired because he did not comply. Trump has denied trying to make Comey drop the case, but if Comey contradicts him and is supported by other evidence, it would represent potential obstruction of justice by the president and mark a long leap down the road towards impeachment. Even in the Teapot Dome scandal that shook Warren Harding\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration in the early 1920s, and in the Watergate affair half a century later, it was not alleged that the president himself tried to intimidate an investigator.... More here: Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prepared statement has already set the scene, showing that president Donald Trump pressured him to shut down an investigation into a senior adviser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s links to Russia.

Edoardo Campanella, economist at UniCredit Research, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The eurozone enters the second quarter on a good footing. Industrial production accelerated in April, expanding by 0.5% month on month from 0.2% in the previous month. The industrial production increase was broad-based across its main components (with durable capital goods being the only exception), but not across the largest economies. Germany led the way, while France and Italy recorded slight declines. However, part of the weakness is due to some technical factors related to both the Easter break and a bridge-day effect in Italy that weighed on the number of working days and, thus, on factory activity. This might explain why today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure, albeit good, seems disappointing when compared to the exceptionally strong manufacturing PMI reading that in April hit a six-year high.</p> <p>Since the most recent surveys continue to point to a rather solid growth in manufacturing activity in the eurozone, it is fair to expect that May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard data from the industrial sector will finally reflect this acceleration in output activity.</p> </blockquote> <p>ING Bank economist Bert Colijn pointed out that much of the growth was due to improvements in energy production, which had underperformed in the first quarter due to a mild winter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Growth in production of goods dropped in April though and capital goods production even declined. While the monthly data for production is volatile, this does show that industry continues to struggle on its way up.</p> <p>The outlook for industry does remain bright though as businesses have been indicating that backlogs of work are increasing as new orders are coming in at a faster pace. This will likely translate into accelerating growth over the course of Q2. Still, while backlogs of work have been increasing, this does not mean that Eurozone industry is overheating. Capacity utilisation has been improving over 2016 and is getting closer to peaks seen in previous expansions, but businesses are also still indicating that a lack of demand is limiting production far more than a lack of labour, funding or equipment.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile eurozone employment grew by 0.4% quarter on quarter and 1.5% year on year in the first quarter.

                "bodyText":"That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick round-up. The US Federal Reserve has pressed on with the normalisation of interest rate policy, by hiking borrowing costs for the second time this year. The Fed funds rate is now 1% to 1.25%. The Fed is also broadly sticking to its previous guidance for interest rate rises over the next couple of years. Chair Janet Yellen tried to cool speculation that recent weak inflation might make the central bank more dovish. The Fed remains confident that the US economy is recovering, saying: The Committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Economists said the move shows that the Fed believes the recovery is on track. Ian Kernohan, senior economist at Royal London Asset Management, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Fed made little changes in the language or projections for further interest rate hikes. They acknowledged that inflation was running below target, but also that job gains have been solid. We expect another rate hike and some balance sheet normalisation before the end of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In another sign of confidence, the Fed outlined its plans to start selling off some of the assets bought during its stimulus programme. During a press conference, Janet Yellen said she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d not discussed her future with president Trump. She remains committed to serving her full term (to February 2018). Wall Street took the news in its stride, with the Dow Jones ending the day at a new high thanks to rising financial stocks. The US dollar also strengthened during Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference, as traders anticipated further rate hikes down the line. Scott Minerd of investment firm Guggenheim Partners sums it up: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW DING DING goes the closing bell on Wall Street. And the Dow Jones industrial average has finished at a record high, up around 0.2% But the technology-focused Nasdaq index has dropped by 0.6%. Capital Economists have provided a brisk summary of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions today: As widely expected, the Fed raise its policy rate target by an additional 25bp today, to between 1.00% and 1.25% and, despite the recent weakness of core inflation, Fed officials still expect to raise that rate once more in the second half of this year. The Fed also laid out plans for shrinking its balance sheet, with the initial run-off even smaller than we had previously expected, although it offered no specifics on the timing of when that normalisation would begin other than \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Wall Street isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too happy with Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments. The Nasdaq index has dropped by 1% after the Fed chair downplayed recent weak inflation data and signalled that US interest rates will continue to rise over the next couple of years. The S&amp;P 500 is down 0.25%, while the Dow Jones industrial average is flat. Finally, Yellen gets a question about apprenticeships, and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new push to get more Americans to develop their work skills on the job (a specialist subject for the President, of course). Yellen agrees that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important area. It is hard for firms to find workers with appropriate skills right now, as the labor market is so tight. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a particular problem for smaller businesses, she explains, as they have less latitude to retrain workers. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the press conference Q: Now you are getting ready to reduce your balance sheet, what have you learned about QE and whether it works? Great question, says Yellen, who explains how staff at the Fed, and outside, have done a great deal of work evaluating QE. I think we have learned that it works, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a valuable part of the toolkit. How has it worked, exactly? Yellen says QE (buying huge amounts of bonds with new money) succeeded in putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates. And it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t caused the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153runaway inflation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which some critics feared. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Quite the reverse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Yellen, dryly. So in future, if the Fed hit an episode of extreme economic weakness its primary weapon would be interest rates. But if it reached the point where it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cut again (the zero lower bound), QE could be deployed. Q: The president has credited you with being a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclow interest rate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 person. Do you agree? Yellen says she \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstrongly supported\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy of keeping interest rates at record lows after the financial crisis -- so i guess she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accepting the accolade, despite having just raised rates! Q: What do you say to the group of economists who are calling for the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation target to be raised? [This group, which includes Nobel laureate Joe Stiglitz, warned that the Fed could trigger a recession if it kept raising rates] Yellen plays a straight bat (unlike the England cricket team today, alas), saying it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very important issue. The Fed is open to a wide range of views, and might reconsider its target sometime in the future....ants to take in a wide range of views. Fidelity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Anna Stupnytska, is surprised that Yellen is sounding more cautious - especially about inflation and wage growth. Back to inflation... Q: Is it possible that globalisation, and falling central bank credibility, mean we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve entered an era of low inflation where it will be very hard to get wages and prices rising again? Yellen doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credibility has been impaired (but what else would a Fed chair say?!). But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certainly possible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that structural factors are partly to blame, she adds. Yellen says she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not seen much evidence that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed tax and spending plans have changed consumer or business spending. Q: Is the Fed worried about the recent run of weak inflation futures? Yellen doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound too worried, saying that inflation can be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153noisy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and affected by idiosyncratic factors. She cites cuts to cell phone contract prices, and some over-the-counter medicines. Onto questions, and the press pack quickly home in on Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. Q: Have you spoken to the president about the possibility of serving a second term, and would you be interested? Yellen says she is fully committed to serving her full first term, but she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not had any discussions with president Trump about a second term. She declines to say whether she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to say on when her first term expires (in February 2018). [Background: Trump dropped loud hints last year that he would replace Yellen] Q: Are you disappointed that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t produced any nominees for the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board of governors? The White House is working hard to find nominees for open slots, Yellen replies. She \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very much hopes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd there will be nominations in the not too distant future. Yellen is now outlining the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to start reducing its balance sheet later this year [details here]. She confirms that the Fed will take a cautious approach, initially with a $6bn monthly cap on sales of Treasury bonds and $4bn on mortgage-backed securities. This cap, which is expected to rise every quarter, will avoid any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153market strains\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as the Fed sells some of the assets bought during the financial crisis to stimulate the economy. Yellen also cautions that there is no rush to take decisions about the long-run framework of monetary policy. Big decisions, like the ideal future composition of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance sheet, needn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be taken for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quite some time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Janet Yellen also acknowledges the shooting in Virginia earlier today, where several people including Steve Scalise, Republican House majority whip, were shot. Our thoughts are with those who were injured this morning, the Fed chair says. Fed chair Janet Yellen explains that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest hike reflects the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153progress\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the economy, which appears to have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rebounded\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after slowing in the first three months of 2017. A pick-up in global growth is helping US exports, she says. Yellen adds that the job market will probably strengthen further, but cautions that it is near its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maximum sustainable level\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. On inflation, she credits one-off factors for the recent slowdown in inflation. And the bottom line - the Fed continues to expect that gradual increases in borrowing costs will be needed to keep inflation close to target, while sustaining the economic expansion. But, rates are still likely to be lower than in previous economic cycles, she adds. Over in Washington, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is holding a press conference to discuss today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions. You can watch it live here. Yellen is explaining that the Fed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continues to expect that the economy will expand at a moderate pace\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as conditions continue to improve in the labour market. The most important news tonight is the new guidelines on Fed balance sheet reduction. So says Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International. Stevenson explains: There was never much doubt that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates by a further 0.25% at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting to between 1% and 1.25%. ... More important was what the US central had to say about its plans to rein in its bloated balance sheet, which has ballooned to $4.5trn since the financial crisis as the Fed has bought government and mortgage-backed bonds to underpin the American economy. The Fed said today that it would decrease reinvestment of maturing bonds at a steadily increasing rate until after a year it is holding back $30bn a month on Government bonds and $20bn on mortgage backed securities. The Fed has taken another step towards \u00e2\u20ac\u0153normalisation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management commented. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recent economic indicators have not been weak enough to prevent Yellen pulling the lever on the third rate hike in seven months. Yes, inflation remains elusive, and wage growth relatively weak, but the data does not suggest growth has slowed enough to suggest a change in tack. The decision to raise rates doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t signal the beginning of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, but it does mark another step towards normalisation, as well as confidence in the long-term recovery of the economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate hike shows that the Federal Reserve is confident that the US economy is recovering, says Kully Samra, UK Managing Director at Charles Schwab. Samra adds: Despite recent underwhelming jobs numbers, the underlying US economic data remains robust enough to warrant tightening. While the economy is bouncing back from a weak first quarter, earnings have been strong and even in the wake of continued political uncertainty, corporate confidence remains secure. The market has demonstrated that it is comfortable with gradual rate hikes and will be reassured that the Fed has today committed to its promises. We expect at least one more rate hike this year but incoming data will influence future decisions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We have some unexpected news - the Fed has outlined how it expects to start reducing its huge balance sheet. Reuters has a great explanation: The Fed gave a clear outline on its plan to reduce its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, most of which were purchased in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The committee currently expects to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program this year, provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Fed said in its statement. According to an addendum released with the policy statement, the Fed anticipates that the balance sheet reduction plan would feature halting reinvestments of ever-larger amounts of maturing securities. The Fed sees the cap for Treasury securities to be $6 billion per month initially, increasing in $6 billion increments at three-month intervals over 12 months until it reaches $30 billion per month. For agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, the cap will be $4 billion per month initially, increasing by $4 billion at quarterly intervals over a year until it reaches $20 billion per month. The Federal Reserve has updated its dot plot, which shows where each policymaker thinks interest rates will be over the next few years. It shows that 4 policymakers expect rates will remain on hold for the rest of 2017. Eight Fed voters predict one more rate hike -- the central view - and another four expect two. As this chart shows, that means one voter is less hawkish than in March. The US dollar has fallen by 0.4% against a basket of currencies as Wall Street digests today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement. In its prepared statement, the Federal Reserve says that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continued to strengthen\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd since its last meeting. Economic activity has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rising moderately\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so far this year, the Fed says: Job gains have moderated but have been solid, on average, since the beginning of the year, and the unemployment rate has declined. Household spending has picked up in recent months, and business fixed investment has continued to expand. The Fed also acknowledge that inflation is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhat below 2%\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a nod to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker-than-expected CPI data. They add: Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2% in the near term but to stabilise around the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% objective over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely. Breaking: The Federal Reserve has voted to raise American interest rates today, to a range of 1% to 1.25%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quarter-point move, and exactly what Wall Street expected ... The Fed has also stuck to its forecast of one more interest rate rise this year. Just over 15 minutes to go, until the Federal Reserve either delivers the interest rate hike that the markets expect, or shocks us by leaving borrowing costs on hold ... Earlier, on the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme, the consensus seemed to be the US Federal Reserve would be raising rates. George Magnus, economist and senior advisor at UBS said: I think they [the Fed] really want to do this [rate rise] and I think they want to do it because they are trying to normalise the situation. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re quite worried about sub prime \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in other words less than good quality automobile loans and commercial real estate. So they have other concerns in addition to the economy. After today, though, things might change, because if inflation doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pick up in the United States later this year then the expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep going will be revised. Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management, said: The US economy is fundamentally a 2% growth economy. All the soft data, the surveys have been great but if you look at the hard data it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look as great, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look terrible either. The US recovery is continuing, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as strong as the markets might suggest ... I also agree that the Fed will hike rates today. As long as the markets are aligned as they are with yields pretty low, the dollar fairly weak but equity markets soaring, it gives the Fed room to hike. Of course they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to not just normalise rates but start shrinking their balance sheet but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a deadline for that which is when Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s term ends next year. A slump in the oil price after disappointing US weekly inventory figures has seen some of the shine come off stock markets. The FTSE 100 has also been hit by a rise in sterling, which is bad news for the overseas earners which dominate the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index. On top of that, commodity companies fell back despite some reasonable industrial production figures from China. There was also some caution among investors ahead of the US Federal Reserve meeting, which is widely expected to raise interest rates later. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 26.04 points or 0.35% at 7474.40 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.32% to 12,805.95 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.35% at 5243.29 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.61% to 20,960.55 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.98% at 10,775.8 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.48% to 800.97 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 9 points or 0.04%. On oil, Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Oil prices are in freefall again, thanks to a second consecutive failure of forecasters on the oil inventories front. Stockpiles dropped by much less than forecast, although at least they got the direction right this week, after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock rise in inventories. What is particularly noticeable is that oil production continues to rise, even as prices fall. It looks like everyone is keen to get as much sold before another rout in prices. WTI now trades at its lowest level in six weeks, with little sign of a turnaround in place. Both Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate are now down more than 2%. The weekly US oil figures have shown a smaller than forecast fall in crude stocks. The Energy Information Admistration said crude stocks fell by 1.66m barrels last week to 511.55m, lower than the 2.7m drop expected by the market and indicating weaker than expected demand. Gasoline stocks rose by 2.1m barrels compared to forecasts of a 0.5m decline. Crude prices, which have been buffetted by concerns that Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output cuts were having little effect given rising US production, have seen their losses increase following the figures. Brent, down 0.88% before the US data, has now fallen 1.64% to $47.92 a barrel. West Texas Intermediated has seen its losses increase from 0.8% to 1.89%. Back with the dollar, and it has fallen to its lowest level against the euro since the start of November. The single currency currently sits at $1.1286, up 0.64%, after reaching $1.1295. With the uncertainty over the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view on further interest rate rises in the wake of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak data, Wall Street has made a mixed start. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a new peak of 21,354 initially, before falling back to 21,334, a gain of around 6 points. The S&amp;P 500 edged up 0.12% at the open, while the Nasdaq Composite was unchanged. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, also believes the weak US data casts doubts on further Federal Reserve rate hikes after today: A double dose of soft economic data sent the US dollar plunging and gold rallying before the Federal Reserve rate decision. Slowing inflation and flat retail sales add to the growing sense that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting could see the last US rate rise this year. We would be in a state of shock if the Federal Reserve didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lift interest rates at its meeting later today.... Movement in the dollar will depend on what kind of signal policymakers give about the next hike, possibly in September. The US economy has not been firing on all cylinders but the Fed risks losing credibility if it backed off from a rate hike when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been so heavily intonated. A \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdovish hike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 seems most appropriate, which may not be enough to generate enthusiasm for the dollar. With the expectations for further US rate rises after today dimming, the dollar is continuing to weaken. This is to the benefit of the pound, which has climbed above $1.28 for the first time since the UK election. It was a brief moment, but sterling is still up 0.36% at $1.2795. The weaker than expected US inflation and retail sales figures could mean the Federal Reserve being more cautious about further interest rate rises this year, says James Knightley of ING Bank: This [data] creates more of a headache for the Federal Reserve in how it communicates its hiking strategy. They keep talking about slower growth and weaker inflation being transitory (the word was used on nine separate occasions in the minutes to the May FOMC meeting), but the longer we go without seeing growth and inflationary pressures is resulting in the markets becoming less convinced about higher interest rates. With little sign of tax reform and fiscal stimulus coming the Fed will likely sound more cautious on the prospect of an additional hike later this year even though their forecasts will almost certainly include it when released later on today. The dollar has just hit a one week-low against a basket of currencies, as the markets give their verdict to that double-dose of US data. Jamie McGeever of Reuters says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures were much weaker than expected: Matt Boesler of Bloomberg has spotted that the markets are repricing their interest rate hike expectations: Colin Cieszynski of CMC Markets wonders if the Fed might even leave interest rates on hold today, rather than delivering the hike that has been priced in by the markets: Chris Vecchio of Daily FX suggests the US dollar will have a volatile day Another newsflash! US retail sales have suffered their biggest decline in 16 months. Retail sales declined by 0.3% in May, new figures from the Commerce Department show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest drop since January 2016, and dashes expectations of a 0.1% rise. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another signal that the US recovery might not be as strong as hoped, and means the dollar is getting quite a hoofing. Newsflash: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has fallen!, surprising the markets and sending the dollar sliding. Consumer prices across the US dropped by 0.1% during May, having risen by 0.2% in April. And that dragged the annual inflation rate down to 1.9%, down from 2.2% a month ago. Core inflation, which strips out the prices of volatile elements like gasoline and food, only rose by 1.7% - the weakest rise since May 2015. This gives America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bankers something to think about, as they gather for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. It probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop the Federal Reserve raising interest rates in under six hours time, but it might make them more cautious about the next rise.... Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage squeeze since the financial crisis struck is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153staggeringly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bad. He writes: Cast your mind back to March 2008. The financial markets have been in turmoil since the previous summer and in the previous month the Labour government has been forced to nationalise the troubled bank Northern Rock. Few realised it at the time but the economy had peaked. A deep and brutal recession was about to begin. In that month, the average basic weekly wage, excluding bonuses, was \u00c2\u00a3473. The recession officially came to an end by late 2009 and after a couple of years of weak and patchy growth, the worst seemed to be over. Activity picked up, unemployment started to come down. Yet more than nine years after the slump of 2008 began, wages \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the yardstick by which most people judge whether the economy is doing well or not \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have not recovered. In fact, according to the Office for National Statistics, they have gone backwards. The average basic weekly wage, adjusted for movements in prices, now stands at \u00c2\u00a3458. More here: Over in Europe and eurozone industrial production rose by 0.5% month on month in April, with March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure revised up from a 0.1% fall to a 0.2% increase. Edoardo Campanella, economist at UniCredit Research, said: The eurozone enters the second quarter on a good footing. Industrial production accelerated in April, expanding by 0.5% month on month from 0.2% in the previous month. The industrial production increase was broad-based across its main components (with durable capital goods being the only exception), but not across the largest economies. Germany led the way, while France and Italy recorded slight declines. However, part of the weakness is due to some technical factors related to both the Easter break and a bridge-day effect in Italy that weighed on the number of working days and, thus, on factory activity. This might explain why today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure, albeit good, seems disappointing when compared to the exceptionally strong manufacturing PMI reading that in April hit a six-year high. Since the most recent surveys continue to point to a rather solid growth in manufacturing activity in the eurozone, it is fair to expect that May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard data from the industrial sector will finally reflect this acceleration in output activity. ING Bank economist Bert Colijn pointed out that much of the growth was due to improvements in energy production, which had underperformed in the first quarter due to a mild winter: Growth in production of goods dropped in April though and capital goods production even declined. While the monthly data for production is volatile, this does show that industry continues to struggle on its way up. The outlook for industry does remain bright though as businesses have been indicating that backlogs of work are increasing as new orders are coming in at a faster pace. This will likely translate into accelerating growth over the course of Q2. Still, while backlogs of work have been increasing, this does not mean that Eurozone industry is overheating. Capacity utilisation has been improving over 2016 and is getting closer to peaks seen in previous expansions, but businesses are also still indicating that a lack of demand is limiting production far more than a lack of labour, funding or equipment. Meanwhile eurozone employment grew by 0.4% quarter on quarter and 1.5% year on year in the first quarter. In all, statistics office Eurostat said 154.8m people were employed in the eurozone in the first quarter, the highest number on record. Here are the Liberal Democrats on the fall in real wages. The party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader Tim Farron joined the calls for an end to the freeze on public sector pay rises: For a government that used to bang on about the Just About Managing, they are doing diddly squat to help them. This represents the biggest fall in real wages since August 2014. Staff are working more hours, for less pay and with higher levels of stress. More people are living pay cheque to pay cheque and having to struggle at the end of every month to get by. Britain needs a pay rise and it is time the government delivered it, especially for the public sector. Our nurses, care workers, teachers and soldiers have bared the brunt of the economic crisis and seen their pay capped and wages squeezed. Enough is enough. We need to raise the wages of our public sector workers. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment report: The pound has now dropped into the red, as the City shows its disappointment with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor wage growth. Sterling is now down 0.2% today at $1.2725. The wage squeeze is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153headache\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government (on top of everything else) says the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Helen Barnard, JRF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of analysis, says the labour market has now reached a tipping point which can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply be ignored by Westminster. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouraging to see that employment levels continue to rise and unemployment has fallen again. But the troubling news for the government is the continued squeeze on wages for those are in work. This is the first time that there has been a year-on-year decrease in real total pay since 2014. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have reached a tipping point where rising costs are outstripping earnings, leaving millions of just managing families in a precarious position. The election campaign paid precious little attention to the squeezed living standards of low income households and their prospects of finding secure, well-paid work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It means the new government must act to ease the strain by lifting the damaging freeze on tax credits, and prioritising plans to drive up pay and productivity across the country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd UNISON, the union, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows how much stress the public sector is facing, as it also calls for the 1% pay cap to be ditched. General secretary Dave Prentis warns: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Demand for public services continues to rise, but these figures confirm that the workforce is still being cut. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Services are being starved of funds and staff shortages mean nurses, paramedics, teaching assistants and council employees are having to work even harder, but for less money. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Public sector workers have not had a proper pay rise since 2011. It is no wonder they feel so undervalued. The public sector pay cap must go.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The governent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Secretary of State for Work &amp; Pensions, David Gauke, is encouraged that employment remains at record levels. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This government wants to give everyone the opportunity to succeed, regardless of where they live or their background. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is yet another strong set of record-breaking figures with employment up and unemployment down, fuelled by full-time opportunities. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is good news for families as we continue to build a stronger, fairer Britain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But opposition parties are alarmed by the fall in real wages. Debbie Abrahams MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We welcome the overall increase in employment, but are deeply concerned that millions remain in low paid, insecure work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government has also failed to close the employment gap faced by women, disabled people and BAME groups, who have too often borne the brunt of austerity cuts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the cost of basic essentials rising by 2.9 per cent, while wages stagnate, too many of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s families are struggling to get by while Theresa May focuses on holding her unstable coalition of chaos together. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Only a Labour government will ensure working people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s living standards are protected with a real Living Wage of \u00c2\u00a310 per hour, and an immediate end to austerity spending cuts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Prime Minister must stand aside and let a Labour government build an economy that works for the many, not the few.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, suggests the government may have to bow to pressure and end its 1% cap on public sector pay rises, as the TUC and others demand. With inflation likely to be heading above 3% later this year, the squeeze on real pay growth is now getting serious and is likely to dampen real consumer spending growth for some time to come. The cost of Brexit to people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s living standards due to the fall in the pound is becoming ever more apparent. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The squeeze is even more severe in the public sector, where pay is only rising at around 1%. The sustainability of this pay policy for nurses, doctors, teachers and other key public service workers will come increasingly into doubt as inflation rises to 3% and above later this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also shows how the public sector has shrunk since the financial crisis. Just 17.0% of all people in work were employed in the public sector, which is the lowest proportion since comparable records began in 1999. There are now 5.42 million people employed in the public sector, down 20,000 in the last year, and the lowest since June 1999. The rise of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGig economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, with its low-paid, precarious jobs, is surely a factor behind the weak wage growth. Dr John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, says it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remarkable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that pay is so weak when the employment rate is at a record high of nearly 75%. Hard times and near full employment make strange bedfellows, highlighting the extent to which a de-regulated labour market with an abundance of workers available to fill low wage vacancies has altered the UK jobs landscape.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 The Resolution Foundation have crunched today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures, to show how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pay is still below its levels before the financial crisis (once you adjust for inflation). They also show how the economy is still creating jobs, although some parts of the country aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feeling the benefits as much as others: Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, also fears that the pay squeeze will hurt growth: The UK economy faces a dangerous cocktail of political uncertainty, slowing growth and shrinking real wages. First-quarter GDP figures were disappoining, while a recent report from VISA confirmed consumers are under pressure, with spending falling 0.8% year-on-year in May. Households are being squeezed from both directions, with inflation rising faster than expected and wages rising more slowly. This doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bode well for economic growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the UK economy is heavily reliant on the consumer and falling real incomes will eventually translate into lower retail sales. The pay squeeze puts more pressure on the Bank of England to consider raising interest rates to curb inflation, argues Neil Wilson of ETX Capital (whose hopes of stronger wage growth have been firmly dashed). He writes: Wages are climbing at a rate of just 2.1%, or just 1.7% when you excluded bonuses. This run rate is just not enough to sustain consumer spending where it has been of late when inflation is accelerating. Average earnings in real terms slumped by 0.6%, or 0.4% including bonuses. This will have a material effect on GDP growth in the second quarter. The pay-inflation gap is widening despite record low unemployment, which is also a sign of structural problems for the UK economy. Total pay growth was running above 3% in the first half of 2015, when inflation was anchored at around zero. That sweet spot is well and truly over. Real pay is falling across the economy, points out Professor Geraint Johnes, Director of Research at the Work Foundation: On the three month average measure, pay settlements fell from 2.3% in March to 2.1% in April [that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s including bonuses]. The fall in the single month measure is more dramatic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from 2.4% to 1.2% - though it should be noted that this measure is generally held to be less reliable. On the single month measure, there were falls in average weekly earnings in both the finance and construction sectors in April. There is no sector of the economy in which wages are currently rising as fast as prices. The squeeze in real wages is back, and there seems to be little prospect of an immediate recovery.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, has a few theories for why real wages are shrinking again. One could be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcslack in the labour market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - which is economist speak for the fact that the jobs market isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working as well as it could. This is usually down to underemployment: people working part-time who want a full-time job or hidden unemployment: people who are not actively looking for work but who would rejoin the workforce if the jobs market were stronger. Another factor is the problem of poor productivity. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t unique to the UK and has been an issue in many developed world economies since the financial crisis. While most economists concur that slowing productivity is one of the most serious problems in their field today, few can agree on the cause and still less on the right response. Whatever the reason, the situation looks pretty bad: The TUC, which represents Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workers, is calling on the government to act now and end its curbs on public sector pay. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says the policy (which restricts pay rises to 1%) must go. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Real wages have fallen for the second month in a row. Unless the government gets its act together, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll soon be in the middle of another cost of living crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ministers must focus on delivering better-paid jobs across the UK. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to bin the artificial pay restrictions on nurses, midwives and other public sector workers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Britain needs a pay rise, not more pressure on household budgets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The fall in UK real wages is likely to hurt economic growth, warns Naeem Aslam of Think Markets. It is the UK consumers who have been pulling the UK economy and if we see them slowing down, it surely means that economy cannot do well Brexit is certainly on the centre stage when it comes to this and I personally believe that investors are feeling the impact of this. Dutch bank ING is alarmed by the slowdown in UK pay growth, at a time when Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political future is so unclear. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sarah Rappaport is worried about the impact on the public: Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group is concerned that the link between wages and unemployment appears to have broken down (with unemployment at a 42-year low, labour scarcity should drive earnings up). Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also shows that British workers are suffering the worst wage squeeze in two and a half years. The ONS says: Between February to April 2016 and February to April 2017 in real terms (that is, adjusted for consumer price inflation) total pay for employees in Great Britain fell by 0.4%, the lowest growth rate since July to September 2014. If you include bonuses, average pay grew by 2.1%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than the 1.7% rise in regular pay, but still not enough to keep up with inflation. The Office for National Statistics says: Latest estimates show that average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain in real terms (that is, adjusted for price inflation) fell by 0.4% including bonuses, and fell by 0.6% excluding bonuses, compared with a year earlier. Breaking! Basic pay in the UK economy grew by a meagre 1.7% year-on-year in the three months to April. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much worse than expected, and also the lowest rise in regular pay since February 2016. It means that real wages are shrinking at an even faster rate than feared -- inflation was 2.7% in April (and 2.9% in May!) so pay simply isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep pace with the cost of living. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report also shows that the unemployment rate remained at a 42-year low of 4.6%. The number of people out of work fell by 50,000 in the three months to April. The employment total jumped by 109,000 during the quarter, to 31.954. More to follow! The pound is dipping back as City traders brace for the jobs report... The pound should strengthen if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage figures are less grim than feared. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says: Unemployment is likely to be decent so the focus is on earnings. Stronger-than-expected wage growth could help support sterling a touch as it will help offset concerns that falling real wages is destroying consumer spending. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation beat at 2.9% highlights the problems facing the economy so a sign that earnings are at least trying to keep pace will be welcome and allay concerns that consumers stop spending. City economists expect that total pay rose by 2.4% in the three months to April - but only by 2.0% if bonuses are stripped out. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right in 20 minutes... You can get up to speed on the state of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market with these charts from economist Rupert Seggins: The US dollar is under some pressure today ahead of the Federal Reserve decision, which is helping nudge the pound up. With an interest rate hike today \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpriced in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, traders are focusing on the tone of the decision from the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Open Market Committee. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale expects the Fed to sound cautious about the long-term path for interest rates. The FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response is likely to be a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdovish hike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s priced in, to a large degree. Uncertain about how much slack there is in the economy or the labour market, FOCM members are inclined to want to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnormalise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rates while they have the chance, but they seem very pragmatic about the longer-term outlook. So more likely to raise rates now, without overlay hawkish commentary, and then lay the groundwork for another hike in the autumn if markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take fright in the weeks ahead. In the City, the FTSE 250 index - which contains medium-sized UK-focused firms - has jumped by 0.5% in early trading. Housebuilder Bellway is the biggest riser, up 3.6%, after reporting that customer demand for new homes is still strong. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index is flat, although its housebuilders (Taylor Wimpey, Barratt and Persimmon) are all rising. Guardian Business has launched a daily email.

For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Sterling is rising in early trading, hitting its highest level since Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock general election results landed. The pound has gained a third of a cent to $1.278, as traders brace for this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK jobs report. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a little higher against the euro, at just below \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.14. The possibility that Britain could now seek a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsofter Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from the European Union is helping the pound recover. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga explains: Currency investors remained cautiously optimistic over a softer Brexit following last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK election outcome, resulting in a hung parliament. Although the political uncertainty in the UK and pending Brexit negotiations are still in focus, much attention will be directed towards the UK jobs report this morning. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living squeeze will be dragged back into the spotlight today, when the latest employment data is released. City economists fear today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures will show that wages are falling further behind inflation, which has been driven up to 2.9% in May by the weak pound (as we learned yesterday). Basic pay rises (excluding bonuses) are expected to have fallen to 2.0% in the three months to April. That would mean real wages have kept falling this year, bringing more pain to struggling families across the country. On a more positive note, the unemployment rate may remain at a 42-year low (last month it fell to 4.6% , the lowest since 1975), and the employment total probably kept rising in the last quarter. RBC Capital Markets say: Unless last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains somehow turn out to be a total blip, it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too surprising if the level of employment rises again by close to a triple-digit number of thousands in the three months to April. The rotation of workers out of part-time roles into full-time employment is now an established theme and if we see this trend once more it would imply that slack is being partially eroded as a result of reduced \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunderemployment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a big day for the US economy. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, the Federal Reserve, is widely expected to raise interest rates today - to a target range of 1% to 1.25% (from 0.75% to 1%). Fed chair Janet Yellen will then face the press and give her views on the state of the economy. Wall Street experts predict she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try to squash speculation that the Fed is too hawkish. As Lew Alexander, chief economist at Nomura, put it (via Marketwatch): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We do expect her to try to be somewhat forceful in conveying...to market participants that their skepticism over hikes after the June meeting may not be warranted.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We also get new eurozone unemployment figures, plus new retail sales and inflation statistics from America. European stock markets are expected to be flattish, as investors hunker down ahead of the Fed decision tonight. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9.30am BST: UK labour market report 10am BST: Eurozone employment report for Q1 2017 1.30pm BST: US inflation report for May 1.30pm BST: US retail sales for May 7pm BST: US Federal Reserve interest rate decision 7.30pm BST: Fed chair Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference",

The IMF contribution to Greek bailout coffers is expected to be limited, but European governments see the IMF as a tough broker that will push Athens for reforms and lend the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout electoral credibility. Having the IMF on board is seen as a litmus test for the Bundestag, which has to approve loans to Greece. Hopes of a breakthrough rose when the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Berlin said she was confident Greece would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153be rewarded for its efforts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Arriving for the talks in Luxembourg, the Greek finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, summed up his feelings tersely: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Optimistic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he said. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leftwing government, which has pushed through unpopular pension cuts and tax increases to secure the funds, is very likely to be disappointed that it is still waiting on a specific number on debt relief. Although the economy is growing again, more than one third of Greeks are estimated to be at risk of poverty. Eurozone ministers were expected to stop short of naming a figure for measures to ease Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt burden, which totals \u00e2\u201a\u00ac314bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or 180% of economic output. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a figure that rolls out,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who is the Eurogroup president. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The figure will only come at the end of the programme.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite detente between the creditors, the IMF and the eurozone are expected to remain at odds over the long-term prospects for the Greek economy. IMF officials do not believe EU assumptions that Greece can run a budget surplus (minus debt servicing) of 3.5% for years to come. The IMF wants to the terms of the Greek debt to be eased, by extending repayment holidays and deadlines. Creditors agreed on short-term debt relief last year, but the IMF had been pressing for specifics on the long-term. It has previously warned that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debts could spiral to 250% of GDP by 2050 without help. Before the meeting on Thursdays, the creditors sounded optimistic about reaching a deal, while Greek sources warned that an agreement was hanging in the balance. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, told his cabinet he would take the problem to an EU leaders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 summit next week if there was no agreement.",

Payment of the latest tranche of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 86-billion euro ($97-billion) has been held up for months by a row over its needs for debt relief pitting bailout-weary Germany against the IMF.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am pleased to announce we have achieved an agreement on all elements,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem told a news conference.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think this is a major step forward,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.  In a breakthrough, Lagarde agreed in Luxembourg that the Washington-based IMF would join Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s massive bailout, but said any payouts depended on the eurozone coming up with a full debt relief plan.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nobody claims that this is the best solution. This is a second best solution, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a bad solution,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Lagarde, a former French finance minister.

The Committee discussed the appropriate response of monetary policy.</p> <p><strong>Given this change in the trade-off, there were arguments in favour of a moderate tightening in monetary policy.</strong> Headline, core and some domestically focussed inflation measures had picked up further. Inflation was projected to overshoot the target by more than previously expected, and to remain above it throughout the three-year forecast period. Slack in the labour market appeared to have diminished, and demand for labour remained strong. Growth in business investment and net trade appeared on track to compensate for weaker consumption. The withdrawal of part of the stimulus that the Committee had injected in August last year would help to moderate the inflation overshoot while leaving monetary policy very supportive.</p> <p><strong>But there were also arguments in favour of leaving the policy rate unchanged.</strong> A slowdown in household consumption, and GDP as a whole, had recently begun, and it was too early to judge with confidence how large and persistent it would prove to be. Although consumer confidence had held up, there had been further signs of a slowing housing market and new car registrations had fallen sharply. It was as yet unclear to what degree weaker consumption would be offset by other components of demand. A period of slower than expected growth could see a margin of slack re-opening. Wage growth had remained subdued, despite low unemployment.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/status/875310692890542081\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Bank between a rock and hard place - not much spare capacity &amp; inflation overshoot likely to be larger than they assumed. <a href=\"https://t.co/MZ1c0SHvyE\">pic.twitter.com/MZ1c0SHvyE</a></p>&mdash; Duncan Weldon (@DuncanWeldon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/status/875310692890542081\">June 15, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59426b2be4b014a733d6271a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/katieallen\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-15T11:14:37.764Z\">12.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>From the Bank of England, my colleague Katie Allen reports on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s split:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Bank of England edged closer to raising interest rates this month as a deeper split emerged among its committee of policymakers, with three of the eight voting for an immediate rate rise to keep inflation in check.</p> <p>The 5-3 split vote to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.25% will surprise financial markets. Most City economists had expected just one member, Kristin Forbes, would maintain her previous vote for rates to be raised to 0.5%.

The May pick-up was driven in part by the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness since the Brexit vote, which has made imports to the UK more expensive.</p> <p>The other five members of the monetary policy committee, including Bank governor Mark Carney, felt interest rates should stay at their current low to help support growth at a time when Britons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 incomes are being squeezed by rising prices and meagre wage growth. The drop in living standards has hit consumer spending and knocked overall economic growth. Figures this week showed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/14/pay-squeeze-wages-growth-inflation-ons-unemployment-rate\">workers were suffering the biggest squeeze on their pay since 2014</a>.</p> <p>Minutes from the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate-setting meeting released on Thursday cited a range of views on the committee. They noted inflation was now expected to overshoot the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target by more than previously expected. Supporting those voting for a rate rise, there were also signs that growth in business investment and net trade was on track to make up for weaker consumption.</p> <p> The minutes added that for some policymakers it was time to start scaling back the massive package of support launched in the wake of last summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum, that included a rate cut and more electronic money printing.....</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-594269d6e4b0d5ab311e7f9b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-15T11:09:23.308Z\">12.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pound has jumped by almost a cent to $1.278 as traders react to the shock news that three BoE policymakers want to raise interest rates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/neilwilson_etx/status/875307228449976320\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sterling pops on BoE vote <a href=\"https://t.co/YZ5iMWshym\">pic.twitter.com/YZ5iMWshym</a></p>&mdash; Neil Wilson (@neilwilson_etx) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/neilwilson_etx/status/875307228449976320\">June 15, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Birdyword/status/875307438106345473\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Jump in sterling on 5-3 vote at BOE against a rate hike. 7-1 vote was expected. <a href=\"https://t.co/ZEoVHItLip\">pic.twitter.com/ZEoVHItLip</a></p>&mdash; Mike Bird (@Birdyword) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Birdyword/status/875307438106345473\">June 15, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-06-15T11:09:42.931Z\">at 12.09pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-594267e0e4b014a733d62709\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-15T11:02:28.939Z\">12.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">SPLIT at the Bank of England!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here we go: The Bank of England has voted to leave interest rates unchanged at their current record low of 0.25%.</strong></p> <p>But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a split vote, with three policymakers voting to hike rates!!

                "bodyText":"And finally... Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister has hailed the deal. Alexis Tsipras tweeted that Today Greece is turning a page. We have an agreement that corresponds to the sacrifices of the Greek people. He added that: With unity and determination we move forward for fair growth and the healing of the wounds of the crisis. Stirring stuff. But some analysts aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced that the deal is quite that sweeping - given there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still no concrete pledge for meaningful debt relief. Wolf Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence argues that Greece is still in a fix: And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good moment to wrap up. Good night! GW Here are some photos from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup meeting in Luxembourg, where the Greek bailout deal was agreed: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Marketwatch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s explanation of how the IMF is finally coming on board and joining the Greek bailout.... Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, on Thursday unveiled a plan that will unlock some new funding for Greece. Lagarde said she would ask the IMF board to back \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the approval in principle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of a new IMF loan for Greece. The deal will unlock some IMF funding thus \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reducing serious stress on the Greek economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lagarde said. Greece is facing debt repayment in July. On the debt relief issue, the eurozone finance ministers have agreed to consider extending the maturity of some Greek bonds. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a way of providing debt relief without actually writing the loans off. So something of a fudge, really - but one that all sides can live with. Reuters explains: To accommodate the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s need for more specifics on debt relief, the euro zone finance ministers said in a statement that in 2018 they would be ready to consider extending the maturities and grace periods of their loans to Greece by a range from zero to 15 years. The average maturity now is 30 years. But they did not go any further than that and the IMF said it was not enough to calculate Greek debt sustainability. The AFP newswire have a good write-up of tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal, by Alex Pigman. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Eurozone agrees Greek bailout payment, IMF comes on board Eurozone ministers struck a long-delayed bailout deal with Greece on Thursday to unlock badly needed rescue cash, but warned Athens would have to wait for debt relief. After hours of talks in Luxembourg IMF chief Christine Lagarde and the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 19 finance ministers greenlit a payout of 8.5 billion euros to meet debt payments due in July and avoid another summer of Greek crisis. Payment of the latest tranche of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 86-billion euro ($97-billion) has been held up for months by a row over its needs for debt relief pitting bailout-weary Germany against the IMF. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am pleased to announce we have achieved an agreement on all elements,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem told a news conference. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think this is a major step forward,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. In a breakthrough, Lagarde agreed in Luxembourg that the Washington-based IMF would join Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s massive bailout, but said any payouts depended on the eurozone coming up with a full debt relief plan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nobody claims that this is the best solution. This is a second best solution, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a bad solution,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Lagarde, a former French finance minister. The deal averts a repeat of the summer of 2015 when Greece spectacularly defaulted on an IMF loan, and allows Athens to meet seven billion euros of debt repayments due in July. Athens all week insisted it would veto the deal, bitter that the latest disbursement would come without firm debt relief commitments after it delivered on tough reforms. As a consolation, in a compromise negotiated by France, Greece won a certain amount of clarity from the eurozone on debt relief. Debt relief \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will be implemented at the end of the programme, conditional on its successful implementation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in 2018, said Dijsselbloem, who is also Dutch finance minister. The eurozone would now draw up an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exit strategy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over the next year \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to enable Greece to stand on its own feet again\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Dijsselbloem said. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official line from the International Monetary Fund: The IMF has long been pushing the eurozone to admit that Greece needs debt relief to put the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances on a sustainable level. European Council president Donald Tusk has also applauded the news: European commissioner Pierre Moscovici has welcomed tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement to extend Greece its next bailout loan: But there is scepticism too. Carsten Brzeski of Dutch bank ING points out that there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any debt relief yet, and the IMF still haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put any money in. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, says tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal provides \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclight at the end of the tunnel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He explains that the eurogroup has given greater clarity about the medium-term debt relief which Greece can look forward to once its bailout programme has been successfully completed in summer 2018. The eurozone is committed to helping Greece stand on its own two feet, Tsakalotos adds. However, Tsakalotos also hints at some unhappiness, suggesting that Greece deserves even more given what it has endured, and achieved. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, says the Bundestag will consider whether to back this deal on Friday. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the eurogroup\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision needs to be ratified by national parliaments. Schauble told reporters in Luxembourg that the deal will help improve Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece has to become competitive to get access to debt markets so it can stand on its own two feet. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For that Greece has to carry out reforms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A late newsflash: Eurozone finance ministers have reached a deal to unlock \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.5bn in urgently needed loans. The eurogroup reached the deal tonight, ending months of uncertainty, giving Greece the financial assistance it needs to meet debt repayments this summer (yes, Greece is bring lent more money so it can pay older loans back). It will be split into three payments - the first, in early July, will cover debt repayments and various arrears. In a statement, the eurogroup welcomed the measures Greece has taken under its economic reform programme (which include painful austerity, tax rises and spending cuts). Importantly, the International Monetary Fund has moved closer to finally supporting Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout (which was agreed almost two years ago and expires in August 2018). It is proposing to join the bailout this summer, but would not actually disburse any money until there is an agreement on Greek debt relief..... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: Acknowledging the staff level agreement reached with Greece on policies, IMF management will shortly recommend to the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Executive Board the approval in principle of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s request for a 14-month Standby Arrangement. The IMF welcomes the further specification of the debt measures given today by Member States, and agrees that it represents a major step towards Greek debt sustainability. The IMF arrangement will become effective with resources made available in accordance with its terms, provided that the programme stays on track, when IMF staff can assure to the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Executive Board that there is an agreement on debt relief measures, that, appropriately calibrated at the end of the programme, would secure debt sustainability. On debt relief, the Eurogroup have confirmed their commitment to an early pledge to address Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt pile - but any move would only come after this current bailout. IMF chief Christine Lagarde says this is limited progress; not ideal, but enough to avoid a summer crisis. Time for a quick recap The Bank of England has surprised the markets by revealing that three policymakers have voted to raise interest rates. At her final meeting, Kristin Forbes pushed for borrowing costs to rise from 0.25% to 0.5%, and was supported by fellow MPC members Michael Sanders and Ian McCafferty. The three hawks have highlighted the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns about inflation, which jumped to 2.9% earlier this week. But there other five members are more concerned about the UK economy. Our economics editor Larry Elliott argues that the doves are right: Households are spending less, the housing market is weak, new car registrations have plunged and wage growth has fallen back, even though more people are in jobs. On balance, the arguments in favour of leaving rates where they are look more compelling than the arguments for raising them The latest economic data has highlighted why the Bank is worried. UK retail sales volumes fell sharply last month, contracting by 1.2%. On an annual basis, Britons bought just 0.9% more stuff than a year ago -- the smallest rise in four years. City traders were jolted by the news, sending the FTSE 100 and 250 indices down sharply today. Furniture maker DFS added to the anxiety by reporting that its sales have fallen materially in recent weeks. Its shares plunged by a fifth following this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning. Over in Luxembourg, eurozone finance ministers are discussing whether Greece has done enough to receive its next bailout tranche. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s optimism that a deal could come tonight.... City bigwigs won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be heading to Mansion House for their annual black tie shindig; the dinner has been cancelled due to the Grenfell Tower disaster. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has signalled he is hopeful that tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup meeting will produce what members of his government often like to call \u00e2\u20ac\u0153white smoke.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Emerging from a tripartite summit of Greek, Israeli and Cypriot leaders in Thessaloniki, the leftist leader told the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news agency: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the end the good [guys] win.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The cryptic sound-bite is being interpreted as the first sign of concrete optimism from the leader over Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt deal. The Greek media is now reporting it is only a matter of time before the bailout review is formally wrapped up. The big question, it says, is the message euro area ministers will send to markets regarding mid-term debt relief. No signs of a breakthrough at the Greek debt talks yet... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has ended the day down 55 points, or 0.75%, at 7419, after a downbeat session. Hundreds of millions of pounds was wiped off the value of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest retailers, after this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak retail sales figures. That included Next (-6%) and Marks &amp; Spencer (-4.5%). Traders were worried by the news that retail sales shrank by 1.2% in May, and only grew by 0.9% over the last 12 months - the weakest rise in four years. The FTSE 250 has a steeper selloff, shedding 2% or 421 to 19,553. That looks like the biggest one-day fall since last July. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says this pessimism highlights why the Bank of England shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raise interest rates right now. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSentiment towards UK retailers is remarkably fragile at the moment, and any signs of a consumer squeeze are being seized upon as a reason to take a big red pen to the share prices of companies in this sector. Retailers are undoubtedly facing tough times as inflation looks set to hit household budgets, however the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extreme response smacks of a knee-jerk reaction to one piece of retail sales data, when only a month ago these same figures were being celebrated for their resilience. Against this background the Bank of England looks out of step to be seriously considering raising interest rates, when economic data is pointing towards a consumer slowdown. Indeed the central bank has itself highlighted weaker consumer spending as a key risk to the UK economy, so now this particular chicken is coming home to roost, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strange that the Bank of England is thinking about releasing the foxes. For the moment the balance of power still rests with the doves in the MPC however, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worthy of note that expectations of an interest rate rise have been confounded for many years now.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Other European markets also ended in the red: Back in the UK, Sam Hill, RBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior UK economist, has argued that the next UK interest rate move will be DOWN, even though three Bank of England policymakers voted to raise them today. Hill believes that slowing consumer spending is a risk to economic growth. Business spending could falter too, in the face of political uncertainty. So he believes governor Carney should highlight this uncertainty, and downplay the chances of a rate hike, when he next speaks (tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mansion House speech having been cancelled, of course). Our view is that Carney should downplay the signal sent by the hawkish external members in light of the precarious position of the consumer and the uncertain post-election aftermath. Indeed, despite the vote split from the June meeting, we retain a forecast for more stimulus in Q1 2018, in the form of a Bank Rate cut to 0.1% and an additional \u00c2\u00a350bn of QE Gilt buying. Over in Athens, pensioners have been holding anti-austerity protests - and sound unimpressed by the prospect of Greece finally getting its next bailout loan approved today. Helena Smith reports from the Greek capital: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro group is starting on a note of optimistic with even Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s embattled finance minister saying he is hopeful that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proceedings will end well. But whatever emerges this evening will be far from what the increasingly embattled Greek government had in mind. As euro area finance ministers prepared for this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crucial Euro group, pensioners from across Greece gathered before the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parliament in Syntagma square to protest against the extra cuts they now stand to suffer following legislation of additional austerity measures last month. Most, like Nikos Agnagnostopulos, were in their eighties. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I came into Athens from the Peloponnese because the fight has to go on,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a builder I paid into my fund for nearly 50 years and now they have reduced my pension by 50%. With the next round there will be nothing left.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leftist-led coalition agreed to pre-legilsate cuts that as of 2019 will see some pensions being reduced by a further 18 percent in exchange for 7.5 bn euro in loan disbursements that single currency finance ministers are expected to sign off today. With maturing debt due next month, the tranche is vital if Greece is to, once again, avert default. But the emergency funds are a far cry from the debt relief Tsipras insists is absolutely necessary if the recession-hit Greek economy is ever to recover. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the very least we are expecting what they agree to give us to be bigger than the forthcoming debt owed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one Syriza MP adding that a bigger tranche would automatically stimulate the real economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were told [by Tsipras] in no uncertain terms that the qui pro quo for supporting measures that went beyond those initially agreed in this [bailout] programme would be debt forgiveness. A lot of us are enraged that while we have kept to our side of the deal, they [creditors] have not kept to theirs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ahead of the today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting Tsipras had urged lenders to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153respect the rules\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in op eds penned for the French daily Le Monde and German Die Welt. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect our lenders to respect the rules that they, themselves, came up with,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he wrote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 To respect my country. To respect Greece.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Optimism is building that Greece and its creditors might finally reach a deal over its bailout today. The eurogroup meeting is getting underway in Luxembourg, and several ministers have expressed hopes that Athens might finally get its next aid tranche. This loan has been held back for months, as creditors demand more German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told reporters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I remain confident that we will find an agreement today on the payment of the latest tranche.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, Schauble also dampened hopes of a breakthrough on debt relief today. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire was also upbeat, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a question of goodwill and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a question of willingness. If everyone around the table makes a very slight and positive move in the right direction we should be able to find an agreement today,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director, Christine Lagarde, is also attending the meeting: The head of the Royal Statistical Society is jubilant that UK data will no longer be released early to selected insiders. Back in March, the WSJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mike Bird exposed how UK government bonds moved in suspicious ways before UK data was released, suggesting that statistics were being leaked. He wrote: On average, between April 2011 and December 2016, U.K. government-bond futures correctly anticipated the rise or fall that ultimately happened when economic data were published, according to an analysis prepared for The Wall Street Journal by Alexander Kurov, associate professor of finance at West Virginia University..... Some senior British statisticians and policy makers have long feared that the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wide, early distribution of data creates a much greater risk of leaks and the potential that people could trade on data ahead of their release. For U.K. unemployment data, for instance, 118 people have prerelease access, according to the Office for National Statistics. Important news! The Office for National Statistics is stopping releasing data 24 hours early to scores of politicians and officials. From July 1, the ONS will end its current \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpre-access\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 system, which allowed early access to official surveys. This follows pressure from economists and journalists, and persistent concern that the data has been leaked to City traders who have profited by buying or selling the pound in advance. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national statistician, John Pullinger, says that previous efforts to tighten early access haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worked, so the whole system must end. Pullinger says: On the basis of all the information now available to me I consider that the public benefit likely to result from pre-release access to ONS statistics is outweighed by the detriment to public trust in those statistics likely to result from such access. Lena Komileva of G+ Economics makes a very good point. The Bank of England doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually have to raise rates to influence the markets. It can make signals, and encourage investors to change their views, through a narrow vote on the MPC. She says: It is an open question as to whether either Saunders and or McCafferty would have predicted a rate hike at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting had they still been in their former roles as a market and industry economist respectively. This is to say that, with monetary \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hawks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd likely to remain in the minority, even in the face of a strong inflation overshoot, the importance of the wider vote split is in the market signalling, not in the probability of an actual rate hike near term. Just in: The Mansion House Dinner has been cancelled, due to the Grenfell Tower disaster. Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Economics argues that it would be a mistake to raise UK interest rates now. Via Barclays, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing which Bank of England policymakers are hawkish, dovish, or firmly on the fence. Barclays also predicts that interest rates will remain on hold until 2019. Minutes of the meeting mention higher-than-expected core inflation and investment intentions, in addition to firming global growth and extra imported inflation stemming from the depreciation in the currency. Those MPC members who voted for a hike emphasised tighter labour market conditions and risks of a more pronounced inflation overshoot. Despite the change in vote split, we remain of the view that no interest hike will be delivered in the course of the next two years. UK chancellor Philip Hammond will not give the traditional Mansion House speech tonight, following the awful Grenfell Tower disaster. Hammond had been planning to use the speech to warn against a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says the Bank appears to be running out of patience with inflation: Set against a backdrop of disappointing retail sales, slowing growth, shrinking real wages and heightened political uncertainty, it was somewhat surprising that three MPC members voted for higher rates at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy meeting. Economists had expected a 7-1 split, with the soon-to-depart Kristin Forbes the lone voice calling for higher rates. In fact she was joined by Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders in believing intensifying inflationary pressures justify an immediate 25 basis point increase. It seems the willingness of the MPC to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclook through\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 higher inflation and leave rates on hold is wearing thin, and if inflation continues to surprise we could see higher rates by the end of the summer. Almost every share on the FTSE 100 is down right now. The jump in the pound has sent the FTSE 100 into a spin. The blue-chip index has tumbled by 90 points, or 1.2%, to 7383. Retailers and housebuilders are among the top fallers, along with multinationals like miners (whose share price benefits from a weak pound). This is the first time since 2011 that three MPC members have voted to raise rates (six years ago, the hawks were Andrew Sentance, Martin Weale and Spencer Dale). That was a 6-3 vote. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the closest vote since 2007 - when the BoE was divided 5-4. Currently there are only eight MPC members, as deputy governor Charlotte Hogg hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been replaced yet. So is the Bank really close to raising rates? Probably not. For starters, this is Kristin Forbes final vote on the MPC, and her successor may take a different view of the situation. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also hard to imagine that Hogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacement would break ranks and oppose governor Mark Carney, who of course voted to leave rates on hold today. But few City experts predicted such a close vote today, so who knows..... The minutes of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting show how the Bank of England is split between policymakers who believe inflation should be reined in, and those who believe the economy is too weak to bear higher rates. Many policymakers fear that hiking rates could crush economic growth, and that it would be better to let inflation keep climbing. As the minutes put it: Attempting to offset fully the effect of weaker sterling on inflation would be achievable only at the cost of higher unemployment and, in all likelihood, even weaker income growth. But Kristin Forbes, Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty -- three independent members of the MPC -- believe that inflation needs to be tackled, as it heads towards 3%. This is the key section of the minutes, which shows how the three hawks and five doves tussled over what to to: Overall, the degree of spare capacity in the economy appeared limited but, at the same time, the inflation overshoot relative to the target could be more pronounced than previously thought. This lessened the trade-off that the MPC was required to balance and, all else equal, reduced the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tolerance of above-target inflation. The Committee discussed the appropriate response of monetary policy. Given this change in the trade-off, there were arguments in favour of a moderate tightening in monetary policy. Headline, core and some domestically focussed inflation measures had picked up further. Inflation was projected to overshoot the target by more than previously expected, and to remain above it throughout the three-year forecast period. Slack in the labour market appeared to have diminished, and demand for labour remained strong. Growth in business investment and net trade appeared on track to compensate for weaker consumption. The withdrawal of part of the stimulus that the Committee had injected in August last year would help to moderate the inflation overshoot while leaving monetary policy very supportive. But there were also arguments in favour of leaving the policy rate unchanged. A slowdown in household consumption, and GDP as a whole, had recently begun, and it was too early to judge with confidence how large and persistent it would prove to be. Although consumer confidence had held up, there had been further signs of a slowing housing market and new car registrations had fallen sharply. It was as yet unclear to what degree weaker consumption would be offset by other components of demand. A period of slower than expected growth could see a margin of slack re-opening. Wage growth had remained subdued, despite low unemployment. From the Bank of England, my colleague Katie Allen reports on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s split: The Bank of England edged closer to raising interest rates this month as a deeper split emerged among its committee of policymakers, with three of the eight voting for an immediate rate rise to keep inflation in check. The 5-3 split vote to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.25% will surprise financial markets. Most City economists had expected just one member, Kristin Forbes, would maintain her previous vote for rates to be raised to 0.5%. Instead she was joined by Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders. Their call for higher borrowing costs follows figures this week showing inflation had risen further above the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target. In May inflation hit 2.9% as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), well above the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.0% target. The May pick-up was driven in part by the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness since the Brexit vote, which has made imports to the UK more expensive. The other five members of the monetary policy committee, including Bank governor Mark Carney, felt interest rates should stay at their current low to help support growth at a time when Britons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 incomes are being squeezed by rising prices and meagre wage growth. The drop in living standards has hit consumer spending and knocked overall economic growth. Figures this week showed workers were suffering the biggest squeeze on their pay since 2014. Minutes from the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate-setting meeting released on Thursday cited a range of views on the committee. They noted inflation was now expected to overshoot the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target by more than previously expected. Supporting those voting for a rate rise, there were also signs that growth in business investment and net trade was on track to make up for weaker consumption. The minutes added that for some policymakers it was time to start scaling back the massive package of support launched in the wake of last summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum, that included a rate cut and more electronic money printing..... The pound has jumped by almost a cent to $1.278 as traders react to the shock news that three BoE policymakers want to raise interest rates. Here we go: The Bank of England has voted to leave interest rates unchanged at their current record low of 0.25%. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a split vote, with three policymakers voting to hike rates!! They were outvoted by five policymakers who wanted to leave interest rates unchanged. Kristen Forbes, Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders are the three hawkish members who wanted to raise rates to 0.5%. This is the first time since 2011 that three MPC members have voted to raise interest rates. The MPC also left its QE stimulus programme unchanged (which means it holds \u00c2\u00a3435bn of bonds). More to follow!! Retail analyst Steve Dresser sees a flock of Brexit chickens coming home to roost... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly time for the Bank of England to announce its decision on interest rates, and release the minutes of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee meeting. City experts are united in expecting no change on policy at noon today - but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be keen to read the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views on the economy, especially as inflation hit 2.9% this month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The political chaos in Westminster, uncertainty over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic outlook and ongoing Brexit concerns\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are all good reasons for the Bank to leave interest rates unchanged, says FXTM Research analyst Lukman Otunuga. With the central bank highly unlikely to make any changes to monetary policy amid the instability, investors will most likely direct their attention towards Mark Carney for insights on how he plans to tackle the various challenges that the UK political climate and Brexit developments have presented. While inflation in the UK has hit a four-year high at 2.9%, wage growth remains subdued and this creates further headaches for the BoE. Although raising interest rates to cool inflation is seen as a practical strategy, it may simply end up pressuring borrowers ultimately eroding business confidence and pinching consumers further. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the retail sales figures: Last summer, Britons defied expectations by spending more in the shops after the Brexit vote. That trend is over, says Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, who fears that UK growth is weakening as consumers are forced to cut back. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his comment on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales figures: This is further evidence that the surge in consumer spending, which sustained UK economic growth since the EU referendum, has come to an end. With prices rising more rapidly, shoppers find their money does not go so far and they are therefore reining in their spending. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We should expect this subdued growth of consumer spending to continue while inflation remains around 3 percent - and there is a risk it could go even higher. The result is likely to be relatively sluggish economic growth this year and next - with GDP rising by around 1.5% in 2017 and 2018, the weakest period of growth since the euro crisis in 2011 and 2012.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The weak retail sales figures have knocked the pound down by half a cent, to $1.2702. Jane Foley, top foreign exchange strategist at Rabobank, says sterling is suffering from a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153horrible dynamic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of political uncertainty and bad economic data. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speaking on Bloomberg TV now, saying: If you look at the economy, it is looking like it might weaken quite notably. This week we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen really high inflation [2.9%], weaker than expected earnings growth [1.7%], and to cap it all, very weak retail sales. The possibility of a softer Brexit is giving the pound some support, she adds, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not at all clear how those negotiations with the EU will pan out. This is turning into a bad morning for the UK retail sector.... The bad news for UK shoppers is that price are going to keep rising -- and their wages probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep pace. Ian Gilmartin, Head of Retail &amp; Wholesale at Barclays, says retailers may have to pass on rising impost costs to customers. Inflation is really starting to kick in, with prices in the sector increasing at the highest rate for more than five years and expected to rise further. Coupled with lower wage growth, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely that consumer spending power will continue to weaken and it appears that retailers are going to have to navigate some choppy waters in the coming months. There are no easy solutions. With persisting currency challenges and rising supply chain costs, many retailers simply have to pass on some of this to their customers through price increases. Striking the right balance on price point between what is viable from a cost perspective and what is acceptable to the consumer is now the crucial strategic decision for retail heads to consider.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, also blames rising inflation: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The writing has been on the wall for several months now, but May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Retail Sales figures confirm that consumer spending in the UK is finally slowing down. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no mystery whatsoever about what the cause is: inflation is biting into household budgets. With prices set to rise further, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely the slowdown seen in May will continue. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another retail sales chart, highlighting how UK consumers spend more in the shops in May but got rather less. The ONS says price hikes are hitting sales volumes. Increases in average store prices may explain this slowdown. Food stores saw the biggest increase in prices since November 2013 and non-food stores the biggest increase since October 2011.

Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: UK consumers will remain under the cosh for some time as inflation pushes higher, warns Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on the UK retail sales slowdown: May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales relapse points to increasingly squeezed consumers again reining in their spending after a temporary loosening of the purse strings in April Retail sales figures dilute hopes that consumer spending will make a significantly improved contribution to GDP growth in the second quarter after a sharp first-quarter slowdown With inflation poised to move above 3% imminently and earnings growth weak, there looks to be more pain to come for consumers. Economists and City traders are alarmed by the weak UK retail sales last month. Alan Clarke of Scotia Bank says we should focus on the 0.9% annual rise in sales volumes - the weakest rise in four years - rather than the 1.2% month-on-month slump. He writes: Since late-2016, the growth rate has slumped from over 6% y/y to below 1% y/y currently. That is exactly what should have happened given the unpleasant cocktail of: - slower employment growth; - slower wage inflation; and - much higher CPI inflation. There is plenty more where that came from. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets blames the surge in inflation, due to the slump in the pound since last June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. The retail sales data out of the UK was trashy and it shows how reluctant the consumers have become in terms of their spending. Consumer spending has been feeble and wage growth is lacklustre also as it was confirmed by the average earning index data yesterday. Investors have been feeling the pinch due to the higher inflation, the concussion of Brexit. Rupert Seggins points out that the retail sales figures have been choppy since last summer. Mizuho Bank are also concerned that Brexit is now hurting the UK economy: Breaking: Retail sales volumes across the UK plunged by 1.2% in May as inflation bites deeper into household budgets. This is a deeper fall than the 0.8% decline expected, and will fuel worries that the UK economy is faltering. It means that retail sales were only 0.9% higher than a year ago - the weakest rise since April 2013! The Office for National Statistic blames rising prices (inflation jumped to 2.9% in May). Ole Black, ONS Senior Statistician says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The year-on-year growth in the quantity bought for retail sales in May 2017 was at 0.9%. We have not seen lower growth on the year since April 2013. Increased retail prices across all sectors seem to be a significant factor in slowing growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Volumes of all item types fell in May, apart for petrol. If you strip out fuel sales, then retail sales fell by 1.6% in the month. This chart show the full impact of inflation -- Britons spent 4.1% more in the shops than last year, but only took 0.9% more stuff home with them. European stock markets have all lost ground this morning, as traders digest last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US interest rate hike. The French and Spanish markets are leading the way, down almost 1%. Investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprised that the Federal Reserve hiked borrowing costs - last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike was priced in. But they are a little disconcerted that Fed chair Janet Yellen sounder quite hawkish; sweeping aside concerns about low inflation, and predicting that the employment market would keep recovering. Clear Treasury say: The overriding theme we took from the meeting is that Yellen is planning to plough ahead with normalising Monetary policy despite recent inflation as she bets that the ongoing strength of the labour market will ultimately prevail. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx is also concerned by DFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning: DFS Furniture looked pretty damn tatty this Thursday, the stock plunging 22% to trade below \u00c2\u00a32 for the first time since the aftermath of last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit referendum. The retailer blamed the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcuncertain macroeconomic environment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, in part linked to the chaos of the UK general election, for the substantial drop in demand, going on to state that it believes the issues are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmarket-wide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It is going to be interesting in the coming weeks to see how much of an effect the current political landscape and, of course, rapidly shrinking wages, has had on the UK retail sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second quarter. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is down 0.6%, or 45 points, in early trading as shares in retailers fall. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the DFS tumble again: DFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning has sent shares in other retailers sliding too. That includes high street group Next (down 3.3%), DIY chain Kingfisher (down 2.5%) and joinery group Howdens (down 5%). They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d all be vulnerable if consumers really are cutting back on spending. [Next have also just been downgrade by Credit Suisse] Rival sofamaker SCS has slumped by 10%, as traders deduce that it could also be suffering. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says DFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes are a sign of larger problems in the economy. Undoubtedly the uncertainty around the general election and Brexit means people are delaying big ticket purchases. The relative resilience of the UK in the six months after the referendum, and comparative slowing thereafter, seems to be mirrored in the fortunes of DFS. Retail analyst Nick Bubb adds: We have been noting for a while now that the Electricals market has been quite weak and now the cloud over \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big ticket\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd retailers has increased, with DFS warning that they have seen \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant declines in store footfall leading to a material reduction in customer orders\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in recent months. Ouch! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest sofa chain has just hit the City with a profits warning, sending its shares tanking. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: DFS Furniture told shareholders that it had suffered a big drop in customer orders as the retail environment weakened more than it had expected. DFS said customers were holding off buying furniture generally because of the uncertainty caused by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election and the macroeconomic environment - hinting at last summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote. This means 2017 profits will miss City forecasts, DFS warned. It now estimates Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) at \u00c2\u00a382m-\u00c2\u00a387m, down from City forecasts of around \u00c2\u00a395m. Shares have plunged by over a fifth in early trading to a 11-month low, from 252p to 198p. Quite a reduction! Demand for big-ticket items such as sofas often fall when economic conditions worsen, so this could be another sign that consumers are reining in their spending - especially now that real wages are falling. Garry White of stockbrokers Charles Stanley isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t completely convinced by DFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excuses: Not sure what \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbullocks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 have to do with it. Maybe Garry is thinking of DFS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s range of leather sofas..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There lots to keep the City busy today, with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank and Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt talks jostling for attention. After the Federal Reserve raised interest rates last night, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turn to set monetary policy. The City expect that the Bank will vote 7-1 to leave interest rates unchanged,. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest view on the UK economy will be pored over \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially as last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election has plunged us into a deep political crisis. New retail sales figures are released this morning too, which are expected to show that consumers cut back last month. RBC Capital Markets say: Retail sales volumes in May are expected to reveal a decline versus April, where the outturn was particularly strong as a result of good weather during the month which contained Easter. The great and the good of the City will be ironing their best shirts tonight, for the annual Mansion House speech. Chancellor Philip Hammond is the star turn, and will use his speech to argue for a Brexit that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for business. In the eurozone, Greece will make one more push to persuade its creditors that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done enough to unlock fresh aid funds. Eurozone finance ministers will meet this afternoon, to discuss whether Greece has delivered on its austerity targets, and should receive its next loan. The situation is now getting quite tense; Athens faces debt repayments in July, and prime minister Alexis Tsipras is already talking about the need for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpolitical solution\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to be hammered out by eurozone leaders. Germany, though, wants to leave it in the finance ministers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 court. The real prize, of course, is debt reduction - but Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors are struggling to agree on what needs to be done to make its debts sustainable. So it could be another frustrating Eurogroup meeting. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9.30am BST: UK retail sales for May 10am BST: Eurozone trade figures for April 12pm BST: Bank of England decision on interest rates 12pm BST: Bank of England publishes minutes of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting 2pm BST: Eurogroup meeting begins in Luxembourg 9pm BST: Mansion House speeches",

                "bodyText":"That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it for today folks. Thank you for your comments and have a lovely weekend. AM My colleague Rob Davies reports that the material used in the cladding that covered the Grenfell Tower was the cheaper, more flammable version of the two available options. Omnis Exteriors manufactured the aluminium composite material (ACM) used in the cladding, a company director, John Cowley, confirmed to the Guardian. Read the full story here: New US homebuilding fell for a third month in May, to the lowest level in eight months. Housing starts fell 5.5% to an annual rate of 1.09 million units, the US Commerce Department said. It was the lowest level since September 2016, and reflected a broad slowdown in construction. It was weaker than expected, with economists polled by Reuters predicting 1.2 million starts. Over in Greece, prime minister Alexis Tsipras has called last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup decision a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153decisive step\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd towards ending the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eight-year-long economic crisis. Helena Smith reports from Athens: In upbeat mood, Alexis Tsipras described the decision to throw Greece a new credit line as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clear sign\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of confidence towards markets. Briefing head of state President Prokopis Pavlopoulos on the details, Tsipras said the agreement thrashed out between eurozone member states and the IMF in Luxembourg late Thursday, amounted to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a clear commitment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that Greece would emerge from international stewardship. A clear sign of confidence was given to markets and a clear commitment [was given] to the Greek people, who have suffered so much. [A clear commitment] that the programmes will end decisively with the end of the third [bailout] programme in a year from now. Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 own poll ratings and that of his two-party coalition have fallen precipitously as the government, under pressure from creditors, has time and again been forced to legislate highly unpopular pension cuts and tax increases. Now we must step up our efforts to create the conditions for a dynamic recovery which will be felt by citizens in their every day life with a view to \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 healing the wounds of the crisis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 term ends in 2019. In a bid to turn around flagging morale, the government is expected to launch an all-out drive to spin the results of last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal - even if it did not get the debt relief it had been hoping for. Time for a market update. European indices have held on to earlier gains, with the latest scores as follows: FTSE 100: +0.5% at 7,458 FTSE 250: +0.9% at 19,721 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.3% at 12,725 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.7% at 5,252 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.4% at 20,937 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.3% at 10,728 Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ATG: +1.6% at 812.5 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.6% at 388 The yen is at a two-week low against the dollar after the Bank of Japan kept interest rates on hold and said it was in no hurry to follow the US Fed and tighten monetary policy. The yen fell nearly 0.5% to 111.415 per dollar. Martin Arnold, currency strategist at ETF Securities, said: The theme continues to be the potential for further yen weakness because they are still grappling with the deflationary mindset of the Japanese consumer. I think safe haven trade is the only light at the end of the tunnel - there has to be some sort of significant [risk] event to light a spark under the yen. Foreign tourists came to Britain in bigger numbers in April, taking advantage of the weaker pound. There were 3.7 million visits during the month, up 19% compared with the same April 2016. They spent 20% more too, at \u00c2\u00a32bn according to the ONS figures. Numbers were partly boosted by the timing of Easter, which fell in April this year but March the year before. However, the number of Brits travelling abroad is far greater, at 6.1m visits in April, up 2% compared with a year earlier. UK residents spent \u00c2\u00a33.5bn, down 1%. Patricia Yates, director of Visit Britain (the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tourist authority) commented on the figures: Tourism is one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most valuable export industries and it is very encouraging to see this continued growth as we head into the peak summer season and beyond. We continue to drive home the message of value and welcome globally, particularly in our high spending markets China and the US and the valuable European market. The pound is roughly flat against the dollar, after receiving a boost on Thursday from the shock news that three Bank of England policymakers voted to raise interest rates at their June meeting. They were outvoted 5-3 but it signalled a deeper-than-expected split among the Monetary Policy Committee and edged the Bank closer to a rate hike. Sterling is up 0.1% at $1.2765, but down 0.1% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1423. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets: The GBP/USD has been trading within a tight range, the pound hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t made any more gains versus the US dollar in the wake of the surprisingly hawkish BoE vote yesterday, but neither has it given up much ground. Philip Hammond has been speaking to reporters in Luxembourg, where finance ministers are gathered for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ecofin meeting. He said Britain must prioritise jobs and future prosperity when Brexit negotiations kick-off next week. As we enter negotiations next week we will do so in a spirit of sincere co-operation taking a pragmatic approach to trying to find a solution that works both for the UK and for the European Union 27. My clear view, and I believe the view of the majority of people in Britain, is that we should prioritise protecting jobs, protecting economic growth, protecting prosperity as we enter those negotiations and take them forward. The poll below suggests other EU countries have no appetite to follow the UK out of the union: Former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is not the only one sceptical about the Greek deal struck in Luxembourg last night. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale also suggests it was an elaborate exercise in kicking the can down the road: The politics of debt relief are too toxic to cope with so [Eurogroup president] Jeroen Dijsselbloem called for the tee, put the debt can on top of it, lined it up and kicked it straight between the posts and down the road behind. Then he declared it a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmajor step forward\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that would help put the Greek economy on a sounder footing. Job done. I expect this to be greeted with muted applause by European bond investors, by which I mean peripheral debt should do fine and the currency won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headline rate of inflation in May has been confirmed at 1.4% by statistics office Eurostat, down from 1.9% in April. Petrol prices and hotel stays were more expensive than a year earlier, while phone costs and clothing prices fell. At 1.4%, eurozone is well below UK inflation of 2.9%. The sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote has pushed up the cost of goods imported from abroad and is feeding through to higher shop prices. Greece has long hoped that a deal with creditors will pave the way to inclusion in the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus programme, in turn enabling a return the capital markets. However, Athens will probably have to wait a while longer: A spokesman for the Greek government has commented this morning on the deal struck between Athens and its eurozone lenders. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup decision is a very positive decision which gives the Greek side what it wanted and the possibility to proceed with security until it completes the programme,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dimitiris Tzanakopoulos told the radio station Real FM. The agreement had laid out clear commitments regarding the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staggering debt pile and clear commitments regarding its growth, he said, commitments that would put it on the path to successfully exiting its third bailout programme in August 2018. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have before us a clear two-year period, in which we can change the image of Greece \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We have a concrete goal. This goal is to complete the programme, for Greece to stand on its own feet,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he continued, adding that the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overriding aim was to free the country from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153harsh oversight\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of international lenders keeping it afloat. Despite the air of triumphalism in Athens this morning, prime minister Alexis Tsipras leftist-led coalition has come under heavy fire for wasting precious time haggling with creditors to get to this point. In the uncertainty wrought by nine months of stalled negotiations, the real economy has suffered tremendously as investors have stayed away. Varoufakis has also updated his blog with an annotated version of last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup statement on Greece. Sceptical could probably sum up his view. For example, his response to the Eurogroup\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement that an end to the bailout programme in 2018 could pave the way for a Greek return to the capital markets, he writes: A little like promising pigs that they will be offered flying lessons! On Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to maintain a primary surplus of 3.5% until 2022, and about 2% from 2023 to 2060, he notes: Put a little more clearly: the Eurogroup remains committed to an insane level of austerity (for this is what 3.5% of GDP means) until 2022. After those further four years of mind and soul numbing recession, for those Greeks that remain in the country (and who have not migrated as a result of the utter misery the Eurogroup has spread all over the land), the austerity will be a little lessened until\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 2060. (We are really experiencing levels of cynicism that have never been observed in Europe, or indeed anywhere else, before!) Yanis Varoufakis, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former finance minister, has given his reaction to the news that Athens has secured another \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.5bn in emergency funds. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ATG index has opened up 1.2% at the highest level since mid-June 2015. Meanwhile the yield on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year government bonds has fallen to 5.78% - the lowest level in almost a month - in another sign that investors are breathing a huge sigh of relief at the long-awaited and much-needed bailout deal. Here is how events unfolded last night. Investors have a spring in their step this morning, boosted by the news that Greece clinched a bailout deal last night, averting a fresh crisis. Here are the scores so far in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main markets: FTSE 100: + at 0.3% at 7,445 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.4% at 12,739 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.8% at 5,259 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.5% at 20,959 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.2% at 10,722 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.5% at 388 The FTSE 250 - which includes companies focused more on the UK market than those in the FTSE 100 - is up 0.7% at 19,698 after the index suffered its biggest daily fall since last summer on Thursday. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest supermarket chain says it has protected customers from the full impact of inflation. Inflation is currently running at 2.9%, but Tesco has raised its food prices by just 1.4%. The sharp drop in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote a year ago has driven up the cost of goods and raw materials imported from abroad. Consumers are increasingly feeling the pinch as inflation is higher than wage growth, currently running at 1.7% according to the latest official stats. Tesco said that its decision to limit price rises was helping to drive sales, which rose 2.3% in the UK on a like-for-like basis in the first quarter, comfortably beating analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations for a 1.9% rise. It was Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best quarterly UK growth for seven years. Here is what Dave Lewis, Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, had to say: In tough market conditions, we have stayed true to our commitment to helping customers - working closely with our supplier partners to keep prices low. Customers have responded by doing more of their shopping with us and as a result we continue to grow volumes, particularly in fresh food. This is a good start to the year, with our sixth consecutive quarter of positive like-for-like sales growth across the group. We are confident in our plans to create long-term, sustainable value for our key stakeholders and to deliver on the ambitions we have set out. Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual meeting will be held at 2pm today at London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Excel centre. The FT is reporting that Google could be fined more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn as Brussels prepares to announce the first of its trio of antitrust decisions involving the global search engine giant. EU officials are expected to say in the coming weeks that Google exploited its dominant market position to promote its other services - such as shopping and travel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in a way that was detrimental to the its rivals, the FT said. Google and the European Commission declined to comment. Watch this space. Traders at spread-betting firm IG are expecting Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main markets to open higher this morning: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors will be relieved this morning as Greece finally managed to agree a deal with its eurozone creditors last night to unlock \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.5bn of urgently needed bailout funds. The deal was clinched at the Eurogroup meeting of finance minsters, which is followed today by Ecofin, attended by ministers from the wider EU. We will bring reaction to the Greek deal and any developments a Ecofin. Here is our full story on Greece: The economic data calendar is fairly thin, but with a couple of highlights: At 10am we get final eurozone inflation figures for May. Economists are expecting a headline annual rate of 1.4%. At 13.30 we get the latest snapshot of the US property market with housing starts figures for May.",

This came as a major surprise because Mr Haldane has long been a known dove. He is going head-to-head against the Governor Mark Carney, who is fast losing support on his dovish stance. He said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a partial withdrawal of the additional policy insurance the MPC put in place last year would be prudent relatively soon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Mr Haldane said that the risk was that the Bank tightened its belt too late rather than too early. This is something which the Bank of Canada is also worried about and what the US Federal Reserve had long been wary of, and the European Central Bank better be ready for. The latter came across pretty dovish at its last meeting. With the BoE turning hawkish and ECB remaining dovish, the EUR/GBP could come under pressure in the coming days and weeks.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also sent this image of the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac-\u00c2\u00a3 exchange rate, showing how the euro hit eight month highs against the euro recently, but couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t break through 88.8p.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0959512cd945be137bf4b7503d21a243ddaad9af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0959512cd945be137bf4b7503d21a243ddaad9af/0_0_1093_709/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The euro vs the pound\" width=\"1000\" height=\"649\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The euro vs the pound</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Forex.com</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-594a718ae4b0fb1893fa136c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-21T13:16:40.382Z\">2.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkishness has helped the pound to recovery almost all of the losses suffered yesterday, after BoE governor Mark Carney explained why interest rates ought to remain at record lows.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ramincharles/status/877513447851917318\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BOE?src=hash\">#BOE</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Carney?src=hash\">#Carney</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Haldane?src=hash\">#Haldane</a> whiplash reflected in sterling volatility: ruled out rate rise yday then justify hikes today <a href=\"https://t.co/NZZcT6hfLV\">https://t.co/NZZcT6hfLV</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/dG5dZqFmIP\">pic.twitter.com/dG5dZqFmIP</a></p>&mdash; Ramin Nakisa (@ramincharles) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ramincharles/status/877513447851917318\">June 21, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-594a6a97e4b0fb1893fa132e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-21T12:51:42.567Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Lena Komileva of G+ Economics reckons there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now a 50% chance of a UK interest rate rise this year.</strong></p> <p>She says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The growing split on the MPC signals a much higher risk of tightening this year than previously expected in the markets.</p> <p>With two new members joining the MPC in the second half of the year, an active policy debate on the merits of tightening, against the optics of a strong inflation overshoot, overheating consumer credit growth, and a tight labour market, may well tilt the vote in favour of a rate hike by the year-end.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-594a5c87e4b043e55e143d1d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-21T12:37:22.674Z\">1.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Haldane effect has pushed the pound back over $1.27, a whole cent higher than this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-594a5bfce4b043e55e143d1a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-21T12:04:52.735Z\">1.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Following Andy Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech, there are now at least four Bank of England policymakers who are likely to vote for rate rises this year.</strong></p> <p>However... one of them, Kristin Forbes, leaves on 30 June.</p> <p>That leaves Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders, who both voted to raise interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% at this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKuKuK8c7UAhUJDMAKHQrcDp8QqUMIKDAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fbusiness%2Flive%2F2017%2Fjun%2F19%2Feuropean-markets-rise-ftse-euro-macron-majority-brexit-talks-business-live&amp;usg=AFQjCNEh4xXwl1LweGTb27DRucWSLmKyPQ&amp;sig2=D6pmTG-N-fkYLCoJXTLzmA\">Forbes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacement, Silvana Tenreyro,</a> may not be as hawkish (but who knows?).</p> <p>So the monetary policy committee could be split 6-3*, unless other members are thinking along the same lines as Haldane.

It would even be a sign of confidence in the UK recovery.</p> <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key section from Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Having weighed the evidence, I think that the balance of risks associated with tightening \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too early\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, on the one hand, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too late\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, on the other, has swung materially towards the latter in the past six to nine months. The risks of tightening \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too early\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have shrunk as growth and, to lesser extent, inflation have shown greater resilience than expected. And if policy tightened \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too late\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, this could result in a much steeper path of rate rises later on, contrary to the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collective expectation that Bank Rate would increase \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcat a gradual pace and to a limited extent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.</p> <p>As the balance point between these risks has shifted over the past 9 months, that has left me judging that a partial withdrawal of the additional policy insurance the MPC put in place last year would be prudent relatively soon, provided the data come in broadly as expected in the period ahead. </p> <p>Certainly, I think such a tightening is likely to be needed well ahead of current market expectations.</p> <p>How soon is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153relatively soon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? I considered the case for a rate rise at the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s June meeting. I felt then there were strong grounds for holding back until later in the year, for two reasons. First, despite upwards pressure on inflation, there are still few signs of higher wage growth. And despite robust surveys, there is still some chance of a sharper than expected slowing in the economy. Both are reasons for monetary policy not to rush its fences. Nor does it need to do so, given the slow build of nominal pressures in the economy.</p> <p>Second, there is the election. This has thrown up a dust-cloud of uncertainty. Financial markets-wise, that is manifesting itself in a weaker exchange rate. It is unclear what twists and turns lie ahead, with potentially important implications for asset prices and, at least potentially, confidence among businesses and consumers. I do not think adding a twist or a turn from monetary policy would, in this environment, be especially helpful in building confidence, at least until the dust-cloud has started to settle.</p> <p>Provided the data are still on track, I do think that beginning the process of withdrawing some of the incremental stimulus provided last August would be prudent moving into the second half of the year.</p> </blockquote> <p>That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important intervention. Last week, three MPC policymakers (but not Haldane) voted for a rate hike. But just yesterday, governor Mark Carney argued forcefully that it is too early....</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-06-21T11:34:04.718Z\">at 12.34pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-594a457ee4b01a490fd244e7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-21T10:47:55.176Z\">11.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back in the markets, shares in doorstep lender Provident Financial have slumped by 16% this morning after a shock profits warning.</strong></p> <p>The FTSE 100-listed lender admitted last night that its recent reorganisation - which eliminated around 2,000 - had caused more disruption than expected.</p> <p>Provident appears to have botched its attempts to persuade self-employed debt collectors to become full-time staff instead.</p> <p>CEO Peter Crook told analysts today that too few workers made the switch.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it right.

                "bodyText":"And finally....the latest US oil inventory figures are just out, showing that US crude and gasoline inventories fell last week. The US Energy Information Administration reports that US oil stocks shrank by 2.5 million barrels, more than the 1.01 million which the markets had expected. In another surprise, gasoline inventories fell 578,000 barrels - compared to expectations of a 345,000 rise in gasoline stocks. This has help to push the oil price up a little, away from this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seven-month lows. Brent crude is now up 0.25% today at $46.13. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The US housing market has strengthened unexpectedly last month, according to new figures. Sales of US homes, excluding new builds, rose by 1.1% in May to an annual rate of 5.62 million sales. Average house prices also jumped during the month to record levels, suggesting demand was stronger too. This has pushed up the US dollar, pulling the pound back down below $1.27. Supermarket giant Tesco are back in the news again today, for the wrong reasons. Tesco Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online banking service has suffered a glitch today, that has left some customer unable to access their accounts. Yesterday, Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online shopping scheme hit a pothole, leaving scores of customers without their deliveries. And in another blow today, Tesco has proposed closing its customer service centre in Cardif, putting 1,100 jobs at risk. It is planning to consolidate its two customer engagement centres into a single expanded operation in Dundee, Scotland, and creating 250 new jobs there. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says Andy Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech has been the main event of the morning. Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns about not waiting too long to normalise policy could help the pound strengthen against the euro in the next few weeks, he says - just in time for the summer holiday season! Razaqzada says: Forget the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Speech, it was all about Andy Haldane this morning. The pound jumped and the FTSE dropped after the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist and Monetary Policy Committee member said he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ready to vote for an increase in interest rates \u00e2\u20ac\u0153relatively soon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This came as a major surprise because Mr Haldane has long been a known dove. He is going head-to-head against the Governor Mark Carney, who is fast losing support on his dovish stance. He said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a partial withdrawal of the additional policy insurance the MPC put in place last year would be prudent relatively soon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mr Haldane said that the risk was that the Bank tightened its belt too late rather than too early. This is something which the Bank of Canada is also worried about and what the US Federal Reserve had long been wary of, and the European Central Bank better be ready for. The latter came across pretty dovish at its last meeting. With the BoE turning hawkish and ECB remaining dovish, the EUR/GBP could come under pressure in the coming days and weeks. He also sent this image of the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac-\u00c2\u00a3 exchange rate, showing how the euro hit eight month highs against the euro recently, but couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t break through 88.8p. Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkishness has helped the pound to recovery almost all of the losses suffered yesterday, after BoE governor Mark Carney explained why interest rates ought to remain at record lows. Lena Komileva of G+ Economics reckons there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now a 50% chance of a UK interest rate rise this year. She says: The growing split on the MPC signals a much higher risk of tightening this year than previously expected in the markets. With two new members joining the MPC in the second half of the year, an active policy debate on the merits of tightening, against the optics of a strong inflation overshoot, overheating consumer credit growth, and a tight labour market, may well tilt the vote in favour of a rate hike by the year-end. The Haldane effect has pushed the pound back over $1.27, a whole cent higher than this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows. Following Andy Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech, there are now at least four Bank of England policymakers who are likely to vote for rate rises this year. However... one of them, Kristin Forbes, leaves on 30 June. That leaves Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders, who both voted to raise interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% at this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Forbes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacement, Silvana Tenreyro, may not be as hawkish (but who knows?). So the monetary policy committee could be split 6-3*, unless other members are thinking along the same lines as Haldane. The next MPC meeting is in early August. * - Or 5-3, until the vacancy for a deputy governor is filled. Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group thinks Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s change of mind is an important sign.. Andy Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hint that UK interest rates may rise this year is particularly interesting as he had been seen as the most dovish policymaker at the Bank of England. With one speech, Haldane has shed his dovish feathers in favour of a hawkish summer plumage. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says there is a big split at the Bank of England. Ben Chu of the Independent flags up that Haldane has sounded hawkish before, only to flip when the facts changed... Rupert Harrison of asset management firm BlackRock (and a former top Treasury official) suggests that Haldane may be trying to annoy his boss. Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Economics wonders if the Bank of England is trying to push the pound up, in an attempt to keep inflation down (something usually associated with emerging markets). Jeremy Cook of World First suggests that Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments caused some ructions on FX trading desks in the City: Newsflash: The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist has declared that UK interest rates may have to rise later this year. Speaking in Yorkshire, Andy Haldane argued that the recent spike in inflation, to 2.9%, means the risks of waiting too long to tighten monetary policy have increased. As such, he says, rates may need to rise \u00e2\u20ac\u0153well ahead\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of City expectations. It may make sense, Haldane adds, to start withdrawing some of last summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus (injected after the Brexit vote) later this year. It would even be a sign of confidence in the UK recovery. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key section from Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech: Having weighed the evidence, I think that the balance of risks associated with tightening \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too early\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, on the one hand, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too late\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, on the other, has swung materially towards the latter in the past six to nine months. The risks of tightening \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too early\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have shrunk as growth and, to lesser extent, inflation have shown greater resilience than expected. And if policy tightened \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too late\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, this could result in a much steeper path of rate rises later on, contrary to the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collective expectation that Bank Rate would increase \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcat a gradual pace and to a limited extent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. As the balance point between these risks has shifted over the past 9 months, that has left me judging that a partial withdrawal of the additional policy insurance the MPC put in place last year would be prudent relatively soon, provided the data come in broadly as expected in the period ahead. Certainly, I think such a tightening is likely to be needed well ahead of current market expectations. How soon is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153relatively soon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? I considered the case for a rate rise at the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s June meeting. I felt then there were strong grounds for holding back until later in the year, for two reasons. First, despite upwards pressure on inflation, there are still few signs of higher wage growth. And despite robust surveys, there is still some chance of a sharper than expected slowing in the economy. Both are reasons for monetary policy not to rush its fences. Nor does it need to do so, given the slow build of nominal pressures in the economy. Second, there is the election. This has thrown up a dust-cloud of uncertainty. Financial markets-wise, that is manifesting itself in a weaker exchange rate. It is unclear what twists and turns lie ahead, with potentially important implications for asset prices and, at least potentially, confidence among businesses and consumers. I do not think adding a twist or a turn from monetary policy would, in this environment, be especially helpful in building confidence, at least until the dust-cloud has started to settle. Provided the data are still on track, I do think that beginning the process of withdrawing some of the incremental stimulus provided last August would be prudent moving into the second half of the year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important intervention. Last week, three MPC policymakers (but not Haldane) voted for a rate hike. But just yesterday, governor Mark Carney argued forcefully that it is too early.... Back in the markets, shares in doorstep lender Provident Financial have slumped by 16% this morning after a shock profits warning. The FTSE 100-listed lender admitted last night that its recent reorganisation - which eliminated around 2,000 - had caused more disruption than expected. Provident appears to have botched its attempts to persuade self-employed debt collectors to become full-time staff instead. CEO Peter Crook told analysts today that too few workers made the switch. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it right. The incentives we had in place and the other management actions and communications that were there, were not sufficient to retain the number of agents that we anticipated.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound has recovered its early losses following this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finance figures. Sterling is back at $1.263, as traders watch for any surprises in the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Speech, which begins shortly. Our Politics Liveblog will have all the details: John Hawksworth, PwC chief economist, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finance figures are a boost to Philip Hammond, at a crucial time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finance data brought some good news for the Chancellor as estimated borrowing was revised down by around \u00c2\u00a32 billion in the last financial year and a further \u00c2\u00a31 billion in April. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Taking April and May together, the deficit of around \u00c2\u00a316 billion was very similar to the same two months last year, whereas the OBR had forecast that borrowing would rise this financial year as one-off favourable factors unwound. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of course, it is very early days in this financial year, but the Chancellor will take some cheer from these figures. However, Hawksworth is also concerned that the UK economic picture is darkening: The economy is slowing and considerable uncertainties remain around the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. At the same time, political pressures for higher spending on health, social care, education, policing, social housing and public pay more generally have increased. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Chancellor therefore still faces some tough challenges ahead if he is to meet his target of a balanced budget by 2025. But his interim target of getting the structural budget deficit below 2% of GDP by 2020/21 looks much easier to achieve and gives him some room for manoeuvre on tax and spending over the next few years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The \u00c2\u00a3300m drop in the deficit in May shows that the UK public finances started the year on a solid footing, says Capital Economics. However, they also expect total borrowing to rise during this financial year. Their UK economist, Scott Bowman, says: The strong revenue growth partly reflected a 4.3% rise in VAT receipts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perhaps a sign that consumer spending growth hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t slowed too sharply recently. That said, we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read too much into the borrowing figures for the first few months of the fiscal year as they are based on a significant amount of forecast data. Accordingly, we still think that borrowing for the fiscal year as a whole will increase by several billion pounds (the OBR expects a \u00c2\u00a37bn rise) as a number of one-off factors that lowered borrowing in 2016-17 unwind. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance ministry has welcomed the drop in borrowing last month, but admitted that the task of repairing the public finances isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complete. A Treasury spokesperson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe have reduced the deficit by three-quarters since 2010 but there is still further to go. We are committed to bringing the public finances back to balance by the middle of next decade, building a stronger economy that can deliver higher living standards for people across the country.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Fact check: That \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthree-quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 claim refers to borrowing as a share of the national economy. The deficit was 9.9% of GDP in 2010, and fell to 2.6% of GDP in 2016. Yesterday, chancellor Philip Hammond said the government aims to eliminate the deficit by the middle of the next decade. A far cry from George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal of balancing the books by 2015..... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to the news that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit fell to \u00c2\u00a36.7bn last month: Economist Rupert Seggins points out that UK public sector borrowing has dropped, a little, so far this financial year: KPMG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Yael Selfin, fears that the public finances may deteriorate in the months ahead: Howard Archer of EY Item Club believes VAT receipts rose in May thanks to a pickup in retail sales in April: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finance report also shows that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total national debt is now \u00c2\u00a31.737 trillion -- or 86.5% of annual GDP. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit fell by \u00c2\u00a3300m in May, giving a glimmer of hope to the UK government as it wrestles with Brexit. New figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the UK borrowed \u00c2\u00a36.7bn to balance the books last month. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from \u00c2\u00a37bn in May 2016, and rather less than April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a39.4bn deficit. The public finances were boosted by an increase in the tax takes. VAT receipts rose by 4.3% to \u00c2\u00a311.2bn in May, which looks to be the highest for any May on record. The figures show that Britain has borrowed \u00c2\u00a3100m less since the start of this financial year than in 2016-2017. OK, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only two months in, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a disastrous start... I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull together some reaction now... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been an exciting day on the Chinese stock market. The CSI 300 index, which contains the biggest companies traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen, jumped 1.2% to its highest closing level since the end of 2015. Traders rushed to buy shares after US stock index provider MSCI announced it would add some China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mainland domestic shares to its emerging markets index. That move will have been warmly welcomed in Beijing as it attempts to open up its financial markets and attract foreign capital. Jamie McGeever of Reuters shows how the pound has fallen back to two-month lows since the general election delivered a hung parliament. Breaking! The pound has slipped to a fresh two-month low against the US dollar. Sterling has just fallen below $1.26 for the first time since mid-April, when Theresa May took the fateful decision to call a general election. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lost a third of a cent today to $1.2593. Yesterday, the pound weakened after Bank of England governor Mark Carney said it was too early to raise interest rates. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff may be due to political instability in Westminster, and tensions between the Conservative party and the DUP over a possible deal. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Sterling also had a miserable open this Wednesday, the pound falling 0.3% against the dollar and 0.2% against the euro. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because, despite the state opening of parliament being just a few hours away, Theresa May is yet to fully secure the support of the DUP, the Irish party unhappy with what they see as a lack of respect from certain sections of the Conservatives. Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly publicised production cuts have actually turned into a win for US oil producers. American shale oil firms have raised their own output as the oil price recovered earlier this year, undermining efforts to cut the global glut of oil (leading to this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price falls). The Wall Street Journal explains: U.S. producers ramped up production when the world was already swimming in oil as OPEC members, Russia and other producing nations curtailed output. U.S. oil production is up 7.3% to 9.3 million barrels a day since OPEC announced plans in November to cut output, and the number of active rigs in the U.S. is at a two-year high. The cartel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output cut \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has been deemed an OPEC failure and a U.S. production win,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Tony Headrick, energy analyst at CHS Hedging. Oil prices are coming under more pressure this morning, knocking 1% off the price of Brent crude and Nymex. European stock markets are falling in early trading, as oil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop worries investors. The FTSE 100 has shed 22 points, or 0.3%. BP and Royal Dutch Shell are among the big fallers, down over 1% each. Big news from America: Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick has resigned after a series of scandals at the ride-hailing business he co-founded in 2009. Kalanick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure comes a week after he announced he would take an indefinite leave of absence as the embattled company released a damning report on its workplace culture. According to the New York Times, five of Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major investors demanded that the chief executive resign immediately, following revelations about its workplace culture and reports of harassment and discrimination. In a statement, Kalanick said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I love Uber more than anything in the world and at this difficult moment in my personal life I have accepted the investors request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Nordic bank Danske say that oil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide into a bear market is worrying investors worldwide: FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga predicts that prices will keep falling: Oil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing oversupply woes reached an ear-piercing crescendo during Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading session as WTI Crude plunged into a bear market after growing signs of rising production across the globe. WTI Crude was already extremely sensitive and vulnerable to losses amid the bearish sentiment with reports of an unexpected supply increase by Libya sending prices below $43. Although OPEC initially displayed good intentions when it exempted some members from the production cuts, this has come back to haunt them with more production from Libya, Nigeria, and Iran. With the bias towards oil heavily tilted to the downside, further losses should be expected as bears exploit persistent oversupply concerns to ruthlessly attack the commodity. This is from Jonny Bo Jakobsen of Nordea Markets: Michael Hewson of CMC Markets also expects oil to keep sliding this summer: The risk is we could see further declines, particularly if shale producers continue to add rigs, and demand continues to slow in Asia, and there are no further supply disruptions. The key support levels sit down at the November lows at $43 on Brent and $42 on US WTI, which if they give way $40 could come into view very quickly indeed and drag equity markets down with them, especially if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weekly inventory data disappoints. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Traders are edgy this morning after the oil prices tumbled to seven-month lows. The cost of a barrel of Brent crude has slumped below $46 per barrel for the first time since November 2016, dragged down by signs that the market is oversupplied. US crude prices also took a bath, falling 20% from their recent highs to around $43.50 per barrel. That put oil into a bear market for the first time since August, on signs that the global supply glut of oil isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going away. These moves show that the oil market is losing faith in the Opec cartel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to prop up prices, despite producers recently agreeing to extend production curbs until March 2018. Amanda Cooper, Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 oil expert, tweets that bearish oil traders have the upper hand. The selloff was partly triggered by signs that Libya has tripled its production levels in the last year. Libya is an Opec member, but exempt from its production cuts deal, as Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: As for the black gold, investors are becoming a little anxious towards the rising production out of Libya, however, OPEC has stated it before that the production level out of Libya is already taken into account in the part of their production cut strategy. Saudi Arabia also reported higher export data on Tuesday. It is important that not only production cuts are under control but also the export numbers as well. New oil inventory figures are released by the US government later today, which could move the markets again.... Also coming up today. Never exactly a shrinking violet, the UK economy will gambol back into the spotlight this morning when public finance figures for May are released. The City predict that public sector net borrowing fell to around \u00c2\u00a37bn, from over \u00c2\u00a39bn in April a year ago , as the long drudge of deficit reduction continues. Over in parliament, the Queen will outline the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legislative programme - even though prime minister Theresa May hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agreed a deal with the DUP to prop up her government. The Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech is likely to be dominated by Brexit, as the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Norman Smith explains... The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Andy Haldane, is visiting Yorkshire and the Humber. Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speeches are always good value (remember the one about the dog chasing the frisbee?), so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be scrutinising this one closely. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK public finances for May released 11.30am BST: Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Speech 12pm BST: Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Andy Haldane speaks in Yorkshire 3pm BST: US home sales 3.30pm BST: US crude oil inventory figures",

                "bodyText":"And finally (probably), European stock markets have ended the day in the red. In London the FTSE100 lost 12 points to 7434, despite mining shares rallying, and there were deeper losses in Europe. Currency moves are to blame; the euro strengthened after ECB president Mario Draghi spoke about reflation returning to the Eurozone as its recovery picked up. The pound gained against the US dollar after the IMF cut its growth forecasts. Political developments in Scotland also nudged sterling up, as Josh Mahony of IG explains: News that the SNP have formally abandoned their plan for a second referendum before the completion of Brexit has helped the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ascent, with GBPUSD hitting the highest level in a week. The IMF cut their outlook for the US economy today, which when considering the negative path of core PCE inflation, makes a September rate hike increasingly unlikely. Newsflash: American consumer morale has jumped this month, despite the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns about the US economy. The Conference Board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer confidence index rose in June to 118.9, defying expectations that it would fall to 116.0 this month. Optimism is close to a 16-year high, says Lynn Franco of the The Conference Board: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Expectations for the short-term have eased somewhat, but are still upbeat. Overall, consumers anticipate the economy will continue expanding in the months ahead, but they do not foresee the pace of growth accelerating.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Howard Archer, Chief Economic Advisor to the EY ITEM Club, is struck by the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to bring forwards its consumer credit stress tests by a couple of months: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The risk to financial stability coming from the recent rapid growth in consumer credit would undoubtedly be magnified if there is a near-term interest rate hike. While any interest rate hike would be small with further increases some way off, even small increases could cause problems for some consumers given their high borrowing levels. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is notable that the Bank of England is bringing forward its testing of banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to cope with major losses on consumer loans to September from November. Additionally, regulators will in July publish their expectations for lenders in the consumer credit market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wall Street has opened lower, with the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgraded growth forecasts dampening the mood in New York. The main indices are all in the red, with shares in Alphabet (Google) shedding more than 1.2% after it was slapped with a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.4bn fine by Brussels today. The news that the IMF has downgraded its US growth forecasts and criticised Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget plans, has sent a ripple through the financial markets. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some snap reaction: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more reaction to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report, from Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank of England is right to flag our debt binge as a big concern. Rock bottom interest rates have made borrowing cheap and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve definitely been making the most of it. The harsh reality is many households would struggle to pay back what they owe if interest rates went up. Many are just about managing now and have little in savings to fall back on. Banks need to be prepared for this worst case scenario so they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on shaky ground if rates go up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has cut its US growth forecasts, and concluded that Donald Trump won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t boost economic activity after all. The IMF now expects US GDP to rise by 2.1% in 2017, down from 2.3% back in April. For 2018, it also sees growth of 2.1%, down from 2.5% three months ago. The IMF had hoped that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to boost fiscal spending, and cut taxes, would deliver a economic boost. But having seen the president in action, the Fund has had a rethink. Importantly, it criticises Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent budget proposals, warning that they benefit the richest Americans more than the rest. Reuters explains: The IMF said the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest budget plans would place a disproportionate share of spending cuts onto low-and middle-income households, adding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this would appear counter to the budget\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goals of promoting safety and prosperity for all Americans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Instead, the Fund suggested a tax policy that would improve the federal revenue-to-GDP ratio, more balanced cuts that strengthen the social safety net\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efficiency, and efforts to contain healthcare cost inflation. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been an eventful couple of days in Greece, where prime minister Alexis Tsipras has held emergency talks with striking municipal rubbish collectors over demands for expiring short-term contracts to be replaced with permanent jobs. With the sweltering heat fuelling mounting concerns that mounds of uncollected rubbish could soon become a public health risk, Tsipras invited unionists representing the workers to his office for talks last night. In a statement his office said the invitation was addressed to unionists \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to find a solution to the claims of the refuge workers and to avoid the dangers to public heath\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd posed by the prolonged strike\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and very high temperatures that are expected in the coming days.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Earlier today, scuffles broke out between unionists and security guards outside the building housing the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarters when attempts were made to unfold banners emblazoned with slogans and demands. The meeting is being described as critical by insiders who say given the heat wave now gripping Greece - and the arrival of hundreds of thousands of tourists in the capital alone - the strike has become a major political issue. How Tsipras will be able to negotiate his way out of the crisis - and keep labour reform demanding international creditors on board - is anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guess. Alex Buttle, director of car buying website Motorway.co.uk, argues that Mark Carney is right to worry about the boom in car loans. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The growth of Personal Contract Plans over the past few years has been astronomical, and the level of consumer debt this is causing is getting out of hand. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite the many hidden costs, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to resist the temptation of owning a new luxury car without having to find tens of thousands of pounds upfront to pay for it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The problem is that household finances are starting to get stretched and many people are probably living beyond their means because of readily available credit, including car loans. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If people really do start to struggle financially, then the priority will be keeping a roof over their heads, and they are far more likely to default on a car loan than a mortgage. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We could well see a spike in people defaulting on their car loans in favour of losing their home if the economic climate takes a turn for the worst.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound has inched higher against the US dollar through the day, and is currently 0.3% higher at $1.2764. However, it is still down 0.5% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1314, after ECB chief Mario Draghi gave an optimistic view of the eurozone economy. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153barrage of information\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability review didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually move the markets that much. He says: The FTSE maintained its 15 point drop, the gains in the commodity and banking sectors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the former benefiting from a Brent Crude bounce, the latter from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian bank bailout \u00e2\u20ac\u201c failing to counteract the effects of the drop in consumer confidence revealed by YouGov. As for the pound, while it suffered some serious losses against the euro, it still managed to climb 0.2% against the dollar. That wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the most illuminating press conference with Mark Carney, but here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we learned. The Bank of England is pushing the UK financial sector to prepare for a downturn, by making them hold an extra \u00c2\u00a311bn of capital. But.... Carney says this won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a problem, as banks already hold more capital than required, since the rule were relaxed after the Brexit vote. As Carney puts it: We want to move the levels of capital back up to the level they should be -- any time you move into more benign credit conditions there have been fewer defaults. The BoE is concerned that some lenders are becoming too reckless, saying that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumer credit has increased rapidly. Lending conditions in the mortgage market are becoming easier. Lenders may be placing undue weight on the recent performance of loans in benign conditions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key target appears to be complacency, as it scrambles to bring its consumer credit stress tests forward by three months to September. It is particularly interested in the car market, following the boom in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Personal Contract Purchase\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd deals. These allow customers to pay a monthly fee for a new car, and then either pay a hefty \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcballoon payment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to actually own it, or switch to a new deal with a new vehicle. The fear is that customers could be left high and dry if financial conditions tighten. However (and this is where the confusion starts) the Bank doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want consumers to cut up their credit cards and stop trying to shimmy up the housing ladder. Instead, it wants them to be sensible when borrowing, and trust that the Bank is keeping the financial system strong. Those families who are most over-extended, and wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cope with higher borrowing costs, are a concern, though: On Brexit, Carney repeatedly said the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contingency planning is focusing on the most disruptive scenario, in which Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean the BoE expects such a cliff-edge exit..... If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jill Treanor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story about the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report: Final question: Q: You say you expect to raise the counter-cyclical buffer to 1% in November, but could Brexit force a cut back from 0.5% to 0% (reversing today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move) Mark Carney says the BoE thinks the buffer should be around 1% in stable times. The BoE had started the process of raising the buffer last year, before the Brexit vote, which led it to be cut back to 0% to take worries about lending \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoff the table\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. So.... we could have decided to hike the buffer to 1% today, but it was more sensible to allow a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgradual build\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (to 0.5% today, and 1% in November) On Brexit, we want the system to be as resilient as possible to prepare for any outcome in 640 days time, he concludes. I think that means the BoE want the banking sector to be well capitalised, in case of any Brexit shock in March 2019, when Britain leaves the EU. Q: You say that West End asset prices are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunsustainable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122; when might they return to reality, and what impact would that happen? Carney reiterates his earlier point that Britain currently have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Very low risk-free rates, and high valuation levels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So either those rates should rise, or asset prices should fall. It would be foolish to put a timescale on it - prices can stay unsustainable for a long time, and then correct quickly, he warns. Q: The report talks about the need for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconsistent implementation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of international standards; are you particularly worried about the Trump administration? Carney says it is important to have open global standards, and even more important that they are implemented, to avoid another financial crisis. You also need supervisory co-operation between regulators...and we want to reinforce that where possible. On the US, we have had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very productive discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with regulators about it. Carney explains how many countries have some unique rules (such as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Volcker rule, or bank ring-fencing in the UK), which they can change without affecting other nations. But there needs to be more co-ordination when it comes to global standards, if there are areas of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinconsistency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that need to be addressed. [Explainer: Donald Trump has vowed to cut regulations in the financial sector, such as the Volcker rule which is meant to prevent banks taking dangerous trading risks. Trump is also keen to repeal Dodd-Frank, which was brought in after the financial crisis. ] Q: You point out that commercial real estate assets are overvalued, and could unwind if people try to sell them in a rush. That happened after the Brexit vote - has anything changed since? [explainer: several property funds froze redemptions after the EU referendum, to stop investors cashing out, exposing the dangers of investing in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcilliquid assets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 such as shopping centres] Carney says there is a disconnect between the market expectations for future growth, and the value of commercial buildings. So either those expectations will rise, or commercial asset values will fall. Q: Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the boom in consumer credit due to you keeping interest rates so low? Carney insists he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not to blame, and points to the broader context of a UK economy that has grown solidly over the last 12 months (despite slowing in the first quarter of 2017). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing how consumer debt has grown: Carney says the boom in car loans is a major factor behind the pick-up in consumer debt recently, but he remains \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sanguine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the banking sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall exposure to it. Q: Your charts show that consumer finance has been growing faster than household income since 2014, so shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you have issued today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning sooner? Deputy governor Sir John Cunliffe says consumer borrowing actually picked up in 2013, but overall household lending actually grew slower than the UK economy. Consumer borrowing is \u00c2\u00a3200bn, compared to \u00c2\u00a31.4 trillion in mortgage lending, he explains - so the BoE has to decide when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a serious worry. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been watching consumer credit for a while, and now is the time to look at whether underwriting standards are starting to slip, and bring forwards our stress test (by three months, to September) Q: Are banks misbehaving and gaming the system, and is there a cultural problem? They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not gaming the system, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not learning the lessons of the past, Carney says. Q: Which consumer borrowing are you most worried about? Carney cites the sharp build up in car financing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both in volume, and the move towards \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpersonal contract purchasing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 deals (where buyers pay monthly repayments, and then face a large balloon payment to actually own their car) Q: How confident are you that banks can raise the extra capital you are demanding? They all have this capital on their books at present, Carney replies. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a question of reallocating capital from other areas (and perhaps choosing to raise more capital) The extra capital buffer will mean UK banks must meet a 4% leverage ratio, Carney explains, but the current leverage ratio is actually 5.25%. In other words, Banks shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t face a massive challenge meeting the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demands. Q: Has the general election changed your view of how the Brexit talks will evolve, and raised the risks from political instability? The short answer is no, governor Carney replies. Our job is to work out what might go wrong and prepare for it, rather than assessing quite how likely various scenarios are. So June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contingency planning for Brexit. Q: How worried are you about the British banking sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exposure to China? Risks from China are at the top end of global risks, Carney replies. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to the build-up of debt, structural issues in the financial system, and the challenge of growing the economy while also maintaining stability. Q: What role are interest rates playing in exaggerating or reining in financial stability risks? Monetary policy is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclast line of defence\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, says Carney, and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need monetary policy to do our job of ensuring financial stability, Carney continues. If the Financial Policy Committee does its job properly, then the MPC can focus on its job of getting inflation back to target. Q: And what would you say to those who think that being responsible for financial stability is distracting you from the job of setting interest rates and controlling inflation? Carney (who chairs both the FPC and the Monetary Policy Committee which sets borrowing costs) denies that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got too much on his plate. It takes as long to decide to raise rates as to cut then as to leave them on hold, he replies. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been doing this job for many years at two central banks (the BoE and the Bank of Canada). And he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not biting.... Q: You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re telling banks that times are changing, and they should set aside more capital, but shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t consumers also recognise that times are changing and rein in our borrowings? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to give individual financial advice, says Mark Carney (you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on your own, folks, sorry). He then explains that the Bank is trying to strengthen the resilience of the core of the system, in case a crisis strike. The message for the public is that if things become bumpy, in the Brexit transition or because of problems in the global economy, then the financial system will be there for them, says the governor, adding: Individuals must take the judgement whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the right time to buy a property, or invest in a business, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to ensure that the financial system is there to help them with that. Q: You seem to be blaming lenders, rather than consumers, for the rise in consumer credit - but shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t people be more cautious about how much debt they take on? Carney says that UK households have deleveraged a lot since the financial crisis, and only releveraged recently. He wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that households as a whole are taking elevated risks. The first line of defence is that lenders themselves are responsible; the second line of defence is banks set aside enough capital incase of a downturn. Q: How concerned are you that UK consumers are borrowing too much, and will find themselves in difficulties when interest rates rise? Mark Carney replies that the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message, in good times or bad ones, is that anyone who takes out a loan should consider that they could face adverse conditions in the future, such as weaker growth and higher interest rates. This \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stating the obvious, which is often what you get from a central banker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, is particularly appropriate today, the governor adds smilingly. On cybercrime, Carney says the Bank is setting out the framework that will be needed to protect the UK financial system from computer attacks. On Brexit, Carney says the Bank is making contingency plans for all possible outcomes, and concentrating on those would have the greatest impact on the economy. That includes the possibility that Britain leaves the European Union without a deal (this is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccliff-edge Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that many firms fear). Carney says that forcing banks to hold more capital (by raising the counter-cyclical buffer to 0.5% today, and probably to 1% in November) will more protection to losses. Mark Carney begins his press conference by saying that financial stability has been strengthened since the 2008 crisis. But the job of tackling financial dangers is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153never done, and risks are evolving.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The financial policy committee thinks that the overall risks from the domestic environment are at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153standard level\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with most indicators neither \u00e2\u20ac\u0153particularly elevated nor subdued\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But there are some risks that require particular vigilance, he continues One is consumer credit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c growth has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153far outpaced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd household income in the last year, including credit cards and loans to buy new homes. And with the market competitive, lenders are vulnerable to a downturn. The second worry is Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the range of possible outcomes as Britian leaves the EU, and the paths to them. Mark Carney is facing financial reporters at the Bank of England now, to explain the thinking behind today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report. You can watch it live here: Google has been handed a record \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.42bn fine by Brussels over alleged abuse of its market dominance. It was a much bigger than expected fine, with most predicting a penalty in the region of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn. EU antitrust officials have accused the search engine giant of illegally favouring its shopping service. It is the biggest fine for a single company in an EU antitrust case, and follows a seven-year investigation. European commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: Google has come up with many innovative products and services that have made a difference to our lives. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good thing. But Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy for its comparison shopping service wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just about attracting customers by making its product better than those of its rivals. Instead, Google abused its market dominance as a search engine by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results, and demoting those of competitors. What Google has done is illegal under EU antitrust rules. It denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation. More soon... And here is the background: City experts are trawling through the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report. Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group has spotted a chart showing how consumer credit losses rise when unemployment increases. No wonder the Bank is forcing lenders to stash more capital in their vaults now, in case an economic downturn forces more consumers to default on their loans. Alistair McQueen of Aviva points to another chart, showing how a drop in house prices can ripple through the system, triggering \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfire sales\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and further losses. Steve Hawkes of The Sun has a pithy summary: The BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report is online here. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an infographic form the Bank, setting the scene: The Bank of England is also boosting its work on cybercrime and continuing its work on Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on top of ordering UK banks to set aside more capital, and rushing forwards its consumer stress tests. Here are the five key points from the financial stability report. The Bank of England is.... \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Increasing the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate to 0.5%, from 0%. Absent a material change in the outlook, and consistent with its stated policy for a standard risk environment and of moving gradually, the FPC expects to increase the rate to 1% at its November meeting. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Bringing forward the assessment of stressed losses on consumer credit lending in the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2017 annual stress test. This will inform the FPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment at its next meeting of any additional resilience required in aggregate against this lending. The FPC further supports the intentions of the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority to publish, in July, their expectations of lenders in the consumer credit market. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Clarifying its existing insurance measures in the mortgage market, designed to prevent excessive growth in the number of highly indebted households. This will promote consistency across lenders in their application of tests to assess whether new mortgage borrowers can afford repayments. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Consistent with its previous commitment, restoring the level of resilience delivered by its leverage ratio standard to the level it delivered in July 2016 before the FPC excluded central bank reserves from the leverage ratio exposure measure. The FPC intends to set the minimum leverage requirement at 3.25% of non-reserve exposures, subject to consultation. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Overseeing contingency planning to mitigate risks to financial stability as the United Kingdom withdraws from the European Union. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Building on the programme of cyber resilience testing it instigated in 2013, by setting out the essential elements of the regulatory framework for maintaining cyber resilience. It will now monitor that each element is being fulfilled by the relevant UK authorities. Another important point: the Bank of England is also bringing forwards its planned stress test on consumer credit lending to September, from November. That test will assess whether UK banks can handle a jump in consumer credit losses. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s change means that UK banks will have to set aside more than \u00c2\u00a311bn of extra capital to cover potential losses if the economy weakens: From the BoE, my colleague Jill Treanor explains: The Bank of England is to force banks to hold more capital in the face of rapid growth in lending on credit cards, car finance and personal loans. The intervention by Threadneedle Street, which could amount to banks needing \u00c2\u00a311.4bn of extra capital in the next 18 months, is one of a number of measures intended to protect the financial system from the growth in consumer finance. Here we go! The Bank of England has told Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks to start setting aside more capital to protect themselves from a financial downturn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the key lines from the Financial Stability Report. As predicted, the BoE is raising the counter-cyclical capital buffer (CCyB), so that banks must set aside 0.5% of their assets as capital in case of a rainy day. That means it is reversing one of measures taken after the Brexit vote, a year ago. Interestingly, the BoE says it expecs to raise CCyB again, in November, to 1%. More to follow.... Tension is building in the City as traders wait for the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report to hit the wires, in just five minutes. The rise in the euro has pushed Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets down. Ever index is now in the red, with the Stoxx 600 losing 0.6%. A stronger euro isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great news for eurozone exporters, of course. But the key point is that Draghi is being optimistic -- that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no reason to dump shares. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says traders shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too skittish: Draghi suggested inflation is becoming more sustainable and deflationary forces have been replaced by reflationary forces. Importantly he suggests deflationary forces are external, temporary shocks and the ECB can overlook. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what happens when you open the taps on a massive stimulus programme. The question is whether the Eurozone would survive without the QE support. Draghi sounded more circumspect on that front, arguing that he is confident that monetary policy is working but still needs to remain very loose. Again it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a stretch to describe it as hawkish \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Draghi is simply affirming that loose monetary policy is working without significant adverse consequences and therefore should be maintained. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not advocating tightening any time soon. The European commission just dropped a loud hint that the Google antitrust fine is coming this morning.... This tweet is from EC press officer Yizhou Ren: Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bullish talk has also sent the pound down against the euro, shedding 0.4% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.133. That means one euro buys 88.2p, up from 87.9p on Monday. Good news for eurozone holidaymakers heading to the UK this summer, but a blow to Britons planning a continental jaunt. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters take on Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech: The euro zone still needs \u00e2\u20ac\u0153considerable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd monetary support from the European CentralBank even as its economy recovers steadily and inflation picks up, ECB President Mario Draghi said on Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All the signs now point to a strengthening and broadening recovery in the euro area. Deflationary forces have been replaced by reflationary ones,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Draghi said at the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual policy forum in Sintra, Portugal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, a considerable degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for inflation dynamics to become durable and self-sustaining.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing how the euro spiked as Draghi spoke in Portugal: Oooh. The euro is rallying as Mario Draghi tells the ECB Forum that reflationary pressures in the eurozone are building, as the economy recovers. The single currency has jumped by half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.1235, with Draghi sounding more upbeat and hawkish than expected. Draghi has also told his audience that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a considerable degree\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of stimulus is still needed in the eurozone, and that the ECB must be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprudent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in how it unwinds it. Draghi has previously talked about a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsubstantial degree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of help being needed, and Arne Petimezas, analyst at AFS Group in the Netherlands, thinks this wording is significant. Not for the first (or last) time, Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message is that his policies are delivering the goods.... Over in Sintra, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is giving the keynote speech at the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Forum now. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being streamed here. Draghi says there are clear signs of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strengthening and broadening\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd recovery underway in the eurozone area. There have been 16 straight quarters of growth in the euro area, he says. But this nascent growth needs to become sustainable, and that means higher productivity growth. Central bankers face an unusual challenge today, Draghi continues \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they face growth that is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153above trend and well distributed across the euro area\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But at the same time, inflation is more muted than you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect. To decide the right approach (ie, when to cut the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus package), you need to understand the causes, Draghi cautions. And Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment is that monetary policy is working to build up reflationary pressures. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being slowed by external price shocks, slack in the labour market, and a change in how the labour market and inflation interact, he concludes. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Giles has pulled together a list of key issues to watch for today, when the Bank of England releases its twice-yearly report on financial stability. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Will the BoE remove its emergency support for banks? It could raise its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153counter-cyclical capital buffer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, to force banks to hold more capital. A year ago, after the EU referendum, the BoE reduced this buffer to zero, but it may now conclude that this emergency help is no longer needed. Will it try to curb consumer borrowing? The FPC may tell banks to cut back on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153teaser\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd interest rates, to prevent a surge in defaults. Is car finance out of control? UK car sales have been strong for many months, thanks to cheap credit and new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal contract payment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd deals that make it easier to buy a new vehicle. Is the mortgage market a worry? A housing crash would have very serious consequences for the economy, so investors will want to hear Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views Brexit blues? With negotiations with Brussels finally underway, will the Bank say anything about the risks of a drop in confidence in UK assets? More here. UK consumer confidence has plunged since June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election, as the shock of a hung parliament hits households. It gives the Bank of England a fresh headache as it considers the health of the UK economy, ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Stability Report. Pollsters at YouGov found that UK citizens are fretting about political uncertainty, rising inflation, falling real wages, and the state of the housing market. YouGov found there was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pronounced collapse in consumer confidence following the election\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The sight of Theresa May losing her majority sent its consumer morale index sliding to 105.2 from 109.1. For June as a whole, consumer confidence dropped to 106.9, its second-lowest level since the summer of 2013. Stephen Harmston, head of YouGov, says that the UK housing slowdown is causing particular alarm (Nationwide says prices have fallen for the last three months) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The hung parliament seems to have further dampened consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 spirits, which were already sinking following the continued squeeze on household finances. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the real cause for alarm will be the cooling of the property market, as this is one of the key things that has propped up consumer confidence over the past few years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re facing central bank overload today, with monetary policy chiefs speaking in London, and the Portuguese town of Sintra. All eyes will be on the Bank of England, as its powerful Financial Policy Committee releases its latest report followed by a press conference with Governor Mark Carney. The FPC, which is charged with maintaining financial stability, could order banks to rein in their riskier lending, following growing fears that consumer borrowing is getting out of hand. The Bank could also tell City banks to start restocking their capital buffers, having previously told banks to lend more after the Brexit vote. Meanwhile in sunny (ish) Sintra, the European Central Bank is holding its annual forum. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be hearing from Mario Draghi, ECB president, who last night told students in Portugal that his massive stimulus scheme was creating employment. Challenged over the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge money-printing programme, Draghi declared that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The millennials that found a job because of our policy, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pretty sure they are okay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [with the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies] . And he also denied that savers had been unfairly treated, arguing that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also benefitting from the recovery, as: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recessions are not good for anybody, savers or non-savers, It could be a busy morning, as there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a strong chance that Google will be hit with a whopping fine this morning, of over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn, for breaching Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition rules. That would end a long inquiry into whether Google used its dominant search engine to unfairly promote its Google Shopping service, but could spark an angry response from America. And then tonight, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful central banker, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, is speaking at London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Royal Academy. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re promised a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wide-ranging discussion about global economic issues.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On the corporate front, retail group Debenhams and car hire chain Northgate are reporting results, plus there are retail sales figures in the UK and consumer confidence stats from America to keep us on our toes.
