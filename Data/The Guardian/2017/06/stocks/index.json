Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ADP payrolls number has really grabbed investor attention, with the 253,000 reading providing yet more clues that we will see the Fed raise rates once more this month. Tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls figure is undoubtedly the big release of the week, as this will largely provide confirmation of whether the Fed will actually act this month.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US dollar got a significant uplift after a bumper ADP payrolls report for May which showed that 253k new jobs were added, with most of them in the services sector. As a bellwether for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official payrolls report it could well rubber stamp the prospect of a move in June, but also raise expectations of a further hike as soon as September. The main puzzle for a lot of people given the number of jobs being added is the weak nature of wage growth which still remains lacklustre. </p> </blockquote> <p>Despite the dollar strength, sterling has not been hit too hard. Hewson again:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound has managed to hold up fairly well despite another poll showing a narrow lead for the Conservative party, as the focus returns to the UK economy. Another decent manufacturing report for the month of May saw decent gains in new orders as well as employment. Rising prices remained a concern but they also showed further signs of easing back. </p> </blockquote> <p>The latest election poll shows an 8 point lead for the Conservatives over Labour, down from 15 points on May 23.</p> <p><strong> <br></strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59302157e4b0be3ed1921ce6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-01T14:16:32.561Z\">3.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The ISM survey adds more impetus for the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this months, says ING Bank economist James Knightley:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The key manufacturing survey suggests strong order books will keep output robust with employment picking up nicely.</p> <p>The US ISM manufacturing index for May has barely changed from April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rising to 54.9 from 54.8. The consensus had expected it to hold steady. Production slipped marginally to stand at 57.1 versus 58.6 previously, but new orders rose to 59.5 from 57.5 so it looks as though the pipeline for output remains very strong given both readings are well above the break-even 50 level. The employment component moved higher to 53.5 from 52.0, which offers encouragement for the jobs story as well. As such, the manufacturing sector is clearly a source of strength right now and the report boosts the case for a Fed rate hike at the June 14 FOMC meeting.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59301fede4b0be3ed1921cdb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-01T14:14:26.981Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Meanwhile US construction spending recorded its biggest drop in a year in April.</strong></p> <p>With slowing investment in both public and private projects, spending fell by 1.4% compared to expectations of a 0.5% rise.</p> <p>But the March figure was revised up from an initial 0.2% decline to a rise of 1.1%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59301e1ae4b0bdd87e2f22b8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-01T14:08:36.491Z\">3.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US manufacturing edges higher - ISM</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In fact the second manufacturing survey has confounded expectations by showing a slight rise rather than a slight dip.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/ismreport/mfgrob.cfm?SSO=1\">ISM manufacturing activity index </a>has increased from 54.8 in April to 54.9 last month, better than the 54.5 forecast by analysts.

Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ADP payrolls number has really grabbed investor attention, with the 253,000 reading providing yet more clues that we will see the Fed raise rates once more this month. Tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls figure is undoubtedly the big release of the week, as this will largely provide confirmation of whether the Fed will actually act this month. However, with markets already pricing in a 100% chance of a rate rise, there is reason to believe we could see a lower degree of volatility than usual. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 23.82 points or 0.32% higher at 7543.77 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.4% to 12,664.92 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.66% higher at 5318.67 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB climbed 0.99% to 20,936.07 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.01% better at 10,881.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.85% to 781.85 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 54 points or 0.27% higher. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. After a nervous opening, Wall Street has the wind in its sails. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 46 points or 0.22% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have both hit new highs. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Crude inventories are tanking if the latest data from the EIA is anything to go by, with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading providing the biggest weekly draw-down in 2017. The recent OPEC decision to extend production cuts was treated with disdain, yet there is reason to believe that their actions are gradually managing to reduce global crude inventories despite rising output in the likes of the US. More signs of growing demand for oil, with US crude stocks falling last week by the biggest amount so far this year. Crude supplies fell by 6.43m barrels to 509.91m, compared to expectations of a 2.5m decline. Gasoline stocks were also down by more than analysts had been forecasting, according to the Energy Information Administration. The news has pushed crude prices higher, with West Texas Intermediate up 0.56% to $48.59 a barrel and Brent crude 0.37% better at $50.95. Sterling is now moving higher against both the dollar and the euro, shrugging off worries about the latest election opinion polls and buoyed by the decent UK manufacturing data. It is now up 0.12% against the dollar at $1.2905 and 0.29% higher against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1490. More on the currency markets. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The US dollar got a significant uplift after a bumper ADP payrolls report for May which showed that 253k new jobs were added, with most of them in the services sector. As a bellwether for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official payrolls report it could well rubber stamp the prospect of a move in June, but also raise expectations of a further hike as soon as September. The main puzzle for a lot of people given the number of jobs being added is the weak nature of wage growth which still remains lacklustre. Despite the dollar strength, sterling has not been hit too hard. Hewson again: The pound has managed to hold up fairly well despite another poll showing a narrow lead for the Conservative party, as the focus returns to the UK economy. Another decent manufacturing report for the month of May saw decent gains in new orders as well as employment. Rising prices remained a concern but they also showed further signs of easing back. The latest election poll shows an 8 point lead for the Conservatives over Labour, down from 15 points on May 23. The ISM survey adds more impetus for the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this months, says ING Bank economist James Knightley: The key manufacturing survey suggests strong order books will keep output robust with employment picking up nicely. The US ISM manufacturing index for May has barely changed from April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rising to 54.9 from 54.8. The consensus had expected it to hold steady. Production slipped marginally to stand at 57.1 versus 58.6 previously, but new orders rose to 59.5 from 57.5 so it looks as though the pipeline for output remains very strong given both readings are well above the break-even 50 level. The employment component moved higher to 53.5 from 52.0, which offers encouragement for the jobs story as well. As such, the manufacturing sector is clearly a source of strength right now and the report boosts the case for a Fed rate hike at the June 14 FOMC meeting. Meanwhile US construction spending recorded its biggest drop in a year in April. With slowing investment in both public and private projects, spending fell by 1.4% compared to expectations of a 0.5% rise. But the March figure was revised up from an initial 0.2% decline to a rise of 1.1%. In fact the second manufacturing survey has confounded expectations by showing a slight rise rather than a slight dip. The ISM manufacturing activity index has increased from 54.8 in April to 54.9 last month, better than the 54.5 forecast by analysts. Timothy Fiore, ISM chair, said: Comments from the panel generally reflect stable to growing business conditions, with new orders, employment and inventories of raw materials all growing in May compared to April. The slowing of pricing pressure, especially in basic commodities, should have a positive impact on margins and buying policies as this moderation moves up the value chain. And here are some comments from the survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s respondents: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sales have picked up compared to the last two months. Customer demand has increased.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Plastics &amp; Rubber Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Economy is still strong, but [the] political climate can change things very quickly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Transportation Equipment) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Global price increases for commodities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Electrical Equipment, Appliances &amp; Components) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business (sales/production) is steady. Pricing pressures on raw materials. Skilled labor in short supply.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Furniture &amp; Related Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Agricultural demand very strong.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Chemical Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our business is definitely paying attention to developments with the Canadian lumber tariff announcement. The final outcome could change our fiber pricing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Paper Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153OEM longer lead parts possibly longer lead time due to more orders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Nonmetallic Mineral Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business conditions are steady, and with competition increasing, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s making negotiations even more intense to reduce costs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Machinery) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business is booming, and getting direct employees is increasingly difficult.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Fabricated Metal Products) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Difficult to find qualified labor for factory positions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products) Commenting on the US PMI, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: Manufacturing growth momentum continued to ebb in May, down to its weakest since just before the presidential election. Manufacturing output, order books and employment all grew at only modest rates as sluggish sales prompted firms to scale back hiring. Exports sales remained especially lacklustre, hampered in part by the relatively strong dollar. The survey also brought signs of companies becoming more cautious about holding inventory. Factories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 raw material prices meanwhile rose at a sharply reduced rate, which should at least help take pressure off profit margins and also feed through to weaker pressure on consumer price inflation. The rival ISM survey is due shortly, and is also expected to show a slight dip from the April figure. The first of the two US manufacturing surveys has come in better than the initial reading but has shown a very slight dip from the previous month. The Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index has slipped from 52.8 in April to 52.7 last month, compared to a first estimate of 52.5. While this is still in expansion territory it is the lowest reading since September. US markets have made a tentative start to the new month, despite the strong private sector jobs data and ahead of two rival manufacturing surveys for May. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 9 points while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have edged marginally higher at the open. The dollar is rallying after the stronger than expected private sector jobs figures, ahead of the non-farm payrolls due on Friday. The US currency is up 0.5% against the yen and 0.2% better against the euro. And the pound is currently 0.13% lower at $1.2874. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen plenty of encouraging economic news this morning, with factory output rising in the UK and also in the eurozone, strong job creation in America, and an upgrade to Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP. But this is no time for complacency. The chief executive of the World Bank has just warned governments to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuckle up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, ready for the next crisis. Kristalina Georgieva warned an audience at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum that the rise in financial, economic and terror-related emergencies is becoming the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She explained: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m asking myself what has changed in this decade and my conclusion is what has changed probably can be summed up with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuckle up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are now at the point when shocks are more frequent. Unexpected crises are maybe not more dramatic than they used to be before, but they are very impolite, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait their turn.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In the past, Georgieva argued, governments would be faced with one \u00e2\u20ac\u0153massive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd crisis at a time. Now, they come in battalions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you just look at the last years, we had financial crisis, economic crisis, eurozone crisis, terrorism, geopolitical crises, and neither institutions or businesses are well tuned to deal with more than one shock at a time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have to really figure out - if this is the new normal, and I happen to think this is the new normal - how we can have more resilient , more agile and more adaptable government policies, (and) private sector behaviour so that (work) security can be put on a sound foundation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thanks to the Press Association for the quotes. More American employment data just landed. And it shows that the number of US citizens filing new claims for unemployment benefit has risen to 248,000, from 235,000 a week ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than expected, but remains low by historical standards. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector created 253,000 new jobs in May, substantially more than expected. Economists had predicted that the monthly ADP payroll would rise by 185,000, and these blow-out figure suggest tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll could also be impressive. More than 200,000 jobs were created in the service sector, including 88,000 in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprofessional and business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sector. There were also small gains in manufacturing and mining, and 37,000 new hires in construction. Brian Wesbury, chief economist at First Trust Portfolios, says the report shows that the US economy is motoring along quite nicely. But economists are also looking for signs that wage growth is picking up. International Airlines Group CEO Willie Walsh has broken his silence over the disruption that grounded over a thousand British Airways flights last weekend. Speaking to the BBC, Walsh said he was pleased that BA has recovered from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant disruption\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that it faced on Saturday. And he insist that the IT meltdown was caused by a power outage, rather than a problem with BA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology, saying: We clearly apologise to any customers who were disrupted. It was not an IT failure. It was a problem caused by the failure of electrical power to our IT systems. We understand what happened, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still investigating why it happened, and that investigation will take some time. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that IT experts have told us that a power surge could not cause such a catastrophic outage. Walsh added that the team at BA did \u00e2\u20ac\u0153everything they could\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to recover the situation. Clearly we will do everything we can to make up for the disruption that passengers suffered, he concludes. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got bad news for wine lovers out there. The average price of a bottle in the UK has risen over \u00c2\u00a35.50 for the first time ever. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122a according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, which blames the fall in sterling following last June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. Miles Beale, WSTA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Last year the WSTA predicted that Brexit and the fall in the value of the pound, compounded by rising inflation, would force the UK wine industry to up their prices. Sadly this is now a reality as an average priced bottle of wine in the UK is at an all-time high. Unfortunately, for both British businesses and consumers, we are clear that this is not a one off adjustment, but rather that wine prices will continue to rise. What is even more concerning is that this does not take into account the inflationary duty rise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at a painful 3.9% - on alcohol inflicted by the Chancellor in the March Budget. Billionaire-turned-philanthropist George Soros has weighed in on Brexit this morning, saying the European Union needs to be radically re-invented. Soros also argued that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the EU will take much longer than the two-year window set under the Lisbon Treaty. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Negotiating the separation with Britain will divert the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention from its own existential crisis, and the talks are bound to last longer than the two years allotted to them. Five years seems more likely.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Our Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin has more details: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unrest at the Bank of England this morning. Workers at Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank are to be balloted on strike action, after being offered a pay rise of just 1%. Unite regional officer Mercedes Sanchez has blasted the BoE, calling it arrogant and out of touch: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disgraceful snub of low paid staff stinks of arrogance and represents an organisation thoroughly out of touch with the reality of the pressure staff face meeting their costs of living. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a source of shame that an iconic symbol of financial services in the UK is choosing to ride roughshod over the concerns of its dedicated and hardworking staff and impose this derisory pay deal. In effect, staff are facing a real terms pay cut. A 1% rise in wages won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep pace with inflation, which has just jut a four-year high of 2.7%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ahead of the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own target of 2%. Unite represent security, catering, legal, and human resource staff at the Bank. Update: Apparently Unite represent 2% of all BoE staff. Sky News has more details. Economists have welcomed the news that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing PMI dipped to 56.7 in May, from 57 in April, showing solid growth. Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply says manufacturers are shrugging off political uncertainty: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While not quite hitting the heights of April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound in activity, the manufacturing sector didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disappoint with a sustained rise in purchasing activity, output and new orders, optimism at a 20- month high, and storming ahead unfazed by the looming election. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The domestic market persisted as the driving force, but the weak pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continuing bounty meant levels of export orders also increased, for the thirteenth month, as export markets made use of the competitiveness of UK firms. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation, agrees that UK manufacturing is in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood shape\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Output and orders expansion is being driven by resilient demand coming through UK supply chains and a better looking global economy than UK manufacturers have been used to for some time. Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays, says the weak pound is helping exporters, but could bite UK customers in the pocket: Exporters have continued to take advantage of a weak sterling, which has kept British exports competitive on a global stage, and at a time when the world economy is showing signs of improvement. However, rising cost pressures are still circling, not only from elevated import costs but also from the growing effect of domestic costs from sources such as energy and staffing which will all contribute to fuelling inflation. Although manufacturers have resisted passing on these costs to date, the expectation of price rises is becoming more apparent in the sector.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chris Leyland, analyst at investment firm True Potential, says factory bosses face some pressures: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure is above 50, meaning expansion is still happening, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just that the rate has slowed compared to last month. There are a number of reasons for that, mostly stemming from the weaker pound pushing up import cost for factories and therefore prices for the end consumer. It also means consumers have less disposable income, because their food and fuel bills have risen. The price of oil has also increased, leading to higher fuel costs for manufacturers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The key will be exports, because the weaker pound means factories may receive more orders from abroad, which could offset some domestic pain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Williamson flags up that export growth slowed a little in May: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector has continued to shrug off Brexit, by posting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153further marked growth in May\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI survey from Markit, which shows that UK factory growth was close to April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three-year high. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the topline: UK factory bosses reported that they benefitted from domestic demand, and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153solid increase\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in new export business. Optimism regarding the outlook for production levels in one year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time rose to a 20-month high. This is also feeding into the jobs market; factory employment rose for the tenth consecutive month in May, at the fastest rate since June 2014. In short, it all suggests that the manufacturing sector is holding up well. Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The strong PMI numbers suggest the manufacturing sector has gained growth momentum in the second quarter after the sluggish start of the year. The ongoing strength of the domestic market remains the main driver of the upturn. Growth of new export business played a lesser role in comparison, with the trend in foreign demand continuing to improve only in fits and starts, despite the assistance of a historically weak sterling exchange rate.

Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate has been revised sharply higher, in another sign that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery is strengthening. Italian GDP rose by 0.4% in January-to-March, new figures show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twice as fast as first estimated. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also twice as fast as Britain managed in Q1, and confirms that the UK was the weakest-performing G7 member at the start of this year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details of the surge in manufacturing employment across the eurozone last month: Staffing levels rose at quicker rates in Germany (six- year high), Italy (just below October 1999\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s series- record), Spain (fastest in 19 years), Ireland (two-year peak) and Austria (two-month high). Slower increases were registered in France and the Netherlands, while Greece reported jobs growth for the first time in six months. Newsflash: Eurozone factories have just racked up their fastest growth in six years. The euro-area manufacturing PMI has come in at 57.0, up from 56.7 in April, thanks to faster growth in output and new orders. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector led the way, with growth at a 73-month high. Most other eurozone countries also posted growth, but Greece brought up the rear with another contraction. And the really good news is that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories have created more jobs in May than at any time since this survey began, 20 years ago. Markit says: The ongoing expansion of the eurozone manufacturing sector gathered further momentum in May. Growth in output and new orders accelerated to the best seen for around six years, to underpin the strongest job creation in the 20-year survey history. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, says the surveys show Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery is strengthening: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The eurozone upturn is developing deeper roots as factories enjoy a spring growth spurt. Demand for goods is growing at the steepest rate for six years, encouraging manufacturers to step up production and take on extra staff at a rate not previously seen in the two-decade history of the PMI survey. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fact that the upturn is being accompanied by such strong jobs growth sends a signal that increasing numbers of companies are moving away from a focus on cost cutting towards investing in expansion, underscoring the elevated levels of business optimism seen across the region. The record hiring adds to the sense that the upturn is looking more and more robust as each month goes by. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories have expanded faster than their French rivals last month: Good news from Spain! Spanish factories are taking on new staff at the fastest rate since 1998, after posting another month of growth. The Spanish manufacturing PMI hit a four-month high of 55.4 in May, up from 54.5 in April. Firms reported a rise in output and new orders, encouraging them to take on extra workers to deal with the demand. Spain has suffered one of the worst unemployment crisis of any eurozone country since the financial crisis, so this is very encouraging. Andrew Harker, senior economist at IHS Markit, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153May was an excellent month for workers in the Spanish manufacturing sector as firms took on staff at the strongest pace for 19 years. Moreover, with new work rising healthily again and further signs of capacity coming under pressure, the likelihood is that jobs will continue to be created at a decent clip over the near-term at least. The first eurozone manufacturing report of the day was quite a belter. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory PMI jumped to 55.9 in May from 55.0 in April, signalling \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a marked improvement in business conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level in 22 months. Investec, which produces the report, says: Respondents linked higher output to rising new orders and improving economic conditions. New business also rose at a faster pace in May amid reports of stronger client demand. We have fresh evidence that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market is cooling. House prices fell by 0.2% in May, reports Nationwide, which is the third monthly fall in a row. That hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happened since 2009 - the dark days of the financial crisis. On an annual basis, prices are only 2.1% higher than a year ago - another sign that demand is cooling off. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Economist, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153House prices recorded their third consecutive monthly fall in May \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first time this has occurred since 2009. The annual rate of growth slowed to 2.1%, the weakest in almost four years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is still early days, but this provides further evidence that the housing market is losing momentum. Moreover, this may be indicative of a wider slowdown in the household sector, though data continues to send mixed signals in this regard. Worries over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy are intensifying this morning after new data showed its manufacturing sector is shrinking. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index (PMI) fell to 49.6 in May, from 50.1 in April. That signals that activity contracted last month, for the first time in nearly a year. Chinese firms reported that output grew at the weakest level in 11 months, due to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmuted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 growth in new orders from domestic and overseas customers. Firms also slashed jobs again, at the fastest rate since last September. Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, said there are signs that Chinese factories are struggling. The sub-index of stocks of purchases signalled a renewed decline, while the sub-index of stocks of finished goods rebounded, indicating that companies have stopped actively restocking as inventories began to stack up. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector has come under greater pressure in May and the economy is clearly on a downward trajectory.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Caixin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey is weaker than the official Chinese PMIs.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new month, and that means a new flurry of economic data. June is kicking off with new surveys of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories, from China to the US via Europe. The Purchasing Manager Indexes are expected to show that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery continued last month, with eurozone manufacturing growth possibly hitting a six-year high. The UK data will also be closely scrutinised. Economists predict a small slowdown in growth last month. RBC Capital Markets say: Another set of robust numbers would make the Q1 slowdown seem potentially transitory, whereas softer data would instead leave the April upturn looking like a positive blip amidst mounting evidence of a slowing economy. Our economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 central expectation remains that the consumer-led slowdown will be more durable, so our bias is to look for a pullback in the PMIs to confirm this. The City has already woken up to some disappointing data from China, where factory activity contracted for the first time in 11 months (more on that shortly). The pound continues to bob around like a cork in a stormy sea, as the UK general election approaches. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shed almost half a cent this morning, to $1.285, after a new YouGov poll showed a mere 3 point gap between the Conservatives and Labour. Other polls, though, have given Theresa May a larger lead, so traders are suitably cautious. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 8.15am to 9am: Eurozone manufacturing PMIs are released 9.30am: UK manufacturing PMIs 1.15pm: US ADP payroll of private sector jobs 1.30pm: US weekly jobless figures 3pm: US manufacturing PMIs",

We know the Fed is more than happy to look through this kind of thing. Indeed Janet Yellen isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that fussed about one quarter of weaker growth, so she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardly going to be troubled by a soft-ish month or two of job creation. </p> <p>The recent US data has been pretty solid too and projections for Q2 growth are very upbeat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Atlanta Fed reckons 4%, which would make a soft month or two of job creation pretty irrelevant.</p> <p>The big question is not really whether we get a hike in June now but the extent to which the market thinks the Fed is ready to do one or even two more hikes this year. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs numbers arguably make the Fed a touch less likely to tighten as quickly as the most hawkish estimates suggest. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-593162dfe4b0be3ed19222ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-02T13:08:14.210Z\">2.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more from ING Bank. Economist James Smith said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs report would have had to be horrendous to worry the Fed, and the sub-consensus wage and jobs numbers won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t derail a June rate hike.</p> <p>To us, the latest dip in non-farm payrolls to 138k looks like nothing more than a return closer to the underlying trend. As the US economy is close to, if not at, full employment, we should be seeing a gradual slowdown in jobs growth. Whilst 200k+ jobs growth sounds good at face value, consistently high readings would raise the possibility that there is more slack in the US economy than previously thought. This is a view that the Fed themselves broadly subscribe to, and they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be phased by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sub-consensus figure.</p> <p>What they may find more irritating is wage growth, which marginally disappointed markets by coming in at 2.5% year on year. In reality, this is probably more of a statistical quirk rather than anything fundamental. May had three more workdays than April, and as the data doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t adjust for this, average hourly earnings will have been temporarily depressed. </p> <p>The underlying story is still a positive one. Labour market tightness still appears to be pushing up pay, but the Fed really needs to see average hourly earnings growth push above 3% if they are to hike more aggressively. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looking increasingly unlikely this year.</p> <p>So what does this all mean for the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tightening cycle? Well in reality, it would have taken a horrendous report today to make the Fed think twice about a June rate hike. Other recent data has supported the notion that 1Q economic weakness was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transitory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>But what comes next from the Fed is less assured. Core PCE has struggled to converge on 2%, wage growth has been disappointing and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal plans are still very uncertain. That means we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect fireworks from the Fed, but even so, we feel a third 2017 rate hike in September still looks more likely than markets are currently pricing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59316081e4b0be3ed19222a2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-02T12:56:55.305Z\">1.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>But the poor data may not stop an imminent US rate rise:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ING_Economics/status/870621155262156802\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As expected, a weaker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFP?src=hash\">#NFP</a> report.

Helena Smith reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Fambouraris said the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal now was to close the outstanding bailout review so that disbursement of the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.5bn Athens owes in imminent maturing debt is made. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[It] will give a boost to the real economy because besides covering our obligations towards creditors the rest of the money will cover requirements of the real economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. </p> <p>Senior sources in Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leftist-led administration say they are bracing for a tough eurogroup meeting on June 15 amid growing signals from senior European officials that the prospect of any debt deal is now off the table.</p> <p>Flambouraris insisted Athens was still holding out for an agreement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Caught in the row between the IMF and German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble, the government is trying to achieve a solution for the debt that will make it viable,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said in the statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know very well that this clash does not help our country but despite that we are still trying and hoping.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59314a7ae4b00493c827886b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-02T11:26:36.377Z\">12.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With just over an hour to go to the latest US non farm payroll figures, there is continuing talk the number could beat forecasts, especially in the light of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector data from ADP. Mihir Kapadia, chief executive of Sun Global Investments, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The ADP data released yesterday (which only covers the (private sector) clients of payrolls processing firm ADP) came in at 253,000 jobs versus 180,000 expected) and this has set the stage for a strong number today. Economists expect the US to add 184,000 nonfarm jobs (211,000 in April) though the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whisper number\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is somewhat higher.</p> <p>The unemployment rate is forecast to hold steady at 4.4%, a level which is effectively full employment. The wage inflation number indicator will be highly watched as wage growth has been slower than expected despite labour market tightness. This has been reflected in recent Fed officials\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 utterances about undershooting the inflation target of 2%. A strong number will only strengthen the already very strong conviction that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by 25 basis points at their mid-June meeting.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59313edee4b0bdd87e2f2797\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-02T10:36:25.900Z\">11.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>While European markets are soaring, the FTSE 100 has come off its best levels, with commodity companies coming under pressure as the oil price falls. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The FTSE lost its mojo as the morning went on, significantly trailing beyond its rampant Eurozone peers.</p> <p>After striking [almost] 7600 for the first time in its history the UK index quickly fell back, and is now up just 15 points thanks to a series of sharp losses in its commodity sector. Following on from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late drop \u00e2\u20ac\u201c inspired by reports of increased oil output in Libya and the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Brent Crude has fallen a further 2.5%, leaving the black stuff just above $49 per barrel. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to remove America from the Paris climate agreement has sparked concerns that the country will ramp up its drilling, negating any output cap implemented by OPEC. This in turn sent Shell and BP down 0.5% to 1%, with the miners also in the red thanks to copper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.7% decline.</p> <p>Free from such troubles the Eurozone soared this Friday, the CAC and DAX jumping 0.8% and 1.4% respectively.</p> <p>The Dow Jones is set to break its own records when the bell rings on Wall Street, with the futures suggesting the index will cross the 21200 mark. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because investors are getting excited about this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm jobs report. A huge ADP non-farm figure means the current forecasts for a 181k change in the number of employed people may be conservative, while for the past 2 months in a row the unemployment rate has unexpectedly shrank. Wage growth is the only real laggard, with average hourly earnings set to fall from 0.3% to 0.2% month-on-month.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59313c7ce4b0bdd87e2f2788\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-02T10:23:49.975Z\">11.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has joined the global rally and also reached a new peak.</strong></p> <p>It has added more than 1.4% to hit 12,850, beating the previous high set in the middle of May.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59313688e4b0be3ed19221b9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-02T10:01:06.261Z\">11.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greece growing faster than UK</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The revision to Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first quarter GDP figures not only means the country was not in recession, but it has also grown more than the UK, Italy and US.</p> <p>The statistics service Elstat said the Greek economy grew by 0.4% in the three months to March, compared to an earlier estimate of a 0.1% fall.

Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number also raises the bar for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official payrolls report which is expected to come in at around the 180k level, down from 211k in April.</p> <p>This seems rather conservative given the decent ADP number, and the fairly close correlation between the two we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen over the last few months, the March outlier notwithstanding.

                "bodyText":"The big event of the day, the US jobs data, turned into a disappointment. After expectations that at least 180,000 jobs would be added in May the actual figure came out at 138,000. March and April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures were also revised downwards by 66,000. But most analysts believe the poor data would not stop the US Federal Reserve from raising interest rates at its meeting later this month. Earlier, a UK construction survey proved stronger than expected, lifted by a strong residential sector. Greece saw its first quarter growth figures revised upwards, meaning it did not fall into recession and is outperforming the UK, Italy and the US. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. The poor US jobs figures have certainly taken the shine off markets. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently just 9 points higher, well below the earlier expectations. The S&amp;P 500 opened virtually unchanged while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.24%. European markets are also off their best levels, with the FTSE 100 now up just 0.15% although still on track - just - for a new closing high. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 1.3% better while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.5%. Still with the US jobs and here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a breakdown of the job movements in various sectors: Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: As far as today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s NFP number matters, a June rate hike is pretty well nailed on and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relatively soft nonfarm payrolls number shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really affect the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision-making in the near-term. We know the Fed is more than happy to look through this kind of thing. Indeed Janet Yellen isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that fussed about one quarter of weaker growth, so she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardly going to be troubled by a soft-ish month or two of job creation. The recent US data has been pretty solid too and projections for Q2 growth are very upbeat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Atlanta Fed reckons 4%, which would make a soft month or two of job creation pretty irrelevant. The big question is not really whether we get a hike in June now but the extent to which the market thinks the Fed is ready to do one or even two more hikes this year. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs numbers arguably make the Fed a touch less likely to tighten as quickly as the most hawkish estimates suggest. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more from ING Bank. Economist James Smith said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs report would have had to be horrendous to worry the Fed, and the sub-consensus wage and jobs numbers won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t derail a June rate hike. To us, the latest dip in non-farm payrolls to 138k looks like nothing more than a return closer to the underlying trend. As the US economy is close to, if not at, full employment, we should be seeing a gradual slowdown in jobs growth. Whilst 200k+ jobs growth sounds good at face value, consistently high readings would raise the possibility that there is more slack in the US economy than previously thought. This is a view that the Fed themselves broadly subscribe to, and they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be phased by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sub-consensus figure. What they may find more irritating is wage growth, which marginally disappointed markets by coming in at 2.5% year on year. In reality, this is probably more of a statistical quirk rather than anything fundamental. May had three more workdays than April, and as the data doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t adjust for this, average hourly earnings will have been temporarily depressed. The underlying story is still a positive one. Labour market tightness still appears to be pushing up pay, but the Fed really needs to see average hourly earnings growth push above 3% if they are to hike more aggressively. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looking increasingly unlikely this year. So what does this all mean for the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tightening cycle? Well in reality, it would have taken a horrendous report today to make the Fed think twice about a June rate hike. Other recent data has supported the notion that 1Q economic weakness was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transitory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But what comes next from the Fed is less assured. Core PCE has struggled to converge on 2%, wage growth has been disappointing and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal plans are still very uncertain. That means we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect fireworks from the Fed, but even so, we feel a third 2017 rate hike in September still looks more likely than markets are currently pricing. But the poor data may not stop an imminent US rate rise: The weaker than expected non-farm payroll numbers came as a particular surprise since on Thursday the ADP private sector jobs report beat forecasts, prompting analysts to expect a higher number if anything. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: The significant dip in nonfarm payrolls for May will be a concern for Donald Trump, particularly as the figure has slipped below the 150,000 generally considered as a marker of strong job creation. The embattled president has been under attack from all sides in recent weeks, but had at least been able to point to the strong performance of the US economy since his inauguration. However, a failure to deliver on jobs will leave him vulnerable, particularly as he made it the cornerstone of his successful run to the White House. The question now is how the Federal Reserve reacts, with many analysts expecting policy makers to hesitate on future rate hikes if wage growth does not pick up pace. It was seen as a given that the US Federal Reserve would be raising interest rates at its meeting in the middle of the month. But these poor jobs figures cast some doubt on that, and on any further moves by the Fed. So the dollar has weakened, dropping to a seven month low against the Swiss franc and the euro. The pound has strengthened as a consequence, and is now up 0.07% at $1.2888 having earlier fallen as low as $1.2846. The US futures have also come off their best, now indicating a smaller opening rise of around 49 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The unemployment rate dipped from 4.4% in April to 4.3% last month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile the US trade deficit widened by more than expected in April. It jumped 5.2% to $47.6bn, the highest level since January, with a surge in cellphone imports. Average hourly earnings were up 0.2% in May, the same as the April figure which was itself revised down from 0.3%. Breaking news: Bad news for Donald Trump. The US non-farm payroll numbers have come in well below expectations. They fell from 174,000 in April to 138,000, compared to expectations of a figure of at least 180,000. And that April figure itself was revised down from 211,000. March was revised down from 79,000 to 50,000, meaning in total, around 108,000 fewer jobs were created than expected. Back with Greece, and following the news that the country has avoided recession, the Greek prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mentor and closest advisor Alekos Fambouraris has made a rare public statement. Helena Smith reports: Fambouraris said the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal now was to close the outstanding bailout review so that disbursement of the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.5bn Athens owes in imminent maturing debt is made. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[It] will give a boost to the real economy because besides covering our obligations towards creditors the rest of the money will cover requirements of the real economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Senior sources in Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leftist-led administration say they are bracing for a tough eurogroup meeting on June 15 amid growing signals from senior European officials that the prospect of any debt deal is now off the table. Flambouraris insisted Athens was still holding out for an agreement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Caught in the row between the IMF and German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble, the government is trying to achieve a solution for the debt that will make it viable,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said in the statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know very well that this clash does not help our country but despite that we are still trying and hoping.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With just over an hour to go to the latest US non farm payroll figures, there is continuing talk the number could beat forecasts, especially in the light of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector data from ADP. Mihir Kapadia, chief executive of Sun Global Investments, said: The ADP data released yesterday (which only covers the (private sector) clients of payrolls processing firm ADP) came in at 253,000 jobs versus 180,000 expected) and this has set the stage for a strong number today. Economists expect the US to add 184,000 nonfarm jobs (211,000 in April) though the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whisper number\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is somewhat higher. The unemployment rate is forecast to hold steady at 4.4%, a level which is effectively full employment. The wage inflation number indicator will be highly watched as wage growth has been slower than expected despite labour market tightness. This has been reflected in recent Fed officials\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 utterances about undershooting the inflation target of 2%. A strong number will only strengthen the already very strong conviction that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by 25 basis points at their mid-June meeting. While European markets are soaring, the FTSE 100 has come off its best levels, with commodity companies coming under pressure as the oil price falls. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The FTSE lost its mojo as the morning went on, significantly trailing beyond its rampant Eurozone peers. After striking [almost] 7600 for the first time in its history the UK index quickly fell back, and is now up just 15 points thanks to a series of sharp losses in its commodity sector. Following on from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late drop \u00e2\u20ac\u201c inspired by reports of increased oil output in Libya and the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Brent Crude has fallen a further 2.5%, leaving the black stuff just above $49 per barrel. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to remove America from the Paris climate agreement has sparked concerns that the country will ramp up its drilling, negating any output cap implemented by OPEC. This in turn sent Shell and BP down 0.5% to 1%, with the miners also in the red thanks to copper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.7% decline. Free from such troubles the Eurozone soared this Friday, the CAC and DAX jumping 0.8% and 1.4% respectively. The Dow Jones is set to break its own records when the bell rings on Wall Street, with the futures suggesting the index will cross the 21200 mark. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because investors are getting excited about this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm jobs report. A huge ADP non-farm figure means the current forecasts for a 181k change in the number of employed people may be conservative, while for the past 2 months in a row the unemployment rate has unexpectedly shrank. Wage growth is the only real laggard, with average hourly earnings set to fall from 0.3% to 0.2% month-on-month. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has joined the global rally and also reached a new peak. It has added more than 1.4% to hit 12,850, beating the previous high set in the middle of May. The revision to Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first quarter GDP figures not only means the country was not in recession, but it has also grown more than the UK, Italy and US. The statistics service Elstat said the Greek economy grew by 0.4% in the three months to March, compared to an earlier estimate of a 0.1% fall. The previous quarter, GDP fell by 1.1%. Two months of negative GDP growth indicate recession, but Greece has now avoided that according to the revised data. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first quarter month on month growth compares to a figure of 0.2% for the UK, which was already at the bottom of the G7 league table. Oil is on the slide, partly thanks to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement. There are concerns that the move could lead to more US drilling, which in turn would add to the supply glut that Opec and its allies have been trying to counter with their own agreement to cut output. As a result West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has fallen 2.9% to $46.96 a barrel, while Brent crude is down 2.8% at $49.21. Over in Greece, and the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has grown unexpectedly in the first quarter despite all the uncertainties surrounding its bailout programme and the struggles to agree a deal with its creditors. Eurozone producer prices have come in lower than expected. They were flat in April compared to a 0.3% fall the previous month and forecasts of a 0.3% rise. Year on year they rose 4.3%, slightly lower than the expected 4.5%. Tim Moore, senior economist at IHS Markit, said: May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey data reveals that the UK construction sector has started to recover strongly from its slow start to 2017. House building was the key growth driver, with work on residential projects rising at the fastest pace since December 2015. A sustained rebound in residential building provides an encouraging sign that the recent a soft patch for property values has not deterred new housing supply. Instead, strong labour market conditions, resilient demand and ultra-low mortgage rates appear to have helped boost work on residential development projects in May. Civil engineering continued to flourish, helped by a strong pipeline of infrastructure projects. However, commercial building was trapped in the slow lane amid reports highlighting that heightened economic uncertainty is holding back client spending. The forward-looking elements of the latest survey are reassuring for the construction sector, notably the acceleration in new business growth to its strongest so far this year. On the price front, while construction costs have ratcheted up over the past six to nine months, the wave of inflation from imported materials now appears to have passed its peak. Markit said residential work had replaced civil engineering as best performing category in its survey: A sharp and accelerated rise in residential work was a key factor supporting overall construction activity in May. The housing sub-category has rebounded strongly following the seven-month low seen in March. Moreover, the latest increase in residential building was the fastest since December 2015. Survey respondents cited a strong pipeline of new development projects and resilient underlying demand conditions. Breaking news: The latest UK construction figures show an increase in May rather than the expected decline. The Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers index climbed from 53.1 in April to 56, the highest level since December 2015, helped by a pickup in housebuilding. Analysts had been forecasting a dip to 52.7. The Ahora family behind discount retailer B&amp;M European are a bit richer this morning. The family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment vehicle SSA and private equity group Clayton Dubilier have between them sold shares worth around \u00c2\u00a3454m in a placing to investors. SSA retains 15% and CD 4.9% following the placing. It was done at 363p a share, and in the market B&amp;M has lost 11.3p to 359p. Analyst Nick Bubb said: The B&amp;M share price has had a good run and after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finals guess what: the private equity fund Clayton Dubilier and SSA Investments (the Arora family investment vehicle) have dumped a combined 125m shares (12.5% of B&amp;M\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total issued share capital) at a price of 363.4p, raising aggregate gross sale proceeds of \u00c2\u00a3454m... [Last week] Simon Arora, the CEO, gushed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153B&amp;M has never been in better shape\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and, to be fair, the big share placing seems to have gone very well. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: The FTSE 100 took off on the open this morning, shooting up to hit 7,599 for another record intra-day high as the UK market took its cue from the US and a buoyant mood for equities. Investors are ignoring any worries about what Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paris climate deal shakeout might mean in the short term and instead focusing on renewed reflationary pressures. Whatever risk premium we have around the general election, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not bothering equity investors too greatly. We have a sea of green in European indices with global stocks at record highs as June starts on a very upbeat note for riskier assets. After a slight pullback on the whole Trump reflation trade in May that saw defensives in favour, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s risk-on again. The US market set the tone this morning in Europe with the S&amp;P 500 closing on Thursday at a fresh record high. A solid batch of PMI readings kicked off June in fine style, while we have a situation where central banks remain highly accommodative despite the growth pickup as inflation remains subdued. While we have this scenario it looks very favourable for equities. On the FTSE, shares are rising as part of a global cyclical turnaround and sterling weakness is increasingly less important. The pound is still an important factor in the UK market in terms of overall valuations [but] the FTSE [is] no longer simply reacting to cable; going up with the pound falls and dropping when the pound rises. As has been noted, the more domestically-focused FTSE 250 is also notching record highs, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not enough to explain away the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continued strength by saying it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down to sterling.

Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index has hit a new peak, touching 7598.99 and within a whisker of 7600.

The FTSE 250 is also at a new record, reaching 20,071. Meanwhile the US futures are predicting a 73 point opening on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which could also see it in unprecedented territory. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The markets are looking pretty buoyant this morning, boosted by the prospect of this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm jobs report. The FTSE appears to be gunning for a new record this Friday, surging more than half a percent after the bell to sit just a handful of points below 7600. As for the pound, with no new polls \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to cause it to panic it got off to a rather dull start, dipping 0.1% to 0.2% against both the dollar and the euro. Sterling has tended to do better in the afternoon than the morning this week, once the early political news has been fully digested. Today, however, sees the latest US jobs report, and with the Fed looking to raise rates this month a strong non-farm figure could cause cable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial losses to widen. The Eurozone was just as jubilant this Friday, with the DAX and CAC both rising around 1%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pushed the German index back to 12800, and within 50 or so points of a new all-time high, while the CAC is at its best price for a week and a half. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually much for the Eurozone to work with this morning, the indices seemingly surging on the prospect of a 21200-crossing open for the Dow Jones later today. Boosted by the gains on Wall Street and in Asia, European markets have made a good start to the day. The FTSE 100 is currently up around 0.4% at 7580, within 6 points of the record high achieved earlier this week. Meanwhile France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.6%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax 0.7%, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB has risen 0.48% and the Euro Stoxx index is 0.2% better. And the world stocks index has also hit a new high: Markets appear to be shrugging off the controversial decision by Donald Trump to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement, instead concentrating on the forthcoming US jobs figures. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: As global leaders decried Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to withdraw the US from the Paris Climate Accord, investors were quietly pumping funds into the stock market. Dumping the climate deal hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really hurt of hindered investor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appetite for risk... Surprisingly good private payrolls data has increased confidence in the US economy ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report. The Fed looks set to raise rate this month irrespective of recent data, so investors are glad to see an economy that can withstand it. Expectations are for 185k US jobs to have been created in May, down slightly from the 211k in April with earnings growth of 0.2% m/m. In Asia, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei index breached 20k for first time since 2015, matching similar gains in Hong Kong and Australia. European investors look to be taking heart from optimism in Asia and the strong finish on Wall Street with all the major indices set for a higher open. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little quiet on the corporate and economic calendar so it may end up being a wait-and-see type day before the US jobs report. Our live blog on the fallout from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s climate decision can be found here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big day for the US economy with the latest monthly jobs and wages figures due later. Analysts are expecting another bumper outcome after April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than expected number, which would probably put the seal on a US rate rise this month. Originally, forecasts were for an increase of around 180,000 in non-farm payroll jobs. But with Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast-beating private sector job numbers from payroll specialist ADP, that could easily prove conservative. The jobs data helped push US markets sharply higher, with both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hitting new peaks. Meanwhile in Asia, the Nikkei 225 added 1.6%, closing above 20,000 for the first time since 2015. Europe is also forecast to make a strong start, with the FTSE 100 on track for a new intra-day peak: Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: European markets look set for a strong open this morning having started on the front foot yesterday, helped by a continuation of the recent theme of an improving economic environment, as further improvements in economic data fuelled a positive start to the month, which was carried on in the US, after Europe had closed. This rise in US markets saw yet more record closes across the board, after a singularly upbeat ADP payrolls report showed that the US economy added 253k jobs in May, well above expectations of 177k. This bumper number more or less confirmed the prospect of a June rate rise, with the potential for further moves later in the year, maybe in September, if the economy holds up. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number also raises the bar for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official payrolls report which is expected to come in at around the 180k level, down from 211k in April. This seems rather conservative given the decent ADP number, and the fairly close correlation between the two we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen over the last few months, the March outlier notwithstanding. This would suggest that a number in excess of 200k for non-farm payrolls would be more in line with expectations... Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s average hourly earnings data for May is [also] likely to be closely scrutinised with a modest increase from 2.5% to 2.6% expected. Before all that, come UK construction figures. In April the construction PMI was lifted by civil engineering and housebuilding and came in at 53.1. This time round it is expected to slip to around 52.7, but this is still a reasonable performance following Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive manufacturing figures. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda (all times BST): 9.30: Markit/CIPS UK construction PMI 10.00: Eurozone producer prices index 13.30: US non-farm payrolls data We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events throughout the day.",

Strength in the dollar - which makes oil less affordable for international buyers - seems to be outweighing the prospect of supply shortages following the Gulf dispute. In any case, Qatar is not a major producer of oil, rather it specialises in liquefied natural gas (LNG). Clement Thibault, senior market analyst at Investing.com, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>According to the latest data, five of the top 10 oil producers in the world are Gulf countries (Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, UAE, Kuwait). Together, they are responsible for over 24 million barrels of crude a day, or over two and a half times the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crude production.</p> <p>However, Qatar is a minor player among the OPEC big boys. Its strength is aligned with LNG. Indeed, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest LNG producer, supplying almost 30% of global production. By land, Qatar is completely blocked by Saudi Arabia. By sea, its exporting tankers have to pass through the Strait of Hormuz, situated between Iran and the UAE, putting it in a precarious situation any way it turns. Asian customers such as Japan, India, and South Korea would be the most affected by a disruption in NG service, since they are the major importers of Qatari gas...</p> <p>Though we aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raising any alarms yet, we believe this is a situation worth monitoring carefully. The Middle East is after all an energy powerhouse, but also rather notorious for a lack of political stability. Any geo political incident coming out of this region could have worldwide energy implications.</p> </blockquote> <p>Despite Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minor role in oil, the dispute has raised new fears that the recent Opec deal to cut production could run into trouble.</p> <p>Brent crude is currently down 1% at $49.44 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 0.9% lower at $47.23.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-06-05T13:42:45.110Z\">at 2.42pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-593553b0e4b00493c82798cf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-05T12:51:29.203Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>After a rough session of heavy losses, the Qatar stock market has closed down 7.27%</strong>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/anca_cighi/status/871690577695436800\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Qatar Stock Exchange has closed down 7.27 per cent.

                "bodyText":"Stock markets made a downbeat start to an important week, which sees the UK election, the latest meeting of the European Central Bank, and the testimony of former FBI director James Comey on Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged links with Russia. Markets were also unsettled by volatility in sterling, reacting to the latest opinion polls, as well as the terror attack in London. And the diplomatic crisis in the Gulf, which sparked a rise then fall in the oil price, added to the uncertainty. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: Markets softened at the beginning of what could be a game-changer of a week in politics and monetary policy. Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s soft US jobs report, another terror attack in London in the run up to the UK election and volatile oil prices all played a role in the downbeat tone. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 21.87 points or 0.29% at 7525.76 German market shut for public holiday France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC closed 0.66% lower at 5307.89 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.99% to 20,721.04 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.19% at 10,884.7 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.6% to 786.57 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just 2 points or 0.01%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup meeting over Greece, some positive noises from the IMF. A report in Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Handelsblatt (\u00c2\u00a3) says: The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, is willing to participate in a Greek bailout and give European creditors more time to settle an ongoing dispute over debt relief, she told Handelsblatt in an exclusive interview. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the creditors are not yet at that stage where they can agree on and respect our assumptions, if it takes them more time to get there, we can acknowledge that and give them a bit more time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on how the diplomatic crisis in the Gulf is affecting Qatar. Kareem Shaheen writes: The tiny Gulf state of Qatar has been literally and figuratively isolated by the escalating row with its Arab neighbours, with land, sea and air routes closed off in an unprecedented crisis in the Arabian peninsula that threatens longstanding trade deals. The closure of the only land route into Qatar as well as the airspaces of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain in effect established a blockade on Doha, which relies almost entirely on imports to feed its population. It will damage the prospects of a recovery for Doha\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national carrier, Qatar Airways, amid a slowdown caused by the US administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ban on electronic devices in the cabins of aircraft flying from the Middle East, and will raise questions about the future of al-Jazeera, the flagship television network established by the Gulf kingdom and which has been at the centre of diplomatic rows with the rest of the region. Along with the block on re-exports from Dubai to Qatar, together the measures could even affect the monarchy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preparations for the football World Cup it is due to host in 2022. The full story is here: The pound is continuing its recent volatility, something which is likely to continue this week in the run up to the UK election as various polls emerge but with little in the way of consistency. Sterling is currently up 0.3% against the dollar at $1.2929 and 0.6% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1491. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The pound remained the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main mover, seemingly still dining out on this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Guardian/ICM poll. Sterling gradually widened its growth, taking 0.3% off the dollar and pushing 0.6% higher against the euro; in reality, however, this has done little to change the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standing. Cable still has a bit to go before it has clawed back all of the losses it suffered this time last week, while the pound has barely escaped its 7 week lows against the euro....Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather dreary, pound-heavy trading is likely the template for the rest of the week, as there is nothing in the run-up to the election that can topple it from its dominant perch. In fact, all of the week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s points of interest come on Thursday: alongside the UK vote there is the month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB press conference and, perhaps most excitingly, the reappearance of former FBI chief James Comey for his testimony in front of the Senate intelligence committee. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Despite a weakening in [the UK] services PMI for May to 53.8 from 55.8 in April the pound has held up rather well in the wake of the weekend terror attacks. If financial markets are nervous about Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election and a weakening of economic activity they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to be showing it, with opinion polls still showing divergent results. YouGov appear to be doubling down on their recent survey by suggesting that the Conservatives will fall short of a majority by 21 seats, while the latest ICM poll shows a lead of 11 points. Markets appear to be taking the view that the YouGov poll is an outlier and unreliable which when you look at the margin for error on it, and the balance of probabilities right now, seems a sensible conclusion. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more detail from the survey itself: Here are some of the comments from the respondents to the ISM survey: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lumber tariff effects are beginning to show up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Construction) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business is progressing steadily. No real issues or adjustments to affect annual goals/efforts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Finance &amp; Insurance) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153General feeling is caution. Too much uncertainty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Health Care &amp; Social Assistance) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Seeing an uptick in the overall activity within the oil and gas sector, which typically will cause a trickle-down effect on the majority of businesses.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Mining) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Typical transition month in terms of fresh produce and other food related categories. End of spring items and beginning of summer. Gapping of some items. Beef is increasing in price, especially grilling meat cuts. I anticipate this to increase to over $1 per pound on some items as we approach the 4th of July holiday.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Accommodation &amp; Food Services) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Continuing to feel [the] effect of overheated commercial construction market \u00e2\u20ac\u201d few bidders, higher prices. Scarce construction labor seems to be the driver.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Public Administration) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business outlook continues to be steady and meeting original projects, but some ups and downs in successive months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Professional, Scientific &amp; Technical Services) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overall, business conditions the past month were flat as compared with several months of growth. While levels haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t decreased, it may be that overall conditions have reached a high watermark.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Retail Trade) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Strong market conditions bring a renewed confidence.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Transportation &amp; Warehousing) The second service sector survey is not only lower than expected, but also lower than the previous month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure. The ISM non-manufacturing PMI fell from 57.5 in April to 56.9 last month, just below the expected level of 57. Meanwhile US factory orders fell for the first time in five months, down 0.2% in April compared to a 1% rise in March. The March figure was revised up from the previous 0.5% increase. The surveys show that the US economy is enjoying steady if unspectacular growth, said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit: Although service sector business activity picked up in May, the PMI surveys for manufacturing and services collectively indicate only a modest pace of economic growth so far in the second quarter. Historical comparisons with GDP indicate the PMI is signalling second quarter GDP growth of just over 2%, suggesting there may be some downside risks to IHS Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current forecast of a GDP growth rebound to just over 3% in the second quarter. However, the key message from the PMI is that the economy is enjoying steady, albeit unspectacular, growth, and that the pace of expansion has been slowly lifting higher in recent months. Hiring meanwhile remains on a firm footing, with the survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment indicators running at levels consistent with around 160,000 jobs added to the economy in May. In another sign of the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s underlying steady expansion, average prices charged for goods and services is running at the second highest in almost two years, indicating that rising demand is helping restore some pricing power. The first of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two US economic surveys has shown a month on month improvement in the service sector, albeit not as much as earlier expected. The final Markit services PMI reading for May came in at 53.6, up from 53.1 in April but lower than the initial estimate of 54. It was still the highest level since February. It was a similar picture for the composite index - services and manufacturing together - which rose from 53.2 in April to 53.6, lower than the first reading of 53.9. Ahead of the latest service sector surveys (from Markit and ISM), US markets have indeed slipped back at the open. After hitting another record high on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 17 points of 0.08%. while the S&amp;P 500 opened down a similar amount and the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.01%. Wall Street is about to open and the forecast is for a slight fall in initial trading: Meanwhile the oil price has lost its early gains, which were made on the back of the Qatar news. Strength in the dollar - which makes oil less affordable for international buyers - seems to be outweighing the prospect of supply shortages following the Gulf dispute. In any case, Qatar is not a major producer of oil, rather it specialises in liquefied natural gas (LNG). Clement Thibault, senior market analyst at Investing.com, said: According to the latest data, five of the top 10 oil producers in the world are Gulf countries (Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, UAE, Kuwait). Together, they are responsible for over 24 million barrels of crude a day, or over two and a half times the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crude production. However, Qatar is a minor player among the OPEC big boys. Its strength is aligned with LNG. Indeed, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest LNG producer, supplying almost 30% of global production. By land, Qatar is completely blocked by Saudi Arabia. By sea, its exporting tankers have to pass through the Strait of Hormuz, situated between Iran and the UAE, putting it in a precarious situation any way it turns. Asian customers such as Japan, India, and South Korea would be the most affected by a disruption in NG service, since they are the major importers of Qatari gas... Though we aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raising any alarms yet, we believe this is a situation worth monitoring carefully. The Middle East is after all an energy powerhouse, but also rather notorious for a lack of political stability. Any geo political incident coming out of this region could have worldwide energy implications. Despite Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minor role in oil, the dispute has raised new fears that the recent Opec deal to cut production could run into trouble. Brent crude is currently down 1% at $49.44 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 0.9% lower at $47.23. After a rough session of heavy losses, the Qatar stock market has closed down 7.27%. After a fairly quiet morning in London, the FTSE 100 has dropped by 22 points to 0.3% to 7525. Mining stocks such as Antofagasta (-2.7%) and BHP Billiton (-1.8%) are among the fallers, tracking a 1% drop in the copper price. The slowdown in UK service sector growth last month hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spooked the markets, though, as the pound is still back above $1.29 today. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains also ignored an unexpectedly weak services PMI. The figure fell from 55.8 to 53.8 month-on-month, the slowdown due to the dual pressures of rising inflation and pre-election jitters. The FTSE ended up bearing the brunt of the bad news, falling 0.3%; the index wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped by its mining stocks, which dropped between 1.5% and 2.5% thanks to copper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own 1% decline. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much action in Europe, where some markets are closed for the Whit Monday holidays. So City traders are getting on with business, putting last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s terrorist attacks at London Bridge (south of the Square Mile) behind them. Yesterday, it emerged that Sunday Express business editor Geoff Ho has been injured after stepping in after a bouncer was attacked during Saturday night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s atrocities. Sunday Express editor Martin Townsend summed up the mood, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Geoff Ho is an absolutely first class reporter and a fine and decent man and our thoughts are with him and his family at this time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are all hoping and praying for a speedy recovery.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And the good news is that Geoff has been tweeting from his hospital bed today. Reuters is reporting that some Egyptian banks have suspended links with their counterparts in Qatar: Get set for the working day - we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll guide you to the all the business stories you need to read in one really useful email. Click here to sign up. Some photos from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Qatar stock market have arrived, showing the scene of the biggest selloff since the financial crisis. Every blue-chip share on the Qatar stock market has fallen sharply this morning. Many stocks - including property and energy companies - have slumped by 10%, which is the maximum daily move allowed by regulators. Even the best-performing stock on the QSI index is down 6%, as investors are spooked by the sudden freeze in relations with other Gulf states. The Qatar index is currently down by 7.5%, hitting its worst level since early 2016. The pound has inched back over $1.29 this morning, up around 0.2%. Sterling rose after a new Guardian/ISM poll showed the Conservatives with an 11-point lead ahead of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. However, YouGov are painting a more serious picture for the Tories. Their new election model is now showing that the Conservatives would win 305 seats, which is 21 short of an overall majority. The diplomatic crisis between Qatar and its neighbours could have serious political and economic implications, says Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group in a new research note. MUFG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ehsan Khoman explains: 1) This time the political tensions are different \u00e2\u20ac\u201c increased regional geopolitical instability. Whilst the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] has been hit by severe internal turmoil in the recent past (revival of memories of a similar spat in May 2014, when Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain united against Qatar for its support of the Muslim Brotherhood and severed ties for 8 months), the current wave is particularly worrying. Indeed, a divided GCC will bring further instability in the region at a time of full confrontation between the Saudi-led alliance and Iran. A possible thaw between Iran and Qatar could, in theory, lead to a confrontation with the US, as the latter has an immense military base currently in the GCC (most notably in Qatar where the country hosts the largest US military presence in the GCC \u00e2\u20ac\u201c CENTCOM Forward Headquarters). Thus, a rapprochement between Iran and Qatar would be a vast security risk to the US military. 2) Yemen war. Saudi Arabia has announced this morning that it has pulled all Qatari troops from the ongoing Yemen war. 3) Oil and OPEC agreement risks. A full-fledged confrontation will, without any doubt, put pressure on the current compliance rate of OPEC members to the adherence of the 9 month agreement to cut production. Whilst Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge was only to cut 30,000 barrels to 628,000 barrels (as part of the OPEC agreement), there are potential risks of Qatar leaving OPEC which could significantly impact oil prices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Brent prices are up 1.7% today to USD50.7/b. 4) Transportations industry (airlines, shipping and road freight) risks. The closure of land/sea/air contacts could have surmountable implications for the airlines, shipping and road freight industries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Etihad Airways, said it would suspend flights to and from Qatar beginning Tuesday morning (the last flight from Abu Dhabi to Doha will depart at 02:45 local time on Tuesday, the airline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman said in an email). There have been no other announcement by the major airline carriers or corporates have been made thus far. Yemen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state news agency is reporting that it has also cut ties with Qatar. Yemen also supports the decision to remove Qatari soldiers from the Saudi-led coalition in the country. That group is fighting Houthi forces supported by Iran (a conflict which has turned Yemen into a humanitarian crisis, with millions of people starving, and thousands of cholera cases recorded) Back in the Gulf, the cost of insuring Qatari sovereign debt against default has hit a two-month high this morning. That underlines concerns that Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE have all cut ties with Qatar today. Reuters has the details: Five-year credit default swaps for Qatar rose 2 basis points(bps) from Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to 61 bps, the highest level since early April. The coordinated move from the Gulf states dramatically escalates a dispute over Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support of the Muslim Brotherhood, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest Islamist movement, and adds accusations that Doha even backs the agenda of regional arch-rival Iran. Ratings agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s said the rift could have an impact onQatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating if trade and capital flows are disrupted. Qatar sovereign dollar bonds also fell. Breaking: Growth across Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector slowed last month, which could reinforce worries about the state of the UK economy. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK service sector PMI has fallen to 53.8 for May, down from April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 55.8 (a four-month high). This takes the PMI closer to to the 50 point mark that separates expansion from contraction. Companies reported that new business growth slowed, with some clients holding off big decisions until the general election is over. The squeeze on household incomes, due to rising inflation, is another factor. It shows that the sector is vulnerable to political uncertainty, says Duncan Brock, director of customer relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. He explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The powerhouse driving UK GDP lost some of its force this month, with the weakest performance since February, revealing a fragility out of sync with the other sectors which were fired up and running. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was clear that slower new business growth let the side down, impacted by caution around the General Election, and a tightening of purse strings. Not even stiff competition between businesses absorbing higher prices for food and the effects of the National Living Wage, could tempt consumers to spend. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Disappointingly, businesses also delayed crucial buying decisions on the back of lingering doubts around the strength of the economy which in turn affected job creation. UK car sales have fallen, and this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK general election may be partly to blame. The number of new car registered in May fell by 8% year-on-year to 186,265, according to the latest figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the second monthly fall in a row. Registrations plunged by 18% in April, after a rush to buy cars in March before new tax changes on vehicle emissions came into effect. Mike Hawes, head of SMMT, warns that sales will keep falling this month too. He believes that the political uncertainty may have put some buyers off: We expected demand in the new car market to remain negative in May due to the pull-forward to March \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which was an all-time record month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c resulting from VED reform. Added to this, the general election was always likely to give many pause for thought and affect purchasing patterns in the short term. Although demand has fallen, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to remember that the market remains at a very high level and, with a raft of new models packed with the latest low emission and connected technology coming to market this summer, we expect the market to remain strong over the year. Breaking: The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector has kept growing at its fastest pace since the financial crisis. And this may mean that the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is entering a real growth spurt. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomposite PMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which measures activity at service sector and manufacturing firms, has just come in at 56.8 for May, matching April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading. Any figure over 50 shows growth, and this is the highest reading since 2011. Firms reported that they were the more optimistic about their prospects, as new orders rose strongly. They also took on new workers, at one of the fastest rates in the last 10 years. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says these PMI surveys suggest the eurozone is speeding up: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The final PMI readings add to mounting evidence that the eurozone is enjoying a strong second quarter, consistent with GDP rising at a 0.7% rate. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Encouragingly, both the hard data and the surveys are revealing a broad-based upturn. So far in the second quarter the PMI surveys are running at levels indicative of 0.7% GDP growth in France and Germany, with nearly 1% being signalled for Spain and 0.5% in Italy. Another solid performance from Germany... France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector firms racked up decent growth in May: Back in the eurozone, Spain has posted strong service sector growth last month. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Spanish services PMI has come in at 57.3 in May, down on April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 57.8, but still showing a sharp increase in activity. The Gulf is now facing its most serious diplomatic crisis in years, says my colleagues Ben Doherty and Patrick Wintour. They explain: Qatar has long faced criticism from its Arab neighbors over its support of Islamists. The chief worry among them is the Muslim Brotherhood, a Sunni Islamist political group outlawed by both Saudi Arabia and the UAE as it challenges the nations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hereditary rule. Gulf countries led by Saudi Arabia fell out with Qatar over its backing of then-Egyptian president Mohammed Morsi, a Brotherhood member. In March 2014, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain recalled their ambassadors from Qatar over the rift. Eight months later, they returned their ambassadors as Qatar forced some Brotherhood members to leave the country and quieted others. However, the 2014 crisis did not see a land and sea blockade as threatened now. In the time since, Qatar repeatedly and strongly denied it funds extremist groups. However, it remains a key financial patron of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip and has been the home of exiled Hamas official Khaled Mashaal since 2012. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is suffering its biggest slump since the financial crisis, with shares now down 8%. Several airlines, including Etihad and Emirates, have announced they are suspending flights to Qatar. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[There are] rising tensions in the Gulf, as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and U.A.E. sever ties with Qatar over its alleged sponsorship of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcterrorism\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, only serving to raise the temperature on the geo-political heat map.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Qatar has hit back at Saudi, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt, accusing them of lying over their decision to cut diplomatic ties today. In a statement, the Qatari foreign ministry says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The campaign of incitement is based on lies that had reached the level of complete fabrications.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains why crude prices have risen today: The price of oil could be on the verge of another recovery with political tensions between Saudi Arabia and Qatar a potential threat to supply out of the Strait of Hormuz. A wave of selling has swept through Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market at the start of trading, sending its benchmark index tumbling by 6%. The oil price has jumped this morning after a group of Gulf states cut diplomatic relations with Qatar. In a dramatic development Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain all announced early today they were severing ties with Doha and calling their diplomatic staff home. They accused the Qatar leadership of supporting terrorism in the region, and destabilising the Gulf, through its support for Islamist groups and its relations with Iran. Associated Press explains: Saudi Arabia said it took the decision to cut diplomatic ties due to Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153embrace of various terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at destabilizing the region\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd including the Muslim Brotherhood, al-Qaida, the Islamic State group and groups supported by Iran in the kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restive eastern province of Qatif. Egypt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Foreign Ministry accused Qatar of taking an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153antagonist approach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd toward Egypt and said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all attempts to stop it from supporting terrorist groups failed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The tiny island nation of Bahrain blamed Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153media incitement, support for armed terrorist activities and funding linked to Iranian groups to carry out sabotage and spreading chaos in Bahrain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for its decision. The four countries are suspending air and sea travel, and Saudi Arabia is also cutting its road crossings. As this map from Bloomberg shows, this would block Qatar from accessing the rest of the region by land. Energy traders were quick to respond to the escalating crisis, sending Brent crude up by $1 per barrel to $50.42. Qatar is the biggest supplier of liquefied natural gas (LNG), and those supplies could potentially be disrupted if this row deepens. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector has posted its fastest growth in four months, in an encouraging signal following some weak factory data last week. Data firm Caixin reports that Chinese firms were boosted by a jump in new business last month, as client demand strengthened. This sent the Chinese services PMI up to 52.8 in May, up from 51.5 in April, which is the highest reading since January. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a boost to the region, especially as China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector shrank in May. While service sector companies took on more workers, manufacturing firms continued to pare back staff numbers, at the fastest rate since last September. Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The improvement in the services sector bolstered the Chinese economy in May. However, the rapid deterioration in the manufacturing industry is worrying. We need to closely monitor whether the diverging trends in manufacturing and services will widen further.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors are bracing for a barrage of data showing how service sector companies in Europe and America performed last month. Economists expect to see another strong performance from eurozone firms; growth is expected to remain around its highest level since the financial crisis. The UK services report will also be closely scrutinised, for signs that political uncertainty is hurting the economy. The City expects that growth slowed last month, taking the UK services PMI down to 55.0, from 55.7. CMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Hewson reminds us that last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory data was encouraging, so perhaps today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report will bolster optimism. On the data front the picture was more positive with manufacturing PMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continuing to be resilient in May, with the hope that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services PMI numbers will be similarly good. Elsewhere, the oil price is climbing after a group of Gulf countries cut ties with Qatar, saying it was supporting terrorism in the region. And the pound could be jittery, with just three days until the UK general election. New figures showing how many new cars were sold last month.

In the absence of such protections, you can end up with cases like ENRC, the Kazakhstan mining outfit that was briefly a member of the FTSE 100 index, lost a packet for its shareholders, and was dubbed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more Soviet than City\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by one non-executive director as he was ousted. Aramco may say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s made of better stuff and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who knows? \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it may even be willing to defy expectations and reveal audited details of its oil reserves as Shell, BP and others must do. But the 25% qualifying criterion for a premium listing should still apply, even when a 5% slice could be worth $100bn. It is there for a good reason. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hope the intervention of the Investment Association will knock some sense into the politicians, bankers and regulators who seem dazzled by the prospect of Saudi riches. The last time the City got into the game of watering down listing requirements to drum up business from foreign governments and oligarchs, the story ended badly. Let Aramco list in London if it wishes, but Saudi ministers should be told they must play by the rules as they find them.",

So most stock markets have fallen back again, while the dollar has hit a seven month low. Oil has recovered some of its early losses after the latest tensions in the Middle East, with Brent crude edging up 0.2% to $49.57 a barrel having fallen as low as $49.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 has ended virtually flat, outperforming the bulk of its European peers, as the latest polls show a Conservative lead. The FTSE 250, hit by weakness in sterling, has lost 1%, its worst daily performance since the middle of April. The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 edged down 0.81 points or 0.01% at 7524.95</strong></li> <li><strong>The FTSE 250 fell 1.08% to 19,654.84</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.04% to 12,690.12</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.73% at 5269.22</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished up 0.19% at 20,760.01</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.05% at 10,879.7</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market dropped 1.15% to 777.53</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 21 points or 0.1%.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day.

Marchel Alexandrovich, senior European economist at Jefferies, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On Thursday the ECB is widely expected to change some of the language around its forward guidance, but the implications of these changes are likely to be downplayed by Mario Draghi during the Q&amp;A session.</p> <p>In the last two meetings the ECB hinted that a further cut to the depo rate was unlikely \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and we expect this position to be formally confirmed in the Monetary Policy Decisions statement. However, the shift to a more neutral policy stance with regards to interest rates will not affect the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other key messages: the depo rate will remain at present level until after QE comes to an end; and QE will carry on until the end of the year \u00e2\u20ac\u0153or beyond, if necessary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>All in all, the take-away is expected to be that while the ECB is taking a small step toward eventual policy normalisation, this process is not on a predetermined path. For the markets, Draghi is unlikely to provide any useful guidance in terms of when tapering may start, or what form it may take.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5acae04e7749d6fda38f88309732f6c55f0cd55f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5acae04e7749d6fda38f88309732f6c55f0cd55f/0_148_3080_1849/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Draghi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Draghi</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5936c681e4b00493c8279f62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-06T15:13:33.943Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Reuters take on the US job openings figures:</p> <blockquote> <p>U.S. job openings surged to a record high in April while hiring slowed, suggesting a recent moderation in job growth was the result of employers having difficulties finding qualified workers.</p> <p>The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released by the Labor Department on Tuesday showed there were 6.0 million job openings on the last day of business in April, an increase of 259,000 from March.

Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There has been a clear shift into haven trades to protect against any fireworks following key events on Thursday. Brits heading to the polls, central bankers deciding interest rates in Europe and testimony from FBI Director Comey all pose a threat. With three big events clustered in one day, it only takes one to go way to set things off.</p> <p>Stocks mostly retreated with a tendency for more defensive areas of the market to outperform. Utilities, a typical haven when staying invested in stocks rose over half-a-percent on the Euro Stoxx 600 while most other sectors were lower...</p> <p>A 1% decline in the FTSE 250 while FTSE 100 was essentially flat on the day was notable. Investors appear to be shunning UK domestic shares before the election. Within the broader FTSE 350, retail shares were biggest decliners, which are typically closely tied to the health of the British economy. While a Labour victory remains a distant outlier, polls would indicate a hung parliament is possible. The fear is that with the country entering at least two-years of economic uncertainty because of the Brexit negotiations, higher personal and business taxes under a new government could tip the economy over the edge.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5936bb8be4b0bdd87e2f3e75\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-06T14:33:18.889Z\">3.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nick_bunker/status/872097945117655041\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JOLTS?src=hash\">#JOLTS</a> Graph time!

The Job Openings and Labor Turnovers Survey (JOLTS) gives another snapshot of the state of the employment market, with indications on job openings, hiring, layoffs and the quit rate. The latter in particular, if it is increasing, shows a more optimistic market, if employees feel confident enough to leave their jobs in search of new ones.

                "bodyText":"Investors are being rather cautious ahead of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK election, ECB meeting and the testimony by ex-FBI boss James Comey. So most stock markets have fallen back again, while the dollar has hit a seven month low. Oil has recovered some of its early losses after the latest tensions in the Middle East, with Brent crude edging up 0.2% to $49.57 a barrel having fallen as low as $49. The FTSE 100 has ended virtually flat, outperforming the bulk of its European peers, as the latest polls show a Conservative lead. The FTSE 250, hit by weakness in sterling, has lost 1%, its worst daily performance since the middle of April. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 edged down 0.81 points or 0.01% at 7524.95 The FTSE 250 fell 1.08% to 19,654.84 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.04% to 12,690.12 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.73% at 5269.22 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished up 0.19% at 20,760.01 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.05% at 10,879.7 In Greece, the Athens market dropped 1.15% to 777.53 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 21 points or 0.1%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. One of the big events on Thursday is the latest meeting of the European Central Bank, with president Mario Draghi expected to make a minor shift in the tone of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message. Marchel Alexandrovich, senior European economist at Jefferies, said: On Thursday the ECB is widely expected to change some of the language around its forward guidance, but the implications of these changes are likely to be downplayed by Mario Draghi during the Q&amp;A session. In the last two meetings the ECB hinted that a further cut to the depo rate was unlikely \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and we expect this position to be formally confirmed in the Monetary Policy Decisions statement. However, the shift to a more neutral policy stance with regards to interest rates will not affect the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other key messages: the depo rate will remain at present level until after QE comes to an end; and QE will carry on until the end of the year \u00e2\u20ac\u0153or beyond, if necessary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. All in all, the take-away is expected to be that while the ECB is taking a small step toward eventual policy normalisation, this process is not on a predetermined path. For the markets, Draghi is unlikely to provide any useful guidance in terms of when tapering may start, or what form it may take. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Reuters take on the US job openings figures: U.S. job openings surged to a record high in April while hiring slowed, suggesting a recent moderation in job growth was the result of employers having difficulties finding qualified workers. The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released by the Labor Department on Tuesday showed there were 6.0 million job openings on the last day of business in April, an increase of 259,000 from March. Hiring decreased by 253,000 jobs to 5.1 million. Investors are shying away from risk at the moment, with precious metals and defensive shares reaping the benefit. Gold is at its highest level in seven weeks, up $14 to $1293 an ounce, while silver is up from $17.54 to $17.68 an ounce. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: There has been a clear shift into haven trades to protect against any fireworks following key events on Thursday. Brits heading to the polls, central bankers deciding interest rates in Europe and testimony from FBI Director Comey all pose a threat. With three big events clustered in one day, it only takes one to go way to set things off. Stocks mostly retreated with a tendency for more defensive areas of the market to outperform. Utilities, a typical haven when staying invested in stocks rose over half-a-percent on the Euro Stoxx 600 while most other sectors were lower... A 1% decline in the FTSE 250 while FTSE 100 was essentially flat on the day was notable. Investors appear to be shunning UK domestic shares before the election. Within the broader FTSE 350, retail shares were biggest decliners, which are typically closely tied to the health of the British economy. While a Labour victory remains a distant outlier, polls would indicate a hung parliament is possible. The fear is that with the country entering at least two-years of economic uncertainty because of the Brexit negotiations, higher personal and business taxes under a new government could tip the economy over the edge. And here are the job openings figures, and they have come in at a record high. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, job openings rose from a revised 5.78m in March to 6m in April, the highest level since the survey began. But hires were weaker, falling from 5.3m to 5m while the quits rate edged marginally lower from 2.2% to 2.1%. Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US non-farm payroll numbers were much weaker than expected, but analysts agreed they were unlikely to prevent the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates next week. But some observers suggested they could slow down the pace of any further rises. Another set of US jobs data is due shortly, and it is one that Fed chair Janet Yellen is known to pay particular attention too, even if it is not as well followed as the non-farm numbers. The Job Openings and Labor Turnovers Survey (JOLTS) gives another snapshot of the state of the employment market, with indications on job openings, hiring, layoffs and the quit rate. The latter in particular, if it is increasing, shows a more optimistic market, if employees feel confident enough to leave their jobs in search of new ones. However David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, said the job opening figure could see a decline on last month: The expectation is for 5.65 million, and that compares with 5.74 million in March. This report will be of particular importance given the disappointing non-farm payroll figure last week. Ahead of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s triple whammy of the UK election, European Central Bank meeting and ex-FBI director James Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony, US markets are following the trend elsewhere and heading lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 57 points or 0.28% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.26% lower and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.22%. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is down 0.26%, the FTSE 250 has fallen 0.95%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 1% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is 0.8% lower. The weakness in the pound is a factor behind a drop in the FTSE 250. At one point, the mid-cap index was on track for its worst day since November although it has recovered from its worst levels. Even so, the index is down 0.9% and currently sitting at a near three week low as jitters about the UK election continue to unsettle investors. To be fair, the mid-cap index has been hitting new highs in recent days so the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall needs to be seen in that context. After a bright start to the morning, the British pound has taken a lurch lower. Sterling is now down 0.2% today at $1.2875, as traders worry about Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, says sterling is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coming under renewed pressure from polls showing the Conservative Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s out-sized lead dwindling.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Those polls have left investors scratching their heads. Last night, Survation released a phone poll giving the Conservatives a lead of just 1 percentage point. Other pollsters have reported a much wider gap, with ICM putting Theresa May 11 points ahead. And then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s YouGov, whose controversial daily seat projections suggests the Conservatives will fall short of a majority. Back in the UK, one of the bankers at the centre of the 2008 financial crisis is being spared from giving evidence about his actions in court. A group of Royal Bank of Scotland shareholders have settled their claim that they were misled when they backed its rights issue in 2008, shortly before its collapse. That means that Fred Goodwin, who lost his knighthood after RBS was nationalised, will not have to answer questions about the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demise. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: The South African rand has slumped to 12.875 to the US dollar, down from 12.7 yesterday. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM suspects it could fall further: Sentiment towards the South African economy took a hit on Tuesday following reports of the nation falling into a technical recession for the first time since 2009. The latest GDP data released by Stats SA showed that the economy declined by 0.7% in the first quarter of 2017 with all industries excluding agriculture and mining contracting. Despite this decline, there remains some optimism over GDP growth finding some ground and rebounding to 0.7% in the second quarter of 2017 amid the stabilizing economic data seen in recent months. The South African Rand weakened following this news with the USDZAR edging towards 12.9000. Repeated weakness from the Rand should encourage a further incline towards 13.0000 on the USDZAR. South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide into recession piles more pressure on president Jacob Zuma. Zuma was already feeling the heat over his links to the wealthy and influential Gupta family. Last week, leaked emails purported to show that the Gupta family had used their friendship with Zuma to advance their business interests. Zuma had previously repeatedly denied allegations that the Guptas had unfairly won state contracts, and even influenced the choice of government ministers. Magda Wierzycka, CEO of financial services group Sygnia, says South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaders need to focus on fixing its economy: The full South African GDP report is online here. This neat graphic sums it up: Here are the key points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s South African growth report. In the first quarter of 2017, both the secondary and tertiary sectors recorded negative growth rates. Trade growth shrank by 5.9% and manufacturing by 3,7%. On the positive side, the agriculture and mining industries both contributed positively to growth in the first quarter, but not enough to avoid recession. Trade experienced production falls across the board, particularly in catering and accommodation and wholesale trade. Manufacturing found itself hamstrung by lower production levels in seven of its 10 divisions, most notably petroleum and chemical products (accounting for over 20% of the manufacturing industry). It was the third consecutive quarter of decline in total manufacturing. The tertiary sector, which is make up of finance, transport, trade, government and personal services, recorded its first quarter of decline since the second quarter of 2009, when South Africa was in a recession as well. Social media users in South Africa have been reacting to the news: Emerging markets analyst John Ashbourne confirms that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures are much worse then expected: Statistics South Africa deputy director general Joe de Beer has confirmed that the country is in recession, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can now pronounce that the economy is in recession,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The major industries that contracted in the economy were the trade and manufacturing sectors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bloomberg is reporting that South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has been dragged into recession by political infighting. That row saw the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s respected finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, sacked three months ago, alarming international investors. Bloomberg says: While rains are helping Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most-industrialized economy recover from a 2015 drought that was the worst since records started more than a century earlier, political uncertainty has hampered implementing reforms aimed at boosting growth. President Jacob Zuma changed his cabinet and fired Pravin Gordhan as finance minister in March, a move that saw the nation lose its investment-grade status with two ratings companies for the first time in 17 years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a risk that these contractions are not over and we could see another negative coming out in the second quarter of this year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Annabel Bishop, the chief economist at Investec Ltd., said by phone from Johannesburg. More here: S. Africa Has Second Recession in 8 Years as Economy Shrinks The South African rand has has slumped by 1% on the foreign exchange markets, as traders react with alarm to the disappointing GDP figures. Breaking: South Africa has fallen back into recession, for the second time in eight years. South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy shrank by 0.7% in the first quarter of 2017, figures just released show. That follows a 0.3% contraction in the final three months of 2016; two consecutive quarters of contraction mean a recession. The downturn was caused by a sharp contraction in trade. Manufacturing output also shrank, while government and household spending both fell too. Government agency Stats SA has tweeted the key points: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something of a shock. Economists had expected growth to rebound in the last quarter. Details and reaction to follow..... European markets have weakened this morning, dragged down by worries over America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and the diplomatic row between Qatar and its neighbours. Despite the jump in eurozone investor confidence, all the main indices are in the red today. Risk aversion is gripping the markets, driving money out of shares and into gold and the Japanese yen. Signs that the Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election race is tightening are also gripping the City. Joshua Mahony of IG explains: On a day which is largely devoid of major economic releases, the focus remains firmly fixed on Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blockbuster schedule and what it could mean for the future of politics either side of the Atlantic. UK election polls have been widely conflicting of late, reflecting the significant impact different methodology has upon results. Previously we have seen the pound fall with any mention of a hung parliament, yet with the pound rising gradually over recent weeks, it is clear that the markets continue to foresee a Tory majority. More eurozone data just landed, showing that retail sales crept higher in April. Retail spending across the eurozone rose by 0.1%, weaker than the 0.2% which the City expects. On an annual basis, spending was 2.5% higher than in April 2016. Breaking: Investors across the eurozone are at their most confident in a decade! The monthly gauge of investor morale produced by Sentix has risen to 28.4 points this month, up from 27.4 in May. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest reading since July 2007 (just before the credit crunch struck, triggering the financial crisis). Investors reported that the current economic situation has improved, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also more optimistic about future economic prospects. The data suggest that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery is gathering pace, Sentix says: The assessment of the current situation has climbed to the highest level since January 2008, underlining that it is not just ephemeral expectations, but increasingly hard data, that are driving the upswing in the eurozone. The cost of renting a home in the UK has fallen for the first time since the financial crisis, as the slowdown in the sector gathers pace. Average rents were down 0.3% in May, compared with a year earlier, at \u00c2\u00a3901, according to industry body HomeLet. This is the first annual decline since 2009, Rents in London are 3% lower than a year ago; they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also down in the North-East of England, the South-East, Yorkshire &amp; Humberside, and Scotland. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for tenants, but a painful time for landlords. HomeLet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Executive Officer, Martin Totty, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153May 2017 saw average rents nationally fall for the first time in eight years when the economy had suffered the shock of the financial crisis. HomeLet rental data suggests landlords are now facing a difficult balancing act between ensuring rents are affordable for tenants in a low real wage growth environment whilst covering their own rising costs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Financial advisor Claire Walsh reckons Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the EU is now rippling through the economy: The Japanese yen has hit a six-week high against the US dollar, as traders dash for safe-haven assets. Russian intrigue and the looming UK general election are to blame, says FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed: In currency markets, the dollar fell to lowest levels in six weeks against the Yen. This shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprising given the scale of event risks this Thursday, specifically UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election and former FBI director James Comey testifying before the US Senate intelligence committee about potential Russian interference in 2016\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US election. The weakening dollar is good news for the pound, which has gained 0.3% to $1.293 this morning. The US dollar has fallen to its lowest level since Donald Trump won the US presidential election. Investors appear to be increasingly anxious about the American economy, after learning yesterday that its services sector grew slower than expected in May. That followed Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s underwhelming US labour report, showing fewer jobs created than expected. Markets are also bracing for potential bombshells on Thursday, when former FBI chief James Comey is due to testify to Congress. That appearance could provide more problems for president Trump. As Reuters puts it: It has been reported that Comey plans to testify to conversations in which U.S. President Donald Trump pressured him to drop his investigation into former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn, who was fired for failing to disclose conversations with Russian officials. Online electrical chain AO World has added to the gloom in the retail sector this morning, with an underwhelming set of results. AO World, which sells domestic appliances as well as computers, has warned the City that sales will slow \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significantly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between April and June, its first quarter. It said the tough trading environment in the UK that hit sales in the second half of last year had continued into its new financial year. Its operating loss for the year to 31 March widened to \u00c2\u00a312m from \u00c2\u00a310.6m, as a \u00c2\u00a315.6m profit in the UK was offset by losses in Germany and the Netherlands. The company was founded in 2000 by John Roberts, a former kitchen salesman, who ran the business as chief executive until February. When it floated on the stock market three years ago the shares soared \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but soon dipped below the 285p offer price. They are now worth just 136p, after tumbling by 6% in early trading today. Brushing aside the difficulties, the new chief executive Steve Caunce said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We remain relentless in pursuing our goal to be the best electrical retailer in Europe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With two days to go until the UK general election, we have new evidence that parts of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy are slowing. UK retail sales shrank by 0.4% in May, according to the latest healthcheck from the British Retail Consortium. The report found that households are cutting back as rising inflation hits them in the pocket. Worryingly, people have less to spend on discretionary items once they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve covered essentials such as food. Online sales -- typically a big growth area -- also slowed. They only rose by 4.3% during the month, compared to over 13% a year ago. Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said many shoppers are now suffering from falling real wages, leaving them less to spend in the shops. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The impact of inflationary pressures on the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s purse continues to play out in this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures, with shoppers evidently spending more on food and drink than on non-food purchases. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With inflation continuing to rise and wage growth stagnating, consumers are starting to feel the pinch - although the highly competitive nature of the UK grocery market continues to play out in the consumer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favour. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Katie Allen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full report: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s set the tone for a rather subdued day, with many stock markets in Asia dipping and the US dollar coming under pressure. The agenda: Today we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out whether eurozone retail sales kept growing in April, and whether investors across Europe remain confident. 9:30am BST: Sentix\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone investor confidence survey for June 10:00am BST: Eurozone retail sales for April 3pm BST: US Jolts report, showing how many job vacancies were created in America last month",

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said there were also other factors at work in sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favour: The pound found some extra energy this afternoon, though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not quite clear whether the currency is being driven higher by home-grown news or events elsewhere. Against both the dollar and the euro sterling jumped half a percent, suggesting that the election-jitters that have bothered the pound for the last fortnight or so have subsided. However, there are potentially other explanations for its growth. The euro has been hit by reports that the ECB is preparing to cut its inflation forecasts, something that would further kick the rate hike can down the road. In the US, meanwhile, the dollar is gearing up for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony from former FBI chief James Comey, an event that could destabilise an already shaky White House. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters on the rise in US crude stocks: Oil prices slid more than 3 percent on Wednesday after the U.S. government reported an unexpected increase in inventories of crude and gasoline, fanning fears that output cuts by major world oil producers have not drained the global crude glut very much. Crude stocks in the United States grew 3.3 million barrels to 513 million barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). That confounded forecasters who had predicted a drop of 3.5 million barrels, especially a day after preliminary data from the American Petroleum Institute indicated an even bigger drop. Gasoline inventories also unexpectedly rose, imports increased, and exports dropped, the EIA data showed... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Flagging gasoline demand continues to bedevil the market. With gasoline currently the seasonal leader of the complex, its weakness is dragging everything down,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York. Prices slid even as some in the market remained concerned about the move by OPEC members Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar, an OPEC member that had agreed to cut only about 30,000 barrels a day as part of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreement to reduce output. However, analysts saw a risk that rivalries between OPEC members could weaken the production cut agreement. Some were already concerned about rising production from Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt from the agreement. OPEC has pledged to cut almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to help reduce global inventories. More on the US inventory figures: The drop in the oil price following the unexpected increase in US crude stocks has also had an impact on stock markets. The FTSE 100, which had been just marginally lower, is now down 41 points or 0.56% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dipped into the red. In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now virtually unchanged after its earlier gains, up just 1.2 points. Brent crude is now down more than 3% at $48.46 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has dropped 4.6% to $45.95. The surprise rise in US crude stocks contradicts Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report from the API showing a decline in inventories. Oil prices were already on the slide after the blockade imposed on Qatar by its neighbours, with analysts concerned the rift could impede Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement to curb production. Now they have come under more pressure following a surprise rise in US crude stocks. According to the Energy Information Administration, US crude inventories rose by 3.3m barrels last week to 513.21m, compared to forecasts of a 3.46m decline. Gasoline stocks rose 3.32m, well ahead of the expected 0.58m increase. Brent crude has fallen to its lowest level since early May following the EIA report. Meanwhile the pound is now up 0.2% against the dollar at $1.2933, while the dip in the euro on reports that the European Central Bank might cut its inflation outlook on Thursday has helped the pound gain 0.59% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1512 against the single currency. US markets have opened in positive territory, but investors remain cautious ahead of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s triple whammy of the UK election, the European Central Bank meeting and - of more concern to Wall Street - the testimony of ex-FBI boss James Comey. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 24 points or 0.12%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.13% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.27%. WPP, whose boss Sir Martin Sorrell earlier received a rough ride from shareholders over his pay packet and his own future at the company, is the biggest faller in the FTSE 100. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less to do with the annual meeting outcome and more to do with the trading statement issued alongside it. This showed a slightly slowdown in like for like sales growth of 0.7% in the first four months of the year (January to April), down from 0.8% in the first quarter (January to March). Analysts at Jefferies said: One month is not a trend, but these numbers are in focus given the concern around FMCG [fast moving consumer group] spending, US growth in light of the account losses (VW and AT&amp;T) and the weaker start to the year that WPP had in Asia. Later come the latest weekly US oil stocks figures from the Energy Information Administration, a day after an industry survey showed a bigger than expected fall. But the worries over the Middle East after the rift between Qatar and other Gulf states has continued to see oil prices slide, and a positive EIA report may have little impact. Craig Erlam, market analyst at Oanda, said: The only notable data to come today is EIA crude oil inventories which follow an API release on Tuesday that reported a drawdown of 4.62 million barrels. With oil already under pressure as traders appear to question the suitability of the output deal and the latest geopolitical issues in the region weigh, it will be interesting to see whether another large drawdown will offer any support. Having broken below $50 though, Brent continues to look vulnerable to further downside. Manuel Lopez, regulation partner at law firm Ashurst in Madrid, has declared that Santander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue of Banco Popular is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153landmark moment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It shows that the Single Resolution Board is determined to resolve failing banks, without involving state money, he says. This signals that SRB and other EU regulators will take major steps to ensure that taxpayers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bear the cost of bank failures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait until the situation deteriorates too far before doing so. The shareholders of Popular have seen, overnight, the results of the lessons learned in 2008. This will not be the last such case, and investors will certainly study the result and the financial consequences of this important decision.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top advertising magnate, Sir Martin Sorrell, received a rough ride from shareholders today over his pay package, and his own future. One fifth of WPP shareholders refused to back Sorrell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest bumper pay deal, worth \u00c2\u00a348m, even though the company has tightened its remuneration policy after earlier protests. Investors also demanded more action on a succession plan for life after Sorrell, who is 76, especially as either side can end his contract with no notice. Businesses who are fretting about the election could consider protecting themselves against the pound suffering wild swings when the results come in. Roy Williams, managing director at supply chain firm, Vendigital, explains why sterling volatility could be a problem. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never too late for businesses to hedge against unpleasant currency-related post-Election surprises. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The currency markets appear to be banking on a Tory win but the polls are more ambivalent. Businesses operating on low margins with significant imports or exports should consider a late hedge to protect their trading position from exchange rate volatility in the immediate aftermath of the General Election. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Prior to deciding what to do, businesses need to understand if they are a net importer or exporter to each of their various markets. For manufacturers that are net exporters for example, it would be worth considering locking in their exchange rate for a fixed period of time as part of a bank agreement. This will at least allow them a period of financial certainty to plan against. Another option is to line up suppliers in different regions, to give flexibility depending how the foreign exchange markets move, Williams adds. UBS Wealth Management have fired over some analysis of how the financial markets will respond to the result of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election: None of their scenarios sound particularly appealing, frankly, but here goes.... Conservative enhanced majority Back to business as usual for government. Established trends of rising inflation and weak growth in household incomes unlikely to change, weighing on growth in coming quarters. Conservative majority, in the case of less than stellar performance Prime Minister beholden to backbenchers in her party who favour a swift exit and hard Brexit. Less likely to see a transition deal. This results in sharp slowdown in growth as trade falters. Firms shift investment from the UK into the EU. Labour-led minority government Complete change of economic programme for the UK. Domestic policy takes a backseat amid Brexit negotiations, with lack of clarity over which aspects of Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposals will be implemented. Sharp drop in business and consumer confidence amid prospect of unstable coalition, muddled Brexit stance, and higher corporate and business taxes. Downside risks to already below-consensus estimates of 1.4% GDP growth for this year and 0.7% for next. The pound has done its best impression of a somnolent sloth this morning. Sterling is unchanged on the day, at $1.2907, on the final trading session before Britons trudge to the polls to elect our next government. Traders are eager to find out which (if any) of the rival opinion polls have actually predicted the result correctly. The pound could rally if Theresa May gets an increased majority, but likely slide if the PM manages to actually lose seats. Paresh Davdra of RationalFX says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The pound has remained steady on the eve of the general election. As campaigning reaches its climax, the pound has retreated slightly from the two-week highs seen yesterday but remains stable, as analysts await the election results. The markets are positive about the prospects of Prime Minster Theresa May emerging the winner of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote, as current polls indicate a secure lead for the Conservatives. However, there is still caution over the remote possibility of a hung parliament or a Labour victory, which investors fear would sink the pound in the aftermath of the election. Most European stock markets have crept a little high this morning, as traders enjoy a quiet day ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excitement. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX is lagging behind, with Banco Santander down 2% following its plan to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn in new capital to cover Banco Popular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-performing assets. Thursday will include Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election, a European Central Bank meeting, and ex-FBI chief James Comey testifying to Congress. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, says: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing mild gains in the FTSE in what is otherwise a mixed European session this morning. US futures are pointing a little higher ahead of the open, with little direction coming from across the pond. The UK index has stabilised in the weeks leading up to the election, with the sudden uncertainty around the outcome appearing to be contributing to the moves. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suddenly some drama in the markets, as the euro slides to a four-day low. The single currency shed half a cent to $1.122 after Bloomberg reported that the ECB is preparing to cut its inflation forecasts. Government bond prices are also jumping, pushing down the yield (interest rate) on that debt. Lower inflation forecasts means less chance of the ECB tightening monetary policy soon, and unwinding its huge bond purchase scheme. The Financial Times also argue that the Banco Popular bailout has bolstered the credibility of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector. Their Madrid bureau chief Tobias Buck writes: Analysts said that the ability of eurozone authorities to decisively step in to wind down Popular and safeguard its assets gives the EU regime new credibility after questions were raised during the tortuous struggle to clean up Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubled banks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s essentially a case of the regulation doing exactly what it was created for,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Laurent Frings, head of credit research at Aberdeen Asset Management. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But it does show that there is real risk in investing in these second tier names in the banking sector. The rescue of Banco Popular means that attention will now turn to Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sector. Some analysts are speculating on whether any Italian banks will fall into Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resolution mechanism, as some regional lenders are struggling to raise fresh capital. Analysts at ABN Amro, though, fear that some Italian banks aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as attractive as Popular. The deal is facilitated by the fact that Banco Popular is actually strong enough to have buyers. Especially their loan book, and diversification to Portugal was of interest. Crucially, the deal could be performed without the need for state assistance. However, in Italy, the banks of Veneto and Vicenza are not in the equivalent balance sheet position as the Banco Popular. It would seem that the large institutions in Italy would be unwilling to take over the banks without the interaction of the Italian state, either via the Atlante fund or another mechanism. The question now is, if Banco Popular has now been stated as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfailing or likely to fail\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by the SRB, what does this mean for the arguably weaker banks of Veneto and Vicenza banks This chart, from M&amp;S\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bond Vigilantes team, shows how Banco Popular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s risky bonds have been wiped out by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal (the orange line). But senior debt (which is further down the pecking order when a company fails) is not being \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbailed-in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue, so its value has actually risen. Once upon a time, a failing eurozone bank would have sparked mayhem in the financial markets. Not today, though. The news that Banco Popular has been acquired for one shiny euro by Santander has caused a notable lack of drama. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bank resolution mechanism is acting like it was meant to. Shareholders in a failed bank have been wiped out, and crucially so have the riskier bondholders. Various Banco Popular debt instruments have been written down, or converted into equity which was then handed to Santander, as part of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal. That means that bondholders who took a risk by holding this debt (which offered attractive returns) are suffering losses, rather than the taxpayer. James Mackintosh of the Wall Street Journal has tweeted the details: The OECD also hiked its growth forecasts for the eurozone and Japan, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t nudge its UK forecasts. Angel Gurria, head of the OECD, says we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too excited that global growth is heading for a six-year high of 3.5%. He told Reuters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everything is relative. What I would not like us to do is celebrate the fact that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re moving from very bad to mediocre. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that we have to get used to it or live with it. We have to continue to strive to do better.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Something to ponder.... This shows why global growth still isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood enough\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, in the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view. This chart shows how the OECD expects the global economy to grow faster, but with many of the benefits heading to the richest: The OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest global economic outlook is just out, and it gives a mixed picture. On the upside, the Paris-based thinktank has hiked its global growth forecast this year to 3.5%, from 3.3% previously. That would be the best performance in six years. The OECD sees growth rising further to 3.6% in 2018. But it is also concerned by persistent inequality in the global economy, lacklustre wage growth, and signs that the public are losing faith in their governments. And it says the outlook is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better, but not good enough\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The OECD has cut its US growth forecasts, but it now more optimistic about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic prospects. My colleague Katie Allen has read the report, and explains: The OECD devoted a significant proportion of its latest report to the possible forces behind a backlash against globalisation. That discontent was seen as a key factor behind Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory in the race for the US presidency, since when he has pledged to put \u00e2\u20ac\u0153America first\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Anti-globalisation sentiment also appears to have boosted protectionist politicians in other countries, including France where the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen made it to the final round of the presidential election but lost to the centrist Emmanuel Macron. The OECD said international trade had been a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153powerful engine of global economic growth and convergence in living standards between countries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but that despite those gains, the backlash against it had been rising. Readers may remember that Santander has a track record on rescuing ailing and troubled banks, including in the UK. It took over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Abbey National and Alliance &amp; Leicester before the financial crisis in 2008, and then added Bradford &amp; Bingley savers to its businesses when B&amp;B\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mortgage book was nationalised. Santander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, Ana Botin, has insisted that she came under \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely no pressure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from regulators to rescue Banco Popular. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, she says This is a transaction that is very good for our franchise in Spain and Portugal. It creates the best bank in both markets. Botin says that an opportunity arose yesterday to present an offer to the Single Resolution Board, to take over Popular, and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impressed by how quickly the rescue was handled. This is really great news for Europe, for the financial system, for Spain, and for Santander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders. Botin says that the deal won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hurt Santander -- it is sticking with all its financial targets for 2017 and 2018, and will be able to improve on its targets from 2019. The \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn of fresh capital is coming from a rights issue, she points out, so Santander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital reserves won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be depleted. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no word on any potential job cuts or branch closures. Botin says: We are fully committed to supporting both the team and the customers from today. But what about Popular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-performing real estate loans - does Santander really know what it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taking on? Botin says her staff did have time to do due diligence on Popular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets, prior to making its offer. And with Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy growing strongly, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confident this deal will be a success. Elke K\u00c3\u00b6nig, chair of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Single Resolution Board (which triggered Banco Popular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue), says that the deal will protect the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s savers. K\u00c3\u00b6nig also argues that the deal vindicates Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to avoid another financial crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decision taken today safeguards the depositors and critical functions of Banco Popular. This shows that the tools given to resolution authorities after the crisis are effective to protect taxpayers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 money from bailing out banks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official statement: The Single Resolution Board adopts resolution decision for Banco Popular Back in the UK, the Halifax bank building society has reported that house prices rose by 0.4% in May. That ends a run of four monthly falls in a row, and means prices are 3.3% higher than a year ago. But prices were still 0.2% lower in the March-to-May quarter than in the previous three months, highlighting how the UK housing market has cooled. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Luis de Guindos, has welcomed Santander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue of Banco Popular. In a statement, de Guindos says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good outcome for the bank, given the situation it had arrived at in recent weeks, as it implies maximum protection for depositors and continuity of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added that taxpayer money is not involved, and there is no danger of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccredit risk contagion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 spreading to other banks. Shares in Santander have dropped by 3% at the start of trading in Madrid. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because investors are reacting to its plan to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn in new capital to fund its rescue of Banco Popular. Popular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have been suspended, following their sale to Sandander If Banco Popular is in such trouble, why did Santander buy it? Popular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attraction is its retail banking division, and its small business customers. They can bolster Santander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existing business, and give it a larger share of the Spanish banking market. Bloomberg reporter Rodrigo Orihuela says: On the one hand, Popular has a very strong SME business and a very strong retail business, which is what Santander wants. The real estate business is the big big question....Everyone will have to wonder whether Sandander can solve it. They probably have a plan. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of Orihuela explaining the situation: Banco Popular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse into the arms of Santander today was primarily due to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctoxic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 real estate loans on its books, and its failure to raise fresh capital. The bank made some seriously bad loans before the financial crisis triggered a major Spanish housing crash, and its management have been unable to fix the damage. Back in February, Popular posted a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.5bn annual loss due to bad debts, restructuring costs and various writedowns. Then in May it admitted that it was setting aside even more money to cover real estate losses. Its new chairman, Emilio Saracho, has been trying to sell assets and issue more shares to raise capital, but the market has proved unreceptive to his efforts. The crisis escalated in recent days, as a series of potential buyers dropped out of an auction to buy Banco Popular. With capital levels running dangerously low, and its shares in freefall, the ECB was forced to step in and trigger today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue, to Sandander. Karen Tso of CNBC points out that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t costing the taxpayer anything, because Santander will raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn of new capital from the markets. Nick Leeson, the rogue trader who broke Barings Bank in the 1990s, is struck by the symbolic price of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal: Breaking news from Spain: Banco Santander has bought Banco Popular for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1, rescuing its fellow Spanish lender from from the brink of collapse. Santander said it would raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7bn to cover the capital shortfall and strengthen the balance sheet of Popular, after the European Central Bank deemed it to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153failing or likely to fail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The ECB (which supervises the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest banks) triggered the move after concluding yesterday that Banco Popular was running out of cash. It says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The significant deterioration of the liquidity situation of the bank in recent days led to a determination that the entity would have, in the near future, been unable to pay its debts or other liabilities as they fell due. Santander said it was making the purchase after \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a competitive sale process\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to rescue the ailing bank. Popular lost more than half of its market value in recent days as investors grew increasingly fearful over its ability to deal with its capital shortfall. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgraded the lender on Tuesday. Details and reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. You have to take your hat off to Australia. Despite the economic challenges of the last decade, it has just racked up its 103rd successive quarter of growth - dating all the way back to 1991. However, these latest growth figures aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too impressive. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.3% in the first three months of this year, a little faster than Britain but slower than France or Germany. That means annual growth is now just 1.7%; the weakest since 2009. Bad weather is partly to blame, with some economists pointing to the disruption caused by Cyclone Debbie in Match. But others are concerned. Michael Workman, a Commonwealth Bank senior economist, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Australian economy began 2017 with a whimper following a decent pace of expansion in the final quarter of 2016.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The weakness in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data extends beyond the weather, and the slowdown in the domestic economy has occurred at a time when the global economic backdrop has improved. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details: That sets the scene for this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main economic event, the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest assessment of the global economy. The Paris-based thinktank will update its growth forecasts, and highlight the key threats it sees ahead. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not expecting much drama in the London markets today. The pound is hovering around the $1.29 mark, and the FTSE 100 is forecast to open unchanged. Oil remains volatile, though, as the diplomatic crisis in the region rumbles on.

The IMF has confirmed that the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director will attend next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s critical meeting of eurozone finance ministers as efforts intensify to resolve the rift over how to lighten the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt load. Helena Smith reports from Athens:</p> <blockquote> <p>Its official: Christine Lagarde will attend the June 15 eurogroup meeting in Luxembourg according to IMF spokesman Gerry Rice.

The IMF has made clear it will not contribute to disbursements until a debt relief formula is devised permitting Largarde to make the case for further bailout participation before the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We would still be insisting on reforms and debt relief before the IMF would disburse any of its funds,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rice told reporters this afternoon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So this is not a backing down or a walking away in any respect.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>The EU and IMF have been at loggerheads over how to make Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gargantuan debt load sustainable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a prerequisite for the ECB to accept the country into its stimulus programme. Earlier Thursday, the EU economic affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici cautioned against \u00e2\u20ac\u0153playing with fire\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd saying it was vital a debt relief agreement was secured on June 15.</p> <p>Lagarde had stayed away from the last and inconclusive meeting of euro area finance ministers on May 22 amid concerns the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt crisis was poised to flare up again.</p> <p>The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras legislated further pension cuts and tax rises recently telling sceptical MPs a debt deal would be reached that would put Greece back on the road to economic recovery. Late on Wednesday he said EU investment programs should now be used to heal the rift between the EU and IMF by igniting the sort of growth that would bring concordance on debt relief.</p> <p>Citing data released by the labour ministry, the leftist leader told the inaugural European Concordia summit in Athens that indices were improving with 89,500 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real jobs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd being created in May in addition to the 92,000 work places created in April.

This time around, all eyes were on the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forward guidance on interest rates and the risk assessment for the economic outlook. On both, the ECB delivered some changes. As regards the forward guidance on interest rates, it was not about what the ECB said but what it actually didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say. The ECB omitted the reference that interest rates could even be lower than their present levels and therefore dropped the easing bias for interest rates. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not forget, however, that at the same time, the ECB kept the easing bias on QE, sticking to the formulation that the ECB would be willing to step up its monthly asset purchases if need be. Also, Draghi remarked that the ECB will remain in the market for a long while and the QE tapering was not discussed at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. As regards the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s macro-economic assessment, the ECB upgraded the risk to the growth outlook from negative to now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broadly balanced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Actually the first time since 2011 that the ECB calls the outlook for growth balanced.</p> <p>The improved economic outlook, however, has not yet led to any significant inflationary pressure in the Eurozone. This picture was reflected in the ECB staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic projections which were marginally upgraded to 1.9% (during the Q&amp;A session, Draghi said that due to the upward revision of 1Q GDP, growth would actually now come in at 2%), 1.8% and 1.7% in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. At the same time, the inflation projections were revised downwards to 1.5%, 1.3% and 1.6% for 2017, 2018 and 2019. Even though the downward revision was mainly the result of lower oil prices and a slightly stronger exchange rate, subdued inflation rates remain the biggest concern for the ECB. Reasons for low inflation rates are in our view not only the slack in the Eurozone economy, still high unemployment and a high number of (involuntary) part-time and low-wage employment but also globalisation and digitalisation. </p> <p>In our view, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB meeting was a very first baby step towards eventual tapering. It is obvious that the ECB is trying to be as cautious as possible to very gradually get out of the unconventional monetary policy measures. Therefore, this process of preparing markets extremely carefully with words and changes in the communication will continue and can take a long while before the ECB delivers new action. In this context, the low inflation forecasts in our view argue in favour of only a mild tapering and probably a tapering without an end date on it. There is clearly room for another \u00e2\u20ac\u0153longer but lower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd announcement for 2018 later this year.</p> <p>All in all, the ECB today delivered two important linguistic changes to its official communication which were more than only words. These changes marked the official start of a taper tiptoeing. A tiptoeing which will still take a long while before it could be called policy normalisation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59394ec2e4b0bdd87e2f49da\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-08T13:34:13.811Z\">2.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens mixed</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With the third element of Triple Threat Thursday - the testimony of ex-FBI head James Comey - due shortly, US markets have got off to an uncertain start.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down just 5 points, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both edged higher.</p> <p>Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Following the release of James Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement on Wednesday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which suggested Trump pressured him for a pledge of loyalty and implied his job was in peril if he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drop the Michael Flynn investigation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all eyes will be on the former FBI chief\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony in front of the Senate intelligence committee.

                "bodyText":"Finally, away from the Triple Threats, there are developments concerning Greece. The IMF has confirmed that the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director will attend next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s critical meeting of eurozone finance ministers as efforts intensify to resolve the rift over how to lighten the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt load. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Its official: Christine Lagarde will attend the June 15 eurogroup meeting in Luxembourg according to IMF spokesman Gerry Rice. Her presence now leaves the door open to the Fund approving a program \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in principle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if the impasse over debt relief isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resolved at the meeting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an effective get-out clause that would allow the EU more time to come to an agreement while emergency loans were disbursed to Greece in time for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.5bn worth of debt repayments in July. The IMF has made clear it will not contribute to disbursements until a debt relief formula is devised permitting Largarde to make the case for further bailout participation before the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We would still be insisting on reforms and debt relief before the IMF would disburse any of its funds,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rice told reporters this afternoon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So this is not a backing down or a walking away in any respect.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The EU and IMF have been at loggerheads over how to make Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gargantuan debt load sustainable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a prerequisite for the ECB to accept the country into its stimulus programme. Earlier Thursday, the EU economic affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici cautioned against \u00e2\u20ac\u0153playing with fire\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd saying it was vital a debt relief agreement was secured on June 15. Lagarde had stayed away from the last and inconclusive meeting of euro area finance ministers on May 22 amid concerns the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt crisis was poised to flare up again. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras legislated further pension cuts and tax rises recently telling sceptical MPs a debt deal would be reached that would put Greece back on the road to economic recovery. Late on Wednesday he said EU investment programs should now be used to heal the rift between the EU and IMF by igniting the sort of growth that would bring concordance on debt relief. Citing data released by the labour ministry, the leftist leader told the inaugural European Concordia summit in Athens that indices were improving with 89,500 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real jobs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd being created in May in addition to the 92,000 work places created in April. On Thursday, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics agency, Elstat, said unemployment had dropped from a record high of 27.9% in September 2013 to 22.5% in March. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and for the latest on the UK election we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be following events through the night. Otherwise we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back here as usual tomorrow to cover the aftermath of the vote. The testimony of ex-FBI director James Comey certainly does not appear to be troubling the US markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has just hit a new peak of 21,265. Its last record was just under a week ago on 2 June. Triple Threat Thursday has so far pass off without too much market drama. Ahead of the close of polls in the UK election, the FTSE 100 and the pound have both slipped back, with investors nervous about the possible outcome. The general feeling is that a Conservative majority is on the cards, but traders are not ruling out a surprise, given the Brexit and Trump shocks. In Europe, the euro has weakened as the European Central Bank ruled out lowering interest rates, a change in its policy. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 28.64 points or 0.38% lower at 7449.98 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax closed 0.32% higher at 12,713.58 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac slipped 0.02% to 5264.24 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 1.46% to 21,042.41 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.75% higher at 10,953.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.61% to 779.05 On Wall Street, as James Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony continues, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 29 points or 0.14%. On the latest market reaction to the UK election, David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The FTSE 100 is sliding today as dealers are concerned about the UK general election. If you take an average of the polls conducted, it points to a Conservative win but some investors have less confidence in the polls, in the wake of Brexit and President Trump. The UK stock market would prefer a Tory victory as the party is more in favour of free market economics than Labour. The ground lost by the Conservatives in the past couple of weeks has rattled some traders. So far markets seem to be taking the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big events in their stride. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a bit more movement this afternoon, but nothing to quite deliver on the promise of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctriple threat Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. So far James Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance in front of the Senate intelligence committee has done little to disrupt the US markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if anything the dollar is looking pretty perky, rising against both the pound and the euro. Of course it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early days yet, with a couple of hours to go until the former FBI chief\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public testimony is finished. Who knows what it will uncover? Elsewhere the ECB largely went through the motions this afternoon. Though the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation forecasts cuts had already been leaked, the central bank did still pull a mild surprise out of the bag by dropping the reference to lowering interest rates, stating that they would \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcremain at their present levels for an extended period of time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Yet Draghi made sure that this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken as too hawkish, something that only ended up disappointing the euro, which fell half a percent against the dollar and 0.1% against the pound. And what of the UK? Well, the FTSE found itself down by around 0.2%, while the pound gradually shed its early growth, both saving any major movements until they get a glimpse at the first trickle of results this evening. A reminder that ex-FBI head James Comey is testifying at the moment. So far there has been little market reaction, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down just a couple of points. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour of the meeting, with Comey explaining why he started making contemporaneous notes about his discussions with President Trump: Why did Comey decide to document that [first] discussion. What was it about that meeting? Comey replies: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A combination of things. The circumstances, the subject matter and the person I was interacting with.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Comey says he was alone with the president-elect discussing weighty matters. Then: I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting, and so I thought it was important to document it. Our live blog is here: The European Central Bank has got the eurozone economy moving again, but will it last, asks our economics editor Larry Elliott: Growth forecasts revised up. Inflation forecasts revised down. Jobs being created. Take a bow Mario Draghi. Urged on by its proactive boss, the European Central Bank has achieved what looked impossible until recently: it has got the eurozone economy moving again. Draghi should milk the applause while he can because the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sweet spot won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last for ever. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the US and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the UK, two countries that pursued exactly the same macro-economic strategy as the ECB, only earlier. His full analysis is here: More reaction to Draghi and the ECB: Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at Forex.com, said: There was so much fuss made about this key ECB meeting and it ended up being a bit of a damp squib. The central bank and its president Mario Draghi delivered contradictory statements about inflation and probably left many market participants feeling somewhat disappointed that there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything concrete announced. To be fair, the leaked inflation and growth forecasts earlier this week had already taken the edge out of this meeting and many people had already prepared to hear a more dovish than a hawkish ECB. Hence, the euro didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly fall off a cliff. Back with the European Central Bank, and Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank has commented again following Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference: It was a bit like in the good old days when ECB watchers looked out for code words like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vigilance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This time around, all eyes were on the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forward guidance on interest rates and the risk assessment for the economic outlook. On both, the ECB delivered some changes. As regards the forward guidance on interest rates, it was not about what the ECB said but what it actually didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say. The ECB omitted the reference that interest rates could even be lower than their present levels and therefore dropped the easing bias for interest rates. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not forget, however, that at the same time, the ECB kept the easing bias on QE, sticking to the formulation that the ECB would be willing to step up its monthly asset purchases if need be. Also, Draghi remarked that the ECB will remain in the market for a long while and the QE tapering was not discussed at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. As regards the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s macro-economic assessment, the ECB upgraded the risk to the growth outlook from negative to now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broadly balanced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Actually the first time since 2011 that the ECB calls the outlook for growth balanced. The improved economic outlook, however, has not yet led to any significant inflationary pressure in the Eurozone. This picture was reflected in the ECB staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic projections which were marginally upgraded to 1.9% (during the Q&amp;A session, Draghi said that due to the upward revision of 1Q GDP, growth would actually now come in at 2%), 1.8% and 1.7% in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. At the same time, the inflation projections were revised downwards to 1.5%, 1.3% and 1.6% for 2017, 2018 and 2019. Even though the downward revision was mainly the result of lower oil prices and a slightly stronger exchange rate, subdued inflation rates remain the biggest concern for the ECB. Reasons for low inflation rates are in our view not only the slack in the Eurozone economy, still high unemployment and a high number of (involuntary) part-time and low-wage employment but also globalisation and digitalisation. In our view, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB meeting was a very first baby step towards eventual tapering. It is obvious that the ECB is trying to be as cautious as possible to very gradually get out of the unconventional monetary policy measures. Therefore, this process of preparing markets extremely carefully with words and changes in the communication will continue and can take a long while before the ECB delivers new action. In this context, the low inflation forecasts in our view argue in favour of only a mild tapering and probably a tapering without an end date on it. There is clearly room for another \u00e2\u20ac\u0153longer but lower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd announcement for 2018 later this year. All in all, the ECB today delivered two important linguistic changes to its official communication which were more than only words. These changes marked the official start of a taper tiptoeing. A tiptoeing which will still take a long while before it could be called policy normalisation. With the third element of Triple Threat Thursday - the testimony of ex-FBI head James Comey - due shortly, US markets have got off to an uncertain start. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down just 5 points, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both edged higher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Following the release of James Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement on Wednesday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which suggested Trump pressured him for a pledge of loyalty and implied his job was in peril if he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drop the Michael Flynn investigation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all eyes will be on the former FBI chief\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony in front of the Senate intelligence committee. Presently neither the dollar nor Dow Jones seems too fussed by the recent revelations, though that could all change when Comey takes the stand. For those wanting to follow Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony, our US live blog is here: Q: The economy has started to improve nicely; is that because of QE or despite QE? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because of QE - we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re here because of that, smiles Draghi (perhaps inwardly fuming at this implied criticism of his precious stimulus package). And then he reels off the evidence that QE has worked: Eurozone growth in the first quarter of 2017 has been revised up today from 0.5% to 0.6%. The PMI indices, which track private sector output, are at their highest level since April 2011. The eurozone economic sentiment is close to its highest level, set in 2007. And unemployment is the lowest since 2009....and five million jobs have been created in the last three and a half years, more than in America. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the ECB press conference. Another nudge to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elected leaders to crack on with the job: Draghi is trying to cool speculation that the ECB is inching towards the exit of its stimulus programme.... Q: Could the ECB increase its QE programme if the economy weakens? Draghi says that there is adequate \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flexibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the asset purchase scheme. An Estonian journalist asks if her country is unfairly missing out from the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s asset purchase scheme, because it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any government debt for the ECB to mop up. Draghi argues that Estonia benefits from QE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive impact on the euro area, as it is an open economy. Q: Why did the ECB decide that Santander was the best candidate to take over Banco Popular? Vice-president V\u00c3\u00adtor Const\u00c3\u00a2ncio says that the ECB concluded that Popular was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153failing or likely to fail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as a bank run was taking hold and liquidity was running low. But the final decision on its future was taken by the Single Resolution Board (an independent agency) not the ECB Q: Did the ECB discuss when to start normalising monetary policy? No, says Draghi.... but then he remembers that two council members made some observations about this issue. I suspect that one of them was Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker, Jens Weidmann. Q: Could a prolonged lower inflation rate force the ECB to change its forward guidance and raise its negative deposit rate before ending its QE programme? [currently it promises to complete the asset purchase scheme before tackling interest rates] \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No, no\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Draghi, emphatically. Nothing substantial has happened to inflation, other than changes to the oil price, he insists. Q: Should we expect the ECB to outline its tapering strategy in September, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to drop your pledge to cut interest rates? It was not discussed, president Mario Draghi snaps back. Q: Last month, ECB governing council member Ewald Nowotny questioned whether the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation target was achievable. Should the markets share his concerns? Draghi says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to look at the reasons behind Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low inflation. One problem is that wage growth is modest, because negotiations are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153backward looking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd -- ie, bosses only offer small pay rises because inflation has been so low recently. Draghi also points out that many of the jobs created recently are of relatively poor quality -- many are temporary, or part-time. So \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to be patient....and persistent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Draghi insists. The euro has shed half a cent against the US dollar after Mario Draghi announced the ECB has slashed its inflation forecasts. Q: Did the ECB act quickly enough to tackle Banco Popular (the Spanish bank which was rescued by Santander this week). Draghi says he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on individual institutions, but he hails the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153timely action\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the regulators who handled the sale. Onto questions Q: Were today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions unanimous? We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a vote, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear any dissenting voices, Draghi replies (presumably he hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stuck his fingers in his ears....) Draghi ends his statement with his traditional call on European governments to do more to tackle structural problems in their economics, and underpin the recovery. The leaks were true! The ECB has cut its forecasts for inflation over the next few years. Here are the new forecasts for CPI inflation: 2017: 1.5%, down from 1.7% previously 2018: 1.3%, down from 1.6% 2019: 1.6%, down from 1.7% Draghi says this is mainly due to lower oil prices. More encouraging news. The ECB has raised its growth forecasts for the next few years. It now expects GDP to rise by 1.9% this year, up from 1.8% expected back in March. It has also raised its growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019 by 0.1 percentage points, to 1.8% and 1.7% respectively. But while the eurozone economy is recovering, there are still \u00e2\u20ac\u0153downside risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, predominately due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153global factors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Draghi says. Boom! Mario Draghi says that the eurozone recovery is enjoying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stronger momentum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and now growing at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhat faster pace than previously expected. Risks to the growth outlook are now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broadly balanced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he declares -- dropping the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous warning that risks were to the downside. Over in Tallinn, Mario Draghi has arrived to explain the decisions taken at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB governing council meetings. He confirms that the ECB left interest rates on hold, adding: The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation that the pledge to cut rates to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lower levels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if needed has been dropped. Draghi also confirms that the ECB agreed to maintain its asset purchase programme at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn per month, adding: If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration. The ECB president then turns to the economic situation. Our stimulus programme has created the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very favourable financing conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that are needed to get inflation back to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of close to but below 2%. Away from the ECB for a moment, and more positive signs from the US economy. Weekly jobless claims fell to 245,000 compared to 255,000 the previous week. That however was slightly worse than the 240,000 figure that had been expected. And the previous week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure was revised up from the original estimate of 248,000. This really is a historic day..... You might have expected the euro to rally, after the ECB dropped its pledge to cut interest rates to fresh lows if needed. But actually the single currency has fallen a little, down 0.3% today at $1.1225, after a sudden spike when the ECB announcement hit the wires. That shows that investors expected today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s change in language, and are also anticipating a dovish performance from ECB chief Mario Draghi in a few minutes. Fred Ducrozet of Pictet Bank says the ECB has taken a symbolic step towards tightening monetary policy in the eurozone, for the first time in many years. Carsten Brzeski of ING calls it a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbaby step\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 towards tapering (or trimming the size of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE programme down from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn per month). It was not about what the ECB said but what it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say. In fact, the ECB omitted the reference that interest rates could be lower than their present levels. This easing bias is now gone. Starting at 2.30pm CET, Draghi will present the new ECB staff macro-economic projections, the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment on growth and inflation and possibly some hints at the future path of monetary policy. In our view, some tweaks to the macro-economic risk assessment as a clear statement that the current recovery does still not show any inflationary signs are the most likely outcomes of the press conference. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the ECB appears to have ruled out the prospect of further rate cuts. We still need to hear from Mario Draghi, but the initial assessment of the early statement is that the ECB may have made some tiny, tentative steps towards policy normalisation by dropping a reference that it could cut interest rates further. We still need to see the ECB staff forecasts for growth and inflation, and there is a big expectation that the ECB will sharply cut its inflation forecast to the 1.5% level, way below the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target rate. Reto Foellmi, Professor of International Economics at University of St.Gallen, says interest rates will still remain at record lows for some time, despite the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspillover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 effects on the global economy. While the short-term costs of prolonging the ongoing monetary regime for a quarter or so seem small, it is not without incident. The longer we stay in this regime the more severe consequences it has on related currencies, such as the Swiss Franc. The actions of the ECB force them to set very low interest rates and to engage in huge bond buying programmes on their own. This spillover effect to other currencces makes it more difficult it is to change the course of action afterwards.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ECB has also voted to keep creating \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn of new money each month, to buy government and corporate bonds in an attempt to get inflation up. The bank has also pledged to boost this QE programme if needed, saying: If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration. Newsflash: The European Central Bank has dropped its pledge to cut interest rates to fresh record lows if needed. Following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council meeting, the ECB has (as expected) voted to leave borrowing costs at their current levels. But importantly, it has adjusted the language in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement. It now says that it expects interest rates to remain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at their present levels for an extended period of time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Previously, the ECB promised that rates would remain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at their present levels or lower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So this is the first step towards tightening monetary policy in the euro area - although we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still a long way from an actual interest rate hike. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision means that the headline interest rate in the eurozone remains at 0.0%, and banks must pay a negative interest rate of -0.4% when they leave money in the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaults rather than lending it to businesses and households. Reaction to follow.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly time for the first of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctriple threats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 -- the results of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European Central Bank meeting, followed by Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference. Investors across the eurozone, and beyond, will be looking closely for signs that the ECB could adjust its monetary policy stance, especially after today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth upgrades. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, explains: While investors have their eyes and ears glued to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU GDP release and this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision could have big ramifications for financial markets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most were expecting the upward revision of 0.6% to be confirmed and the latest estimate of EU GDP, although positive, is unlikely to alter Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking ahead of his lunchtime press conference. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When Draghi speaks later today, investors will be listening out for any dovish tones on interest rates. The ECB has previously stated that rates will remain \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcat present or lower\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and any removal of the potential to loosen monetary policy further could perk up markets significantly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says the City is facing the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccalm before the storm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, ahead of tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election results. The polls are open, and despite what is expected to be an incredibly volatile 24 hours ahead, we have seen a remarkably calm start to the day for the FTSE 100... Amid a remarkable Corbyn resurgence in the polls, FTSE traders would do well to remember the confusion caused around the US election and EU referendum, where the predicted demise of stocks in the eventuality of a Trump win or Brexit really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come to fruition, catching many off-guard. Ultimately the worst eventuality here would be a hung parliament, given that Brexit negotiations are due to start in just 11 days. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is basically becalmed right now, with the FTSE 100 currently down 9 points at 7469. It has gained around 4.5% since today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election was called in mid-April, so traders are now waiting to see if the pollsters have got this one right. The pound is also failing to provide any excitement, and is currently down 0.1% at $1.2945. With Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s polling stations doing a brisk trade, City experts have been analysing how the results of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote will shift the markets. Here are some predictions from Mihir Kapadia of Sun Global Investments, who expects Theresa May to be returned with an increased majority. \u00c2\u00b7 Conservative Win: This is largely expected, however, it is the scale of the victory that matters. If there is a landslide for the Conservatives, the markets will be stable, as they have already priced in for this scenario and thus there is not much leverage for it to rally further. The pound on the other hand will perform well over the news and can well trade over $1.3100. If there is a marginal victory, the markets will await for further clarity on the Brexit prospects and developments. So whichever the outcome in the Tory victory, the markets will be stable. \u00c2\u00b7 Labour Win: This will be a major political upset but is highly unlikely. This could see pressure on the GBP and on Gilts in particular. UK shares may also decline though some sectors will gain on the back of expectations of higher government spending. \u00c2\u00b7 Hung Parliament: This scenario is probably the most difficult for the markets, as it will could lead to a coalition government. This will also weaken the new government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position in handling the Brexit negotiations, and can be particularly damaging for the pound. Jeremy Cook of currency firm World First is predicting (or possible hoping for) a relatively quiet night: Craig Erlam, senior analyst at foreign exchange firm OANDA, says the pound will plunge if the election didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide a clear winner: From a markets perspective, this election is huge and could produce some substantial moves, particularly in sterling, the FTSE and UK debt. As we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned from similar events previously \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Brexit, US election - not only is the outcome not always obvious but the market reaction can also catch people off guard and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had traders acting with such caution all week. The most undesirable outcome is surely a hung parliament that produces both domestic political uncertainty and, more importantly, uncertainty and delays in Brexit negotiations. With the currently deadline being March 2019, any delay will be detrimental to the UK in negotiations and could therefore be devastating for sterling. While the knee jerk reaction to this may also be bad for the FTSE, as we saw after the EU referendum, we could see this bounce back quite quickly with the weaker currency benefiting its mostly outward facing companies. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown at the start of this year was due to faltering demand in the services sector, especially among businesses that relied on consumer spending. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that higher inflation, due to the weak pound, is hitting households. It also highlights the risks posed by Brexit, argues Ben Chu of the Independent. He writes: The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump in GDP growth in the first quarter has been attributed by economists to a sharp slowdown in consumer spending, owing to the spike in inflation that has followed the drop in the pound in the wake of the Brexit vote last June. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP growth rate is expected to pick up slightly in the next quarter, but most analysts believe that leaving the EU will set back the economy, with the damage depending on the nature and scope of future trade arrangements with the EU, our biggest trade partner. Some economists warn that a failure to secure any form of deal - a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cliff-edge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit in 2019 - could cost the economy up to 9 per cent of GDP, relative to otherwise, by 2030. The UK has been growing more strongly than the rest of the EU for most of the past seven years but that partly reflects stronger population growth in the UK. The pound has shed its early gains, following the news that Britain was the slowest-growing member of the EU in the last quarter. Sterling is now hovering around $1.295, falling away from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-week high. Some early reaction to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European growth figures: Breaking! The eurozone economy grew even faster than first thought at the start of this year. Statistics body Eurostat has just updated its figures, to show that GDP in the euro area expanded by 0.6% in January-to-March. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from an initial reading of 0.5%, and is the fastest growth in a year. The figures also show that Britain was the worst-performing member of the European Union in Q1, growing by just 0.2%. In contrast, Germany expanded by 0.6%, France and Italy grew by 0.4%, and many Eastern European states grew by over 1%. We shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read too much into one quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures, though. On an annual basis, the eurozone has expanded by 1.9%, which is actually a bit slower than Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% growth over the same period. But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures do underline how Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is (finally) gathering speed, helping to bring unemployment down across the region to the lowest levels since the debt crisis starter. This chart shows how the cost of insuring against the pound tumbling, or soaring, overnight has surged today - to the highest level since last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned over the years that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wise to treat opinion polls with caution, which is why traders are rather nervous today. Jasslyn Yeo, JP Morgan market strategist, says that younger voters (who typically have a lower turnout than older ones) could catch the City out. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets appear to be pricing in a Conservative Party majority victory. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, we still see much uncertainty surrounding the UK election, where a higher turnout vote of young people could potentially turn the tables on investors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Last week, YouGov showed the scale of the generational split in UK politics: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another chart showing how the markets might react to the UK election result: There will be drama in the markets if Theresa May doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t manage to increase her majority today (she currently has a working majority of just 17). Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services reckons 40 is the magic number to avoid internal Tory party strife. Barring a surprise the key question is how large the Conservative majority might be, with anything below 40 seats likely to embolden the ever restive elements, whose penchant for internecine warfare is well documented, to embark on a fresh leadership challenge, given the incompetence of the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign. Ostwald also pints out that the next UK government faces a very tough job: Even if a substantially larger majority is achieved, there is little doubt that it will make not a iota of difference to the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance on Brexit negotiations, though it will heighten the risk that both sides continue to talk AT, rather than TO each other, and end in a complete breakdown. There is also little doubt that the UK economy is now facing some significant headwinds, above all consumers that are facing higher inflation, weak wage growth and the pressures associated with a far too rapid pace of credit growth, the more so given an increasingly soggy housing market, above all in the populous south east. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is rather subdued this morning, with the FTSE 100 dipping by a mere 3 points to 7473. Investors are sitting on their hands (or possibly nipping off to the polling booth), while they anticipate the three big events of today. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says traders need to bring their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A game\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to work today. Voters over in the UK are going to vote for their new Prime Minister, the European Central Bank will deliver their verdict about their monetary policy and James Comey will testify in front of senate. It is difficult to say which event will have create more volatility but it would be sensible thing to be ready for all kind of outcomes. The outcome of UK elections does matter because the new Prime minister will have arduous task ahead \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the negotiation process of Brexit. Moreover, the winning candidate is not going to have a glittering economic prize because the country is facing significant slow growth, tepid wage gains and a currency which has its back broken and productivity issue which is cursed. City analysts believe the pound will rise over $1.30 if Theresa May increases her majority (which was the whole reason for calling the election). But a hung parliament could send sterling plunging by over six cents - a really sizeable move. Bloomberg has crunched forecasts from several investment banks: The cost of insuring against sharp swings in the value of the pound has soared today. That shows that City traders are preparing for sterling to move sharply when the exit polls are released at 10pm tonight. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details via Reuters: STERLING/DOLLAR OVERNIGHT IMPLIED VOLATILITY JUMPS TO 30.75 PCT ON DAY OF UK ELECTION, HIGHEST SINCE JULY EURO-STERLING OVERNIGHT IMPLIED VOLATILITY HIGHEST SINCE BREXIT VOTE AT 31.55 Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Connor Campbell of SpreadEx agrees that sterling is getting a small lift from the general election: As Britain heads to the ballot box the markets got off to a relatively quiet start this Thursday, with the pound very gently building on yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains. Cable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which, despite some big swings, has been climbing since the beginning of June \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rose another 0.2%, sending sterling to a its best price in a fortnight. Against the euro the pound has been less successful of late; nevertheless, despite being a long way from recovering the losses it has incurred since mid-May, a 0.1% increase has nudged the currency to a one and a half week peak. The pound is assumedly benefiting from the final round of polls, all of which \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to varying degrees \u00e2\u20ac\u201c point to a Tory win. The pound has hit a two-week high in early trading, as City investors anticipate a Conservative win in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election. Sterling has hit $1.2976, its highest level since 25 May, after the last wave of opinion polls suggested that Theresa May is heading back to Number 10 Downing Street with a larger majority. As this chart shows, the pound has been wallowing below $1.30 in mid-May, as the election campaign heated up and investors started wondering if Britain could end up with a hung parliament. But late last night, YouGov reported that the Conservatives have a seven-point lead over Labour: Sterling traders are now pricing a Theresa May victory, says FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed: The higher the margin Conservatives win by, the more negotiation power May will have on Brexit terms, and the higher the Pound goes from here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re calling it Triple Threat Thursday in the City. A pivotal day lies ahead, with plenty of political and economic drama in Europe and the US that could send the markets lurching. In the City, investors are on edge as Britain heads to the polling stations. The latest opinion polls point to a Conservative victory, and an increased majority for Theresa May -- but a shock result could have seismic impact on shares and the pound. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a big day for the European Central Bank as its governing council holds a monetary policy meeting. Investors had been expecting the ECB to take its first step towards tightening monetary policy, by tweaking the language in its outlook statement. However, leaks yesterday claimed that the ECB is actually going to revise down its inflation outlook -- making any exit from its stimulus programme even less likely. ECB president Mario Draghi will reveal all in his eagerly awaited press conference at lunchtime. We also get updated eurozone GDP figures, which could possibly see growth revised UP to 0.6% in the last quarter, from 0.5%, so it could be a volatile day for the euro. The third threat? Former FBI boss James Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony to Congress (from 3pm BST). It could be a historic event, with Comey facing questions from the Senate Intelligence Committee over the investigation into ties between president Trump and Russia. Our world affairs editor Julian Borger explains why it really really matters: When James Comey, the former FBI director, stands before a Senate committee on Thursday to give evidence about the president who fired him, it will be one of the most dramatic moments in US political history. The stakes will be as high as they have ever been at a congressional hearing. The questions Comey will be asked by the Senate intelligence committee include whether Donald Trump tried to persuade him to stop an investigation into improper contacts between a top adviser and Russian officials, whether Trump sought to extract a vow of personal loyalty, and whether Comey was fired because he did not comply. Trump has denied trying to make Comey drop the case, but if Comey contradicts him and is supported by other evidence, it would represent potential obstruction of justice by the president and mark a long leap down the road towards impeachment. Even in the Teapot Dome scandal that shook Warren Harding\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration in the early 1920s, and in the Watergate affair half a century later, it was not alleged that the president himself tried to intimidate an investigator.... More here: Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prepared statement has already set the scene, showing that president Donald Trump pressured him to shut down an investigation into a senior adviser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s links to Russia.

A course towards softer Brexit, and even a second referendum, has potentially been opened, albeit is highly path-dependent.

This is below its long term trend of 0.6%, it said. NIER\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s James Warren said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The subdued performance of the economy in the three months to May was driven by weakness in the production sector, offset by a mild rebound in services. The current political backdrop may lead to greater uncertainty and a drag on growth prospects, in particular business investment, which contracted in 2016.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the light of the election result, NIESR director Jagjit Chadha, added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The subdued performance in the economy throws the political turmoil of a hung Parliament into sharp relief. People are looking for answers to low levels of economic growth, limited improvements in productivity and falling real wages. That none of the parties wholly addressed our long run problems or how we ought to address exit from the European Union is the reason there was no clear winner.</p> </blockquote> <p>NIESR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent economic forecast, published in May, suggested GDP growth of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.9% in 2018. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-593a9668e4b0bdd87e2f4fe1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-09T12:40:24.838Z\">1.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Richard Watts</strong>, manager of <strong>Old Mutual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s </strong>UK Mid Cap Fund, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced by Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to carry on as prime minister.</p> <p>He argues that a hung parliament election make a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsofter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit, or even no Brexit at all, more likely: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Rather than strengthening her position, she has been significantly weakened, perhaps fatally. It is not clear that she can hold on to her position of prime minister, although she has announced that she intends to do so. In 10 days\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time, talks are set to start with the EU over the terms of the UKs withdrawal from the EU. In our view, the election result has called in to question the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mandate for a hard Brexit. It also appears that the DUP favours a soft Brexit and may make this the price of doing a deal with the Conservatives. What this means for Brexit is unclear but it makes a soft Brexit, or no Brexit more likely, in our view. This may not be a bad thing for the UK economy.

Even so the decline gave some support to the FTSE 100 and its overseas earners, while news that Theresa May was forming a government - even if with the help of the DUP - provided some support for shares and the pound. European and US markets shrugged off the UK result, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting a new peak as investors preferred to concentrate on the latest twists in the Donald Trump saga.Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: Although the pound fell, the FTSE 100 as well as other global indices opened higher on election result day. Traditional havens like gold and the Japanese yen dropped as global markets shook off the result as a UK-only affair. The closing scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 77.35 points or 1.04% at 7527.33 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.8% to 12,815.72 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.67% at 5299.71 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was 0.38% better at 21,122.42 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.23% at 10,978.3 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.39% to 782.10 ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key eurogroup meeting On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 100 points or 0.5%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget our politics blog is still going, with all the latest developments in the wake of the election result: The ratings agency also warns another election could be on the horizon (!): Prime Minister Theresa May will seek to form a government with support from Northern Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Democratic Unionist Party, known as the DUP, after her governing Conservative Party fell short of a parliamentary majority. While this would avoid a prolonged period of coalition talks, the terms of the agreement are unclear and another election in the near term is possible. Fitch added: The election increases the possibility of looser fiscal policy. The Conservative manifesto aims to balance the UK budget by the middle of the next decade, later than previously planned, although detailed tax and spending proposals were broadly consistent with March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. But Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stronger-than-expected performance after campaigning for higher public spending and investment funded by higher corporation tax and other tax increases suggests that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153austerity fatigue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is a meaningful factor in UK politics. Meanwhile a minority or Conservative-led coalition government may have to compromise on the pace of fiscal consolidation or specific policy measures to maintain parliamentary support (the reversal of proposals to increase social contributions for the self-employed in March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget highlighted a degree of inflexibility in fiscal policy making). The possibility of a second Scottish independence referendum has receded after the Scottish National Party lost 21 MPs compared with the previous election in 2015, although it remains the largest party in Scotland. We will continue to assess the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign creditworthiness with reference to the resilience of its economic growth prospects and its public finances as the domestic political situation develops and Brexit talks begin. We affirmed the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign rating at \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122/Negative on 5 May. The next scheduled review is on 27 October. Fitch has now chimed in on the election result and says, unsurprisingly, it will cause uncertainty: The UK general election result creates uncertainty over the policy platform, political cohesion and longevity of the next UK government, Fitch Ratings says. This will have implications for Brexit and potentially fiscal policy. The political, economic and institutional uncertainty stemming from the June 2016 Brexit referendum and the upcoming UK-EU negotiations is reflected in the Negative Outlook on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sovereign rating. If the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit negotiating stance remains unchanged despite the election result, that would a negative according to Deutsche Bank. Analysts Oliver Harvey and Mark Wall said: We see the initial move lower in the pound on the election result as justified. The election has resulted in a weaker rather than a stronger UK government, which will make negotiations with the EU27 more difficult. The medium-term outlook will depend on the tone of the Prime Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance on Brexit and fiscal policy over the next few hours and days. A course towards softer Brexit, and even a second referendum, has potentially been opened, albeit is highly path-dependent. But if the UK government sticks with existing Brexit plans in a much weaker domestic political position, significant sterling and/or economic weakness would again be required to shift the UK away from a crash Brexit. On that front, we view the Prime Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just-delivered speech on the steps of Number 10 as extremely negative. As well as confirming that Brexit negotiations will begin on schedule in 10 days\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time, the speech made no concessions to the Conservatives\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 weak showing last night or the clear electoral rejection of hard-Brexit plans. Just a reminder. The latest political developments after the shock UK election result are in our live blog here: The shock UK election result has had little effect on US markets, which have been more concerned about the latest revelations surrounding Donald Trump, notably Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony from ex-FBI boss James Comey. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 60 points , while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened up around 0.13%. UK government bonds could fall back if the new administration decides to boost the domestic economy. Chris Iggo at Axa Investment Managers said: Britain hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been doing elections (referendums) very well recently. Last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote on European Union (EU) membership and the General Election of 2017 have not resulted in the desired outcome for the two people that called the vote... More importantly, Britain faces huge uncertainty about its place in the world together with significant internal divisions. Going forward, one strategy might be to make sure people feel better about the domestic economy at least, in case things don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go well with Brexit. That may mean less austerity. From the UK bond market point of view, interest rates are not likely to move but gilt yields could rise if the new government thinks allowing some fiscal slippage is an acceptable price to pay for staying in power. Gilts could underperform US Treasuries and Bunds as a result, and break-even inflation rates could move back to their highs of earlier this year. More on UK GDP, and Capital Economics has looked at how it has been affected by political uncertainty: The UK economy was seeing subdued growth ahead of the election, according to think tank NIESR. Its latest estimate of GDP showed output growing by 0.2% in the three months to the end of May, the same as during the three months ending in April. This is below its long term trend of 0.6%, it said. NIER\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s James Warren said: The subdued performance of the economy in the three months to May was driven by weakness in the production sector, offset by a mild rebound in services. The current political backdrop may lead to greater uncertainty and a drag on growth prospects, in particular business investment, which contracted in 2016. In the light of the election result, NIESR director Jagjit Chadha, added: The subdued performance in the economy throws the political turmoil of a hung Parliament into sharp relief. People are looking for answers to low levels of economic growth, limited improvements in productivity and falling real wages. That none of the parties wholly addressed our long run problems or how we ought to address exit from the European Union is the reason there was no clear winner. NIESR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent economic forecast, published in May, suggested GDP growth of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.9% in 2018. Richard Watts, manager of Old Mutual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK Mid Cap Fund, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced by Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to carry on as prime minister. He argues that a hung parliament election make a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsofter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit, or even no Brexit at all, more likely: Rather than strengthening her position, she has been significantly weakened, perhaps fatally. It is not clear that she can hold on to her position of prime minister, although she has announced that she intends to do so. In 10 days\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time, talks are set to start with the EU over the terms of the UKs withdrawal from the EU. In our view, the election result has called in to question the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mandate for a hard Brexit. It also appears that the DUP favours a soft Brexit and may make this the price of doing a deal with the Conservatives. What this means for Brexit is unclear but it makes a soft Brexit, or no Brexit more likely, in our view. This may not be a bad thing for the UK economy. However, the timing of talks could be delayed as Theresa May seeks to form a government, which adds another level of complexity to the negotiations. Watts also thinks that Jeremy Corbyn could have dealt a massive blow to austerity, even though he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually win the election: With a continuation of a Conservative-led government, we do not expect any major policy changes. If anything, we may see a fiscal easing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obvious that Jeremy Corbyn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-austerity policies have resonated very strongly with parts of the electorate. In time, this could be good for UK domestic cyclical stocks. Over in Downing Street, Theresa May has just returned from her audience with the Queen - and announced that she is forming a new, minority government. It will be a government that can \u00e2\u20ac\u0153provide certainty and lead Britain forward\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at this critical moment, she says -- not acknowledging the uncertainty created by yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. Over the next five years we will build a country in which no-one and no community are left behind, she insists. Whart the country needs more than ever is certainty, and having secured the largest number of votes and the greatest number of seats, only the Conservative and Unionist party can provide it, May continues. She confirms that she will work with the DUP, and pledge to deliver a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153successful Brexit deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that works for everyone. Now let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s get to work, she concludes, before marching back into Downing Street. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost as if that pesky election didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hung parliament shock is reminiscent of a similar political crisis over forty years ago. Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: When it closed for business on election day, the City of London was in confident mood. Theresa May was Margaret Thatcher. Jeremy Corbyn was Michael Foot. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manifesto was, if not the longest suicide note in history, the second longest. Opinion polls were pointing to a Tory majority of about 100, which is what Thatcher got in her second general election victory. By 10pm when the results of the exit poll were released, it dawned on the City that this was not a rerun of 1983 but of 1974. May was not Thatcher, she was Ted Heath, a prime minister lacking the human touch who had called an election when there was no need to do so. With a hung parliament pointing to the possibility of a second general election within months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c another echo of 1974 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the markets responded in predictable fashion by dumping the pound. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Larry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full analysis: Here are some predictions from another heavyweight global investor, Allianz Global Investors: The UK election result may augur a more pragmatic approach to Brexit and increase the likelihood of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit, perhaps even retaining access to the single market. Our high-conviction view is that the Bank of England will put rate rises on hold for the next 2-3 years, or longer. The election reinforces such a view. Speculation about another election puts downward pressure on sterling but economic data is likely to be the key driver. A weak government or coalition probably means that fewer contentious manifesto pledges can be enacted \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although there may still be action on utilities. Time for a quick recap. The pound has suffered heavy losses in volatile trading, as the impact of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inconclusive general election ripples through the City. Sterling tumbled over three cents against the US dollar this morning to an eight-week low of just $1.265, putting it on track for its worst daily loss since the EU referendum. It also slumped to a seven-month low against the euro, at just \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.13, as investors warned that Theresa May could be forced to resign after failing to secure a majority. But the pound is now clawing its way back, after May seemingly secured a deal with the Northern Irish DUP for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153confidence and supply\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd arrangement that can keep her in Downing Street. Theresa May is heading to Buckingham Palace right now, to ask the Queen for permission to form a new government. Sterling is currently trading at $1.275, down two cents or 1.5% since the exit polls struck, after a wild morning. Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx says the DUP deal has calmed the City, a little: The pound gradually pulled back from the brink this morning, though the currency still finds itself in a very bad way following the shock general election result. As expected, Theresa May appears to have made an agreement with the DUP, whose 10 seats in Northern Ireland would allow the Tories to just about manage a parliamentary majority. While the pound is obviously pleased that May is set to visit the Queen at midday to seek permission to form a government \u00e2\u20ac\u201c therefore likely avoiding another election in a few weeks times \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the unstable nature of such a government, and what that means for the Prime Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to negotiate with the EU, has only seen sterling erase the top layer of its losses. Several major City firms have also voiced their concerns: Legal &amp; General suspects that Theresa May could face a rebellion from angry colleagues UBS has predicted greater volatility for UK assets such as the pound JP Morgan has predicted that Britain won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be ready to hold Brexit talks in mid-June Citi has warned that May could be forced to step down Many UK companies have suffered losses on the stock market today; shares in housebuilders and banks have fallen, due to concerns that the UK economy will struggle. Royal Bank of Scotland are the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, down 3.2%, followed by building firms Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey. Retailers such as M&amp;S and Next have also dropped, on fears that a weaker pound will drive up inflation, hurting consumer spending. Utility firms has risen, though, as the threat of being nationalised by Jeremy Corbyn seems to have faded. After jumping in early trading, the FTSE 100 has dipped back -- currently up 34 points, or 0.5%, at 7484 points. Multinational companies who will benefit from cheaper pound are rallying, such as drinks firm Diageo and fashion chain Burberry. The FTSE 250, which is a better gauge of the UK economy, has shed 100 points or 0.5% to 19639. Business leaders are extremely unimpressed by the situation; the British Chambers of Commerce says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s essential that the UK has a functioning government, while the CBI urged Westminster to get its house in order. Credit rating agencies are also watching the situation closely; S&amp;P has warned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating could be cut. Legal &amp; General Investment Management, one of the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest investors, is concerned that the governance of Britain \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchangs in the balance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Hetal Mehta, LGIM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior European economist, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Theresa May could face a rebellion, as some in her party might blame her for losing both a sizeable lead in the opinion polls and valuable Brexit negotiation time. This could mean that her position might become much weaker, possibly to the extent that she will have to stand down, thereby triggering a leadership contest. As we saw after the EU referendum last year, the Conservatives can pull together relatively quickly to elect a leader, but the risk is that the process is long and drawn out over the summer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the Conservatives become preoccupied with internal party politics, the chances of forming a minority government quickly may be lower, although an arrangement with the DUP is emerging as a likely outcome. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, the situation is extremely fluid, and it is worth remembering that back in 2010 the coalition between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats took six days to form, and that was when that partnership was amongst the likely outcomes. As such, the uncertainty and political wrangling is unlikely to lift quickly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd UK retailer Sports Direct has told the City that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suffer from the drop in the pound, as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfully hedged\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. In a statement, it says: Following the outcome of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election, and in view of the associated market volatility, in particular to sterling / dollar exchange rates, Sports Direct International plc is pleased to confirm that its sterling / dollar exchange rate is fully hedged for FY18 at 1.31. Last October, Sports Direct (which pays for some of its imports in dollars) issued a profits warning after a currency hedge backfired when the pound suffered a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash crash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That cost the firm \u00c2\u00a315m -- at a time when it was trying to improve its image following the exposure of poor working practices at its Derbyshire warehouse. The Greek government is leading enthusiastic applause in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity-wracked south for the election result, says Helena Smith in Athens Describing the result of his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153friend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jeremy Corby as exceptional, Prime minister Alexis Tsipas has just tweeted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The left that dares can inspire and mobilise people.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Earlier the Greek government spokesman had called the outcome a resounding rejection of the politics of austerity. Royal Bank of Canada believe that investors might welcome a Conservative alliance with the Democratic Unionist Party: If the numbers do allow the Conservatives to form a coalition with the DUP then things could be fairly stable. If not there could be a lot of inertia as it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t easy to see how else the Conservatives would be able to form a stable coalition to drive things forward. Uncertainty about government policy on Brexit and the Budget\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and all sorts of other things would be unhelpful and probably be seen as a drag on consumers and businesses. It would be difficult to assume a successor Conservative leader would follow the same Brexit strategy as Theresa May. Willem Buiter, global chief economist at Citigroup, says Theresa May is effectively a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclame duck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 PM. He told Bloomberg TV that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now unlikely that Britain will start its Brexit negotiations on June 19th as planned. Buiter also argues that the odds of the UK breaking up have fallen, as the SNP lost seats in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. The only thing that has changed is that nationalism within Britain, Scottish nationalism, has had a black eye. This is intriguing. Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Kleinman has heard that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking regulator has been quietly checking whether customers have been taking out more cash than usual today. The City of London Corporation (the Square Mile\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s local authority) hopes a new government is formed fast, before the markets are plunged deeper into uncertainty. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also pushing against a hard Brexit deal that would hurt the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sector (which, they say, creates \u00c2\u00a372bn in tax income.) Policy chairman Catherine McGuinness said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The City of London would wish to see an effective and secure Government formed as soon as possible. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets do not like instability. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is also important for the prospect of successful Brexit negotiations that we have certainty in the political system. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In these negotiations with the EU we would hope any new Government recognises the importance of two-way market access, a transitional agreement and the ability of talented people across Europe to get access to the best jobs. Two of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading high street retailers have been hit by worries over the UK economy following the general election. Shares in Marks &amp; Spencer and Next have fallen by more than 2.5% this morning, making them some of the worst performing shares on the FTSE 100. Investors are worried that retailers will suffer from the slump in the pound, which will drive up import costs and fuel inflation, hitting shoppers in the pocket and eating into real wages: Stock broking firm N+1 Singer explain: Depending on coalition talks, or if another election is needed, this picture could deteriorate further. Overall, this is negative for domestic consumer stocks, especially those reliant on foreign sourcing and an above average age demographic. Just in: Theresa May is planning to ask the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s permission to form a new government. That suggest she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got the support of the DUP for some sort of alliance.... Our Politics Live blog has all the action: A second rating agency, Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has just weighed in -- warning that Britain could suffer a credit rating downgrade. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly a year since S&amp;P stripped Britain of its prized triple-A rating, after the Brexit vote. And S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief ratings officer, Moritz Kraemer, has told CNBC that a fresh downgrade is possible. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have the outlook on the ratings still on negative indicating that further downgrade or downgrades could be in the wings going forward. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This depends pretty much on the further outcome of the Brexit negotiations and the reality that the U.K. will face outside the EU, which is still uncertain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kraemer added that Britain is building up \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quite a track record\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of destabilising votes. The pound has clawed its way back over $1.27, following reports that the Conservatives could form an alliance with the Democratic Unionist Party. As explained earlier, the DUP have won 10 seats - enough to provide a wafer-thin working majority if added to the Conservative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s haul. There are reports from Westminster that the DUP are considering a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153confidence and supply\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd deal, to support the Conservatives on key issues (but not a full-blown coalition). That has helped sterling recover from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eight-week low, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still down over two cents, or 1.7%, since the polls closed. There are also signs that May is determined to stick on as PM. Our politics editor Heather Stewart says: Senior Conservatives confirmed that May has no intention of resigning and is instead working to form a government, most likely by making a pact with Northern Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DUP, which has 10 MPs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We won the most seats and the most votes,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd one Tory source said. Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Beth Rigby has also heard that May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s colleagues are sticking with her, for now anyway: Credit ratings agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s says it is watching events in Westminster, and will work out the implications for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating. Kathrin Muehlbronner, a Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior Vice President, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is monitoring the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s process of forming a new government and will assess the credit implications in due course. As previously stated, the future path of the UK sovereign rating will be largely driven by two factors: first, the outcome of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiations on leaving the European Union and the implications this has for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth outlook. Second, fiscal developments, given the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal deficit and rising public debt.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The EEF, which represents Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers, wants the next government to rethink its Brexit strategy. Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Brexit negotiating strategy requires a careful rethink. Industry should be at the table, alongside whatever administration is formed, to help ensure we have the right negotiating position, which is something that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been sadly lacking until now. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The main parties have championed an industrial strategy for Britain and this must not be a casualty of the political turmoil. It is the best blueprint for business in the current circumstances.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s utility firms are emerging as a surprise winner from the election. Shares in power and water companies have risen this morning, as the City concludes that Labour won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be in a position to nationalise them. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to cap bills may also be moving off the agenda..... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no chance of sterling being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong and stable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd anytime soon, warns Viktor Nossek, director of research at wealth manager WisdomTree. He predicts the pound will suffer further losses as politicians try to deal with consequences of Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failed gamble. The pound has tumbled overnight, and this could be just the start, with volatility likely to remain elevated. Indeed, as the ramifications of this vote become clearer, the falls against the US dollar and other currencies could become more pronounced. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking across markets in general, uncertainty will reign as parties try to form a government, so expect an increase in volatility in the near term. The pound has now hit an 11-week low against a basket of currencies. It is on track for its biggest one-day fall in almost a year (since the aftermath of the Brexit referendum), Reuters reports. Jake Trask, FX research director at foreign exchange and international payments firm OFX, fears the pound could have further to fall: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK Prime Minister Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s horrendous miscalculation to have a snap election has hammered sterling overnight. After the Brexit vote and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win, the polls have again proved to be untrustworthy and sterling has tanked as result. A Tory majority was priced into the market but the reality of a hung parliament has seen the pound drop from $1.2950 to $1.27. Theresa May has yet to make a statement over her future, however should she decide to step aside we may see the pound take another leg down\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The British Chambers of Commerce has warned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s businesses will be damaged unless a functioning government is formed, fast. Dr Adam Marshall, the BCC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director general, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The formation of a workable administration that can give voters and businesses confidence around economic management must be the immediate priority. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whilst companies have for many months done their best to screen out political noise in order to focus on their own operations, this result will prove much harder for UK businesses to ignore. The swift formation of a functioning government is essential to business confidence and our wider economic prospects. Marshall adds that he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see how Brexit talks can begin until Britain has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clear objectives, an agreed starting position, and a strong negotiating team.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Although Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political turmoil has shunted the pound, it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t causing too much damage to other assets, reports Jill Treanor from IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading floor: The FTSE 250 index, which consists of small and medium-sized UK companies, has fallen by 0.5% at the open. That highlights the concerns over the British economy today. Outsourcing firm Capita are leading the fallers, down almost 5%. DING DING: The London stock market is open, and the FTSE 100 has jumped by 85 points, or over 1%, to 7535 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only 65 points away from its record high. Multinational companies such as Diageo, Unilever and Burberry are leaving the risers - as they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll all benefit from the slump in the pound. But..there are plenty of losers this morning too. UK banks and housebuilders are among the big fallers, showing that the City is worried that the election will harm the economy. Analysts at Liberum say: We would expect UK Housebuilders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shares to be weak following the surprise General Election result as the economic outlook has now become much more uncertain. Increased uncertainty would be expected to slow house purchases and make the sector less appealing. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to hang on as prime minister is worrying the City, and driving the pound lower, says Neil Wilson of ETX Capital. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling took another leg lower as looks like Theresa May will grimly cling on as PM despite a disastrous night for her. The pound dipped half a cent, slipping from a fairly comfortable looking $1.27 to $1.265 in pretty short order, and was last trading at $1.264 as it is on course for its biggest fall since October. May stepping aside creates uncertainty, but trying to stay as leader looks like it may even more unpredictable and uncertain for markets. Political gridlock is the key here and this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look good for sterling. The CBI, which represents Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s businesses, has issued a magisterial plea to Westminster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politicians to get a grip. Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI Director-General, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a serious moment for the UK economy. The priority must be for politicians to get their house in order and form a functioning government, reassure the markets and protect our resilient economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Politicians must act responsibly, putting the interests of the country first and showing the world that the UK remains a safe destination for business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to put the economy back to the top of the agenda. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the next Government, the need and opportunity to deliver an open, competitive and fair post-Brexit economy that works for everyone across all our nations and regions has never been more important. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no relief for the pound yet today, as the selloff intensifies. Breaking: Political journalists are reporting en masse that Theresa May has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no intention\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of resigning. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sending the pound even deeper into the mire; now down almost three cents at $1.2660, a new eight-week low. Swiss bank UBS fears that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union just became an even bigger problem. Mark Haefele, global chief investment office at UBS, says: We believe the Conservatives are ultimately likely to be able to form a minority government, but they have been severely weakened by the vote. The unexpected outcome increases the threat of further volatility for sterling and UK assets. The result is likely to call the position of the Prime Minister into question, the government is likely to be relatively weak, and the result further complicates the upcoming Brexit negotiations, due to start on June 19. A tighter political balance could make it easier for Eurosceptics within the Conservative Party and potential partners to prevent the government from offering the compromises needed to secure a trade deal. Brexit talks are now likely to be even more unsettling for markets, and the prospect of another election raises the risk of a delay, potentially leaving the UK without a negotiated exit settlement. The chatter on the trading floors today is that the Conservative Party could form a coalition with the Democratic Unionist Party. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says: Clearly, the fact that the Conservatives will be able to get past the 326 line with the help of Northern Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DUP is probably allowing markets, at least at this early stage, to keep a sense of perspective. But... that would only create a very small majority. The Tories are on track for around 319 seats while the DUP have 10. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s barely half of the 650 seats in parliament, so hardly the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstrong and stable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 government Theresa May was looking for. Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg says: The early speculation is that the Conservatives and the pro-Brexit DUP (Democratic Union Party \u00e2\u20ac\u201c N. Ireland) could enter a coalition. But with 329 seats between them, the working majority would be very slim. No doubt there will be speculation of another Conservative-Lib Dem government. But the Lib Dems want another referendum on Europe. That would be a tough sell for the Eurosceptics in the Conservative Party. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the state of play, with just a handful of seats still to declare: Our election results tracker has all the details: Bad news for holiday makers: The pound has just hit a new five-month low against the euro, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1322. That means one euro buys 88.3p. Alex Stubb, the former Finnish prime minister, agrees that Brexit talks probably shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t begin in 10 days time (as currently scheduled). The pound has hit a new eight-week low of $1.269, down over 2.5 cents since the exit poll landed at 10pm last night. These photos from inside City firm ETX Capital show how traders were shocked by the election results: Investment bank JP Morgan reckons that Britain will be forced to seek a delay in its Brexit negotiations. Those talks are due to begin on 19 June, but as things stand there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no certainty that Britain will have a stable government in place. Malcolm Barr, economist at JPMorgan, writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Perhaps the most obvious conclusion is that the likelihood of the UK needing to request a delay in the Brexit process has risen substantially, given the chance that political developments in the UK disturb what is already a time-compressed process.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The prime minister (at the time of writing) identified this issue herself, in a tweet that hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t aged particularly well.... The pound is losing ground against the US dollar as more City workers arrive at their desks in London. Sterling has now hit $1.271, down almost two and a half cents. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to the seven-week low struck around 1.30am today as election results flowed in. Traders have just heard that Theresa May will give a statement at 10am. Our City editor Jill Treanor spent election night in London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hectic trading floors. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how it unfolded: Gasps greeted the exit poll at 10pm. The City had been expecting Theresa May to win the election - quite possibly with a landslide. The exit poll showing that a hung parliament was real possibility had an immediate impact on the pound. It slumped as much as 2% in a matter of minutes -and has been treading water ever since. At World First, chief economist Jeremy Cook spent the evening explaining that it was ticking higher and lower as each seat came in. Few wanted to believe the exit poll - and the early seats appeared to show that the poll had overestimated Conservative Party weakness. As dawn broke, it became clearer that the exit poll had called the result much better than had first been expected. At IG, the analysts reckoned the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shock of the result is not really translating into the market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This is in part because the City is trying to work out if Brexit will now be delayed or soft with possible talk that the UK will ask to remain in the single market. The loss of seats for the SNP may also help take Scottish independence off the table. Waiting for the stock market to open at 8am, Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inconclusive election means it is a question of when, not if, the country heads to the polls again in the near future\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The slide in sterling meant the FTSE 100 was being called higher. But at IG they were also ready to watch the FTSE 250 index - made up of domestic stocks and less protected by sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide. Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management, predicts that the pound will be very volatile as investors come to terms with a hung parliament. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets were not primed for the prospect of uncertainty today. The dramatic change to the political and economic status quo will be unsettling to investors. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The purest way of playing macro-political risk is through sterling, and we may see a good deal of the markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 worries played out through currency. The short-term outlook points to higher volatility. In the first instance, it is likely that the pound will give up the bulk of its post-election announcement gains.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Investment bank Citi have predicted that Theresa May will step down as prime minister, and believe that a second general election is possible. In a research note, they say: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A period of political uncertainty lies ahead. Following what is widely regarded as a poor campaign and failure to translate a strong lead in the polls into a larger majority in the Commons, we expect May is likely to resign.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound could suffer further heavy losses following Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election disaster, warns Lee Hardman, currency analyst at Japanese financial group Mitsubishi UFJ . \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The consensus that this election was all about consolidating Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership is now shattered. Market hopes were pinned firmly on a stronger mandate as the UK government begins Brexit negotiations. Without question, there is volatility ahead. The market is desperate for any indication of what a Brexit deal might look like.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If negotiations go well, this could translate into a 1.30 to 1.35 range for the pound versus the dollar. But if the market anticipates a hard Brexit, the pound could drop to 1.20 to 1.25 against the dollar.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Although the pound has slumped, City traders are actually expecting the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares to rise slightly. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly because the slump in sterling is good for multinational companies listed in London. My colleague Jill Treanor is on the trading floor of IG in London, and reports: Good morning. The people have spoken, sending the pound sliding as a wave of confusion ripples through the financial markets. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to call snap general election has backfired in the most spectacular fashion. With most seats declared, the Conservative Party have failed to win the landslide majority they were aiming for. Instead, Britain is waking up to a hung parliament. Sterling plunged to a seven-week low as soon as the shock exit poll was released at 10pm last night. It has been buffeted through the night as traders digest this latest political shock, wiping off two cents to $1.2750. It also suffered heavy losses against the euro, down 1.5% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.138. As Jeremy Cook of World First put it, during a gruelling all-nighter: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Currencies like governments with mandates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like delays to Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This chart shows the initial slump, and the volatility since: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a night of wild drama, perhaps best summed up by Labour claiming the usually safe Conservative seat of Canterbury for the first time ever. Right now there are rather more questions than answers. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position as prime minister looks insecure, even though the Conservatives will be the largest party. Will Britain need a second election within months? How can the UK government now push for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, given this result? Could we even see a second referendum on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership of the EU? One thing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sure; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been quite a night for Jeremy Corbyn.... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the financial reaction through the day.",

The election outcome looks set to further complicate the process of negotiating the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the EU, as the government only has a narrow majority in parliament \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and even this looks vulnerable in the context of Conservative MPs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 widely differing views on post-Brexit UK-EU relations. Given the backdrop of an already slowing economy (the UK posted the lowest real GDP growth of all 28 EU economies in Q1 2017), it is not surprising that businesses are beginning to express a lack of confidence. We believe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly unlikely that the first round of Brexit talks between the British government and the EU (scheduled for 19/20 June) will deliver more clarity or significant results. This means that companies will have to wait even longer to assess the impact of these negotiations on their business. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our analysis indicates that uncertainty will remain high in the next 18 months, regardless of what happens in the wake of the election, and we are maintaining our risk rating of DB2d and our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeteriorating\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 risk outlook for the UK economy.

The time frame for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU in March 2019 remains unchanged, reducing still further the time available to achieve the transition agreement needed to avoid a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit.<br></li> <li><strong>We expect fiscal risks to increase because consolidation will have a lower priority, a credit negativ</strong>e. In our view, the budget deficit will increase this year and next, as the government reacts to the economic slowdown under way. The election outcome, with significant gains for the Labour Party which had campaigned for increased public spending, will likely be seen as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vote against austerity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

                "bodyText":"Time for a quick recap Sterling has lost ground today as fresh signs of UK political instability rattled investors. The pound has hit a seven-month low against the euro and is close to an eight-week low against the US dollar. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows: \u00c2\u00a31 = \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1280, lowest since November 2016 \u00c2\u00a31 = $1.1265, close to the eight-week low set in Friday The selloff came as rumours swirled through Westminster that next Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Speech might be postponed. This has highlighted that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position in Downing Street remains vulnerable (and potentially creates a very awkward diary clash with the monarch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s duties at Royal Ascot.) Political insiders are also reporting that the cabinet is split, with some members pushing for a softer Brexit plan. Business leaders have warned that confidence has been badly hit by the hung parliament delivered by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election, which has left May chasing some sort of deal with the Democratic Unionist Party, which won 10 seats in Northern Ireland. The Institute for Directors said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if not addressed immediately \u00e2\u20ac\u201c be disastrous for the UK economy. The needs of business and discussion of the economy were largely absent from the campaign, but this crash in confidence shows how urgently that must change in the new government. Rating agencies have weighed in too. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warned that the hung parliament was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccredit negative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the UK; a hint that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating could be downgraded. They said: Election result heightens uncertainty over Brexit negotiations and increases fiscal risks, a credit negative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist predicted that UK growth would be hurt. Harvard University added to the mix, with a study finding that most businesses want to remain in the single market. The Resolution Foundation warned that UK firms are worryingly unprepared for migration curbs. Meanwhile on Wall Street, US technology giants are suffering a second day of losses, with the Nasdaq down 1% in early trading. Is it the end of the tech boom?... ...not necessarily! Chris Beauchamp of IG says: Attention is concentrated on the ongoing rout in US tech stocks. Having been such a one-way bet so far this year, this sudden turn to the downside will have caught out more than a few over-eager latecomers. However, those rushing to proclaim the demise of one of the big rallies of not only the past year but the past eight years too need to be careful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there will be plenty of dip buyers out there who have been waiting for a pullback of this kind of size. And in Europe, the markets have just closed for the day. The FTSE 100 shed 15 points, or 0.25%, to 7511 - failing to get any benefit from the cheaper pound. The the German DAX shed almost 1% and the French CAC lost 1.2% That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Dr Mike Ellington of the University of Liverpool has written an interesting article on how sterling will suffer from the political crisis in Westminster. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysed UK economic uncertainty (measured by recording how many articles on economic and political unrest appear in the media each day), and tracked it against the value of the pound. He conclude that there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnegative relationship\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 between the two, with sterling suffering losses whenever It is clear that the negative relationship between policy uncertainty and the euro to sterling exchange rate is intensifying. This implies that increases in economic policy uncertainty are met with depreciations in the sterling to euro exchange rate running up to June 9, 2017. This indicates that currency markets do not feel the government has a strong negotiation position for Brexit (otherwise sterling wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be so volatile). Ellington concludes that this means trouble ahead.... This, coupled with May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lack of support in the general election, should put her leadership into question, particularly when it comes to entering divorce talks with the EU. The very fact that the domestic political landscape of the UK is shrouded by yet another layer of uncertainty suggests that economic policy, the exchange rate, and indeed the wider economy, is in for a rough ride. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full piece: Why the hung parliament spells economic turbulence for the UK economy The Institute of Director\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that UK business confidence has plunged since the general election has caused quite a stir. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some of the best reaction: Markus Kuger, senior economist at business services firm Dun &amp; Bradstreet \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After the surprising election result, political and economic uncertainty in the UK has risen considerably. The election outcome looks set to further complicate the process of negotiating the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the EU, as the government only has a narrow majority in parliament \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and even this looks vulnerable in the context of Conservative MPs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 widely differing views on post-Brexit UK-EU relations. Given the backdrop of an already slowing economy (the UK posted the lowest real GDP growth of all 28 EU economies in Q1 2017), it is not surprising that businesses are beginning to express a lack of confidence. We believe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly unlikely that the first round of Brexit talks between the British government and the EU (scheduled for 19/20 June) will deliver more clarity or significant results. This means that companies will have to wait even longer to assess the impact of these negotiations on their business. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our analysis indicates that uncertainty will remain high in the next 18 months, regardless of what happens in the wake of the election, and we are maintaining our risk rating of DB2d and our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeteriorating\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 risk outlook for the UK economy. We predict that, in the long run, the election result could make a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit - which we believe would be harmful for the British economy - impossible. Jenni Hibbert, Managing Partner for Financial Services Europe &amp; Africa at executive headhunters Heidrick &amp; Struggles \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Worries about the future are not just relegated to those in financial services: we recently conducted a wide-ranging survey with hospitality CEOs, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth largest employer accounting for 180,000 businesses in the UK, with less than one in ten confident about the future and almost half describing themselves as concerned.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Former UK shadow chancellor Ed Balls has also weighed in on Brexit today by co-authoring a report which found that a bad deal would be a disaster for the UK. A survey of small UK businesses by Harvard University found that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153almost all\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd business leaders wanted to retain membership of the single market and customs union, to make it easier to keep trading with the EU. Balls says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the time of the referendum, many British companies thought that Brexit might lead to a reduced regulatory burden. But now they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re worried that if Britain leaves the single market and the customs union, the opposite will be true.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: During the election campaign, both the Labour and Conservative leadership said Britain would leave the single market after Brexit - in order to impose migration controls. However, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit secretary, Sir Kier Starmer, has suggested today that the UK could stay inside the single market; a reminder that there are differing views on Brexit in both major parties... Newsflash: Shares in tech companies are falling again at the start of trading on Wall Street. The Nasdaq has shed 1%, losing 64 points to 6,143, at the start of trading. That adds to Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.8% tumble, Amazon, Alphabet/Google and Apple are all leading the fallers, as concerns grow that these tech giants have become overvalue. Ouch! The pound has just hit a new seven-month low against the euro, and is falling further against the dollar too. Sterling dropped as low as \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1280, down almost one euro cent today. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest level since last November. Sterling is also continuing to lose ground against the US dollar; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now down 0.5% at $1.2671- close to the eight-week low hit after the general election. The selloff comes as Theresa May government fails to show a great deal of strength and stability - with the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech reportedly postponed. FXTM Vice President of Market Research, Jameel Ahmad, argues that the pound will suffer fresh losses as Brexit talks begin next week. He isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced that a move towards a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsofter Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will provide much support. I personally still see downside risks for the Sterling and see the potential for the market to become encouraged towards selling in the likelihood that the UK is set to begin negotiations next week and looks very unprepared for such complex negotiations. The whole reason for the UK election in the first place was so that Theresa May would have more powers to influence the Brexit process, but not only has this play backfired, the UK looks more unprepared than ever to go head-to-head with the EU as it currently stands. I personally remain bearish on the Sterling. Carolyn Fairbairn, the director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, has also weighed in on the issue of EU migrants. She warns that British firms can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be expected to replace EU nationals with UK citizens, at a time when employment in Britain is already at record high levels. Fairbairn also told the Resolution Foundation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conference that politicians need to concentrate on the economy again.. Speaking of EU migration.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s businesses are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153totally unprepared\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the drop in migration after Brexit, according to a new report from the Resolution Foundation today. The think tank polled more than 500 UK businesses who employ EU workers, and found that 17% expect no change to the current system of freedom of movement for EU/EEA nationals to the UK. Another 30% believe this system will be maintained for anyone from the EU who arrives in Britain with a job offer. These are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153totally unrealistic expectations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, warns Resolution, because: The Prime Minister in contrast has ruled out either option, stating that her government \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rather than firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 demand for workers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will control migrant numbers. The Conservative Manifesto recommitted the government to reducing net migration down to the tens of thousands. The report was presented to a conference in London today, which also heard that the UK agriculture sector needs tens of thousands of season workers each year. The National Farmers Union is urging the government to consider this issue during the Brexit talks: Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Another dollop of uncertainty has just landed on our plates; Downing Street are hinting that the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Speech might not take place next Monday after all. Our political liveblogger Andrew Sparrow has just returned from the regular lobby briefing with Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman, and reports: The spokesman said that the new leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom, would be making a statement about the date of the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech in due course. The spokesman would not say anymore, but he would not confirm that it will go ahead as planned on Monday next week. It may be that the government has decided to delay it until it has agreed its deal with the DUP. A delay would be most unusual - and rather irksome for Queen Elizabeth II, who is expecting to spend most of next week at the Royal Ascot races. Sterling has fallen against every other major currency today, according to Bloomberg, which explains: The pound fell against all its Group-of-10 peers on the prospect of an unstable coalition government heading into Brexit talks with the European Union in a week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. Betfair reckon there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a one-in-three chance that Britain will hold a second general election this year. Here are the latest odds: Year of Next General Election 2017 3.0 (2/1 or 33% chance) 2018 4.0 (3/1 or 25% chance) 2019 4.9 (4/1) 2020 8.8 (8/1) 2021 9.4 (17/2) 2022 7.6 (13/2) They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also provided some odds for Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely replacement: Next Conservative Leader Boris Johnson 3.4 (12/5) David Davis 4.7 (7/2) Amber Rudd 9.0 (8/1) Ruth Davidson 10.0 (9/1) Phillip Hammond 17.5 (16/1) Michael Gove 23.0 (22/1) Speculation that Theresa May might change her Brexit stance is propping up sterling, says Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The rise of softer Brexit speculation is another reason why the pound has not declined more sharply following the UK general election result\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More here: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unstable political situation means the pound will remain volatile for some times, says investment bank JP Morgan. It told its clients that: The UK delivered another electoral surprise this week with the Conservative party losing its majority in Parliament. This means the Conservatives would be reliant on the Northern Irish DUP with its 10 seats to establish a thin parliamentary majority. This raises questions about PM May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to deliver a hard Brexit given the desire in Northern Ireland for a frictionless border with the Republic of Ireland. For sterling rates, this means markets are likely to be caught between the opposing forces of political instability associated with a Conservative minority government, and a potential softening of the Brexit stance. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy report on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election has knocked the pound, says Neil Wilson of ETX Capital: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sentiment around the pound took a bit of a dive in morning trading in London. After treading water around $1.274 for the last few days since the election, cable eased back below the $1.27 handle after Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warned that the election result is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccredit negative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the UK. This seems to have woken traders from their slumber and the pound is on the defensive as we start the week. It wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take much bad news from the UK political scene to force cable to take another leg lower. Still there is plenty of bid to catch on the way down as the dips are being viewed as short-term buying opportunities. Sentiment remains pretty bearish. As Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s points out there is a chance of a softer Brexit but we must also think there is a heightened risk of a cliff-edge exit from the EU.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sterling is also dropping against the euro, losing 0.6% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1322. On Friday it hit an eight-month low of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1285 before recovering a little. Update: the pound had now dropped below $1.27, towards the eight-week low struck on Friday morning as the election results came in. The pound is dipping back towards $1.27, down 0.2% today, as investors analyse these warnings from Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and S&amp;P and wait for developments in Westminster. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says the drop in business confidence, and the slowdown in household spending, are worrying the City: This decline in economic indicators may have been a long time coming, yet with a weakened political mandate and Brexit negotiations about to start, it is likely that we will see the UK continue to struggle. The fallout from the UK election continues and will remain key to expectations for the pound. Newsflash from the Bank of England: Andy Haldane, the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, has been reappointed to the Monetary Policy Committee. That means Haldane will continue to vote on UK interest rates and the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus programme until 2020. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a big surprise, but it is worth noting as Haldane is one of the most dovish members of the committee. Speaking of Brexit delays..... The formal Brexit talks are due to begin on 19 June, the same day as the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech.... Rating agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has also issued a report on the UK election, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not very cheery reading. It is titled: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Election result heightens uncertainty over Brexit negotiations and increases fiscal risks, a credit negative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And it warns that negotiating to leave the EU will now be a more complicated process. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fears that those talks (which are due to start next week) may be delayed, or may not focus on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantive issues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a while as the Conservative Party tries to agree a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is also worried that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national debt will keep rising for longer, as the government wrestles with a slowing economy and the public backlash against austerity. That could be bad for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating, which is currently Aa1 with Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, one notch below AAA. But.... Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also suspects that Theresa May (or her successor) will now steer away from a hard Brexit, which would be good for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating. Here are the key points from the report Inconclusive election outcome will complicate and probably delay Brexit negotiations, a credit negative. The negotiations with the EU were due to begin on 19 June, but we now expect a delay to the start of those negotiations or at least a period during which no substantive issues will be discussed. The time frame for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU in March 2019 remains unchanged, reducing still further the time available to achieve the transition agreement needed to avoid a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit. We expect fiscal risks to increase because consolidation will have a lower priority, a credit negative. In our view, the budget deficit will increase this year and next, as the government reacts to the economic slowdown under way. The election outcome, with significant gains for the Labour Party which had campaigned for increased public spending, will likely be seen as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vote against austerity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The public debt ratio will rise further and for longer than we had expected, placing the UK among the few highly rated European sovereigns whose public debt is still rising. However, the election outcome also means that the government may now consider \u00e2\u20ac\u0153softer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit options, which could be credit positive. While we still expect Brexit to happen and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cliff\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd risk of sudden exit remains, the election result suggests an electoral shift away from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit that the Prime Minister had ostensibly sought. Hence, a move towards \u00e2\u20ac\u0153softer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd versions of Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c potentially with continued access of some sort to the Single Market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c might now be considered. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing why Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is worried about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national debt: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth is likely to be damaged by the current political instability, according to the European chief economist of ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Jean-Michel Six told the AJEF association of financial journalists in Paris that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the time being, the outlook remains negative.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In terms of the outlook for growth, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that things are not going in the right direction. This latest bit of instability can only weaken the business environment and consumer confidence,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thanks to Reuters for the quotes....and this chart, showing how the UK economy has deteriorated recently: The shock election result has fuelled speculation that Britain may aim for a less \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit than Theresa May had planned. Kalum Pickering of Berenberg Bank explains: On the continent, most observers have taken the UK election result as a rebuke of Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard Brexit rhetoric of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal is better than a bad deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd kind. For example, EU Commission \u00c3\u2013ttinger has expressed hope that the UK may now agree to stay in the Customs Union and the Common Market, possibly by joining EFTA. To remain in the Common Market and thus maintain preferential access to the EU27 market (except for some financial products where regulators will insist that some activities have to be carried out under the direct sway of EU regulators), the UK would have to accept the free movement of labour and continue to pay into the EU budget like EFTA members do. Whether or not a Tory-led government could agree to that remains a very open question, though, to put it mildly. Indeed! And in the last few minutes, Brexit secretary David Davis has played down the idea that the government could soften its stance - insisting that leaving the EU meant leaving the single market. More in our Politics Live blog: Buzzfeed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alberto Nardelli tweets: Traders will be watching Wall Street nervously when it opens later today, to see if technology stocks keep falling. Apple fell by 4% on Friday, while Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook all shed 3% - wiping almost $100bn off their market value. The selloff comes after a long surge in tech stocks, so investors are wondering if the rally is over. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says other assets could be spooked.... Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell off in some of the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest tech names was sharp and severe on Friday. But was this just a bit of profit taking after a note from Goldman Sachs questioned the $600bn increase in some tech firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 market cap in the past year? This is an important question that we need answered as tech stock weakness is having an impact on other growth assets today. The MSCI emerging markets index fell on Friday, yet the Aussie dollar, which is correlated with growth assets, was relatively stable on Monday. The BBC has a good take on the IoD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business confidence survey: The uncertainty caused by the general election has led business confidence to sink \u00e2\u20ac\u0153through the floor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to a lobby group. A snap poll of 700 members of the Institute of Directors found a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dramatic drop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in confidence following the hung parliament. Members saw no clear way to resolve the political impasse quickly, the IoD said. However, it found there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no desire\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for another election this year.... More here: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are a sea of red this morning, as investors digest the tumble in UK business confidence in the last couple of days. Shares are being pulled down by worries over UK politics, and the selloff in the tech sector. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much optimism in the City this morning. Falling around half a percent the UK index found itself back below the 7500 mark, if only just, as the Institute of Directors warned that its members were feeling pretty damn pessimistic about the state of the UK economy in the next 12 months. The pound, meanwhile, neither continued last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline nor substantially recovered any of those election-losses, opening 0.1% higher against the dollar and flat against the euro. The FTSE 250 index, which is more UK-focused than the FTSE 100, has dropped by 50 points (or 0.25%) in early trading to 19,719. The IoD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy warning on business confidence is helping to keep a lid on the pound this morning. Sterling is hovering around $1.274, close to Friday night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. It tumbled by over two cents when the election exit polls came out on Thursday night. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, warns that the pound is vulnerable to political uncertainty, as prime minister May tries to cling onto power. With Theresa May scrambling to repair the self-inflicted damage suffered as a result of the election, there remains a huge amount of uncertainty around her position and with only a week to go before Brexit talks with the EU begin, I feel there may be a few more twists to come yet. May has not delivered the strong and stable government she wanted and instead looks weak and vulnerable. I find it hard to see how she recovers from this. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets agrees, saying: Sentiment remains dented by politics following the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hung parliament and shift in the balance of UK political power. European stock markets have opened in the red, with the FTSE 100 losing 27 points (or 0.4%). Technology stocks are the biggest fallers, following a selloff on Wall Street on Friday night. Manish Singh of CrossBridge Capital, an investment advisory firm, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprised that business confidence has fallen since the UK election. He says many business leaders are now pondering the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister, after he smashed expectations and gained 32 seats. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Singh says: If you are a business, you really need to start thinking \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhat is in the Labour manifesto?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.... It will have some businesses worrying about Mr Corbyn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manifesto included raising income tax on those earning over \u00c2\u00a380,00 per year, increasing corporation tax, and renationalising the water companies, as well as free childcare, ending the freeze on welfare benefits and abolishing tuition fees. Singh says political instability can deter businesses from investing, especially when the Brexit talks are also hanging over them. But he also agrees that younger voters are right too feel aggrieved, as yound people in Europe will be poorer than previous generations. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European stock markets are set to fall this morning, as evidence piles up that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mounting political uncertainty is hurting the economy. The Institute of Directors have issued a stark warning that business optimism has plunged after Theresa May lost her House of Commons majority last week. A new survey of IoD members found that 57% are either quite pessimistic or very pessimistic about the UK economy over the next 12 months. Just a fifth described themselves as optimistic -- which gives a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnet confidence\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 score of minus 37. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a serious deterioration compared to the previous month, when 34% were optimistic and 37% pessimistic. The poll, conducted over the weekend, found that many business leaders are alarmed by the prospect of a hung parliament, just as the Brexit negotiations begin. Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, says British politicians need to urgently refocus on the state of the economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if not addressed immediately \u00e2\u20ac\u201c be disastrous for the UK economy. The needs of business and discussion of the economy were largely absent from the campaign, but this crash in confidence shows how urgently that must change in the new government. This chart might focus a few minds in Westminster: The IoD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only cause for concern this morning. Visa have reported that household spending fell last month, for the first time in almost four years. It highlights how consumers are being squeezed by rising inflation and political uncertainty, and cutting back on non-essential items. As things stand this morning, May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grip on Number 10 is looking precarious, with insiders saying she cannot lead the Conservative Party into another election. Yesterday she was savaged as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dead woman walking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by former chancellor George Osborne (who seems to be enjoying his new career in journalism). But the game isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over, yet. Later today May will appeal to her MPs for support, in an attempt to remain as prime minister. Our political editor Heather Stewart explains: The prime minister is expected to signal to her parliamentary colleagues that she will run her government in a more collegiate, less controlling way, after sacrificing her two closest advisers, Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy. With many backbenchers blaming May for the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor performance at the polls, one senior Conservative said she would have to give a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153barnstorming\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd performance at the meeting of the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1922 committee of MPs to hold on to her job. Spread-betting firm IG expect the main European markets to fall by up to 0.5% this morning. While Britain is gripped by May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crisis-of-her-own-making, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Emmanuel Macron is showing us how to lead a country. The French president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s En Marche party is on track for a landslide win in parliamentary elections, giving him enough muscle to start pushing through economic reforms. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very little in the economic calendar today, alas.",

                "bodyText":"Shares in technology companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the driver behind recent record stock market gains \u00e2\u20ac\u201c kept falling on Monday as investors worried the sector was running out of steam. On Friday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index, home to Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and others, fell 1.8% and the slide continued on Monday, with the index down another 0.52% as market analysts anticipated more wobbles ahead of a crucial meeting of the Federal Reserve this week. Technology stocks have done far better than the rest of the market this year and they were trading close to all-time highs before Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop. The S&amp;P 500 technology index shed 2.7% on Friday for one of its worst days of the year. The climb has made fortunes for investors, and for tech entrepreneurs. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has seen his net worth soar by almost $20bn (\u00c2\u00a316bn) in the past five months to $85.2bn. Bezos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fortune is closing in on that of Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, whose net worth is $89.3bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Bezos could become the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest man if the tech stocks continue to grow. Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, said it was too early to say whether the last two days of trading would develop into something worse for the tech sector but added that there were worrying signs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The tech sector has been the stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best performer, and some people may be taking profits or rotating their investments into different sectors,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But there is also some concern about what the Fed will do.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stock markets have been bolstered by the huge amounts of money the Fed and other central banks have poured into bond markets in an attempt to keep interest rates at record lows. Low rates have made stock investments more attractive but the Fed has signaled that rates in the US are now on the rise, albeit from a low base. The Fed meets on Tuesday and Wednesday this week and its chairwoman, Janet Yellen, is expected to announce another rate rise at her press conference when the meeting concludes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everyone fully expects a rate rise this time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ablin. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What matters is what the Fed says about the rest of the year. Given their gains, tech is probably going to be the most sensitive sector to be affected by that. We will know more after Wednesday.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Strong quarterly earnings have helped technology stocks fill a void left by financial and industrial stocks after a post-election rally faded.

                "bodyText":"That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today, I think. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story on the inflation data: Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, argues that the government must respond to the pickup in inflation, and reverse some of its austerity measures. He writes: Had Theresa May won the landslide she was clearly expecting, the government would have been able to ride out this difficult period. Inflation is likely to go up a bit further, but the ONS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s separate figures for producer output prices, which measure the cost of goods leaving factory gates and provide a guide to inflationary pressure early in the pipeline, appear to have peaked. Moreover, weaker consumer spending will result in lower growth and this will eventually feed through into a fall in inflation. But May is a weakened prime minister heading a minority administration and she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time on her side. The government has recognised that voters are unhappy about falling living standards and have had enough of cuts. Deficit reduction will now play second fiddle to the need to raise real incomes, so expect a generous uplift in the minimum wage and an easing of curbs on public sector pay as signs that the age of austerity is over. More here: Rising prices are bad news for those who have managed to save money, particularly if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re relying on savings income (as many pensioners are). M&amp;S have calculated that the gap between the interest rate on cash savings and inflation is the widest since November 2011. That means savings, as well as wages, are shrinking in real terms. Ritu Vohora, Investment Director at M&amp;G, has the details: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At this rate, \u00c2\u00a35,000 left in an average bank account would lose \u00c2\u00a3137.50, in real terms after the effects of inflation, over the next 12 months. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All investments come with some risk, but these rock bottom net savings rates carry the very real risk of eroding wealth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now could be the right time to consider whether investing in stocks and shares could be a better way to protect against inflation, and achieve your long-term financial goals.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The head of the Confederation of British Industry has called Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election a political earthquake, but said it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an opportunity for a different kind of Brexit in which the voice of common sense is heard. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, also warned Theresa May that for businesses across the UK, particularly in Northern Ireland, a soft border in the country was fundamental. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Clearly it was just a political earthquake last Thursday. What we saw and realised is a lot of the consensus we thought we had we actually don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fairbairn told the Fortune Most Powerful Women International Summit in London on Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My biggest message is this is a time to broaden the church, listen to and work through the biggest issues. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know we really care about the strength of our economy, about the regions of the UK growing. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just be focused on London. The young turned out in their thousands, listen to that young voice.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fairbairn said the soft border in Ireland was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely fundamental\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, because it had helped understanding between people and the peace process. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m hoping from a business and practically human point of view that there is a commitment to that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. She added that there was much unhelpful language around Brexit ahead of the commencement of negotiations next week, such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard and soft\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know we want access to the single market, jobs depend on it. We also know there is a dilemma we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re facing, there is real public concern around immigration. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also seeing companies with skills shortages, a 96% reduction in nurses applying [as revealed yesterday]. We need to open up that dilemma again and come up with ways to address the public concern.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked why businesses were quiet during the referendum campaign, Fairbairn said they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t but their voice wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heard enough. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We learnt through the referendum how strong this sense of feeling left out of prosperity and growth a lot of the country felt,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she continued. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand enough the concerns around immigration.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd What was needed now was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a reset\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she explained. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In terms of the migration issue, I think people were saying we want control back. Is that served by a single number, a cap? If not, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s go back to problem solving.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a fundamental confidence in common sense prevailing through all this,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fairbairn said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think nobody in this room would think the referendum campaigns were good. The information and understanding... I think we can get to a better place now, where there are more voices coming through. Universities, young people. The chips are falling a different way now and we can have a different outcome. The fact is the EU will be our trading partner for a long time and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an opportunity to protect our relationship.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But she added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s be very clear, everybody I speak to in business accepts Brexit is happening. But what we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have is a consensus about how it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She stressed that there was a lot of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153really fantastic stuff\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd going on in businesses across the country, and urged people \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not get too down on ourselves in terms of the economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which has huge potential. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to get Brexit right and make sure we have access to the single market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While Britain faces the prospect of falling real wages, squeezed households and ongoing child poverty, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has just hit a new all-time high. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped by around 70 points to 21,307, a new record. Investment bank Goldman Sachs is the biggest riser (+1.5%), followed by credit card firm VISA (1.2%). Tech firms Apple, Microsoft and Cisco have all gained around 1%, after two days of losses. UK government bond prices have hit their lowest levels in a month since the inflation data was released. The pound has also risen, now up 0.7 of a cent at $1.2720. Those two facts suggests that traders see a higher chance that the Bank of England tightens monetary policy sooner, because of the risk of inflation. However, several economists are suggesting that the BoE will be content to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclook through\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the inflation figures. The FTSE, meanwhile, is almost flat at 7519 points, up 0.1%. Ashwin Kumar, Chief Economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, has joined the ranks of the experts calling for the government to end its benefits freeze. He points out that the policy becomes particularly harsh when prices start to accelerate: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People on low incomes face challenging times. Inflation is up by the highest rate in five years, continuing a sharp rise since the Brexit vote, and employment figures out tomorrow are likely to show that wages are barely keeping up. With increases of 2 per cent in food, nearly 5 per cent in energy and 3 percent in clothing and footwear, families are facing very difficult choices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The benefit freeze will squeeze family budgets even further. This was a policy designed in an era of very low inflation. This is no longer the case and low-income households are suffering. As the cost of essentials rises, the new Government could help struggling families by ending the freeze on benefits.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Given the current economic uncertainty, Brits should plan for this wage squeeze to last for some time. Calum Bennie, savings expert at Scottish Friendly, says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The seemingly perpetual squeeze on UK households continues. The rise of inflation to 2.9% means no end is in sight for hard-pressed consumers who see prices rising but growth in their wages failing to keep pace. It is no surprise then that consumers are reining back on spending or in many cases are turning to credit to get by as day-to-day living gets more expensive.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Prices will continue to rise due to the falling pound and the higher costs of imports so the message has to be try to be prudent with spending and stash more cash. You will need more bang for your buck in the next few months and having more money in your financial armoury can only help.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real pay crisis is a sign that austerity has failed, argues the GMB Union. Tim Roache, GMB general secretary, says Theresa May must take the opportunity to ditch polities such as the public sector pay freeze: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yet again, we are seeing the cost of living rise faster than wages. Inflation has risen to almost ten times its rate 12 months ago. In the real world, that increase means that no matter how hard people work, increasingly they are struggling to pay their bills. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Too often there is more month than money left after pay day. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is further proof, if any was needed, that austerity has failed and that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s working people paying the price. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the Prime Minister is to take anything away from her election embarrassment, it should be that people are fed up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re fed up with working hard to stand still and with a system set up to benefit those who already have more than enough. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ending the public sector pay freeze and making sure all workers are paid a decent wage is an absolutely must, and it needs to be on the agenda for the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Speech.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A neat summary of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data: House price inflation has also risen, thanks to a pick-up in prices in London. The average house price rose by 5.6% in the 12 months to April, to \u00c2\u00a3220,000. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 4.5% in the year to March 2017. The Office for National Statistics cautions that: While up against March 2017, there has been a general slowdown in the annual growth rate since mid-2016. London continues to be the region with the highest average house price at \u00c2\u00a3483,000, followed by the South East (\u00c2\u00a3315k) and the East of England, (\u00c2\u00a3281k). The North East still has the lowest average price (123k). In London, prices have risen by 4.7% in the last 12 months -- up from just 1.5% a month ago. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Evening Standard is splashing on the rise in inflation, and blaming it on the EU referendum. It warns that there is now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clear blue water\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between wages and inflation, adding that: There was growing concern in the City today that the hit to consumer spending power combined with political uncertainty following the loss of Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Commons majority will further undermine already slowing economic growth. Strangely, the front page doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mention that real wages also fell through most of their editor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time as chancellor (2010-2016)..... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a danger that the political deadlock in Westminster could push inflation higher in the months ahead, warns Stephen Clarke, economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation. And that could be particularly bad news for poorer families, if essential purchases like food and clothes keep climbing while benefits remain capped. Clarke says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest rise in inflation adds further pressure to already shrinking pay packets. The uncertain political environment, coupled with Brexit negotiations beginning in six days\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time, is already having an impact on sterling and could create further inflationary pressures down the track. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest rise in inflation will be a double blow to low-income working families, who are also seeing their tax credits fall in value as they have been frozen in cash terms. Many will wonder whether the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcend of austerity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 announced by the Prime Minister last night could mean a softening of the ongoing benefits freeze. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With no sign yet of pay settlements responding to rising inflation, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s renewed pay squeeze looks set to be longer and deeper than many originally expected.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ben Lord, who manages M&amp;G\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK Inflation Linked Corporate Bond Fund, predicts that CPI inflation will peak at 3% later this year. He also believes the Bank of England will resist any pressure to raise interest rates in response: At this point, with such high uncertainty about the direction of travel into Brexit negotiations, but with very significant downside risks, it seems extremely unlikely the Bank of England will tighten policy at this point. With so little evidence of domestic inflation pressures, and with most inflation coming from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctransient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and exogenous forces, governor Mark Carney will look through CPI at 3%, 4% even 5% perhaps. In fact, if Brexit negotiations commence poorly, and if the government can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get anything done without a workable majority and now with a viable and sizeable opposition, I would still argue that Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last move at the helm may be in the looser direction. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has been driven higher by the slump in the pounce since June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum, tweets Conservative MP George Freeman: Freeman argued we should remain in the EU. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, has sent over some advice on coping with inflation: check you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on a fixed rate energy tariff (one that guarantees the price you pay per unit) and if not switch make sure your savings are earning an interest rate that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s higher than the rate of inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c otherwise they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll lose buying power over time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you might need to think about high interest current accounts shop around for food and fuel so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not paying any more than you need to check whether you could cut your mortgage repayments by switching to a fixed rate deal if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on your lender\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s SVR The Child Poverty Action Group is urging the government to help struggling families cope with the ravages of inflation. Chief executive Alison Garnham says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unless there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an urgent re-think of the current freeze on benefits, the living standards of ordinary families will slip and slide downwards with serious consequences, particularly for children. Families are saying they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t manage. They need some leeway. Now is the time to ensure that benefits for working and non-working families once again reflect their needs and so rise with inflation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The failure to uprate benefits in line with inflation is the single biggest driver behind child poverty rising to 4 million and why it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s set to rise to over 5 million by the end of the new parliament.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This chart from Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ed Conway shows how Britain is now experiencing its second real wage squeeze since the financial crisis: The Telegraph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ben Wright points out that inflation is higher than the City, or the Bank of England, expected: Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, says inflation has hit \u00e2\u20ac\u0153eye-watering\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd levels. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rising prices coupled with lacklustre earnings growth means our wages aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keeping up with the rising cost living. Our real income are being squeezed and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re witnessing this impacting UK consumer spending, which fell for the first time in nearly four years in May as consumers tightened their belts. This is bad news for an economy which relies on confident consumers spending on goods and services - already we are seeing signs of a stagnating economy as confidence among companies and consumers falter. Election result paralysis will only add to the UK economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes. Readers may remember that inflation was rather higher back in the 1970s -- but the key point is that wages aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keeping pace. Currie explains why inflation is a concern: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation never seems like a problem until suddenly it is and while it may be good news for borrowers, as it erodes the value of their debts, it has detrimental implications for savers, investors and retirees, chipping away at the value of future interest and dividend payments and eroding the worth of your capital pot. Once pricing pressures become entrenched, consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 feel the pain, businesses don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t invest and the stock market gets worried. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says the government must respond to the wage squeeze by ending the 1% cap on public sector pay rises: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The election showed that working people are struggling. And the biggest price rises in four years won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide any comfort. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Working people are still \u00c2\u00a320 a week off worse, on average, than they were before the crash \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and now rising prices are hammering their pay packets again. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The new government must stop the real wage slide. Ministers must focus on delivering better-paid jobs all around the UK. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to lift the artificial pay restrictions in the public sector. Our hardworking nurses and teachers are long overdue a pay rise.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Britains\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 household finance squeeze has intensified, warns Ben Brettell, senior economist at financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers from the ONS showed inflation jumped to a fresh four-year high of 2.9%, as a fall in the price of motor fuels failed to offset higher prices for energy, food and recreational goods. Lower air fares also had a downward effect as the Easter holiday drops out of the calculation. Economists had expected the rate to remain at 2.7%. Wage data out tomorrow is expected to confirm pay is shrinking in real terms, and a report out yesterday from Visa confirms consumers are under pressure, with spending falling 0.8% year-on-year in May. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report: UK inflation jumped to a four-year high of 2.9% in May, signalling a sustained fall in living standards as prices rose faster than wages. The consumer prices index went up from 2.7% in April and has been steadily increasing since the Brexit vote a year ago, which triggered a sharp drop in the value of the pound and pushed up the cost of goods imported from abroad. Inflation was 0.3% in May 2016, a month before the EU referendum. At 2.9%, inflation is higher than average year-on-year wage growth of 2.1% in the three months to March, putting pressure on household budgets. It is also well above the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. Economists had expected inflation to stay at 2.7%. Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec, said inflation was likely to rise further in the coming months, as the weaker pound continues to feed through to higher shop prices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our view is that inflation will rise steadily to a little above 3% by the summer,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, should sterling resume an upward trend and energy prices slip further in US dollar terms, there is a chance that inflation remains below the 3% level.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A Treasury spokesperson has responded to the jump in inflation, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe government is helping families with the everyday cost of living by keeping taxes low, freezing fuel duty and increasing the National Living Wage. A typical basic rate taxpayer now pays \u00c2\u00a31,000 less income tax than in 2010 and increases in the National Living Wage mean \u00c2\u00a31,400 extra a year for a worker since its introduction.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more detail from the Office for National Statistics about why inflation jumped to 2.9% last month: The largest upward effect came from a variety of recreational and cultural goods and services with prices rising, overall, by 0.9% between April and May 2017 compared with a fall of 0.4% a year ago. Within this category the major contribution came from games, toys and hobbies, particularly computer games. Food prices rose slightly between April and May this year compared with a fall a year ago. The latest rise continues the upward movement observed from late 2016 and comes from a variety of product groups, particularly sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery where prices of cartons and boxes of chocolates rose between April and May this year. Prices for clothing rose by 0.6% between April and May this year compared with a fall of 0.3% a year ago. The upward effect came principally from children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothing. Sales patterns may have contributed to the price movements, as the proportion of items on sale fell between April and May this year, having risen a year ago. Prices for furniture and household goods rose by 1.2% between April and May this year, the largest rise between these two months since 2008. Between the same two months in 2016, prices rose by 0.4%. The main upward contributions came from lounge furniture and household textiles. There was also a significant upward effect from electricity as further price increases entered the index in May. This is a part of the broader housing and household services heading within which the effect is partially offset by a downward contribution from owner occupiers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 housing costs. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more inflation coming down the pipeline, warns Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group: Inflation is now rising faster than the Bank of England expected, points out Ben Chu of the Independent. This chart, from Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jamie McGeever, shows the impact of higher inflation on pay packets: The rise in inflation means that the cost of living squeeze has worsened. Earnings figures due tomorrow are expected to show that basic pay only rose by 2.0% in the last quarter, meaning they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have kept pace with inflation. This charts hows how the Consumer Price Index has jumped to its highest level since June 2013 (the yellow line). This shows how the cost of living has risen over the last year: Food, energy and recreational costs all helped to push inflation up in May. The Office for National Statistics say: Rising prices for recreational and cultural goods and services (particularly games, toys and hobbies) was the main contributor to the increase in the rate. There were smaller upward contributions from increased electricity and food prices. These upward contributions were partially offset by falls in motor fuel prices, and air and sea fares, the latter two influenced by the timing of Easter in April this year. Breaking! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has jumped to 2.9% in May - a new four-year high. More to follow.... The pound has now crept back over $1.27, a gain of half a cent today. Economist Rupert Seggins has tweeted some handy charts on inflation, ahead of May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer prices index report (due in around 10 minutes). This shows how inflation has risen sharply in recent months: This shows how it can take up to two years for a change in the value of the pound to fully feed into the economy: This shows how global food prices have stopped rising recently: And this show how the price of oil, in pound, surged after the Brexit vote: Merlin Entertainment, which runs many of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest theme parks and tourists attractions, has warned that demand has fallen since the terror attacks in London and Manchester. Shares in Merlin have fallen by 3%, to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, after it told that City that fewer domestic tourists have been making day trips to its sites - whihc include Alton Towers, the Sea Life centres, and Legoland. Nick Varney, Merlin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, struck a suitably upbeat and uncowed tone, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The impact of recent terror attacks on our London attractions is unclear at this stage.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What is clear, however, is that London has bounced back before and will do again. I have every confidence in the longer term resilience and growth trajectory of the market. London is very much open for business, welcoming visitors from the UK and from around the world to this exciting and vibrant city.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: European stock markets have risen in early trading, with the FTSE 100 gaining around 0.25%. The pound is also pushing back towards $1.27 ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation data. Connor Campbell of SpreadEX believes the City is welcoming the prospect of a softer Brexit (assuming Michael Barnier finally gets some company at the negotiating table): The pound has woken in a better mood than it did yesterday, lifting 0.2% against the dollar and 0.3% against the euro. The FTSE also looked a bit chirpier, rising 0.3% to sit at 7530. art of that positivity will stem from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters poll stating that the risk of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit has fallen following Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to secure a Tory majority; that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the same as the PM now chasing a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exit from the EU, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still good news for sterling. Cabinet minister Michael Gove, who campaigned to leave the EU last year, has dropped a hint that Britain is inching away from a hard Brexit. City traders should also take note that Michel Barnier, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief Brexit negotiator, is running out of patience. Barnier has told the Financial Times that Britain risks crashing out of the EU in March 2019 without a deal on future relations if it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wastes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd more time. Barnier pointed out that no progress has been made since Britain triggered Article 50 in March, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Next week, it will be three months after the sending of the Article 50 letter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t negotiated, we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t progressed. Thus we must begin this negotiation. We are ready as soon as the UK itself is ready.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In a sign of exasperation, Barnier even pointed out that he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t negotiate with himself! Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction from our Brussels correspondent, Jennifer Rankin: Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada agree that last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election shock has changed the Brexit landscape. But they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not sure, though, that Britain can maintain in the Single Market: Calls for a so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit need to be weighed against the reality that both Labour and the Conservatives had manifesto commitments to take the UK out of the Single Market. In any case, it looks as though the existence of a minority government with less authority in the House of Commons is set to fuel expectations that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit strategy could be modified in some way. During the campaign, Theresa May repeatedly said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal was better than a bad deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But there are signs that this position is, well, softening. My colleagues Anushka Asthana and Jessica Elgot reported last night that: Senior insiders say one of the ideas actively being considered to win backing across parliament was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not to major\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the controversial \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal is better than a bad deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd position taken by May before the election. Also under consideration is whether to exclude overseas students from the immigration numbers and even possibly to abandon the target to reduce immigration to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tens of thousands\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Although nothing has been agreed, any softening of the position on immigration could maximise the chance of a closer economic relationship with the EU. As the dust settles from last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election, economists are coming to the conclusion that Britain is less likely to exit the EU with a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to a new poll of City experts from Reuters, who say: The chances of Britain ending up outside the single market when Brexit talks are concluded have receded somewhat after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election, although the pound might weaken further against other currencies, a Reuters poll of economists found. Around two-thirds of the economists polled this week, 33 out of 49, said the chance of a hard Brexit had receded somewhat. Three said it had receded significantly, while eight said there was no change. Five said it had increased somewhat and none said increased significantly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The prime minister may have to change her stance and approach to Brexit following the election outcome,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Nikesh Sawjani at Lloyds Banking Group. More here: Likelihood of hard Brexit recedes after UK election - Reuters poll of economists Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about to find out how much damage the weak pound did to UK household budgets. New inflation data, due at 9.30am, is expected to show that prices rose by 2.7% year-on-year in May. That would match the four-year high struck in April, and mean that prices in the shops are rising faster than wages [which only rose by 2.1% in the year to March]. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says the figures come at a crucial time for the economy: We get to look under the bonnet of the UK economy this week, at a time when there is rising evidence that the UK consumer having enjoyed a post Brexit shopping spree is now scaling back as inflation starts to eat away at average earnings. Having started this year at 1.8% CPI inflation hit 2.7% in April and looks set to stay at this level in the latest May numbers which are due out later this morning. Core prices have also jumped sharply since the beginning of the year from 1.6% to 2.4% in April, though we are expected to see a slight moderation in the May numbers to 2.3%. There could be a silver lining given recent falls in oil prices, which might suggest that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a short term plateau for prices which could see prices start to fall back. Input prices in the last few months have shown some signs of falling back, and in both the US and the EU inflation has shown some signs of falling back which would be good news for hard pressed consumers, when wages are currently lagging behind. We also get a new report on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market, which may show that prices rose at a slower rate in April. So it will be a busy morning for City traders, who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have one eye on the economic data, and the other one on political developments after Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election. The pound has clawed back a little ground this morning, after hitting eight-month lows against the euro yesterday. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently trading around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.132, up 0.2%. Today, prime minister Theresa May is meeting DUP leader Arlene Foster to discuss a possible deal to prop up a minority Conservative administration. Last night, the PM apologised to her backbenchers for leading the party into such a mess. Senior colleagues have been making supportive noises, but May still looks weak and vulnerable - even if her premiership isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over quite yet. Also coming up today.. Brussels is expected to announce new proposals for how euro-denominated securities are cleared. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important for London, which currently dominates this market but could lose this lucrative (and important) business after Brexit. City AM has the details: The City is bracing itself for the European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed changes to the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir), due out on Tuesday morning. Brussels sources told City A.M. the proposals will include a mechanism giving the EU power to force relocation of euro clearing activity, which is currently dominated by London. A source familiar with the plans told City A.M.: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The commission is not going for the nuclear option.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nuclear option\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd would have seen the commission require all clearing of euro-denominated derivatives to take place within the EU... European stock markets are expected to rise this morning, with the FTSE 100 index called up 33 points. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9.30am BST: UK inflation report for May 9.30am BST: UK house price index for April 10am BST: German ZEW investor confidence report",

                "bodyText":"The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil glut is likely to persist next year in a blow to efforts by major producers to shore up the oil price by cutting output, according to a leading energy authority. Growth in oil supply will outstrip growth in demand during 2018, driven by increasing production from US shale and other countries outside Opec, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. The watchdog said its first forecast for 2018 made \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sobering reading for those producers looking to restrain supply\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Oil prices have fallen by about 10% since Opec and non-member countries including Russia recently agreed to extend production cuts until the end of March 2018. The deal was meant to prop up prices, but markets have been unimpressed by the continued curbs. The price of a barrel of oil fell further to $47.12 on Wednesday after new data from the American Petroleum Institute showed US crude stocks had risen 2.8m barrels in the week to 9 June. They had been expected to fall by a similar amount. The IEA has revised its forecast upwards for US oil production this year, and said Brazil and Canada were also expected \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to make further gains\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. As a result, despite the Opec deal, oil stocks might not fall to the cartel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desired level \u00e2\u20ac\u0153until close to the expiry of the agreement in March 2018\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the agency said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhatever it takes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 might be the mantra, but the current form of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhatever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is not having as quick an impact as expected,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the IEA said in a reference to Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise to do \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whatever it takes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to rebalance oil supply and demand. Efforts to combat the oil glut have not been helped by figures this week that showed Opec as a whole increased production in May because of higher output by Nigeria and Libya, which are not covered by the recent cuts deal. However, the big problem is the US and the speed at which it is adding new oil rigs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a huge resource, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s changed everything,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Gary N Ross, global head of oil at energy analysts Pira, of US shale. The number of US rigs has climbed to 927, according to the oil services firm Baker Hughes, up from 414 this time last year. The rise has been driven by the oil price climbing back up after an initial deal by Opec and allies last year to cut production by 1.8m barrels of oil a day from January 2017. Ross said surplus oil stocks were being drawn down, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but not at the rate Opec would like to see\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because of US production. He said he believed the price of international benchmark Brent crude would have to drop to $45 a barrel before US rig growth slowed. The analyst also said that the cartel should have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153done more\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at its meeting last month, and added that he thought it was in for a period of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perpetual [production] cuts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.",

After today, though, things might change, because if inflation doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pick up in the United States later this year then the expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep going will be revised.</p> </blockquote> <p>Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US economy is fundamentally a 2% growth economy. All the soft data, the surveys have been great but if you look at the hard data it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look as great, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look terrible either. The US recovery is continuing, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as strong as the markets might suggest ... I also agree that the Fed will hike rates today. As long as the markets are aligned as they are with yields pretty low, the dollar fairly weak but equity markets soaring, it gives the Fed room to hike. Of course they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to not just normalise rates but start shrinking their balance sheet but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a deadline for that which is when Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s term ends next year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-06-14T18:08:38.856Z\">at 7.08pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-594160ede4b014a733d62303\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-14T16:28:10.842Z\">5.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Mixed day for European markets</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A slump in the oil price after disappointing US weekly inventory figures has seen some of the shine come off stock markets.

Edoardo Campanella, economist at UniCredit Research, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The eurozone enters the second quarter on a good footing. Industrial production accelerated in April, expanding by 0.5% month on month from 0.2% in the previous month. The industrial production increase was broad-based across its main components (with durable capital goods being the only exception), but not across the largest economies. Germany led the way, while France and Italy recorded slight declines. However, part of the weakness is due to some technical factors related to both the Easter break and a bridge-day effect in Italy that weighed on the number of working days and, thus, on factory activity. This might explain why today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure, albeit good, seems disappointing when compared to the exceptionally strong manufacturing PMI reading that in April hit a six-year high.</p> <p>Since the most recent surveys continue to point to a rather solid growth in manufacturing activity in the eurozone, it is fair to expect that May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard data from the industrial sector will finally reflect this acceleration in output activity.</p> </blockquote> <p>ING Bank economist Bert Colijn pointed out that much of the growth was due to improvements in energy production, which had underperformed in the first quarter due to a mild winter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Growth in production of goods dropped in April though and capital goods production even declined. While the monthly data for production is volatile, this does show that industry continues to struggle on its way up.</p> <p>The outlook for industry does remain bright though as businesses have been indicating that backlogs of work are increasing as new orders are coming in at a faster pace. This will likely translate into accelerating growth over the course of Q2. Still, while backlogs of work have been increasing, this does not mean that Eurozone industry is overheating. Capacity utilisation has been improving over 2016 and is getting closer to peaks seen in previous expansions, but businesses are also still indicating that a lack of demand is limiting production far more than a lack of labour, funding or equipment.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile eurozone employment grew by 0.4% quarter on quarter and 1.5% year on year in the first quarter. In all, statistics office Eurostat said 154.8m people were employed in the eurozone in the first quarter, the highest number on record.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-06-14T11:41:45.428Z\">at 12.41pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5941174ae4b0bdd87e2f6ac5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-14T11:02:36.269Z\">12.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the Liberal Democrats on the fall in real wages.

                "bodyText":"That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick round-up. The US Federal Reserve has pressed on with the normalisation of interest rate policy, by hiking borrowing costs for the second time this year. The Fed funds rate is now 1% to 1.25%. The Fed is also broadly sticking to its previous guidance for interest rate rises over the next couple of years. Chair Janet Yellen tried to cool speculation that recent weak inflation might make the central bank more dovish. The Fed remains confident that the US economy is recovering, saying: The Committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Economists said the move shows that the Fed believes the recovery is on track. Ian Kernohan, senior economist at Royal London Asset Management, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Fed made little changes in the language or projections for further interest rate hikes. They acknowledged that inflation was running below target, but also that job gains have been solid. We expect another rate hike and some balance sheet normalisation before the end of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In another sign of confidence, the Fed outlined its plans to start selling off some of the assets bought during its stimulus programme. During a press conference, Janet Yellen said she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d not discussed her future with president Trump. She remains committed to serving her full term (to February 2018). Wall Street took the news in its stride, with the Dow Jones ending the day at a new high thanks to rising financial stocks. The US dollar also strengthened during Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference, as traders anticipated further rate hikes down the line. Scott Minerd of investment firm Guggenheim Partners sums it up: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW DING DING goes the closing bell on Wall Street. And the Dow Jones industrial average has finished at a record high, up around 0.2% But the technology-focused Nasdaq index has dropped by 0.6%. Capital Economists have provided a brisk summary of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions today: As widely expected, the Fed raise its policy rate target by an additional 25bp today, to between 1.00% and 1.25% and, despite the recent weakness of core inflation, Fed officials still expect to raise that rate once more in the second half of this year. The Fed also laid out plans for shrinking its balance sheet, with the initial run-off even smaller than we had previously expected, although it offered no specifics on the timing of when that normalisation would begin other than \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Wall Street isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too happy with Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments. The Nasdaq index has dropped by 1% after the Fed chair downplayed recent weak inflation data and signalled that US interest rates will continue to rise over the next couple of years. The S&amp;P 500 is down 0.25%, while the Dow Jones industrial average is flat. Finally, Yellen gets a question about apprenticeships, and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new push to get more Americans to develop their work skills on the job (a specialist subject for the President, of course). Yellen agrees that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important area. It is hard for firms to find workers with appropriate skills right now, as the labor market is so tight. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a particular problem for smaller businesses, she explains, as they have less latitude to retrain workers. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the press conference Q: Now you are getting ready to reduce your balance sheet, what have you learned about QE and whether it works? Great question, says Yellen, who explains how staff at the Fed, and outside, have done a great deal of work evaluating QE. I think we have learned that it works, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a valuable part of the toolkit. How has it worked, exactly? Yellen says QE (buying huge amounts of bonds with new money) succeeded in putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates. And it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t caused the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153runaway inflation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which some critics feared. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Quite the reverse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Yellen, dryly. So in future, if the Fed hit an episode of extreme economic weakness its primary weapon would be interest rates. But if it reached the point where it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cut again (the zero lower bound), QE could be deployed. Q: The president has credited you with being a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclow interest rate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 person. Do you agree? Yellen says she \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstrongly supported\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy of keeping interest rates at record lows after the financial crisis -- so i guess she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accepting the accolade, despite having just raised rates! Q: What do you say to the group of economists who are calling for the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation target to be raised? [This group, which includes Nobel laureate Joe Stiglitz, warned that the Fed could trigger a recession if it kept raising rates] Yellen plays a straight bat (unlike the England cricket team today, alas), saying it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very important issue. The Fed is open to a wide range of views, and might reconsider its target sometime in the future....ants to take in a wide range of views. Fidelity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Anna Stupnytska, is surprised that Yellen is sounding more cautious - especially about inflation and wage growth. Back to inflation... Q: Is it possible that globalisation, and falling central bank credibility, mean we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve entered an era of low inflation where it will be very hard to get wages and prices rising again? Yellen doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credibility has been impaired (but what else would a Fed chair say?!). But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certainly possible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that structural factors are partly to blame, she adds. Yellen says she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not seen much evidence that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed tax and spending plans have changed consumer or business spending. Q: Is the Fed worried about the recent run of weak inflation futures? Yellen doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound too worried, saying that inflation can be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153noisy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and affected by idiosyncratic factors. She cites cuts to cell phone contract prices, and some over-the-counter medicines. Onto questions, and the press pack quickly home in on Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. Q: Have you spoken to the president about the possibility of serving a second term, and would you be interested? Yellen says she is fully committed to serving her full first term, but she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not had any discussions with president Trump about a second term. She declines to say whether she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to say on when her first term expires (in February 2018). [Background: Trump dropped loud hints last year that he would replace Yellen] Q: Are you disappointed that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t produced any nominees for the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board of governors? The White House is working hard to find nominees for open slots, Yellen replies. She \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very much hopes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd there will be nominations in the not too distant future. Yellen is now outlining the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to start reducing its balance sheet later this year [details here]. She confirms that the Fed will take a cautious approach, initially with a $6bn monthly cap on sales of Treasury bonds and $4bn on mortgage-backed securities. This cap, which is expected to rise every quarter, will avoid any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153market strains\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as the Fed sells some of the assets bought during the financial crisis to stimulate the economy. Yellen also cautions that there is no rush to take decisions about the long-run framework of monetary policy. Big decisions, like the ideal future composition of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance sheet, needn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be taken for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quite some time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Janet Yellen also acknowledges the shooting in Virginia earlier today, where several people including Steve Scalise, Republican House majority whip, were shot. Our thoughts are with those who were injured this morning, the Fed chair says. Fed chair Janet Yellen explains that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest hike reflects the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153progress\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the economy, which appears to have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rebounded\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after slowing in the first three months of 2017. A pick-up in global growth is helping US exports, she says. Yellen adds that the job market will probably strengthen further, but cautions that it is near its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maximum sustainable level\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. On inflation, she credits one-off factors for the recent slowdown in inflation. And the bottom line - the Fed continues to expect that gradual increases in borrowing costs will be needed to keep inflation close to target, while sustaining the economic expansion. But, rates are still likely to be lower than in previous economic cycles, she adds. Over in Washington, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is holding a press conference to discuss today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions. You can watch it live here. Yellen is explaining that the Fed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continues to expect that the economy will expand at a moderate pace\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as conditions continue to improve in the labour market. The most important news tonight is the new guidelines on Fed balance sheet reduction. So says Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International. Stevenson explains: There was never much doubt that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates by a further 0.25% at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting to between 1% and 1.25%. ... More important was what the US central had to say about its plans to rein in its bloated balance sheet, which has ballooned to $4.5trn since the financial crisis as the Fed has bought government and mortgage-backed bonds to underpin the American economy. The Fed said today that it would decrease reinvestment of maturing bonds at a steadily increasing rate until after a year it is holding back $30bn a month on Government bonds and $20bn on mortgage backed securities. The Fed has taken another step towards \u00e2\u20ac\u0153normalisation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management commented. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recent economic indicators have not been weak enough to prevent Yellen pulling the lever on the third rate hike in seven months. Yes, inflation remains elusive, and wage growth relatively weak, but the data does not suggest growth has slowed enough to suggest a change in tack. The decision to raise rates doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t signal the beginning of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, but it does mark another step towards normalisation, as well as confidence in the long-term recovery of the economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate hike shows that the Federal Reserve is confident that the US economy is recovering, says Kully Samra, UK Managing Director at Charles Schwab. Samra adds: Despite recent underwhelming jobs numbers, the underlying US economic data remains robust enough to warrant tightening. While the economy is bouncing back from a weak first quarter, earnings have been strong and even in the wake of continued political uncertainty, corporate confidence remains secure. The market has demonstrated that it is comfortable with gradual rate hikes and will be reassured that the Fed has today committed to its promises. We expect at least one more rate hike this year but incoming data will influence future decisions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We have some unexpected news - the Fed has outlined how it expects to start reducing its huge balance sheet. Reuters has a great explanation: The Fed gave a clear outline on its plan to reduce its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, most of which were purchased in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The committee currently expects to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program this year, provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Fed said in its statement. According to an addendum released with the policy statement, the Fed anticipates that the balance sheet reduction plan would feature halting reinvestments of ever-larger amounts of maturing securities. The Fed sees the cap for Treasury securities to be $6 billion per month initially, increasing in $6 billion increments at three-month intervals over 12 months until it reaches $30 billion per month. For agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, the cap will be $4 billion per month initially, increasing by $4 billion at quarterly intervals over a year until it reaches $20 billion per month. The Federal Reserve has updated its dot plot, which shows where each policymaker thinks interest rates will be over the next few years. It shows that 4 policymakers expect rates will remain on hold for the rest of 2017. Eight Fed voters predict one more rate hike -- the central view - and another four expect two. As this chart shows, that means one voter is less hawkish than in March. The US dollar has fallen by 0.4% against a basket of currencies as Wall Street digests today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement. In its prepared statement, the Federal Reserve says that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continued to strengthen\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd since its last meeting. Economic activity has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rising moderately\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so far this year, the Fed says: Job gains have moderated but have been solid, on average, since the beginning of the year, and the unemployment rate has declined. Household spending has picked up in recent months, and business fixed investment has continued to expand. The Fed also acknowledge that inflation is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhat below 2%\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a nod to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker-than-expected CPI data. They add: Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2% in the near term but to stabilise around the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% objective over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely. Breaking: The Federal Reserve has voted to raise American interest rates today, to a range of 1% to 1.25%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quarter-point move, and exactly what Wall Street expected ... The Fed has also stuck to its forecast of one more interest rate rise this year. Just over 15 minutes to go, until the Federal Reserve either delivers the interest rate hike that the markets expect, or shocks us by leaving borrowing costs on hold ... Earlier, on the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme, the consensus seemed to be the US Federal Reserve would be raising rates. George Magnus, economist and senior advisor at UBS said: I think they [the Fed] really want to do this [rate rise] and I think they want to do it because they are trying to normalise the situation. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re quite worried about sub prime \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in other words less than good quality automobile loans and commercial real estate. So they have other concerns in addition to the economy. After today, though, things might change, because if inflation doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pick up in the United States later this year then the expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep going will be revised. Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management, said: The US economy is fundamentally a 2% growth economy. All the soft data, the surveys have been great but if you look at the hard data it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look as great, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look terrible either. The US recovery is continuing, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as strong as the markets might suggest ... I also agree that the Fed will hike rates today. As long as the markets are aligned as they are with yields pretty low, the dollar fairly weak but equity markets soaring, it gives the Fed room to hike. Of course they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to not just normalise rates but start shrinking their balance sheet but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a deadline for that which is when Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s term ends next year. A slump in the oil price after disappointing US weekly inventory figures has seen some of the shine come off stock markets. The FTSE 100 has also been hit by a rise in sterling, which is bad news for the overseas earners which dominate the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index. On top of that, commodity companies fell back despite some reasonable industrial production figures from China. There was also some caution among investors ahead of the US Federal Reserve meeting, which is widely expected to raise interest rates later. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 26.04 points or 0.35% at 7474.40 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.32% to 12,805.95 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.35% at 5243.29 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.61% to 20,960.55 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.98% at 10,775.8 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.48% to 800.97 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 9 points or 0.04%. On oil, Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Oil prices are in freefall again, thanks to a second consecutive failure of forecasters on the oil inventories front. Stockpiles dropped by much less than forecast, although at least they got the direction right this week, after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock rise in inventories. What is particularly noticeable is that oil production continues to rise, even as prices fall. It looks like everyone is keen to get as much sold before another rout in prices. WTI now trades at its lowest level in six weeks, with little sign of a turnaround in place. Both Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate are now down more than 2%. The weekly US oil figures have shown a smaller than forecast fall in crude stocks. The Energy Information Admistration said crude stocks fell by 1.66m barrels last week to 511.55m, lower than the 2.7m drop expected by the market and indicating weaker than expected demand. Gasoline stocks rose by 2.1m barrels compared to forecasts of a 0.5m decline. Crude prices, which have been buffetted by concerns that Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output cuts were having little effect given rising US production, have seen their losses increase following the figures. Brent, down 0.88% before the US data, has now fallen 1.64% to $47.92 a barrel. West Texas Intermediated has seen its losses increase from 0.8% to 1.89%. Back with the dollar, and it has fallen to its lowest level against the euro since the start of November. The single currency currently sits at $1.1286, up 0.64%, after reaching $1.1295. With the uncertainty over the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view on further interest rate rises in the wake of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak data, Wall Street has made a mixed start. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a new peak of 21,354 initially, before falling back to 21,334, a gain of around 6 points. The S&amp;P 500 edged up 0.12% at the open, while the Nasdaq Composite was unchanged. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, also believes the weak US data casts doubts on further Federal Reserve rate hikes after today: A double dose of soft economic data sent the US dollar plunging and gold rallying before the Federal Reserve rate decision. Slowing inflation and flat retail sales add to the growing sense that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting could see the last US rate rise this year. We would be in a state of shock if the Federal Reserve didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lift interest rates at its meeting later today.... Movement in the dollar will depend on what kind of signal policymakers give about the next hike, possibly in September. The US economy has not been firing on all cylinders but the Fed risks losing credibility if it backed off from a rate hike when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been so heavily intonated. A \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdovish hike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 seems most appropriate, which may not be enough to generate enthusiasm for the dollar. With the expectations for further US rate rises after today dimming, the dollar is continuing to weaken. This is to the benefit of the pound, which has climbed above $1.28 for the first time since the UK election. It was a brief moment, but sterling is still up 0.36% at $1.2795. The weaker than expected US inflation and retail sales figures could mean the Federal Reserve being more cautious about further interest rate rises this year, says James Knightley of ING Bank: This [data] creates more of a headache for the Federal Reserve in how it communicates its hiking strategy. They keep talking about slower growth and weaker inflation being transitory (the word was used on nine separate occasions in the minutes to the May FOMC meeting), but the longer we go without seeing growth and inflationary pressures is resulting in the markets becoming less convinced about higher interest rates. With little sign of tax reform and fiscal stimulus coming the Fed will likely sound more cautious on the prospect of an additional hike later this year even though their forecasts will almost certainly include it when released later on today. The dollar has just hit a one week-low against a basket of currencies, as the markets give their verdict to that double-dose of US data. Jamie McGeever of Reuters says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures were much weaker than expected: Matt Boesler of Bloomberg has spotted that the markets are repricing their interest rate hike expectations: Colin Cieszynski of CMC Markets wonders if the Fed might even leave interest rates on hold today, rather than delivering the hike that has been priced in by the markets: Chris Vecchio of Daily FX suggests the US dollar will have a volatile day Another newsflash! US retail sales have suffered their biggest decline in 16 months. Retail sales declined by 0.3% in May, new figures from the Commerce Department show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest drop since January 2016, and dashes expectations of a 0.1% rise. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another signal that the US recovery might not be as strong as hoped, and means the dollar is getting quite a hoofing. Newsflash: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has fallen!, surprising the markets and sending the dollar sliding. Consumer prices across the US dropped by 0.1% during May, having risen by 0.2% in April. And that dragged the annual inflation rate down to 1.9%, down from 2.2% a month ago. Core inflation, which strips out the prices of volatile elements like gasoline and food, only rose by 1.7% - the weakest rise since May 2015. This gives America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bankers something to think about, as they gather for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. It probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop the Federal Reserve raising interest rates in under six hours time, but it might make them more cautious about the next rise.... Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage squeeze since the financial crisis struck is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153staggeringly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bad. He writes: Cast your mind back to March 2008. The financial markets have been in turmoil since the previous summer and in the previous month the Labour government has been forced to nationalise the troubled bank Northern Rock. Few realised it at the time but the economy had peaked. A deep and brutal recession was about to begin. In that month, the average basic weekly wage, excluding bonuses, was \u00c2\u00a3473. The recession officially came to an end by late 2009 and after a couple of years of weak and patchy growth, the worst seemed to be over. Activity picked up, unemployment started to come down. Yet more than nine years after the slump of 2008 began, wages \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the yardstick by which most people judge whether the economy is doing well or not \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have not recovered. In fact, according to the Office for National Statistics, they have gone backwards. The average basic weekly wage, adjusted for movements in prices, now stands at \u00c2\u00a3458. More here: Over in Europe and eurozone industrial production rose by 0.5% month on month in April, with March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure revised up from a 0.1% fall to a 0.2% increase. Edoardo Campanella, economist at UniCredit Research, said: The eurozone enters the second quarter on a good footing. Industrial production accelerated in April, expanding by 0.5% month on month from 0.2% in the previous month. The industrial production increase was broad-based across its main components (with durable capital goods being the only exception), but not across the largest economies. Germany led the way, while France and Italy recorded slight declines. However, part of the weakness is due to some technical factors related to both the Easter break and a bridge-day effect in Italy that weighed on the number of working days and, thus, on factory activity. This might explain why today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure, albeit good, seems disappointing when compared to the exceptionally strong manufacturing PMI reading that in April hit a six-year high. Since the most recent surveys continue to point to a rather solid growth in manufacturing activity in the eurozone, it is fair to expect that May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard data from the industrial sector will finally reflect this acceleration in output activity. ING Bank economist Bert Colijn pointed out that much of the growth was due to improvements in energy production, which had underperformed in the first quarter due to a mild winter: Growth in production of goods dropped in April though and capital goods production even declined. While the monthly data for production is volatile, this does show that industry continues to struggle on its way up. The outlook for industry does remain bright though as businesses have been indicating that backlogs of work are increasing as new orders are coming in at a faster pace. This will likely translate into accelerating growth over the course of Q2. Still, while backlogs of work have been increasing, this does not mean that Eurozone industry is overheating. Capacity utilisation has been improving over 2016 and is getting closer to peaks seen in previous expansions, but businesses are also still indicating that a lack of demand is limiting production far more than a lack of labour, funding or equipment. Meanwhile eurozone employment grew by 0.4% quarter on quarter and 1.5% year on year in the first quarter. In all, statistics office Eurostat said 154.8m people were employed in the eurozone in the first quarter, the highest number on record. Here are the Liberal Democrats on the fall in real wages. The party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader Tim Farron joined the calls for an end to the freeze on public sector pay rises: For a government that used to bang on about the Just About Managing, they are doing diddly squat to help them. This represents the biggest fall in real wages since August 2014. Staff are working more hours, for less pay and with higher levels of stress. More people are living pay cheque to pay cheque and having to struggle at the end of every month to get by. Britain needs a pay rise and it is time the government delivered it, especially for the public sector. Our nurses, care workers, teachers and soldiers have bared the brunt of the economic crisis and seen their pay capped and wages squeezed. Enough is enough. We need to raise the wages of our public sector workers. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment report: The pound has now dropped into the red, as the City shows its disappointment with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor wage growth. Sterling is now down 0.2% today at $1.2725. The wage squeeze is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153headache\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government (on top of everything else) says the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Helen Barnard, JRF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of analysis, says the labour market has now reached a tipping point which can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply be ignored by Westminster. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouraging to see that employment levels continue to rise and unemployment has fallen again. But the troubling news for the government is the continued squeeze on wages for those are in work. This is the first time that there has been a year-on-year decrease in real total pay since 2014. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have reached a tipping point where rising costs are outstripping earnings, leaving millions of just managing families in a precarious position. The election campaign paid precious little attention to the squeezed living standards of low income households and their prospects of finding secure, well-paid work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It means the new government must act to ease the strain by lifting the damaging freeze on tax credits, and prioritising plans to drive up pay and productivity across the country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd UNISON, the union, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows how much stress the public sector is facing, as it also calls for the 1% pay cap to be ditched. General secretary Dave Prentis warns: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Demand for public services continues to rise, but these figures confirm that the workforce is still being cut. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Services are being starved of funds and staff shortages mean nurses, paramedics, teaching assistants and council employees are having to work even harder, but for less money. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Public sector workers have not had a proper pay rise since 2011. It is no wonder they feel so undervalued. The public sector pay cap must go.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The governent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Secretary of State for Work &amp; Pensions, David Gauke, is encouraged that employment remains at record levels. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This government wants to give everyone the opportunity to succeed, regardless of where they live or their background. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is yet another strong set of record-breaking figures with employment up and unemployment down, fuelled by full-time opportunities. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is good news for families as we continue to build a stronger, fairer Britain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But opposition parties are alarmed by the fall in real wages. Debbie Abrahams MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We welcome the overall increase in employment, but are deeply concerned that millions remain in low paid, insecure work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government has also failed to close the employment gap faced by women, disabled people and BAME groups, who have too often borne the brunt of austerity cuts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the cost of basic essentials rising by 2.9 per cent, while wages stagnate, too many of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s families are struggling to get by while Theresa May focuses on holding her unstable coalition of chaos together. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Only a Labour government will ensure working people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s living standards are protected with a real Living Wage of \u00c2\u00a310 per hour, and an immediate end to austerity spending cuts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Prime Minister must stand aside and let a Labour government build an economy that works for the many, not the few.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, suggests the government may have to bow to pressure and end its 1% cap on public sector pay rises, as the TUC and others demand. With inflation likely to be heading above 3% later this year, the squeeze on real pay growth is now getting serious and is likely to dampen real consumer spending growth for some time to come. The cost of Brexit to people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s living standards due to the fall in the pound is becoming ever more apparent. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The squeeze is even more severe in the public sector, where pay is only rising at around 1%. The sustainability of this pay policy for nurses, doctors, teachers and other key public service workers will come increasingly into doubt as inflation rises to 3% and above later this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also shows how the public sector has shrunk since the financial crisis. Just 17.0% of all people in work were employed in the public sector, which is the lowest proportion since comparable records began in 1999. There are now 5.42 million people employed in the public sector, down 20,000 in the last year, and the lowest since June 1999. The rise of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGig economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, with its low-paid, precarious jobs, is surely a factor behind the weak wage growth. Dr John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, says it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remarkable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that pay is so weak when the employment rate is at a record high of nearly 75%. Hard times and near full employment make strange bedfellows, highlighting the extent to which a de-regulated labour market with an abundance of workers available to fill low wage vacancies has altered the UK jobs landscape.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 The Resolution Foundation have crunched today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures, to show how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pay is still below its levels before the financial crisis (once you adjust for inflation). They also show how the economy is still creating jobs, although some parts of the country aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feeling the benefits as much as others: Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, also fears that the pay squeeze will hurt growth: The UK economy faces a dangerous cocktail of political uncertainty, slowing growth and shrinking real wages. First-quarter GDP figures were disappoining, while a recent report from VISA confirmed consumers are under pressure, with spending falling 0.8% year-on-year in May. Households are being squeezed from both directions, with inflation rising faster than expected and wages rising more slowly. This doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bode well for economic growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the UK economy is heavily reliant on the consumer and falling real incomes will eventually translate into lower retail sales. The pay squeeze puts more pressure on the Bank of England to consider raising interest rates to curb inflation, argues Neil Wilson of ETX Capital (whose hopes of stronger wage growth have been firmly dashed). He writes: Wages are climbing at a rate of just 2.1%, or just 1.7% when you excluded bonuses. This run rate is just not enough to sustain consumer spending where it has been of late when inflation is accelerating. Average earnings in real terms slumped by 0.6%, or 0.4% including bonuses. This will have a material effect on GDP growth in the second quarter. The pay-inflation gap is widening despite record low unemployment, which is also a sign of structural problems for the UK economy. Total pay growth was running above 3% in the first half of 2015, when inflation was anchored at around zero. That sweet spot is well and truly over. Real pay is falling across the economy, points out Professor Geraint Johnes, Director of Research at the Work Foundation: On the three month average measure, pay settlements fell from 2.3% in March to 2.1% in April [that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s including bonuses]. The fall in the single month measure is more dramatic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from 2.4% to 1.2% - though it should be noted that this measure is generally held to be less reliable. On the single month measure, there were falls in average weekly earnings in both the finance and construction sectors in April. There is no sector of the economy in which wages are currently rising as fast as prices. The squeeze in real wages is back, and there seems to be little prospect of an immediate recovery.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, has a few theories for why real wages are shrinking again. One could be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcslack in the labour market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - which is economist speak for the fact that the jobs market isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working as well as it could. This is usually down to underemployment: people working part-time who want a full-time job or hidden unemployment: people who are not actively looking for work but who would rejoin the workforce if the jobs market were stronger. Another factor is the problem of poor productivity. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t unique to the UK and has been an issue in many developed world economies since the financial crisis. While most economists concur that slowing productivity is one of the most serious problems in their field today, few can agree on the cause and still less on the right response. Whatever the reason, the situation looks pretty bad: The TUC, which represents Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workers, is calling on the government to act now and end its curbs on public sector pay. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says the policy (which restricts pay rises to 1%) must go. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Real wages have fallen for the second month in a row. Unless the government gets its act together, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll soon be in the middle of another cost of living crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ministers must focus on delivering better-paid jobs across the UK. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to bin the artificial pay restrictions on nurses, midwives and other public sector workers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Britain needs a pay rise, not more pressure on household budgets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The fall in UK real wages is likely to hurt economic growth, warns Naeem Aslam of Think Markets. It is the UK consumers who have been pulling the UK economy and if we see them slowing down, it surely means that economy cannot do well Brexit is certainly on the centre stage when it comes to this and I personally believe that investors are feeling the impact of this. Dutch bank ING is alarmed by the slowdown in UK pay growth, at a time when Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political future is so unclear. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sarah Rappaport is worried about the impact on the public: Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group is concerned that the link between wages and unemployment appears to have broken down (with unemployment at a 42-year low, labour scarcity should drive earnings up). Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also shows that British workers are suffering the worst wage squeeze in two and a half years. The ONS says: Between February to April 2016 and February to April 2017 in real terms (that is, adjusted for consumer price inflation) total pay for employees in Great Britain fell by 0.4%, the lowest growth rate since July to September 2014. If you include bonuses, average pay grew by 2.1%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than the 1.7% rise in regular pay, but still not enough to keep up with inflation. The Office for National Statistics says: Latest estimates show that average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain in real terms (that is, adjusted for price inflation) fell by 0.4% including bonuses, and fell by 0.6% excluding bonuses, compared with a year earlier. Breaking! Basic pay in the UK economy grew by a meagre 1.7% year-on-year in the three months to April. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much worse than expected, and also the lowest rise in regular pay since February 2016. It means that real wages are shrinking at an even faster rate than feared -- inflation was 2.7% in April (and 2.9% in May!) so pay simply isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep pace with the cost of living. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report also shows that the unemployment rate remained at a 42-year low of 4.6%. The number of people out of work fell by 50,000 in the three months to April. The employment total jumped by 109,000 during the quarter, to 31.954. More to follow! The pound is dipping back as City traders brace for the jobs report... The pound should strengthen if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage figures are less grim than feared. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says: Unemployment is likely to be decent so the focus is on earnings. Stronger-than-expected wage growth could help support sterling a touch as it will help offset concerns that falling real wages is destroying consumer spending. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation beat at 2.9% highlights the problems facing the economy so a sign that earnings are at least trying to keep pace will be welcome and allay concerns that consumers stop spending. City economists expect that total pay rose by 2.4% in the three months to April - but only by 2.0% if bonuses are stripped out. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right in 20 minutes... You can get up to speed on the state of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market with these charts from economist Rupert Seggins: The US dollar is under some pressure today ahead of the Federal Reserve decision, which is helping nudge the pound up. With an interest rate hike today \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpriced in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, traders are focusing on the tone of the decision from the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Open Market Committee. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale expects the Fed to sound cautious about the long-term path for interest rates. The FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response is likely to be a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdovish hike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s priced in, to a large degree. Uncertain about how much slack there is in the economy or the labour market, FOCM members are inclined to want to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnormalise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rates while they have the chance, but they seem very pragmatic about the longer-term outlook. So more likely to raise rates now, without overlay hawkish commentary, and then lay the groundwork for another hike in the autumn if markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take fright in the weeks ahead. In the City, the FTSE 250 index - which contains medium-sized UK-focused firms - has jumped by 0.5% in early trading. Housebuilder Bellway is the biggest riser, up 3.6%, after reporting that customer demand for new homes is still strong. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index is flat, although its housebuilders (Taylor Wimpey, Barratt and Persimmon) are all rising. Guardian Business has launched a daily email.

For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Sterling is rising in early trading, hitting its highest level since Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock general election results landed. The pound has gained a third of a cent to $1.278, as traders brace for this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK jobs report. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a little higher against the euro, at just below \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.14. The possibility that Britain could now seek a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsofter Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from the European Union is helping the pound recover. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga explains: Currency investors remained cautiously optimistic over a softer Brexit following last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK election outcome, resulting in a hung parliament. Although the political uncertainty in the UK and pending Brexit negotiations are still in focus, much attention will be directed towards the UK jobs report this morning. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living squeeze will be dragged back into the spotlight today, when the latest employment data is released. City economists fear today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures will show that wages are falling further behind inflation, which has been driven up to 2.9% in May by the weak pound (as we learned yesterday). Basic pay rises (excluding bonuses) are expected to have fallen to 2.0% in the three months to April. That would mean real wages have kept falling this year, bringing more pain to struggling families across the country. On a more positive note, the unemployment rate may remain at a 42-year low (last month it fell to 4.6% , the lowest since 1975), and the employment total probably kept rising in the last quarter. RBC Capital Markets say: Unless last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains somehow turn out to be a total blip, it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too surprising if the level of employment rises again by close to a triple-digit number of thousands in the three months to April. The rotation of workers out of part-time roles into full-time employment is now an established theme and if we see this trend once more it would imply that slack is being partially eroded as a result of reduced \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunderemployment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a big day for the US economy. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, the Federal Reserve, is widely expected to raise interest rates today - to a target range of 1% to 1.25% (from 0.75% to 1%). Fed chair Janet Yellen will then face the press and give her views on the state of the economy. Wall Street experts predict she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try to squash speculation that the Fed is too hawkish. As Lew Alexander, chief economist at Nomura, put it (via Marketwatch): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We do expect her to try to be somewhat forceful in conveying...to market participants that their skepticism over hikes after the June meeting may not be warranted.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We also get new eurozone unemployment figures, plus new retail sales and inflation statistics from America. European stock markets are expected to be flattish, as investors hunker down ahead of the Fed decision tonight.

Tesco, meanwhile, operates nearly 2,500 convenience stores under its Express and One Stop banners. Tesco and Booker say the deal, which is the subject of a competition investigation, is not about stores but cashing in on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd food market which is growing faster than retail sales as more Britons opt to eat out. </p> <p>A decision to sell up is likely to cause controversy among Nisa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s members, because its raison d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122etre is to help them compete with supermarket giants such as Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Nisa describes itself as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153family of independent grocers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and when it launched in the late 70s, the goal of the Northern Independents Supermarket Association was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to protect the interests of independents against the insurgence of the national supermarket chains\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. </p> <p>Nisa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1,400 members operate 2,500 shops, and some entrepreneurs run small chains.

                "bodyText":"Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is closing in on a \u00c2\u00a3130m deal to acquire the convenience chain Nisa as the industry rushes to consolidate following Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a33.7bn swoop on rival Booker. The board of Nisa, which is owned by its shopkeeper members, recently hired bankers to advise on its strategic options in light of the proposed Tesco-Booker alliance, which some regard as a tectonic shift in UK convenience retailing. It is understood that following talks with potential suitors, which included the Co-op and Morrisons, Nisa is poised to recommend Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to its members as its preferred bidder. Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover of Booker, the wholesaler behind the Londis and Budgens chains, has set a cat among the pigeons in a market where around 80% of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 41,000-plus convenience stores are still independent or belong to buying groups such as Nisa or Costcutter - known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153symbol groups\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the industry. Booker has around 5,400 stores in its network, which trade under the Premier, Londis, Budgens and Family Shopper brands. Tesco, meanwhile, operates nearly 2,500 convenience stores under its Express and One Stop banners. Tesco and Booker say the deal, which is the subject of a competition investigation, is not about stores but cashing in on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd food market which is growing faster than retail sales as more Britons opt to eat out. A decision to sell up is likely to cause controversy among Nisa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s members, because its raison d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122etre is to help them compete with supermarket giants such as Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Nisa describes itself as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153family of independent grocers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and when it launched in the late 70s, the goal of the Northern Independents Supermarket Association was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to protect the interests of independents against the insurgence of the national supermarket chains\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Nisa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1,400 members operate 2,500 shops, and some entrepreneurs run small chains. The group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest customer is the McColl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s convenience chain. The sale of Nisa, which would include members receiving a payout, would be akin to a demutualisation. According to last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual report, the retailer has around 1,400 members who hold between 1 and 250 shares each. According to the 2016 annual report, there are just under 60,000 shares in issue. Nisa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unusual ownership structure could block any deal, however, because 75% of members, many of whom are fiercely proud of their independence, must back it. They rejected bids from Nisa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arch rival Costcutter in both 2006 and 2009. Industry sources suggest it is not a done deal yet from Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s point of view because it is yet to carry out due diligence. Nisa members own their own stores, and their potential trading relationship with a Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s-owned entity remains unclear. Some suggest it could form the basis of the supermarket\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed franchise network. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s said last month that it was considering offering franchise deals to independent retailers because it was struggling to find suitable convenience stores. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Co-op would have been a better fit for its mutual values,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one source familiar with the deal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is just a PLC trying to do what Tesco has done. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an extreme outcome, Nisa has no need to sell itself.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nisa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Nick Read, has led a turnaround of the business after it lost \u00c2\u00a33m in 2015. It swung back into black in 2016, recording a \u00c2\u00a37.3m profit on sales of \u00c2\u00a31.3bn. The group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial problems stemmed from the loss of \u00c2\u00a3500m in sales in 2014 after Costcutter switched to the rival supplier Palmer &amp; Harvey. Nisa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contract with McColl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, which ends next year, is currently out to tender with a handful of rivals competing to poach the business. Its loss would land another blow to Nisa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances. At Nisa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual trade show in April, Read said the combination of Tesco and Booker would create a more formidable competitor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be an enormous amount of pain and consequently quite a bit of fallout,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. The mainstream grocery industry is in a state of flux as the German discounters Aldi and Lidl grab market share. There is also a growing threat from internet rivals such as Amazon, which sent supermarket stocks around the world into decline on Friday when it announced a $13.7bn (\u00c2\u00a310.7bn) takeover of the organic food chain Whole Foods Market. Under the leadership of Mike Coupe, Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has sought to broaden its appeal with last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a31.4bn purchase of Argos.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap. Britain has a new interest rate policymaker, after the government appointed LSE professor Silvana Tenreyro to the Bank of England. City experts have welcomed appointment of Tenreyro, who studied at Harvard and has Argentinian, Italian and UK citizenship, to the Monetary Policy Committee. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been described as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit critic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, given her concerns over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU and the impact of rising inequality. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what the papers are saying. Economists reckon she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less likely to vote for an interest rate rise than her predecessor, Kristin Forbes (one of three MPC members who wanted to raise borrowing costs this week). European stock markets are enjoying their best day in two months, after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s French parliamentary elections proved another triumph for Emmanuel Macron. Paris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC index has lead the way, up 1.2%, with other markets also gaining ground. The euro faded, though, after a small bounce when the results came in last night. Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s La R\u00c3\u00a9publique En Marche (La REM) party, and its centre-right ally Modem, won 350 of the 577 lower house seats between them. This leaves Macron with a clear mandate to reshuffle his cabinet and implement economic reforms, say City experts. Some also predict protests from unions, though. Sterling has remained steady, as UK and EU officials began the Brexit talks in Brussels. The pound is hovering around $1.2765, down just 0.1% today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to know whether Britain will \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchave its cake and eat it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, or end up swallowing humble pie. But we do know that the two sides have had cake for lunch - in what looks like some tongue-in-cheek humour by the EU side. The Brexit talks haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t caused any alarm in the City, yet. The FTSE 100 has gained 65 points, or almost 1%, in a sweltering session. Chris Beauchamp at IG says: The long-awaited beginning of discussions between the UK and the EU has been greeted with an impressive bounce for both UK and European stocks. The rally today has been broad-based, with European markets seeing a return of buyers after weeks of indecision. An ongoing fall in the euro is certainly helping to make life easier for European stocks, while further sterling weakness is helping to lift the FTSE 100. The summer is supposed to be a tough period for stocks, with gains fleeting in duration, but the solid pickup in risk appetite at the beginning of the week is very encouraging, despite the lightness of the macro and corporate calendars. US tech stocks are also recovering from last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff, with Amazon hitting a fresh record high. The rally may not be over yet.... That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Professor Costas Milas, of the Management School at the University of Liverpool, tells me that Silvana Tenreyro is a well-respected economist with a deep understanding of monetary policy. He believes Tenreyro could take a dovish approach at the Bank England, if the UK economic picture deteriorates. Professor Milas writes: She has pretty robust knowledge of monetary policy issues and, in fact she has researched on this very area finding that (in the US) monetary policy is more powerful in expansions than in recessions. So, if she believes her work (which I think she does) and to the extent that changes in the policy rate have limited impact in a recession, then central banks will be more likely to need to resort to other (unconventional) monetary policy measures to achieve the desired expansionary effect! Hence, she will turn out a dove if she believes that a slowdown is imminent! In other news... Argentina is planning to issue 100-year bonds to the market. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister has announced the plan over Twitter today: According to Bloomberg, the debt will yield a tasty 8.25% - a much better rate than you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get from most other government bonds. But investors should tread carefully. Argentina has defaulted several times in the past, most famously during the financial crisis of 2001. Bloomberg has more details. The Financial Times says the government have appointed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a staunch critic of Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee. [Professor Tenreyno\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] views on Brexit are that it will damage the UK economy and she has said this in public \u00e2\u20ac\u201d in her response to the FT survey and in signing a letter from economists urging a vote to remain in the EU, ahead of the referendum last year. In response to the FT New Year survey she said her pessimism about Brexit had not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moved much\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd since the EU referendum. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it will have a negative impact on the UK economy and Europe more generally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she added. She added that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit of leaving the single market and the customs union might substantially reduce immigration. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The effects on the UK economy will certainly be negative \u00e2\u20ac\u201d many firms will need to rethink and reorganise production as they lose talented workers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Independent describes her views on monetary policy as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunconservative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. In July 2015, she said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reforming the monetary system to allow negative policy interest rates will equip the [Bank of England] with an additional tool to face potential crises in the future\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She also said that it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worth experimenting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with an increase in the minimum wage and that this could help stimulate the wider economy. Further, she opposed the plans of the former Chancellor, George Osborne, to run a budget surplus by 2020, saying that this consolidation was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too brisk and could hamper a healthy recovery\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Reuters call Tenreyro a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trade-focused economist\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, who will join the Bank at a critical time. She will replace the strongest advocate for a rate hike on the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee, meaning economists will scrutinise her opinions even more closely than usual. Tenreyro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work has focused on issues including trade and wage growth, both of which are important factors for the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking as Britain prepares to leave the European Union and as pay increases have fallen behind inflation. Technology shares are leading the rally on Wall Street today. Amazon are up 1.44%, as traders continue to applaud its takeover of Whole Foods, while Apple have gained 1.7%. Newsflash: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones industrial average has hit a record high at the start of trading in New York. The Dow gained 70 points to 21,454, up 0.33%. The Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 are also climbing higher at the open. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Silvana Tenreyro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CV is most impressive. Seven pages long, it includes more than twenty positions (not including her current job at the LSE), a dozen honours, grants and awards, and 17 published papers. Veteran City economist George Magnus is also a fan: Harvard economics professor Robert Barro has told Reuters that Silvana Tenreyro is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgreat appointment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the Bank of England. Barro supervised Tenreyro when she was studying for her PhD (which she got in 2002), and says she is very knowledgeable about \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceconomic fluctuations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and the role that monetary policy can play: Ben Chu of the Independent has spotted that professor Tenreyro was critical of the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity programme..... ...and in favour of negative interest rates being imposed in a crisis: Some more snap analysis from the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Giles (based on her answers to the CFM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surveys) Silvana Tenreyro has argued that Britain needs a new industrial policy to help it cope with Brexit. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to a regular survey by the Centre For Macroeconomics, who poll a range of economic experts. In February, Tenreyro said: Brexit will change many aspects of the UK economy. There is still uncertainty about the scope and consequences that Brexit will have on the economy. (Let us not forget that Brexit has not happened yet!). I think the UK needs to think about industrial policy among many other policies. It is far from clear, however, that industrial policy will solve the problems the economy will likely face or that it will be enough to boost long term growth. The shape industrial policy takes will matter a lot. With industrial policy, the devil is in the details. And last July, she said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153misleading politicians\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had encouraged people to vote for Brexit. Asked for the most likely reason that a majority of UK voters went against the near unanimous advice of the economics profession, she replied: Immigration certainly played a role in the exit vote, and many voters (partly encouraged by misleading politicians) thought immigration was to be blamed for their problems, while those problems are more complex and date longer. Skill-biased technological progress, globalization, and the fall of unions have created winners and losers, and the latter have not been compensated for their losses. They saw their standards of living deteriorate since the late 1970s, while at the same time salaries at the top of the distribution rocketed. Inequality is a critical issue in the UK and the West that needs to be addressed. Brexit was mostly an angry vote against the lack of progress of the bottom half. More details here. Andreas Wallstr\u00c3\u00b6m, chief analyst at Nordea Markets, thinks the Treasury have made an astute hire: Andy Bruce of Reuters flags up that Tenreyro signed a letter in May 2016 warning that Brexit would harm the economy. Chris Giles of the Financial Times points out that she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change her view after the referendum.... Jordan Rochester of Nomura reckons that Tenreyro is less likely to push for an interest rate rise than the outgoing Kristen Forbes, who voted for a rate hike last week. Relative to the hawkish person she is replacing (Forbes) and the view that new members do not usually jump straight into a bias, we would assume a slight swing to a more dovish vote. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am delighted to appoint Professor Silvana Tenreyro as the new external member of the Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of England. I am confident that Professor Tenreyro will be a strong addition to the MPC, bringing a wealth of economic experience and academic rigour to the Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deliberations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: Britain has a new interest rate setter -- London School of Economics professor Silvana Tenreyro. Professor Tenreyro has just been named as the next external member of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). She will join the MPC on 1 July, replacing Kristin Forbes whose term expires on 30 June 2017. Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, says Tenreyro has important skills in the dynamics of the labour market -- an important issue, given Britain is struggling with weak productivity and falling real wages. Carney says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am delighted to welcome Silvana Tenreyro to the Monetary Policy Committee and am very much looking forward to working with her. Her extensive and varied academic experience \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on the monetary transmission mechanism, the dynamics of productivity, trade, housing issues as well as wage dynamics, to name just a few \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will be invaluable to the Committee as it seeks to promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom through maintaining monetary stability.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tenreyro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CV shows that she has British, Italian and Argentine citizenships. She has a degree from the National University of Tucuman, Argentina, and a PhD from Harvard University. She lists her academic interest as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Macroeconomics, growth, macro-development, monetary economics, international economics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She has written academic papers on a wide range of issues including the impact of monetary policy, wage dynamics and currency unions (all important issues of the day). Shares in almost every major company listed on the Paris stock market have risen this morning. Thirty six members of the CAC40 index of blue-chip French companies are up, with just four lagging behind. This means the CAC is holding onto this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1% jump; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently 35 points higher at 4173. Industrial firms are leading the rally, including steelmaker ArcelorMittal and aeroplane maker Airbus. Banks, such as BNP Paribas, Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale,and Credit Agricole, are also gaining ground. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, gives the credit to Emmanuel Macron: European equity markets are in positive territory this morning as the political success of Emmanuel Macron in France has boosted investor confidence. Mr Macron was tipped to gain a majority and that he did, and traders welcomed the news as political stability in Europe is a welcome change. With his parliamentary majority secured, Emmanuel Macron has flown to the Paris Air show in a military transport jet. The French president landed at the Bourget airfield in an Airbus A400-M military transport plane to launch the aviation showcase. His arrival was followed by a flypast by the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest passenger plane, the Airbus A380, and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aerial display team. Reuters suggests that Macron was keen to signal his support for Airbus: The ceremony lent high-level support to two ambitious European aerospace projects tarnished by problems in recent years: the A400M because of chronic cost overruns and delays and the A380 because of weak sales that threaten its future. The Paris Air show is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest air show, and a major event for the industry. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains what to expect: Since 1909 it has been held every two years at Le Bourget Airport in north Paris \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where Charles Lindbergh landed after making the first solo, non-stop transatlantic flight in 1927, between New York and Paris. Crowds will be wowed by spectacular flying displays, but in business terms the 52nd air show is likely to be a more subdued affair. Aviation experts say aircraft makers will bag far fewer orders than in previous years, as low oil prices have relieved pressure on airlines to replace older planes. In any case, Airbus and Boeing have been struggling to deliver due to problems with their supply chains. As usual, the two arch rivals will be seeking to outdo each other at the air show. Boeing will reveal the new 737 Max-10, an upgraded version of its bestselling single-aisle 737 plane. The American company is also expected to unveil plans for a new highly efficient medium-sized aircraft. Airbus, for its part, will unveil plans for an enhanced A380, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A380plus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with new large winglets that will save fuel. Airbus and Boeing face new competitors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Comac C-919 and Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s United Aircraft Corporation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MC-21 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which will not be at the show. A new arrival at the event is Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which will show off Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first commercial aircraft in 50 years, the MRJ regional jet, which has been beset with delays. In another highlight, Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Embraer is showing three aircraft \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the military transport plane KC-390, the commercial E195 airliner and the Legacy 450 business jet. But when the event opens to the public at the end of the week, the Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jet looks to dazzle spectators with its circus acrobatics. Back in Brussels, David Davis and Michel Barnier have shaken hands for the cameras as the Brexit negotiations begin. Both men struck a positive tone before the press, Davis pledged to do everything possible to achieve a deal that works for all citizens, while Barnier said he hopes to agree a timetable for the negotiations today: My colleague Jennifer Rankin has the details: Our Politics Live blog will be tracking all the action: Just in: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building sector outperformed the rest of Europe in April. New figures from Eurostat show that French construction output jumped by 3.5% during April, after a 5.3% slump in March. Across the whole eurozone, output rose by just 0.3% month-on-month, with housebuilding activity picking up but civil engineering contracting. Output across the wider European Union was flat month-on-month. Eurostat explains: Among Member States for which data are available, the highest increases in production in construction were recorded in Sweden (+3.8%), France (+3.5%) and the Czech Republic (+1.6%), and the largest decreases in Romania (-7.7%), Italy (-4.1%) and Hungary (-2.6%). The pound is crept back over $1.28 this morning, up 0.25%. Traders are watching events in Brussels, as David Davis and Michel Barnier begin negotiating Brexit. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect any major developments The UK position is as clear as mud\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 beyond growing signs that the UK wants free trade without being part of the customs union or conceding grounds on border controls. Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably range-bound. Any rally triggered by \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hopes is probably temporary. Julien Manceaux, senior France economist at ING, predicts that Macron will kick off his most \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unpopular\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd labour reforms in the first few months of his presidency. That would let him capitalise on his honeymoon with voters; even so, there is still likely to be resistance to cutting workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 protections and entitlements. As Manceaux puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The mandate for reform is not extremely strong for Mr Macron who could hence endure strong civil opposition, especially to his labour and pension reforms. (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s via the FT) Here are the official results from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s French parliamentary election, showing how Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s REM party, and his allies in the Modem party, won a substantial majority. The French stock market has jumped by almost 1% at the start of trading, as Parisian traders applaud Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win. The CAC 40 index has gained 39 points, or 0.95%, to 4177, which is a two-week high. Other markets are also showing healthy gains, on relief that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new president won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t face a deadlocked parliament (there had been worries that his new party wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to win a majority). In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 52 points to 7515. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: The positive opening comes as traders welcome another Macron victory in France, this time in Parliamentary elections, which give hope to him passing reforms that can help both the French economy and thus Europe, There is also optimism about a positive start to UK-EU Brexit negotiations which kick off today in Brussels. But.... the poor turnout in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election is causing some analysts to question whether Macron has really energised France. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services warns: The focus will be on how French President Macron turns words into action after securing a solid parliamentary majority, though not as large as opinion polls had suggested, and with a very poor 43.5% turnout underlining a great deal of scepticism among the general public as a whole. Emmanuel Macron now has a free hand to drive his policies through, say Royal Bank of Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategists. We reiterate our view that there is no real opposition to the proposed economic reforms left on the political side - with only the street and unions likely to oppose the measures. The scale of En Marche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory gives Macron an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incredible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd position to push reforms through, says Elliot Hentov, head of policy and research for EMEA at State Street Global Advisors. But there could still be protests on the streets, he adds, against Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to make it easier to lay off workers or cut wages. Macron will enjoy one of the largest majorities in French history. A large portion of these new parliamentarians are new to national politics and this reinforces the sense that a wholesale political revolution has taken place. Most importantly, it affirms that Macron will have incredible leeway in pushing his domestic agenda. Markets should therefore expect that labour reforms should pass, as should changes to the tax code and pension system. The impact could be structural and two-fold, both in boosting French investment and productivity gains as well as in setting the stage for more audacious reforms of the Eurozone. Nonetheless, Macron will still face public hostility to his reforms, possibly in the streets but not in parliament, but after yesterday, that will likely be expressed in burning tires rather than parliamentary machinations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With an absolute majority comes absolute responsibility, says Le Figaro, as it splashes on Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relief in European financial markets this morning after French president Emmanuel Macron won another landmark victory. The La R\u00c3\u00a9publique en Marche (La REM) party, and its centrist allies the Democratic Movement (Modem), have secured a large majority in the French parliament, claiming around 350 of the 577 seats up for grabs. This gives Macron the muscle he needs to implement his plans to change French labour law, and overhaul unemployment benefits and pensions. Getting those reforms enacted will be a struggle - as previous French leaders have discovered. Investors, though, will be pleased to see that Macron is now in a position to push through the promises he made during his successful presidential bid this year. That relief has sent all Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main stock markets up in early trading, by around 0.75% (full details to follow). Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government spokesman Christophe Castaner, said the new party (created less than two years ago) now has to deliver: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The French people have given us a clear majority, but they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to give us a blank cheque. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a responsibility. The real victory will be in five years time when things will have really changed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a strong majority, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a will for things to change.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, there are also concerns that the turnout slumped to a record low - showing how many voters are disenchanted with politics. The pound could be skittish today, as the formal talks over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union begin (nearly a year after the historic Brexit referendum). David Davis, UK Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, will sit down with Michel Barnier, the European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Negotiator, to lay out their opening positions. Given Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fragile political situation, EU leaders fear that talks will collapse - resulting in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brutal Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Guardian reports this morning that: As officials began gathering in Brussels on Sunday night, the long-awaited start of negotiations was overshadowed by political chaos back in Westminster, where chancellor Philip Hammond warned that failing to strike a deal would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a very, very bad outcome\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The EU side fears that, in reality, the British government will struggle to maintain any position without falling apart in the coming months, because, without support from the Democratic Unionist party, May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiating hand is limited. There are also concerns that any DUP backing to give May a majority in the House of Commons would come with strings attached. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit fears that the talks could be tough: Also coming up, a new healthcheck on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders and the start of the Paris Air Show. 10am BST: Eurozone construction output for April All day: Paris Air Show, Day 1",

AM Unison\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual conference is underway in Brighton and the squeeze on living standards is on the agenda. The trade union, which represents more than 1.3 million workers who provide public services, is calling for an end to pay freezes and austerity. Here is what Dave Prentis, general secretary, had to say: We live in a kingdom dangerously divided into the haves and the have-nots. Some are living in misery and poverty \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or even in extreme danger as we have seen last week. The catastrophe at Grenfell Tower was the epitome of a tale of two cities. People living in wealth and luxury side by side with those living in poverty. The Prime Minister appears to be unable to give the support people need or be the leader this country wants. This contrasts with the warmth and compassion shown by the public, and the bravery shown by the heroes of the emergency services. Public service champions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including nurses, hospital porters and council workers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are working together and supporting each other. We live in a country full of heroes. Jeremy Corbyn is the man capable of taking this country in the right direction. Some said he was unelectable but people saw hope and someone worth voting for. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a man who can be Prime Minister.It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for a Labour government with our values and our manifesto. A manifesto against job cuts, police cuts and pay freezes that ends the senseless pain of austerity. This government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity pay policies have crushed public services under their heel. They have ground down public service employees. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re worried about their jobs, their families and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go through another five years of poverty pay. Now is the time to shout enough is enough. This is the year to smash the pay cap. The Scottish National Party says Bank of England governor Mark Carney delivered a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153blunt Brexit reality check\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when he made his annual Mansion House speech this morning. Stewart Hosie MP: Today the governor of the Bank of England confirmed that Brexit is beginning to bite hard \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that our economy and people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wages are bearing the brunt. His speech paints an extremely depressing picture. It is fundamentally unfair, when Scotland voted expressly against this eventuality, that the Tories continue to drag us towards the hard Brexit cliff edge, putting jobs and growth at risk. The SNP has set out our position in clear terms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we want Scotland to maintain our place in the single market, to maintain our place in the customs union and will work hard to protect jobs and wages. The need for this approach has been underlined by Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Tories cannot continue to ignore Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voice. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, has given his take on the latest market moves. Here in the UK... The FTSE 100 erased early forex-induced gains by the afternoon when energy sector shares slumped alongside the price of oil. Investors were also weighing up the implications of fraud charges against former Barclays executives. Broader stock markets have been weathering the three-week slide in the oil price on the assumption prices will stay within the price range seen over the past 12 months. The further we move below $50 per barrel, the more worrisome the bruising taken by oil prices gets for stocks. And over in the US: Stocks in the US turned lower in early trading. Another day of record highs might be scuppered by concern around the persistent downtrend in oil and other commodity prices. Apart from sending Amazon shares to new stratospheric levels, the deal to buy Whole Foods has been a negative force on the US stock market. US markets are slightly down in early trading: Dow Jones: -0.03% at 21,521 S&amp;P 500: -0.3% at 2,446 Nasdaq: -0.2% at 5,758 Oil prices have fallen to seven-month lows after news of increases in supply from several key producers. Brent crude is down sharply: Elsewhere in Europe, major markets are mixed. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.04% at 12,894 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.2% at 5,320 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.5% at 20,909 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.5% at 10,799 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.2% at 391 The FTSE 250, which is more UK-focused than the FTSE 100, is down 0.4% at 19,796. A weaker pound is often a plus for the FTSE 100 where companies tend to be internationally focused. It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the case at the moment however as a falling oil price in dragging down commodity stocks. Brent crude is down 2.6% at $45.68 a barrel. The FTSE 100 is currently down 16 points or 0.2% at 7,508. Here is the list of the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest fallers: Labour MP Chuka Umunna has commented on Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mansion House speech. Speaking as a supporter of Open Britain, the campaign against a so-called hard Brexit, Umunna said: The chancellor is absolutely right that nobody voted in the referendum to become poorer. That is why it is vital that the government negotiates a Brexit deal that puts jobs and our economy first. To do so, the government needs to recognise that it cannot continue to threaten a Brexit with no deal at all. And they should reopen the possibility of keeping Britain in the single market and customs union, which would be the best option for our economy. Time for a recap: The pound has fallen sharply after Bank of England governor Mark Carney argued against raising UK interest rates. In his delayed Mansion House speech, Carney argued that the UK economy is too weak to support higher borrowing costs, especially as Brexit is at a critical point. Carney told an audience in London that: From my perspective, given the mixed signals on consumer spending and business investment, and given the still subdued domestic inflationary pressures, in particular anaemic wage growth, now is not yet the time to begin that adjustment. In the coming months, I would like to see the extent to which weaker consumption growth is offset by other components of demand, whether wages begin to firm, and more generally, how the economy reacts to the prospect of tighter financial conditions and the reality of Brexit negotiations. This has knocked almost a cent off the pound, to $1.2654 - close to a two-month low. City analysts say Carney has calmed speculation that interest rates could rise soon, after three policymakers voted for a hike last week. Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s added to the pressure on sterling, by warning that it needn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait for Brexit to be concluded before changing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating. Chancellor Philip Hammond also used the Mansion House speech to argue for UK businesses to be protected from Brexit damage, through a transition deal. The car industry has voiced its concerns too; saying that a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccliff-edge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit would be the worst option for the sector. And in other news, Tesco is facing customer complaints after a computer problem led to home delivery orders being cancelled. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says concerns over Brexit are weighing on the pound. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on top of Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech arguing against raising UK interest rates anytime soon. Otunuga explains: Sterling was in trouble during Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading session with prices tumbling to a weekly low at 1.266 after Mark Carney suggested that interest rates should be kept on hold amid Brexit uncertainty. It is becoming clear that the rising fears of Brexit negotiations negatively impacting economic growth continues to weigh heavily on sentiment while prolonged periods of uncertainty has ensured Pound weakness remains a recurrent theme. With both consumer spending and business investments dishing out mixed signals, and tepid wage growth still a cause for concern, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153now is not yet the time to raise interest rates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd according to Mark Carney. The pound is falling further against the euro too, down almost one eurocent at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.134. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a one-week low, and close to the eight-month low of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1276 hit after June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK general election. Rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have warned that it could downgrade the UK before the terms of the Brexit deal are known, putting even more pressure on the pound. S&amp;P sovereign ratings chief Moritz Kraemer told Reuters that S&amp;P needn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait until the negotiations have been concluded in 2019. Asked if it would wait until the end of the Brexit negotiations to take another ratings action on Britain, Kraemer said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will review the UK every six months... and if necessary more often... We will be watching the economic implications, the implications for the public finances, the constitutional implications like the whole Scotland situation...and things like the currency and if it will maintain its reserve status.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd S&amp;P slashed the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating by two-notches to AA , from Triple A, after the Brexit vote last summer. It currently has a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnegative outlook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the debt, suggesting another cut is possible. That has given currency traders another reason to sell the pound, which is still bruised by Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments this morning. This \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccandlestick formation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shows how sterling has fallen to a one-week low of $1.266, down 0.5%, and is barely above the two-month low struck after the UK election results. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carmakers have added their weight to calls for Britain to agree a transition deal after it leaves the EU. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders warned that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cliff-edge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit was the worst possible outcome for the automotive industry. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We accept that we are leaving the European Union and we share the desire for that departure to be a success. But our biggest fear is that, in two years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time, we fall off a cliff edge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no deal, outside the single market and customs union and trading on inferior WTO terms. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This would undermine our competitiveness and our ability to attract the investment that is critical to future growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The auto industry provides 12.0% of total UK export of goods, according to the SMMT, with 169,000 people employed directly in manufacturing, and over 800,000 in the wider industry. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Tesco is busy apologising to customers caught up in its home delivery problems. It says: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re currently experiencing an IT issue which is affecting some Grocery Home Shopping orders. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working hard to fix this problem and apologise to customers for any inconvenience this may cause.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Its social media team are handling a lot of criticism too: In other news....Tesco customers are reporting problems with the supermarket giant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home delivery service. Many are complaining on social media that their orders have been cancelled. According to a company spokesman, around 10% of orders have been affected. Tesco is blaming a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153computer glitch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and offering a \u00c2\u00a310 voucher as compensation, according to the BBC. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a few of the customers affected: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, on Mark Carney and Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speeches this morning: For analysts who were awaiting Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to the BoE policy meeting last week, this announcement has dampened expectations of a significant policy change in the near future, with the governor citing low wage growth and mixed signals on consumer spending as the reasons for his decision. There were some positives for investors from Hammond however, as he proposed arrangements for a transitionary period during the Brexit process and beyond which would see the customs union rules remain in place for the UK until new rules are implemented and other measures agreed that would protect the city and prevent disruption.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Taken at face value, Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insistence that interest rates would stay at rock bottom levels until the smoke had cleared from the Brexit talks was quite a rebuke to colleagues who voted for a rate rise only last week. The Bank of England governor was in combative mood as he listed the many reasons for keeping the base rate at 0.25%, not least the febrile atmosphere inside City trading rooms. Michael Saunders, Kristin Forbes and Ian McCafferty were the three members on the monetary policy committee to warn that rising inflation needed to be calmed by an increase in rates. You might think they would seem foolish now that a slap from the governor is visible on their livid cheeks. But it is more likely that the governor was quite content to see the huge amount of coverage in the news media for the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dissenting minority. The slap, if we can call it that, was staged. Knowing that rates cannot rise without thousands of businesses going bust and millions of households getting into financial trouble, Carney is playing a game. With the economy struggling as Brexit talks begin, the dangers are apparent. For this reason he must talk tough to prevent consumers heaping more cheap credit on their already huge borrowing, thereby creating a dangerous lending bubble. At the same time he wants to keep the credit wheels turning to keep the economy from falling over. He can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do this alone. The committee needs to play its part. We must assume that Forbes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacement, the London School of Economics professor Silvana Tenreyro, and whoever takes over from Charlotte Hogg, have been briefed. The drop in the pound has pushed up the value of multinational companies listed in London, as their overseas earnings are now more valuable. Global advertising giant WPP is leading the way, up 2.2%. Other gainers include luxury fashion chain Burberry (+1.5%) and consumer good titan Unilever (+1.2%). This has nudged the FTSE 100 up by 11 points to 7535, close to the alltime closing high of 7547. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcintraday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 high for the FTSE 100 is 7598. Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s caution suggests that UK interest rates will remain at their current record low throughout 2017, and possibly until 2019, says Howard Archer of the EY Item Club. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious stance fuels our belief that interest rates will not be rising any time soon, given a stuttering UK economy and uncertainties over its outlook.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We maintain the view that the Bank of England will hold off from raising interest rates in 2017. A tightening in 2018 also looks highly questionable given the cloudy outlook Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Mark Carney has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153emphatically\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd distanced himself from the three hawkish MPC members who voted to raise interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% last week. So says Sam Hill of Royal Bank of Canada. He adds: Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reference to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coming months\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd implies that his vote for an unchanged policy stance is set to prevail at the August Inflation Report, and beyond whilst these uncertainties are resolved. Whilst there are still many members we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heard from since the election purdah period ended (Haldane comments will be published tomorrow), it is significant that the Governor has now shown that the range of views on the Committee is broad, with his own being distinctly different to those who voted for a hike last week. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also worth remembering that the most hawkish MPC member, Kristin Forbes, steps down at the end of the month. Her replacement, Silvana Tenreyro, is expected to be more dovish. Mark Carney comments come just a week after UK inflation rate jumped to 2.9%, well over the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target, and much faster than wages. So if the Bank resists pressure to raise interest rates to curb inflation, workers may suffer falling real wages for even longer. Kathleen Brooks, currency expert at cityindex.co.uk, explains: This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments are important because they suggest that the Bank of England will look through the period of high inflation, headline CPI is running at 2.9%, blaming the rise on the sharp drop in sterling last year. This could spell more woe for the UK consumer, if the BOE is not going to take action to bring down prices, this could keep the squeeze on pay packets for some time. She also suspects that the pound could keep falling: In the very short term we are looking at $1.2650 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the bottom of the range from the last 10-days - if we break below here it would be a short-term bearish development.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mark Carney has laid a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a thick layer of dovishness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over the City today, says Neil Wilson of ETX Capital. He writes: Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnow is not the time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to tighten should hardly be a surprise, given his record of favouring looser monetary policy, but it does reiterate the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preference for looking through the current high levels of inflation for the time being. However, inflationary pressure could still force the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hand, he adds: There are plenty who think that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to cut last summer following the Brexit vote was folly and rising inflation offers a chance to correct that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcerror\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. However the departure of arch-hawk Kristin Forbes leaves those calling for tightening in a greater minority than before This is from Alpesh Paleja, the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s principal economist: Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments show that the Bank of England is not inching close to a rate hike, says Mike Bird of the WSJ: Allie Renison of the Institute of Directors is struck by Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctransitional deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to help firms cope with Brexit. The Telegraph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Deacon knows exactly who Carney was aiming for, with his comment about Brexit being a piece of cake: Apologies, there was a daft typo in that earlier entry about the pound. To be clear, the pound has fallen to $1.2675, a one-week low, down from $1.275 before Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech hit the wires. Sterling is also down 0.5% against the euro, to 87.9p from 87.4p. That means one pound buys \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.137, from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.142 earlier this morning. Hope that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear! Many thanks to all those who pointed it out. Carney concludes his speech by questioning whether Brexit will be a cakewalk - a mischievous nod to Brexiteers who argued that Britain can \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchave its cake and eat it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 after it leaves the EU. The governor says the success, or otherwise, of Brexit depends on whether the two sides can agree a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctransition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 arrangement (something Philip Hammond also called for today). Carney says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Depending on whether and when any transition arrangement can be agreed, firms on either side of the channel may soon need to activate contingency plans. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Before long, we will all begin to find out the extent to which Brexit is a gentle stroll along a smooth path to a land of cake and consumption.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney has a chilly warning for Britons -- Brexit is going to hurt the economy, and he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop that happening. However, the Bank can balance how this pain is shared; either through unemployment, or inflation, depending on how it sets interest rates. Monetary policy cannot prevent the weaker real income growth likely to accompany the transition to new trading arrangements with the EU. But it can influence how this hit to incomes is distributed between job losses and price rises. Carney has also warned that Britain will suffer badly if the City of London faces higher barriers to trade: One million people across this country work in financial services. The industry contributes 7% of output and pays taxes that cover almost two thirds of the cost of the NHS. At a time when the UK is running a 5% current account deficit, financial services runs a 1.5% trade surplus with Europe alone. The entire service sector runs a 5% surplus with the world and employs 85% of UK workers. We could take these realities for granted. And it would be all too easy to give into protectionism. But as we learned in the 1930s, that road leads neither to equity nor prosperity. Raising barriers to trade disproportionately hurts the least well off through higher prices and fewer opportunities. Carney is also warning against the creeping tide of protectionism, saying that stronger trade is the key to boosting global growth. The governor says countries need to look outwards, not impose new barriers. The G20 faces a choice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c between levelling down by putting more restrictions on goods trade, or levelling up by liberalising trade in services. Evidence from within countries suggests that there may be substantial scope to increase trade in services if barriers are removed. For example, in Canada \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of the few countries to track trade flows within its borders \u00e2\u20ac\u201c services account for around 50% of all inter-provincial trade compared with only 25% of Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international exports. If Canada were able to replicate the pattern of trade within its borders with other countries then services exports would triple. Breaking: Sterling has fallen sharply to a one-week low as Mark Carney declares that Britain isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready for higher interest rates. The pound shed half a cent to $1.2675 against the US dollar, and is down against the euro too. The Bank of England governor is arguing that it would be wrong to raise borrowing costs now, before we know how the Brexit negotiations will play out. He also tells the audience at Mansion House this morning that wage growth is too weak to justify a rate hike. Carney acknowledges that his monetary policy committee are split on this issue (they voted 5-3 to leave rates on hold last week). But he is not ready to join the three hawks pushing for higher borrowing costs. Carney says: Different members of the MPC will understandably have different views about the outlook and therefore on the potential timing of any Bank Rate increase. But all expect that any changes would be limited in scope and gradual in pace. From my perspective, given the mixed signals on consumer spending and business investment, and given the still subdued domestic inflationary pressures, in particular anaemic wage growth, now is not yet the time to begin that adjustment. In the coming months, I would like to see the extent to which weaker consumption growth is offset by other components of demand, whether wages begin to firm, and more generally, how the economy reacts to the prospect of tighter financial conditions and the reality of Brexit negotiations. Now Mark Carney is on his feet. The Bank of England governor begins his speech by touching on the tragic events of recent weeks, which have reminded us of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fine balance between hope and despair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He says: Despair at the murder of Jo Cox [one year ago last week]. Hope in her remarkable life of service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an inspiration that lives on in her family, friends, colleagues and many admirers. Despair at the terrorist attacks in Manchester, Borough Market and Finsbury Park. Despair at the tragedy of Grenfell Tower. Hope in the heroism, resiliency and the community of the responses. Hope when we recognise our common humanity. The best tribute this City and this Country can give to the memories of those lost is to renew our shared commitment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whatever our differences \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to promote the common good. And that includes pursuing a Brexit, and building an economy, that works for all, he adds..... The key message from Philip Hammond today is that Britain can achieve a Brexit that works for the people. But it must have four strands: A comprehensive agreement on trade and services. A mutually beneficial transitional arrangement, avoiding disruption and dangerous cliff edges. Frictionless customs arrangements. An implementation period, when the UK will be outside the customs union, but customs rules will remain in place pending the new rules coming into force. Andy Sparrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Politics Liveblog is covering all the details too (in a frictionless, mutually beneficial arrangement....) Hammond fires a warning shot at those who want to take EU derivatives trading out of London. This will lead to a lower-quality, higher-priced financial services, he warns. As expected, Hammond says Britain will almost certainly need an implementation period after Brexit, so that customs border arrangements can continue. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s land border must stay open and freeflowing too, he continues -- a very hot issue, as Theresa May continues to negotiate with Northern Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DUP party. On trade, Hammond says Britain needs to be able to trade effectively with EU members after Brexit. And on migration, the chancellor reads from the (notorious) Conservative manifesto that Britain needs to keep recruiting the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brightest and the best from around the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Britain has benefitted from globalisation, he continues, but it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn a blind eye to the hostility to it in parts of the developed world. Britain is tired of austerity after seven years of it, the chancellor continues - perhaps a nod that he will loosen the pursestrings in the autumn budget. But he is still committing to eliminating the budget deficit by the end of the next decade. He also promises to provide assurances to the European Investment Bank (EIB) to ensure that funds keep flowing to UK businesses after Brexit. Onto fiscal issues. Hammond says the Conservatives are committed to keeping taxes as low as possible, to encourage growth. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also opposed to raising borrowing to fund current consumption, as that only passes the bill onto future generations. Stronger growth is the only sustainable way to deliver better public services and jobs, says Hammond. I thought we had won that argument, but the general election has shown that we must make a new case for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a market economy and sound money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Hammond (a nod to Jeremy Corbyn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than expected performance). Hammond now turns to Brexit, saying that there is much work to do. But the UK has a solid foundation, he argues. It was one of the fastest growing G7 economies in 2016. He then takes a pop at his predecessor, adding that Britain has created millions of new jobs in the last few years \u00e2\u20ac\u0153even if you only count George Osborne once\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Philip Hammond is speaking now. He begins by thanking the City of London corporation for rescheduling today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s event, after the appalling tragedy that was unfolding at Grenfell Tower. The chancellor says that Britain has suffered a series of shocking events in recent weeks - terror attacks at Manchester, London Bridge, Finsbury Park yesterday, and at Grenfell. Grenfell was an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unimaginable tragedy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Hammond continues, and his thought are with all those affected by it. The immediate priority is to make sure that that the survivors have everything they need. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all. We must also get to the bottom of the failure at Grenfell and take decisive action to make sure nothing like this happens again. You should be able to watch the Mansion House speeches on the TV news. Bloomberg are streaming it. Bloomberg expect Hammond to make the case for a softer Brexit that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause as much damage to the economy. The room at Mansion House is filling up nicely, to hear from Hammond and Carney. Helena Morrissey, head of personal investing at LGIM and a driving force to get more women into the boardroom, is there. So is conservative MPs Steve Barclay and Vicky Ford. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The great and the good of the City of London are heading to Mansion House this morning, to hear from Bank of England governor Mark Carney and chancellor Philip Hammond. The two men, who between them handle the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal and monetary levers, are expected to outline their plans to protect Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth prospects in the face of Brexit. These speeches were originally scheduled for last Thursday night, before the City of London corporation cancelled the Mansion House event altogether following the Grenfell Tower disaster. It was hardly appropriate to have City grandees hobnobbing in black tie and quaffing expensive vintages. So instead, it has been rescheduled as a breakfast event this morning. This is the first time we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard from Carney since the Bank of England was dramatically split over interest rates last week. Three policymakers voted to hike borrowing costs, startling the City, while five voted for no-change. Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech will also be closely watched. He had been expected use last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech to argue against a Hard Brexit, and call on prime minister Theresa May to ensure Britain gets a significant \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transition period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after Brexit, to help businesses adapt. Over the weekend, the chancellor hinted that he might ease up on austerity following the Conservative Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election bloody nose. As Reuters put it: Hammond had looked set to lose his job until May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election flop. He has now re-emerged as big business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leading proponent in government and might provide more details on Tuesday on how he thinks the two-year Brexit process should run. Hammond may also give more details of his budget plans after saying on Sunday that he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not deaf\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the weariness of voters to nearly a decade of spending cuts for many services and tight controls on public sector pay. Also coming up today... The other big news this morning is that the Serious Fraud Office has charged Barclays, and four former top executives, over its fundraising from Qatar during the 2008 financial crisis. We should also get more details of Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s innovative plan to issue 100-year bonds, despite having defaulted on its debts more than once....

This came as a major surprise because Mr Haldane has long been a known dove. He is going head-to-head against the Governor Mark Carney, who is fast losing support on his dovish stance. He said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a partial withdrawal of the additional policy insurance the MPC put in place last year would be prudent relatively soon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Mr Haldane said that the risk was that the Bank tightened its belt too late rather than too early. This is something which the Bank of Canada is also worried about and what the US Federal Reserve had long been wary of, and the European Central Bank better be ready for. The latter came across pretty dovish at its last meeting. With the BoE turning hawkish and ECB remaining dovish, the EUR/GBP could come under pressure in the coming days and weeks.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also sent this image of the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac-\u00c2\u00a3 exchange rate, showing how the euro hit eight month highs against the euro recently, but couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t break through 88.8p.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0959512cd945be137bf4b7503d21a243ddaad9af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0959512cd945be137bf4b7503d21a243ddaad9af/0_0_1093_709/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The euro vs the pound\" width=\"1000\" height=\"649\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The euro vs the pound</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Forex.com</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-594a718ae4b0fb1893fa136c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-21T13:16:40.382Z\">2.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkishness has helped the pound to recovery almost all of the losses suffered yesterday, after BoE governor Mark Carney explained why interest rates ought to remain at record lows.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ramincharles/status/877513447851917318\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BOE?src=hash\">#BOE</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Carney?src=hash\">#Carney</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Haldane?src=hash\">#Haldane</a> whiplash reflected in sterling volatility: ruled out rate rise yday then justify hikes today <a href=\"https://t.co/NZZcT6hfLV\">https://t.co/NZZcT6hfLV</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/dG5dZqFmIP\">pic.twitter.com/dG5dZqFmIP</a></p>&mdash; Ramin Nakisa (@ramincharles) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ramincharles/status/877513447851917318\">June 21, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-594a6a97e4b0fb1893fa132e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-21T12:51:42.567Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Lena Komileva of G+ Economics reckons there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now a 50% chance of a UK interest rate rise this year.</strong></p> <p>She says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The growing split on the MPC signals a much higher risk of tightening this year than previously expected in the markets.</p> <p>With two new members joining the MPC in the second half of the year, an active policy debate on the merits of tightening, against the optics of a strong inflation overshoot, overheating consumer credit growth, and a tight labour market, may well tilt the vote in favour of a rate hike by the year-end.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-594a5c87e4b043e55e143d1d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-21T12:37:22.674Z\">1.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Haldane effect has pushed the pound back over $1.27, a whole cent higher than this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-594a5bfce4b043e55e143d1a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-21T12:04:52.735Z\">1.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Following Andy Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech, there are now at least four Bank of England policymakers who are likely to vote for rate rises this year.</strong></p> <p>However... one of them, Kristin Forbes, leaves on 30 June.</p> <p>That leaves Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders, who both voted to raise interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% at this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKuKuK8c7UAhUJDMAKHQrcDp8QqUMIKDAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fbusiness%2Flive%2F2017%2Fjun%2F19%2Feuropean-markets-rise-ftse-euro-macron-majority-brexit-talks-business-live&amp;usg=AFQjCNEh4xXwl1LweGTb27DRucWSLmKyPQ&amp;sig2=D6pmTG-N-fkYLCoJXTLzmA\">Forbes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacement, Silvana Tenreyro,</a> may not be as hawkish (but who knows?).</p> <p>So the monetary policy committee could be split 6-3*, unless other members are thinking along the same lines as Haldane.

It would even be a sign of confidence in the UK recovery.</p> <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key section from Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Having weighed the evidence, I think that the balance of risks associated with tightening \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too early\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, on the one hand, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too late\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, on the other, has swung materially towards the latter in the past six to nine months. The risks of tightening \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too early\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have shrunk as growth and, to lesser extent, inflation have shown greater resilience than expected. And if policy tightened \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too late\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, this could result in a much steeper path of rate rises later on, contrary to the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collective expectation that Bank Rate would increase \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcat a gradual pace and to a limited extent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.</p> <p>As the balance point between these risks has shifted over the past 9 months, that has left me judging that a partial withdrawal of the additional policy insurance the MPC put in place last year would be prudent relatively soon, provided the data come in broadly as expected in the period ahead. </p> <p>Certainly, I think such a tightening is likely to be needed well ahead of current market expectations.</p> <p>How soon is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153relatively soon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? I considered the case for a rate rise at the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s June meeting. I felt then there were strong grounds for holding back until later in the year, for two reasons. First, despite upwards pressure on inflation, there are still few signs of higher wage growth. And despite robust surveys, there is still some chance of a sharper than expected slowing in the economy. Both are reasons for monetary policy not to rush its fences. Nor does it need to do so, given the slow build of nominal pressures in the economy.</p> <p>Second, there is the election. This has thrown up a dust-cloud of uncertainty. Financial markets-wise, that is manifesting itself in a weaker exchange rate. It is unclear what twists and turns lie ahead, with potentially important implications for asset prices and, at least potentially, confidence among businesses and consumers. I do not think adding a twist or a turn from monetary policy would, in this environment, be especially helpful in building confidence, at least until the dust-cloud has started to settle.</p> <p>Provided the data are still on track, I do think that beginning the process of withdrawing some of the incremental stimulus provided last August would be prudent moving into the second half of the year.</p> </blockquote> <p>That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important intervention. Last week, three MPC policymakers (but not Haldane) voted for a rate hike. But just yesterday, governor Mark Carney argued forcefully that it is too early....</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-06-21T11:34:04.718Z\">at 12.34pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-594a457ee4b01a490fd244e7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-21T10:47:55.176Z\">11.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back in the markets, shares in doorstep lender Provident Financial have slumped by 16% this morning after a shock profits warning.</strong></p> <p>The FTSE 100-listed lender admitted last night that its recent reorganisation - which eliminated around 2,000 - had caused more disruption than expected.</p> <p>Provident appears to have botched its attempts to persuade self-employed debt collectors to become full-time staff instead.</p> <p>CEO Peter Crook told analysts today that too few workers made the switch.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it right.

                "bodyText":"And finally....the latest US oil inventory figures are just out, showing that US crude and gasoline inventories fell last week. The US Energy Information Administration reports that US oil stocks shrank by 2.5 million barrels, more than the 1.01 million which the markets had expected. In another surprise, gasoline inventories fell 578,000 barrels - compared to expectations of a 345,000 rise in gasoline stocks. This has help to push the oil price up a little, away from this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seven-month lows. Brent crude is now up 0.25% today at $46.13. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The US housing market has strengthened unexpectedly last month, according to new figures. Sales of US homes, excluding new builds, rose by 1.1% in May to an annual rate of 5.62 million sales. Average house prices also jumped during the month to record levels, suggesting demand was stronger too. This has pushed up the US dollar, pulling the pound back down below $1.27. Supermarket giant Tesco are back in the news again today, for the wrong reasons. Tesco Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online banking service has suffered a glitch today, that has left some customer unable to access their accounts. Yesterday, Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online shopping scheme hit a pothole, leaving scores of customers without their deliveries. And in another blow today, Tesco has proposed closing its customer service centre in Cardif, putting 1,100 jobs at risk. It is planning to consolidate its two customer engagement centres into a single expanded operation in Dundee, Scotland, and creating 250 new jobs there. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says Andy Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech has been the main event of the morning. Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns about not waiting too long to normalise policy could help the pound strengthen against the euro in the next few weeks, he says - just in time for the summer holiday season! Razaqzada says: Forget the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Speech, it was all about Andy Haldane this morning. The pound jumped and the FTSE dropped after the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist and Monetary Policy Committee member said he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ready to vote for an increase in interest rates \u00e2\u20ac\u0153relatively soon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This came as a major surprise because Mr Haldane has long been a known dove. He is going head-to-head against the Governor Mark Carney, who is fast losing support on his dovish stance. He said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a partial withdrawal of the additional policy insurance the MPC put in place last year would be prudent relatively soon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mr Haldane said that the risk was that the Bank tightened its belt too late rather than too early. This is something which the Bank of Canada is also worried about and what the US Federal Reserve had long been wary of, and the European Central Bank better be ready for. The latter came across pretty dovish at its last meeting. With the BoE turning hawkish and ECB remaining dovish, the EUR/GBP could come under pressure in the coming days and weeks. He also sent this image of the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac-\u00c2\u00a3 exchange rate, showing how the euro hit eight month highs against the euro recently, but couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t break through 88.8p. Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkishness has helped the pound to recovery almost all of the losses suffered yesterday, after BoE governor Mark Carney explained why interest rates ought to remain at record lows. Lena Komileva of G+ Economics reckons there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now a 50% chance of a UK interest rate rise this year. She says: The growing split on the MPC signals a much higher risk of tightening this year than previously expected in the markets. With two new members joining the MPC in the second half of the year, an active policy debate on the merits of tightening, against the optics of a strong inflation overshoot, overheating consumer credit growth, and a tight labour market, may well tilt the vote in favour of a rate hike by the year-end. The Haldane effect has pushed the pound back over $1.27, a whole cent higher than this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows. Following Andy Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech, there are now at least four Bank of England policymakers who are likely to vote for rate rises this year. However... one of them, Kristin Forbes, leaves on 30 June. That leaves Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders, who both voted to raise interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% at this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Forbes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacement, Silvana Tenreyro, may not be as hawkish (but who knows?). So the monetary policy committee could be split 6-3*, unless other members are thinking along the same lines as Haldane. The next MPC meeting is in early August. * - Or 5-3, until the vacancy for a deputy governor is filled. Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group thinks Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s change of mind is an important sign.. Andy Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hint that UK interest rates may rise this year is particularly interesting as he had been seen as the most dovish policymaker at the Bank of England. With one speech, Haldane has shed his dovish feathers in favour of a hawkish summer plumage. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says there is a big split at the Bank of England. Ben Chu of the Independent flags up that Haldane has sounded hawkish before, only to flip when the facts changed... Rupert Harrison of asset management firm BlackRock (and a former top Treasury official) suggests that Haldane may be trying to annoy his boss. Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Economics wonders if the Bank of England is trying to push the pound up, in an attempt to keep inflation down (something usually associated with emerging markets). Jeremy Cook of World First suggests that Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments caused some ructions on FX trading desks in the City: Newsflash: The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist has declared that UK interest rates may have to rise later this year. Speaking in Yorkshire, Andy Haldane argued that the recent spike in inflation, to 2.9%, means the risks of waiting too long to tighten monetary policy have increased. As such, he says, rates may need to rise \u00e2\u20ac\u0153well ahead\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of City expectations. It may make sense, Haldane adds, to start withdrawing some of last summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus (injected after the Brexit vote) later this year. It would even be a sign of confidence in the UK recovery. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key section from Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech: Having weighed the evidence, I think that the balance of risks associated with tightening \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too early\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, on the one hand, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too late\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, on the other, has swung materially towards the latter in the past six to nine months. The risks of tightening \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too early\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have shrunk as growth and, to lesser extent, inflation have shown greater resilience than expected. And if policy tightened \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too late\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, this could result in a much steeper path of rate rises later on, contrary to the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collective expectation that Bank Rate would increase \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcat a gradual pace and to a limited extent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. As the balance point between these risks has shifted over the past 9 months, that has left me judging that a partial withdrawal of the additional policy insurance the MPC put in place last year would be prudent relatively soon, provided the data come in broadly as expected in the period ahead. Certainly, I think such a tightening is likely to be needed well ahead of current market expectations. How soon is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153relatively soon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? I considered the case for a rate rise at the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s June meeting. I felt then there were strong grounds for holding back until later in the year, for two reasons. First, despite upwards pressure on inflation, there are still few signs of higher wage growth. And despite robust surveys, there is still some chance of a sharper than expected slowing in the economy. Both are reasons for monetary policy not to rush its fences. Nor does it need to do so, given the slow build of nominal pressures in the economy. Second, there is the election. This has thrown up a dust-cloud of uncertainty. Financial markets-wise, that is manifesting itself in a weaker exchange rate. It is unclear what twists and turns lie ahead, with potentially important implications for asset prices and, at least potentially, confidence among businesses and consumers. I do not think adding a twist or a turn from monetary policy would, in this environment, be especially helpful in building confidence, at least until the dust-cloud has started to settle. Provided the data are still on track, I do think that beginning the process of withdrawing some of the incremental stimulus provided last August would be prudent moving into the second half of the year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important intervention. Last week, three MPC policymakers (but not Haldane) voted for a rate hike. But just yesterday, governor Mark Carney argued forcefully that it is too early.... Back in the markets, shares in doorstep lender Provident Financial have slumped by 16% this morning after a shock profits warning. The FTSE 100-listed lender admitted last night that its recent reorganisation - which eliminated around 2,000 - had caused more disruption than expected. Provident appears to have botched its attempts to persuade self-employed debt collectors to become full-time staff instead. CEO Peter Crook told analysts today that too few workers made the switch. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it right. The incentives we had in place and the other management actions and communications that were there, were not sufficient to retain the number of agents that we anticipated.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound has recovered its early losses following this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finance figures. Sterling is back at $1.263, as traders watch for any surprises in the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Speech, which begins shortly. Our Politics Liveblog will have all the details: John Hawksworth, PwC chief economist, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finance figures are a boost to Philip Hammond, at a crucial time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finance data brought some good news for the Chancellor as estimated borrowing was revised down by around \u00c2\u00a32 billion in the last financial year and a further \u00c2\u00a31 billion in April. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Taking April and May together, the deficit of around \u00c2\u00a316 billion was very similar to the same two months last year, whereas the OBR had forecast that borrowing would rise this financial year as one-off favourable factors unwound. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of course, it is very early days in this financial year, but the Chancellor will take some cheer from these figures. However, Hawksworth is also concerned that the UK economic picture is darkening: The economy is slowing and considerable uncertainties remain around the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. At the same time, political pressures for higher spending on health, social care, education, policing, social housing and public pay more generally have increased. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Chancellor therefore still faces some tough challenges ahead if he is to meet his target of a balanced budget by 2025. But his interim target of getting the structural budget deficit below 2% of GDP by 2020/21 looks much easier to achieve and gives him some room for manoeuvre on tax and spending over the next few years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The \u00c2\u00a3300m drop in the deficit in May shows that the UK public finances started the year on a solid footing, says Capital Economics. However, they also expect total borrowing to rise during this financial year. Their UK economist, Scott Bowman, says: The strong revenue growth partly reflected a 4.3% rise in VAT receipts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perhaps a sign that consumer spending growth hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t slowed too sharply recently. That said, we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read too much into the borrowing figures for the first few months of the fiscal year as they are based on a significant amount of forecast data. Accordingly, we still think that borrowing for the fiscal year as a whole will increase by several billion pounds (the OBR expects a \u00c2\u00a37bn rise) as a number of one-off factors that lowered borrowing in 2016-17 unwind. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance ministry has welcomed the drop in borrowing last month, but admitted that the task of repairing the public finances isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complete. A Treasury spokesperson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe have reduced the deficit by three-quarters since 2010 but there is still further to go. We are committed to bringing the public finances back to balance by the middle of next decade, building a stronger economy that can deliver higher living standards for people across the country.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Fact check: That \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthree-quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 claim refers to borrowing as a share of the national economy. The deficit was 9.9% of GDP in 2010, and fell to 2.6% of GDP in 2016. Yesterday, chancellor Philip Hammond said the government aims to eliminate the deficit by the middle of the next decade. A far cry from George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal of balancing the books by 2015..... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to the news that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit fell to \u00c2\u00a36.7bn last month: Economist Rupert Seggins points out that UK public sector borrowing has dropped, a little, so far this financial year: KPMG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Yael Selfin, fears that the public finances may deteriorate in the months ahead: Howard Archer of EY Item Club believes VAT receipts rose in May thanks to a pickup in retail sales in April: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finance report also shows that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total national debt is now \u00c2\u00a31.737 trillion -- or 86.5% of annual GDP. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit fell by \u00c2\u00a3300m in May, giving a glimmer of hope to the UK government as it wrestles with Brexit. New figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the UK borrowed \u00c2\u00a36.7bn to balance the books last month. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from \u00c2\u00a37bn in May 2016, and rather less than April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a39.4bn deficit. The public finances were boosted by an increase in the tax takes. VAT receipts rose by 4.3% to \u00c2\u00a311.2bn in May, which looks to be the highest for any May on record. The figures show that Britain has borrowed \u00c2\u00a3100m less since the start of this financial year than in 2016-2017. OK, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only two months in, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a disastrous start... I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull together some reaction now... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been an exciting day on the Chinese stock market. The CSI 300 index, which contains the biggest companies traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen, jumped 1.2% to its highest closing level since the end of 2015. Traders rushed to buy shares after US stock index provider MSCI announced it would add some China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mainland domestic shares to its emerging markets index. That move will have been warmly welcomed in Beijing as it attempts to open up its financial markets and attract foreign capital. Jamie McGeever of Reuters shows how the pound has fallen back to two-month lows since the general election delivered a hung parliament. Breaking! The pound has slipped to a fresh two-month low against the US dollar. Sterling has just fallen below $1.26 for the first time since mid-April, when Theresa May took the fateful decision to call a general election. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lost a third of a cent today to $1.2593. Yesterday, the pound weakened after Bank of England governor Mark Carney said it was too early to raise interest rates. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff may be due to political instability in Westminster, and tensions between the Conservative party and the DUP over a possible deal. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Sterling also had a miserable open this Wednesday, the pound falling 0.3% against the dollar and 0.2% against the euro. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because, despite the state opening of parliament being just a few hours away, Theresa May is yet to fully secure the support of the DUP, the Irish party unhappy with what they see as a lack of respect from certain sections of the Conservatives. Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly publicised production cuts have actually turned into a win for US oil producers. American shale oil firms have raised their own output as the oil price recovered earlier this year, undermining efforts to cut the global glut of oil (leading to this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price falls). The Wall Street Journal explains: U.S. producers ramped up production when the world was already swimming in oil as OPEC members, Russia and other producing nations curtailed output. U.S. oil production is up 7.3% to 9.3 million barrels a day since OPEC announced plans in November to cut output, and the number of active rigs in the U.S. is at a two-year high. The cartel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output cut \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has been deemed an OPEC failure and a U.S. production win,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Tony Headrick, energy analyst at CHS Hedging. Oil prices are coming under more pressure this morning, knocking 1% off the price of Brent crude and Nymex. European stock markets are falling in early trading, as oil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop worries investors. The FTSE 100 has shed 22 points, or 0.3%. BP and Royal Dutch Shell are among the big fallers, down over 1% each. Big news from America: Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick has resigned after a series of scandals at the ride-hailing business he co-founded in 2009. Kalanick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure comes a week after he announced he would take an indefinite leave of absence as the embattled company released a damning report on its workplace culture. According to the New York Times, five of Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major investors demanded that the chief executive resign immediately, following revelations about its workplace culture and reports of harassment and discrimination. In a statement, Kalanick said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I love Uber more than anything in the world and at this difficult moment in my personal life I have accepted the investors request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Nordic bank Danske say that oil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide into a bear market is worrying investors worldwide: FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga predicts that prices will keep falling: Oil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing oversupply woes reached an ear-piercing crescendo during Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading session as WTI Crude plunged into a bear market after growing signs of rising production across the globe. WTI Crude was already extremely sensitive and vulnerable to losses amid the bearish sentiment with reports of an unexpected supply increase by Libya sending prices below $43. Although OPEC initially displayed good intentions when it exempted some members from the production cuts, this has come back to haunt them with more production from Libya, Nigeria, and Iran. With the bias towards oil heavily tilted to the downside, further losses should be expected as bears exploit persistent oversupply concerns to ruthlessly attack the commodity. This is from Jonny Bo Jakobsen of Nordea Markets: Michael Hewson of CMC Markets also expects oil to keep sliding this summer: The risk is we could see further declines, particularly if shale producers continue to add rigs, and demand continues to slow in Asia, and there are no further supply disruptions. The key support levels sit down at the November lows at $43 on Brent and $42 on US WTI, which if they give way $40 could come into view very quickly indeed and drag equity markets down with them, especially if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weekly inventory data disappoints. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Traders are edgy this morning after the oil prices tumbled to seven-month lows. The cost of a barrel of Brent crude has slumped below $46 per barrel for the first time since November 2016, dragged down by signs that the market is oversupplied. US crude prices also took a bath, falling 20% from their recent highs to around $43.50 per barrel. That put oil into a bear market for the first time since August, on signs that the global supply glut of oil isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going away. These moves show that the oil market is losing faith in the Opec cartel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to prop up prices, despite producers recently agreeing to extend production curbs until March 2018. Amanda Cooper, Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 oil expert, tweets that bearish oil traders have the upper hand. The selloff was partly triggered by signs that Libya has tripled its production levels in the last year. Libya is an Opec member, but exempt from its production cuts deal, as Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: As for the black gold, investors are becoming a little anxious towards the rising production out of Libya, however, OPEC has stated it before that the production level out of Libya is already taken into account in the part of their production cut strategy. Saudi Arabia also reported higher export data on Tuesday. It is important that not only production cuts are under control but also the export numbers as well. New oil inventory figures are released by the US government later today, which could move the markets again.... Also coming up today. Never exactly a shrinking violet, the UK economy will gambol back into the spotlight this morning when public finance figures for May are released. The City predict that public sector net borrowing fell to around \u00c2\u00a37bn, from over \u00c2\u00a39bn in April a year ago , as the long drudge of deficit reduction continues. Over in parliament, the Queen will outline the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legislative programme - even though prime minister Theresa May hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agreed a deal with the DUP to prop up her government. The Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech is likely to be dominated by Brexit, as the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Norman Smith explains... The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Andy Haldane, is visiting Yorkshire and the Humber. Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speeches are always good value (remember the one about the dog chasing the frisbee?), so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be scrutinising this one closely. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK public finances for May released 11.30am BST: Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Speech 12pm BST: Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Andy Haldane speaks in Yorkshire 3pm BST: US home sales 3.30pm BST: US crude oil inventory figures",

The prolongation of the output cut for nine months, which was agreed by OPEC and 11 non-OPEC countries on 25 May 2017, was widely anticipated by markets and priced in before the meeting. Hopes raised by some participating countries that there might be agreement on an even deeper or longer cut did not materialise, which led to a renewed price drop in the aftermath of the meeting of about 6% in US dollar terms.

                "bodyText":"And finally, European stock markets have closed for the night. In London, the FTSE 100 ended the day down 8 points at 7439, a drop of 0.1%. The jump in factory orders didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide much of a spark, while traders watched for developments from the Brexit talks in Brussels. European stocks ended the day higher, perhaps helped by the jump in eurozone consumer confidence. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some relief that oil has climbed back from its seven-month lows; Brent crude is now up 1.8% today at $45.62, but still looks vulnerable. Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG, says it was a day of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclow volatility\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and few dramas: Coming on a day which is largely devoid of any major market moving events, we have seen a degree of stability that has been lacking amongst recent political instability. Improved consumer confidence in the eurozone continues the theme of recent months, with investors seeing Europe as a high growth region for the coming years despite Brexit uncertainty. This paves the way for an end of the week that will be heavily focused on the eurozone, with PMI surveys expected to continue the strength seen in recent months. Those PMIs, out tomorrow morning, will give a flash view of how eurozone companies are faring this month. And on that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to stop. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says the jump in eurozone consumer confidence will have delighted the European Central Bank. The eurozone seems to have taken heart from the continued fall in unemployment, and consumer confidence is now at its highest level since 2001 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c improving considerably on last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ten-year high. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even the shock general election result in the UK has not dampened the mood on the continent as Brexit discussions kick-off, and chief negotiator Michel Barnier will feel he holds the strongest hand. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, there are still concerns over inflation, and ECB president Mario Draghi has so far steadfastly refused to taper off the eurozone stimulus programme, perhaps aware that potential banana skins could lie around the corner.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hold onto your hats, folks. Japanese bank Nomura have predicted that the Bank of England will raise interest rates at its next meeting, in August. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a gutsy move, as BoE governor Mark Carney argued forcibly on Tuesday that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early for a rate hike. However, Nomura analyst George Buckley has predicted that the BoE will raise rates from 0.25% to 0.5%, back to their level before the EU referendum a year ago. Buckley writes: It has been a rollercoaster of a week when it comes to central bank commentary, with Governor Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mansion House address justifying no change in interest rates but Chief Economist Haldane highlighting the need for a possible imminent reversal of last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loosening. On balance,we have decided to change our view and now expect the MPC to raise interest rates by 25bp on 3 August. With the Bank growing increasingly intolerant of above-target inflation, it has begun to feel that weaker data would now be needed to prove the case for keeping policy on hold, rather than stronger data being required to justify higher rates. Buckley points to recent signs that the Bank is more worried about inflation, which is well over its 2% target at 2.9%. He anticipates a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdovish hike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, with the Bank pointing out that: a) the move being a reversal of last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cut, b) policy is still highly accommodative, and c) future moves will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gradual and limited\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Back to Greece where today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protests and the electric atmosphere that prevailed may well be a shocking wake up call for the leftist-led government. Municipal workers are warning of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very hot summer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if short-term contracts aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t replaced with permanent positions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will continue the fight until the end,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nikos Trakas who heads the workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 union said after the protests. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153From now on there will be huge and dynamic mobilisations with decisions being taken in the coming hours.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Boom! Or do I mean Euroboom? Eurozone consumer confidence has hit its highest level since 2001, underlining how its economic recovery is on track. The EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly consumer morale index has jumped to -1.3 this month, up from -3.3 in May. A negative reading may not sound much, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually the strongest number in 16 years. With growth accelerating to 0.6% in the first quarter of 2017, and unemployment at a seven-year low, the eurozone is enjoying something of a purple patch. Thirty-odd years ago, David Braben was pushing back the boundaries of computer gaming when he and fellow Cambridge student Ian Bell created Elite. Today, he should be celebrating as Frontier Developments, the computer game developer he founded, posted sparkling financial results. With revenue up 75% this year, the company expects to grow operating profits by 500% to \u00c2\u00a37.2m. It now expects operating profit margins to be towards the top of its previous guidance, of 15-20%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to the success of two games; Planet Coaster, a theme park game.... ...and Elite Dangerous, a massive multiplayer online space adventure game that accurately simulates our whole galaxy. For those of a certain age, the original Elite was quite mind-blowing; Braben and Bell managed to squeeze an open-ended space trading and combat game into just 32kilobytes of RAM, at a time when most people were playing Chuckie Egg (younger readers, ask your parents). Elite Dangerous seems to have tapped into that nostalgia; Frontier crowd-funded the money to create the game, and is turning gamers into repeat customers by releasing regular updates. Shares in Frontier are up 6.5% this morning at 450p, compared with just 300p in mid-April.... Braben says: Our ambition now is to build on this success, continue to invest in our franchises and scale up to create a self-publishing multi-franchise success story. Our third franchise, which is based on an enduring Hollywood movie IP of global renown, is scheduled for release in calendar 2018, and we will provide more details about this exciting project later this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fresh protests against Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity programme are taking place today, as refuse collectors down tools and demonstrate. Associated Press has the details: Thousands of striking Greek municipal workers marched through Athens on Thursday to press for better employment status, in the latest of a series of protests that have hindered trash collection in major cities. Authorities said that about 5,000 people took part in the demonstration. Protesters briefly scuffled with police, who used tear gas to prevent them from pushing into the parliament complex. No arrests were reported, while two protesters suffered respiratory problems from the tear gas. Earlier, some demonstrators had dumped trash outside the interior ministry building. Union officials want the left-led government to grant full-time, permanent state jobs to municipal workers employed on short-term contracts that have expired or are about to expire. A high court has ruled unconstitutional a government attempt to extend the contracts of municipal trash collectors, and government officials say they are seeking an alternative solution. Union members have for days been hindering trash collection across the country, and municipal authorities in Athens and other major cities have asked the public to keep their refuse at home. Greece has been forced to drastically cut public spending and reduce state sector hiring over the past seven years under its international bailout agreements. Over in Brussels, EU leaders have been gathering for a summit where UK prime minister Theresa May will outline her Brexit plans. European Council president Donald Tusk has caused a stir, by suggesting that Brexit might not even happen. Channelling John Lennon, Tusk declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some of my British friends have even asked me whether Brexit could be reversed, and whether I could imagine an outcome where the UK stays part of the EU. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I told them that in fact the European Union was built on dreams that seemed impossible to achieve. So, who knows? You may say I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a dreamer, but I am not the only one.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, meanwhile, told reporters that that the EU must prioritise the needs of its remaining members: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to have talks that take place in a good spirit and we know that later we will want to work with Great Britain, but the clear focus must be on the future for the EU 27 so that we have results for the better.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in London, shares in UK tech firm Imagination have jumped by 16% this morning, after it effectively put itself up for sale. The move comes two months after Imagination shocked the City by revealing that Apple, its biggest customer, would stop using its technology in its iPhones, iPads, and iPods. In a statement today, Imagination said it had received interest from suitors in recent weeks so had begun a formal sale process and is talking to potential bidders. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a dramatic fall; not long ago, Imagination was a City darling thanks to its tie-up with Apple, which provides more than half its revenue. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital points out that Imagination tried, without much success, to sell off its best performing divisions -- before finally putting the whole company on sale today: It was never going to be easy for Imagination Technologies when it lost its biggest customer and efforts to offload two of its three main businesses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c MIPS and Ensigma - in a bid to strengthen the balance sheet clearly weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough. These were both strong potential growth areas that could have delivered lasting revenue accretion to offset the loss of Apple. That was a pretty dire scenario, akin to selling off the family silver to keep the estate going a little longer. Now the shutters are up and a buyer sought. A pretty ignominious end to what was a great British tech success story.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: The number of Americans signing on for unemployment benefit has inched up, but remains at historically low levels. Some 241,000 US citizens filed initial jobless claims last week, new figures show, up from 238,000 the previous week. Wall Street had expected a smaller rise, to 240,000; still, this is a level consistent with a solid labour market. The number of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccontinuing jobless claims\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 also rose to 1.94 million, meaning than an extra 8,000 people remained on jobless benefits. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a relatively low figure: Newsflash from Wall Street: American Airlines has revealed that rival Qatar Airways is interested in buying a 10% stake. American Airlines says it recently received an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unsolicited notice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, saying Qatar Airways intends to make a significant investment in AA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s common stock, bought on the open market. American Airlines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shares have jumped by 5%, and other airlines are rallying too.... After a wobbly morning, Brent crude has now risen back over the $45 per barrel level. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now changing hands at around $45.17, up 0.6% compared with yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seven-month low. But City analysts are still downbeat about oil. Barclays have just cut their 2017 forecast for Brent to $52 per barrel, down from $56. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, suspects that the CBI may be over-egging the strength of UK manufacturing. Archer says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly encouraging\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to see total order books at their best level for nearly 29 years, but points out that official data have been more pessimistic. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Taken at face value, the survey suggests that the manufacturing sector has had a strong second quarter and has considerable momentum going into the third quarter \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, there is the concern that survey evidence for the manufacturing sector has tended to be markedly more upbeat than the official data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) so far in 2017. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Indeed, official data suggests that the manufacturing sector is far from guaranteed to see even modest growth in the second quarter. Specifically, latest ONS figures show manufacturing output edged up 0.2% month-on-month in April after falling in each of the first three months of 2017. Consequently, manufacturing output was down by 0.7% in the three months to April compared to the three months to January. Philip Shaw of Investec is also cautious. He says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report could bolster the case for an early UK interest rate hike - but points out that manufacturing only contributes a small portion of UK GDP. While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reassuring to see some evidence of a strengthening of exports, one should remember that manufacturing still only accounts for about 10 percent of the economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest Brexit dashboard is out....and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather gloomier than the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory report. This month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dashboard shows how Britons are suffering a living standards squeeze, 12 months on from the EU referendum. My colleague Katie Allen explains: One year since voters narrowly opted for Brexit, the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly tracker of economic news paints a gloomy picture, with households facing rising costs and firms fretting over falling demand and political uncertainty. The economy has so far avoided the recession predicted by some doomsayers at the time of the referendum, and in the months immediately following the Brexit vote the UK outperformed most other advanced economies. But at the turn of the year the economy slowed markedly and the UK slipped to the bottom of the European growth league. It was also left trailing behind the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advanced economies. As the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp drop since the referendum works its way through the economy into higher prices in the shops, the pressures on consumer spending threaten to keep growth in the doldrums. Now that complex Brexit talks are gettting under way, business groups are also warning of headwinds from fraught domestic politics and uncertainty around the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trading and immigration arrangements. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Here are economists David Blanchflower and Andrew Sentance analysing the data: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the dashboard itself, tracking the key economic indicators: The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey also shows that UK factory order books have strengthened since the EU referendum a year ago: City experts are welcoming the news that UK factories are enjoying a blowout month. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Julian Jessop, chief economist at the Institute of Economic Affairs: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more reaction: Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector is enjoying its best month for new orders since the summer of 1988. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcheck on the sector, which found that factory order books have strengthened this month. Some 27% of manufacturers reported total order books to be above normal, and 12% said they were below normal, giving a rounded balance of +16% -- the highest in nearly three decades. The CBI explains: The survey of 464 manufacturers found that total order books climbed to the highest level since August 1988. This was underpinned by a broad-based improvement in 13 of the 17 sub-sectors, led by the food, drink &amp; tobacco and chemicals sectors. Export orders also improved to a 22-year high, hitting similar peaks to those seen in 2011 and 2013. A jump in orders suggests factories should be pretty busy in the next few months. Manufacturers are also quite upbeat about their prospects this year; 37% predicted growth, and 9% a decline, giving a rounded balance of +27% However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all good news. First, factory output growth has slowed compared to earlier this year.... Secondly, many firms told the CBI that they intent to hike prices in the months ahead. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because their raw materials costs have gone up (due to the weak pound). Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Chief Economist, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers are continuing to see demand for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Made in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd goods rise with the temperature. Total and export order books are at highs not seen for decades, and output growth remains robust. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nevertheless, with cost pressures remaining elevated it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise to see that manufacturers continue to have high expectations for the prices they plan to charge. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt crisis has fallen out of the headlines again, after Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 creditors agreed to hand over an \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.3bn loan tranche last week. That deal removed the immediate threat of a default this summer, but hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t addressed the key issue; Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt pile is unsustainably large, and Europe and the International Monetary Fund can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree what to do about it. Mohamed A El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, argues that Europe needs to soften its stance and consider how to give Greece the help it needs. He writes: For those of us who have been following the Greek economic tragedy for many years, much of the European view continues to defy economic logic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and for a simple reason: European politicians worry about the domestic political consequences of granting Greece debt relief, especially ahead of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s federal election in September. Offering debt relief, it is feared, could undermine the credibility of governing parties and provide a boost to extremist movements. To be sure, debt forgiveness is tricky, raising complicated issues of fairness and incentives. Yet, in some cases, there comes a time when refusal to forgive debt is more damaging. European officials know as well as the IMF does that Greece has long been at this stage, turning the country into a permanent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ward of the state\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd within a eurozone that does not accommodate this outcome well. But they seem unable to act. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full piece: Equities are down this morning because traders are worried that the falling oil price signals low inflation and weaker growth, says David Madden of CMC Markets. He says: European equities have fallen again as the weakness in oil is weighing on investor confidence. In London, the FTSE 100 is down 0.5% and commodity related companies are the biggest fallers. BP and Royal Dutch Shell are in the red on the back of falling oil prices. While, mining companies like Glencore, Anglo American and BHP Billiton are lower again as dealers are concerned about declining demand for commodities from Asia. Oil isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only commodity having a bad morning. Sugar and coffee are at their lowest in over a year, cocoa is close to a 10-year low, and wheat has also dropped. The Financial Times has the details: Cocoa in New York, has fallen almost 10 per cent since the start of this week, settling at $1,853 a tonne on Wednesday. Some traders are watching to see whether it tests $1,756, the 10-year low seen in April. Sugar is trading at 13 cents a pound, a 16-month low, while arabica coffee is at $1.2195 a pound, a level not seen since May last year. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a worry for producers, and emerging markets that rely on exports of these \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft commodities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. But it could bring relief to consumers... IF suppliers pass these prices on. Even if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, there should be less pressure to raise prices or shrink products. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery is on course and strengthening steadily, according to the European Central Bank. In its new economic bulletin, the ECB says the latest data suggest \u00e2\u20ac\u0153solid growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the current quarter, thanks to rising demand at home and abroad. The ongoing economic expansion is increasingly resilient and has broadened across sectors and countries. Euro area growth is supported primarily by domestic demand, although tailwinds from the external environment have increasingly lent support to the outlook. The recovery is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153particularly visible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in euro area labour markets, it adds, with the unemployment rate falling to 9.3%, an eight-year low. The ECB also focuses on the oil price, saying that recent falls should have a dampening effect on inflation. It adds: Brent crude oil prices have fluctuated in the range of $48 to $56 per barrel since early March. The price fluctuations reflect shifting concerns among market participants about the likely success of the OPEC strategy to curtail production, amid still high oil inventories and rising US shale production. The prolongation of the output cut for nine months, which was agreed by OPEC and 11 non-OPEC countries on 25 May 2017, was widely anticipated by markets and priced in before the meeting. Hopes raised by some participating countries that there might be agreement on an even deeper or longer cut did not materialise, which led to a renewed price drop in the aftermath of the meeting of about 6% in US dollar terms. Looking ahead, the futures curve is signalling largely unchanged oil prices over the next three years. Non-oil commodity prices have declined by about 8% since early March. The oil price is a handy proxy for how confident investors feel about the global economy, as faster growth means more demand for energy. Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As far as the market mentality is concerned, as long as the oil price keeps weakening, this is going to tell us something about the underlying capacity of the global economy to generate inflation on a sustained basis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tracy Alloway has spotted a trend in the oil price: European stock markets have all dipped into the red, as the oil price worries traders. In London the FTSE 100 is down 28 points, or 0.4%. Royal Dutch Shell, the oil company, has shed almost 1.5%. Mining companies are also down, mirroring a fall in commodity prices such as copper. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx blames the weak oil price: The oil slick only got thicker this Thursday, the markets drowning in a well of the black stuff. Brent Crude quickly hit a new 2017 nadir, and its worst price since November 2016, this morning, dropping another 0.2% to sit just below $45 per barrel. Despite a brief bounce following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s larger than expected fall in US crude inventories the current oil glut fears aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t receding, especially since ramped up production in places like Libya and America means OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to affect global output may be waning. Libya and Nigeria are also pushing the oil price down, says the Wall Street Journal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Georgi Kantchev. He writes: Oil production in conflict torn Libya, which is exempted from the OPEC output deal, has surprised on the upside. Despite the continued civil war in the country, which has Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest oil reserves, Libyan output has recently climbed to 885,000 barrels a day, roughly three times its level from just a year ago. Nigeria, also exempted from the OPEC agreement due to militant attacks on its oil infrastructure, is another wild-card. Last month, its production rose to 1.68 million barrels a day, its highest level in a year, according to OPEC data. More here: Five Reasons Why Oil Is Falling Wayne McCurrie, fund manager at Ashburton Investments, argues that Brent crude has fallen to levels which are unprofitable for shale producers - possibly putting a floor under the oil price. The fall in the oil price is encouraging investors to bail out of risky assets, says FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed. He adds: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evident that oil prices are becoming the primary driver of the financial markets. After both benchmarks entered a bear market with Brent plunging below $45 for the first time since November, investors are becoming more concerned as to when the plunge will stop. Sayed believes that the market is losing faith in Opec: Comments from Iranian oil minister, Bijan Zangeneh that Iran is in discussions with OPEC members for further production cuts fell on deaf ears, meaning that comments from OPEC members are unlikely to influence prices. With no hard data to encourage bulls to jump in, the risk to the downside will continue to persist. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an edgy feel in the markets this morning, after the oil price slumped deeper into a bear market last night. Brent crude is wallowing below $45 per barrel this morning, close to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seven-month low, as concerns over a supply glut and falling demand dominate. US crude oil has also tumbled, hitting its lowest levels since last summer. That helped to send energy stocks sliding on Wall Street yesterday. This chart from Bloomberg shows how the oil price has now slumped by 20% from its recent highs, putting it in bear market territory. The selloff is being driven by several factors, including: signs that the oil market is simply oversupplied, scepticism that Opec can actually enforce its production freeze deal, the reality that other producers - such as US shale oil drillers - will boost their own production if the price is right. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says a surprise fall in US oil inventories yesterday hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given oil much support. Crude oil prices have taken another leg lower, falling to their lowest level since August overnight. The move comes as an un-named OPEC member casts doubt over the possibility of deeper production cuts by the group, offsetting a drop in US inventories. Also coming up today... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a raft of data coming up, including the latest economic bulletin from the European Central Bank and a new health-check on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories. European stock markets have dropped in early trading and are expected to be subdued; perhaps City traders are too worn out by the heat.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9am BST: ECB publishes economic bulletin 11am BST: CBI publishes its survey of UK industrial trends for June 1.30pm BST: US weekly jobless report 3pm: Eurozone consumer confidence figures for June",

                "bodyText":"That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today, and this week A quick reminder of the key points. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate in the first quarter of the year has been revised up to 0.5%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest sign that the eurozone recovery continues. European companies have posted their fastest quarterly growth since the debt crisis began six years ago. But growth dipped this month, suggesting a slight slowdown. A similar survey showed that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth may have slowed this month too. US manufacturing output expanded at the slowest rate in nine months. European stock markets closed lower, with the FTSE posting its third weekly decline in a row. Worries over Brexit, and deflation, loomed over the City after a week of oil price falls. The decline in the oil price helped to push Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate down. The annual CPI rate fell by more than expected last month, to just 1.3% last month. The British pound has marked the first anniversary of the Brexit vote with a small rally, up 0.35% to $1.2725. City experts, though, have shown that sterling has had a pretty awful year. The European Central Bank has launched a bid to wrestle control of London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro-clearing market. In Greece, unions are vowing to step up their protests unless the government grants better rights to thousands of short-term workers. The tensions come as rubbish piles up in Athens, as a refuse workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 strike continues. The Greek government, though, is trying to rally investor confidence now it has secured its latest bailout funds. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all from us until next week. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The FTSE 100 has now fallen for three weeks in a row; that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the worst run since the Brexit vote, points out Tara Cunningham in the Daily Telegraph tonight. David Madden of CMC Markets says growth fears weighed on the markets today, despite French GDP being revised up early this morning: Stock markets have fallen yet again as the disinflation fear is still doing the rounds. Oil may have recouped some of its losses today but the commodity has dropped a considerable amount since the start of the year and dealers are worried take it will put downward pressure on inflation. The cost of living in the eurozone and the US is softening already, and when you factor the recent losses in the oil market its points to a continuation of weaker inflation. Traders are anxious it could turn into weaker growth rates, and the high hopes that they had for 2017 may not be met. After another subdued day, the FTSE 100 has closed down 15.16 points at 7424. Worries over disinflation, following the oil price slump this week, weighed on shares. European issues also cast a shadow, as EU leaders in Brussels seemed unimpressed with Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer to EU citizens after Brexit. Other markets also fell: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proof that the London stock market has underperformed since the Brexit vote, when measured in US dollars: Back in Greece, protests are set to intensify over the weekend as unions step up calls on Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leftist-led government to grant better employment rights \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not least extension of short term contracts that could say protestors put up to 10,000 out of work. Announcing that walkouts by rubbish collectors and other municipal workers would continue until Monday, Nikos Trakas, who heads the union representing municipal employees, said the government couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hide behind legal argument in its refusal to put contract workers, now facing joblessness, in permanent positions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A government \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come back two and a half years later and say there is a problem with constitutionality,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe are talking about ten thousand people and if they leave, local government in its entirety will dissolve.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Piles of refuse have collected across Athens and with temperatures set to climb to 36 degrees Celsius by Sunday the strike is causing mounting concerns at a time of rising tourism. Constantine Michalos, president of the Athens chamber of commerce, which represents over 100,000 businesses, issued an urgent appeal this afternoon for both workers and the government to return to the negotiating table. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everyone has to try to limit the obstacles that diminish the growth prospects of the country by limiting claims to rights,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said adding that it made no sense that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vested interests\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd should prevail at such a critical time. Just in: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector is slowing this month. Factory activity across the US rose at its slowest rate in nine months, according to data firm Markit. Companies reported that output and new business growth both slowed compared to May. This dragged Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomposite PMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which measures activity across the private sector, down to a three month low of 53.0, from 53.6. That shows slower growth. But on the upside, job creation picked up and new orders hit a five-month high. Businesses also restocked their inventories, suggesting more optimism about the future. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is ending the current quarter on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a softer note\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That may mean that growth isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as strong as hoped, after a weak start to 2017. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The average expansion seen in the second quarter is down on that seen in the first three months of the year, indicating a slowing in the underlying pace of economic growth. While official GDP data are expected to turn higher in the second quarter after an especially weak start to the year (our recent GDP tracker based on various official and survey data points to 3.0% growth), the relatively subdued PMI readings suggest there are some downside risks to the extent to which GDP will rebound. Back in the UK, the Serious Fraud Office has closed a probe into whether the Bank of England broke the law during the financial crisis. After a two-year investigation, the SFO has concluded there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no evidence of criminality\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd related to the emerging lending measures that the BoE took, to prevent the financial markets seizing up. This all relates to the liquidity auctions which the BoE ran in 2007 and 2008, which gave UK banks access to desperately needed capital following the credit crunch, and the subsequent collapse of Lehman Brothers. The SFO had been looking into whether any assistance was given to certain financial institutions to enable them to bid successfully for the available funding, to the possible detriment of other institutions. Surprise inflation data from Canada have sent the Canadian dollar sliding. Consumer prices across Canada fell by 0.2% during May (on a seasonally adjusted basis0) due to falling goods and energy prices. That dragged the annual inflation rate down to just 1.3%, down from 1.6% in April (and much weaker than Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.9% inflation rate). Economists had expected a smaller fall, to 1.5%. The Canadian dollar promptly fell to 75.23 cents against the US dollar, from 75.6, as traders concluded that this creates less pressure to raise interest rates. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Taking back control\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was a key message for the campaign to leave the EU last year. And today, the European Central Bank has launched a new bid to take control of the euro clearing market, currently centred in London. The clearing market is the point in the system where derivatives contracts are settled. It is meant to reduce financial risk, by using central counterparties who can prevent one default triggering a wave of forced sales and margin calls. The ECB has proposed adjusting its statute, to give it authority to oversee the clearing of euro-demominated securities. That could be the prelude to moving the market into the eurozone, or more control over activities in London. My colleague Jill Treanor explains: London is facing renewed pressure over its dominance of the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1tn (\u00c2\u00a3880bn) a day euro clearing market after the European Central Bank set out proposals aimed at giving it more oversight of the lucrative business. The move by the Frankfurt-based ECB - the central bank for the 19 countries using the euro - follows a report by the European commission which called for the EU to have more powers over clearing of financial products denominated in euros after Brexit. The City dominates the market of clearing, a process which is supposed to reduce the risks of complex financial transactions by matching buyers and sellers as well as reduce the cost of trading, through so-called central counterparties (CCPs)..... Meanwhile, the Greek government has dispatched two top ministers abroad on an investment drive. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an attempt to capitalise on the momentum of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro group decision to throw the country a fresh financial credit line. Helena Smith reports from Athens Both the Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos and the economics and development minister Dimitris Papadimitriou have flown to London and the US respectively in a bid to attract investors. Tsakalotos, who was raised in Britain, is, say officials, on a mission to persuade interlocutors that Greece is now on a path of recovery, with a clear stretch ahead of it, following last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crucial decision to disburse a further \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.5bn euro in rescue funds to avert default. Papadimitiou, long-time economics professor at Bard College, has been in New York with leading businessmen and Geoffrey Pyatt, the US ambassador to Greece, attending the sixth Greek investment programme whose working title is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece at a turning point.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It is hoped that both visits will increase appetite for bonds now that yields have dropped markedly since the euro group decision. Foreign investment, though once a dirty word for prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leftist-led government, is seen as imperative for kick-starting the economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and tackling an unemployment rate of 23%. Economists say that budget cut savings are simply not enough after eight years of gruelling austerity to spur growth. Just in: the UK public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation expectations have risen slightly, as the Bank of England argues over whether to raise interest rates or not. The public now expect inflation to average 3.1% in the long term, up from 3.0% a month ago. Expectations for the year ahead have inched a little higher too, to 2.62%. Inflation actually hit 2.9% last month, and some economists see it heading higher. But Christian Schulz, economist at Citi, says the survey doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suggest the BoE should aggressively hike interest rates: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Expectations are close to long-run averages, but strong upward momentum that would call for urgent monetary tightening is absent in our view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Outgoing BoE policymaker Kristin Forbes may not agree. Last night, she gave a speech arguing that the Bank is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbehind the curve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and suggesting that some policymakers were too hesitant to raise borrowing costs. The price of copper has jumped to a two-month high, helped by this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong eurozone data. One tonne of copper jumped by 1.5% to $5,827, the highest level since early April. Banske Bank analyst Jens Pedersen says (via Reuters): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Positive sentiment around China and a rise in manufacturing PMIs out of Europe are supporting base metals prices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Attention, eurozone crisis watchers. The BBC World Service covering the Greek debt crisis, looking at this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout and the long-term cost of austerity It includes contributions from our Athens correspondent Helena Smith, and is being streamed here: Greece: a Long Road to Recovery Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the pitch: Greece has been through dark economic times over the past decade. Last week a European Union loan of 8.5bn Euros enabled Greece to meet its latest debt payments. The IMF says this deal will help Greece stand on its own feet again over the course of the next year. But after the years of austerity and hardship, do the Greek people believe this will do anything to improve their lives? For Newshour Extra this week, Owen Bennett Jones is in Athens to discuss the consequences of living with long-term austerity and the prognosis for economic recovery. Back on the Brexit anniversary....analysts are pointing out that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a notable shift between the fortunes of UK-focused companies, and those with an international outlook. Those multinational firms have enjoyed a real surge in their value, up 28% in the last year, as the weak pound boosts the value of their overseas earning. But UK-centric firms have actually fallen in value, by 5% in sterling terms, due to worries over the UK economy Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG in the UK, has crunched the numbers: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The KPMG Non-UK 50, which represents the largest companies with more than 70% of their market outside the UK, is up a remarkable 28% since the EU referendum - significantly outperforming the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest indices, while the FTSE 100 climbed 17% over the same period. In contrast, the KPMG UK50, which represents the largest FTSE companies with over 70% of their market in the UK, is down 5%. Put in pounds and pence, this equates to a \u00c2\u00a3330 billion rise in the value of the KPMG Non-UK50 and a \u00c2\u00a319 billion loss for their domestic equivalent. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital has shown how mining companies (Glencore and Antofagasta), consumer giants (Unilever and Diageo) and banks (HSBC) have driven the rally. Over in parliament, a delicious battle is brewing over the top job on the Treasury select committee, one of the most powerful oversight roles in Westminster. Several MPs have a burning desire to succeed Andrew Tyrie, the former chair, who stepped down as an MP at the general election. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the eurosceptic, old-school Tory, is keen, and had been seen as a front-runner. But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now facing a challenge from former minister Nicky Morgan, a fellow Conservative, who has thrown her hat into the ring this morning: Rees-Mogg is one of those politicians who divides opinions, and there are signs that some MPs are determined to thwart him. The Financial Times reports this morning that a Stop Mogg campaign is underway. Some Labour MPs are organising to thwart Mr Rees-Mogg, although they have not yet decided who to support. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The idea is to simply stop Mogg,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one Labour MP. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It almost doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter who the candidate is, we just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want him.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They argue that his role at Somerset Capital Management could pose a conflict of interests. Many also believe that as an ardent supporter of the UK leaving the EU he may not pursue sufficient scrutiny of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit plans. Wes Streeting, who has served on the TSC for the last couple of years (alongside Rees-Mogg), says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s backing Morgan.. Sterling is marking the first anniversary of the EU referendum with a small rally. The pound is up half a cent against the US dollar at $1.2728. That means it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still worth 14% less than before the Brexit vote, after a year of heightened volatility. And with Brexit talks getting underway in Brussels, the pound still looks exposed to further twists and turns. Graham Bishop, Investment Director at Heartwood Investment Management explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s devaluation in response to the shock UK referendum result has been the most significant market event in recent years. It has yet to materially recover from its post-referendum low and now remains vulnerable to even more political and economic uncertainty. Paul McNamara of asset management firm GAM shows how the UK has been the worst-performing major currency over the last year: Katie Martin of the FT has dug deep into the Bloomberg terminal, and found a couple of currencies who did even worst than the pound (the Congolese franc and the Uzbekistan soum) Tara Cunningham of the Telegraph shows how the FTSE has benefitted from the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness: Eurozone stock markets are all down this morning, as the PMIs fail to spark much enthusiasm in the City. The FTSE 100 has shed 30 points, or 0.4%, to 7410. That means the Footsie is on track for its third weekly loss in a row for the first time this year, after energy stocks and mining stocks slipped. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a pretty bleak week for the UK index, shedding around 150 points from Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intraday peak as the latest oil crisis drew focus from the sterling-sapping/FTSE-boosting political uncertainty that was the main market driver in the previous fortnight. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Julien Lafargue, european equities strategist at the J.P. Morgan Private Bank, on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone PMI report: The macroeconomic momentum appears to have eased somewhat in June, in particular in the Services sector. In light of the sharp improvement we have witnessed in the past 9 months, this pause is not really a surprise and, in our opinion, should not be interpreted as an indication that the economy is about to roll over. Activity in the Eurozone remains at very healthy levels and consumer confidence is at its highest level in 16 years. In addition, despite the recent drop in commodity prices, inflation dynamics remain supported by a large backlog and supplier delivery delays worsening to the greatest extent for just over six years. As such, we believe the ECB could adopt a relatively more hawkish stance in the coming months. The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector has recorded its strongest quarterly growth since the debt crisis began, although growth has slowed a little this month. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the upshot from Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly healthcheck on factories and service sector firms across the euro area. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 eurozone PMI for June has dropped to 55.7, down from 56.8 in May, and weaker than the City had expected. But still, the average PMI over the last three months is the strongest quarter since 2011 [this includes this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures from Germany and France] Markit says: Although the rate of growth waned to a five-month low, high order book inflows and elevated levels of business confidence meant job creation remained one of the strongest recorded over the past decade as firms continued to expand capacity to meet rising demand. Price pressures eased, however, largely reflecting lower global commodity prices. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Williamson says the figures suggest eurozone growth has accelerated to a robust 0.7% in the current quarter, up from 0.6% in Q1. He adds: The upturn is also broad-based, with the surveys signalling an acceleration of GDP growth in both France and Germany in the second quarter, as well as across the rest of the region as a whole, albeit with some loss of momentum seen across the board in June. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Job creation continued to run at one of the highest rates seen over the past decade as firms expanded capacity to meet demand. Factory jobs growth remained particularly buoyant, thanks in part to production requirements surging higher on the back of rising exports. Germany \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash PMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is just out, and it shows that private sector growth in the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy is slowing a little. The German composite PMI has dropped to a four-month low of 56.1 this month. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 57.4 in May, but it still signals solid growth (the 50-point mark separates expansion from contraction). Firms reported that output grew sharply, but new export orders slowed to the slowest growth rate since February. Trevor Balchin, senior economist at IHS Markit, says the figures suggest Germany is still enjoying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong economic growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, although the service sector is falling behind manufacturing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest data signalled a growing performance gap between manufacturing and services, however. The goods-producing sector continued to outperform, with the headline PMI little-changed from May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 73-month record. Although growth of manufacturing output, exports and jobs all eased slightly since May, expansions in backlogs and total new orders gathered pace and supply bottlenecks intensified. Another boost for France! French companies are creating jobs at the fastest rate since the financial crisis. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to data firm Markit, whose \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 purchasing managers report for June, just released, shows that private sector employment has jumped at the fastest rate in almost 10 years. Markit says: Buoyed by strong client demand, private sector firms in France raised their staffing numbers for an eighth successive month in June. Furthermore, the rate of job creation was the most marked in just under ten years. The increase was broad-based across both the manufacturing and service sectors. The PMI report shows that French factories picked up this month, pushing the Manufacturing PMI up to 55.0 from 53.8 in May. But services sector growth slowed, pulling the Services PMI down to 55.3 from 57.2 in May. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a five-month low, but still shows steady growth. Alex Gill, economist at IHS Markit says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A particularly upbeat talking point highlighted in the latest data was the sharpest rise in employment for almost ten years. This is welcome news for the newly elected government which has made reducing unemployment one of the main aims of its administration. The slowdown in the rate of accumulation in unfinished work poses a slight concern however, and may slow employment growth in the short-term. Howard Archer of EY Item Club is also impressed by France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP: Bloomberg economist Maxime Sbaihi is encouraged by the upgraded French growth figures: Newsflash: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew faster than previously thought in the first three months of this year. French Q1 GDP has just been revised, to show that the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest economy expanded by 0.5% in the quarter. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from a previous estimate of 0.4%, and means France comfortably outpaced Britain (which grew by 0.2%) and wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t far behind Germany ( which posted 0.6% growth). France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth was driven by business investment - or gross fixed capital formation - which jumped by 1.2% in the quarter. Inventory changes also added 0.7% to growth, as companies restocked their warehouses. But net trade was a drag, though, as exports fell 0.7% during the quarter while imports rose by 1.2%. And household consumption was flat. But still, it shows that this spring\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spook the economy, and it gives Emmanuel Macron a decent starting point to build on. Reaction to follow... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll learn whether European companies are enjoying a blistering June, as data firm Markit releases its latest \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 purchasing managers indexes. These PMIs track activity, output and job creation among private companies, and are expected to show another month of decent growth as Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery continues. The overall eurozone composite PMI is expected to come in at 56.6, down a little on May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 56.8, but still a strong number -- anything over 50 shows growth. Inflation is also on everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind; this afternoon, Canada will release its consumer prices index. Economists expect it to drop to 1.5%, from 1.6%, as the recent oil price falls feed through to the real economy. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be tracking reaction to a damning official report into the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant. It warns that Britain will be locked into subsidising the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153risky and expensive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd project for decades My colleague Adam Vaughan explains: The National Audit Office said the contract sealed by ministers last September with EDF to construct the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first new atomic reactors in two decades would provide \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncertain strategic and economic benefits\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Further, Brexit and Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to quit an EU nuclear treaty could make the situation even worse, by triggering taxpayer compensation for EDF or a more generous deal for the French state-controlled company. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been the most thrilling week in the markets, and I fear that the European bourses may be rather quiet again today. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE is expected to dip by around 0.1% in early trading.

                "bodyText":"And finally (probably), European stock markets have ended the day in the red. In London the FTSE100 lost 12 points to 7434, despite mining shares rallying, and there were deeper losses in Europe. Currency moves are to blame; the euro strengthened after ECB president Mario Draghi spoke about reflation returning to the Eurozone as its recovery picked up. The pound gained against the US dollar after the IMF cut its growth forecasts. Political developments in Scotland also nudged sterling up, as Josh Mahony of IG explains: News that the SNP have formally abandoned their plan for a second referendum before the completion of Brexit has helped the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ascent, with GBPUSD hitting the highest level in a week. The IMF cut their outlook for the US economy today, which when considering the negative path of core PCE inflation, makes a September rate hike increasingly unlikely. Newsflash: American consumer morale has jumped this month, despite the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns about the US economy. The Conference Board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer confidence index rose in June to 118.9, defying expectations that it would fall to 116.0 this month. Optimism is close to a 16-year high, says Lynn Franco of the The Conference Board: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Expectations for the short-term have eased somewhat, but are still upbeat. Overall, consumers anticipate the economy will continue expanding in the months ahead, but they do not foresee the pace of growth accelerating.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Howard Archer, Chief Economic Advisor to the EY ITEM Club, is struck by the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to bring forwards its consumer credit stress tests by a couple of months: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The risk to financial stability coming from the recent rapid growth in consumer credit would undoubtedly be magnified if there is a near-term interest rate hike. While any interest rate hike would be small with further increases some way off, even small increases could cause problems for some consumers given their high borrowing levels. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is notable that the Bank of England is bringing forward its testing of banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to cope with major losses on consumer loans to September from November. Additionally, regulators will in July publish their expectations for lenders in the consumer credit market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wall Street has opened lower, with the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgraded growth forecasts dampening the mood in New York. The main indices are all in the red, with shares in Alphabet (Google) shedding more than 1.2% after it was slapped with a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.4bn fine by Brussels today. The news that the IMF has downgraded its US growth forecasts and criticised Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget plans, has sent a ripple through the financial markets. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some snap reaction: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more reaction to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report, from Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank of England is right to flag our debt binge as a big concern. Rock bottom interest rates have made borrowing cheap and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve definitely been making the most of it. The harsh reality is many households would struggle to pay back what they owe if interest rates went up. Many are just about managing now and have little in savings to fall back on. Banks need to be prepared for this worst case scenario so they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on shaky ground if rates go up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has cut its US growth forecasts, and concluded that Donald Trump won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t boost economic activity after all. The IMF now expects US GDP to rise by 2.1% in 2017, down from 2.3% back in April. For 2018, it also sees growth of 2.1%, down from 2.5% three months ago. The IMF had hoped that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to boost fiscal spending, and cut taxes, would deliver a economic boost. But having seen the president in action, the Fund has had a rethink. Importantly, it criticises Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent budget proposals, warning that they benefit the richest Americans more than the rest. Reuters explains: The IMF said the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest budget plans would place a disproportionate share of spending cuts onto low-and middle-income households, adding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this would appear counter to the budget\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goals of promoting safety and prosperity for all Americans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Instead, the Fund suggested a tax policy that would improve the federal revenue-to-GDP ratio, more balanced cuts that strengthen the social safety net\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efficiency, and efforts to contain healthcare cost inflation. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been an eventful couple of days in Greece, where prime minister Alexis Tsipras has held emergency talks with striking municipal rubbish collectors over demands for expiring short-term contracts to be replaced with permanent jobs. With the sweltering heat fuelling mounting concerns that mounds of uncollected rubbish could soon become a public health risk, Tsipras invited unionists representing the workers to his office for talks last night. In a statement his office said the invitation was addressed to unionists \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to find a solution to the claims of the refuge workers and to avoid the dangers to public heath\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd posed by the prolonged strike\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and very high temperatures that are expected in the coming days.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Earlier today, scuffles broke out between unionists and security guards outside the building housing the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarters when attempts were made to unfold banners emblazoned with slogans and demands. The meeting is being described as critical by insiders who say given the heat wave now gripping Greece - and the arrival of hundreds of thousands of tourists in the capital alone - the strike has become a major political issue. How Tsipras will be able to negotiate his way out of the crisis - and keep labour reform demanding international creditors on board - is anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guess. Alex Buttle, director of car buying website Motorway.co.uk, argues that Mark Carney is right to worry about the boom in car loans. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The growth of Personal Contract Plans over the past few years has been astronomical, and the level of consumer debt this is causing is getting out of hand. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite the many hidden costs, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to resist the temptation of owning a new luxury car without having to find tens of thousands of pounds upfront to pay for it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The problem is that household finances are starting to get stretched and many people are probably living beyond their means because of readily available credit, including car loans. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If people really do start to struggle financially, then the priority will be keeping a roof over their heads, and they are far more likely to default on a car loan than a mortgage. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We could well see a spike in people defaulting on their car loans in favour of losing their home if the economic climate takes a turn for the worst.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound has inched higher against the US dollar through the day, and is currently 0.3% higher at $1.2764. However, it is still down 0.5% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1314, after ECB chief Mario Draghi gave an optimistic view of the eurozone economy. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153barrage of information\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability review didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually move the markets that much. He says: The FTSE maintained its 15 point drop, the gains in the commodity and banking sectors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the former benefiting from a Brent Crude bounce, the latter from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian bank bailout \u00e2\u20ac\u201c failing to counteract the effects of the drop in consumer confidence revealed by YouGov. As for the pound, while it suffered some serious losses against the euro, it still managed to climb 0.2% against the dollar. That wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the most illuminating press conference with Mark Carney, but here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we learned. The Bank of England is pushing the UK financial sector to prepare for a downturn, by making them hold an extra \u00c2\u00a311bn of capital. But.... Carney says this won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a problem, as banks already hold more capital than required, since the rule were relaxed after the Brexit vote. As Carney puts it: We want to move the levels of capital back up to the level they should be -- any time you move into more benign credit conditions there have been fewer defaults. The BoE is concerned that some lenders are becoming too reckless, saying that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumer credit has increased rapidly. Lending conditions in the mortgage market are becoming easier. Lenders may be placing undue weight on the recent performance of loans in benign conditions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key target appears to be complacency, as it scrambles to bring its consumer credit stress tests forward by three months to September. It is particularly interested in the car market, following the boom in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Personal Contract Purchase\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd deals. These allow customers to pay a monthly fee for a new car, and then either pay a hefty \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcballoon payment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to actually own it, or switch to a new deal with a new vehicle. The fear is that customers could be left high and dry if financial conditions tighten. However (and this is where the confusion starts) the Bank doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want consumers to cut up their credit cards and stop trying to shimmy up the housing ladder. Instead, it wants them to be sensible when borrowing, and trust that the Bank is keeping the financial system strong. Those families who are most over-extended, and wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cope with higher borrowing costs, are a concern, though: On Brexit, Carney repeatedly said the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contingency planning is focusing on the most disruptive scenario, in which Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean the BoE expects such a cliff-edge exit..... If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jill Treanor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story about the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report: Final question: Q: You say you expect to raise the counter-cyclical buffer to 1% in November, but could Brexit force a cut back from 0.5% to 0% (reversing today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move) Mark Carney says the BoE thinks the buffer should be around 1% in stable times. The BoE had started the process of raising the buffer last year, before the Brexit vote, which led it to be cut back to 0% to take worries about lending \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoff the table\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. So.... we could have decided to hike the buffer to 1% today, but it was more sensible to allow a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgradual build\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (to 0.5% today, and 1% in November) On Brexit, we want the system to be as resilient as possible to prepare for any outcome in 640 days time, he concludes. I think that means the BoE want the banking sector to be well capitalised, in case of any Brexit shock in March 2019, when Britain leaves the EU. Q: You say that West End asset prices are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunsustainable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122; when might they return to reality, and what impact would that happen? Carney reiterates his earlier point that Britain currently have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Very low risk-free rates, and high valuation levels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So either those rates should rise, or asset prices should fall. It would be foolish to put a timescale on it - prices can stay unsustainable for a long time, and then correct quickly, he warns. Q: The report talks about the need for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconsistent implementation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of international standards; are you particularly worried about the Trump administration? Carney says it is important to have open global standards, and even more important that they are implemented, to avoid another financial crisis. You also need supervisory co-operation between regulators...and we want to reinforce that where possible. On the US, we have had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very productive discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with regulators about it. Carney explains how many countries have some unique rules (such as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Volcker rule, or bank ring-fencing in the UK), which they can change without affecting other nations. But there needs to be more co-ordination when it comes to global standards, if there are areas of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinconsistency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that need to be addressed. [Explainer: Donald Trump has vowed to cut regulations in the financial sector, such as the Volcker rule which is meant to prevent banks taking dangerous trading risks. Trump is also keen to repeal Dodd-Frank, which was brought in after the financial crisis. ] Q: You point out that commercial real estate assets are overvalued, and could unwind if people try to sell them in a rush. That happened after the Brexit vote - has anything changed since? [explainer: several property funds froze redemptions after the EU referendum, to stop investors cashing out, exposing the dangers of investing in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcilliquid assets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 such as shopping centres] Carney says there is a disconnect between the market expectations for future growth, and the value of commercial buildings. So either those expectations will rise, or commercial asset values will fall. Q: Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the boom in consumer credit due to you keeping interest rates so low? Carney insists he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not to blame, and points to the broader context of a UK economy that has grown solidly over the last 12 months (despite slowing in the first quarter of 2017). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing how consumer debt has grown: Carney says the boom in car loans is a major factor behind the pick-up in consumer debt recently, but he remains \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sanguine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the banking sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall exposure to it. Q: Your charts show that consumer finance has been growing faster than household income since 2014, so shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you have issued today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning sooner? Deputy governor Sir John Cunliffe says consumer borrowing actually picked up in 2013, but overall household lending actually grew slower than the UK economy. Consumer borrowing is \u00c2\u00a3200bn, compared to \u00c2\u00a31.4 trillion in mortgage lending, he explains - so the BoE has to decide when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a serious worry. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been watching consumer credit for a while, and now is the time to look at whether underwriting standards are starting to slip, and bring forwards our stress test (by three months, to September) Q: Are banks misbehaving and gaming the system, and is there a cultural problem? They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not gaming the system, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not learning the lessons of the past, Carney says. Q: Which consumer borrowing are you most worried about? Carney cites the sharp build up in car financing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both in volume, and the move towards \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpersonal contract purchasing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 deals (where buyers pay monthly repayments, and then face a large balloon payment to actually own their car) Q: How confident are you that banks can raise the extra capital you are demanding? They all have this capital on their books at present, Carney replies. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a question of reallocating capital from other areas (and perhaps choosing to raise more capital) The extra capital buffer will mean UK banks must meet a 4% leverage ratio, Carney explains, but the current leverage ratio is actually 5.25%. In other words, Banks shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t face a massive challenge meeting the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demands. Q: Has the general election changed your view of how the Brexit talks will evolve, and raised the risks from political instability? The short answer is no, governor Carney replies. Our job is to work out what might go wrong and prepare for it, rather than assessing quite how likely various scenarios are. So June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contingency planning for Brexit. Q: How worried are you about the British banking sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exposure to China? Risks from China are at the top end of global risks, Carney replies. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to the build-up of debt, structural issues in the financial system, and the challenge of growing the economy while also maintaining stability. Q: What role are interest rates playing in exaggerating or reining in financial stability risks? Monetary policy is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclast line of defence\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, says Carney, and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need monetary policy to do our job of ensuring financial stability, Carney continues. If the Financial Policy Committee does its job properly, then the MPC can focus on its job of getting inflation back to target. Q: And what would you say to those who think that being responsible for financial stability is distracting you from the job of setting interest rates and controlling inflation? Carney (who chairs both the FPC and the Monetary Policy Committee which sets borrowing costs) denies that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got too much on his plate. It takes as long to decide to raise rates as to cut then as to leave them on hold, he replies. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been doing this job for many years at two central banks (the BoE and the Bank of Canada). And he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not biting.... Q: You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re telling banks that times are changing, and they should set aside more capital, but shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t consumers also recognise that times are changing and rein in our borrowings? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to give individual financial advice, says Mark Carney (you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on your own, folks, sorry). He then explains that the Bank is trying to strengthen the resilience of the core of the system, in case a crisis strike. The message for the public is that if things become bumpy, in the Brexit transition or because of problems in the global economy, then the financial system will be there for them, says the governor, adding: Individuals must take the judgement whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the right time to buy a property, or invest in a business, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to ensure that the financial system is there to help them with that. Q: You seem to be blaming lenders, rather than consumers, for the rise in consumer credit - but shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t people be more cautious about how much debt they take on? Carney says that UK households have deleveraged a lot since the financial crisis, and only releveraged recently. He wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that households as a whole are taking elevated risks. The first line of defence is that lenders themselves are responsible; the second line of defence is banks set aside enough capital incase of a downturn. Q: How concerned are you that UK consumers are borrowing too much, and will find themselves in difficulties when interest rates rise? Mark Carney replies that the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message, in good times or bad ones, is that anyone who takes out a loan should consider that they could face adverse conditions in the future, such as weaker growth and higher interest rates. This \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stating the obvious, which is often what you get from a central banker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, is particularly appropriate today, the governor adds smilingly. On cybercrime, Carney says the Bank is setting out the framework that will be needed to protect the UK financial system from computer attacks. On Brexit, Carney says the Bank is making contingency plans for all possible outcomes, and concentrating on those would have the greatest impact on the economy. That includes the possibility that Britain leaves the European Union without a deal (this is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccliff-edge Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that many firms fear). Carney says that forcing banks to hold more capital (by raising the counter-cyclical buffer to 0.5% today, and probably to 1% in November) will more protection to losses. Mark Carney begins his press conference by saying that financial stability has been strengthened since the 2008 crisis. But the job of tackling financial dangers is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153never done, and risks are evolving.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The financial policy committee thinks that the overall risks from the domestic environment are at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153standard level\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with most indicators neither \u00e2\u20ac\u0153particularly elevated nor subdued\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But there are some risks that require particular vigilance, he continues One is consumer credit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c growth has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153far outpaced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd household income in the last year, including credit cards and loans to buy new homes. And with the market competitive, lenders are vulnerable to a downturn. The second worry is Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the range of possible outcomes as Britian leaves the EU, and the paths to them. Mark Carney is facing financial reporters at the Bank of England now, to explain the thinking behind today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report. You can watch it live here: Google has been handed a record \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.42bn fine by Brussels over alleged abuse of its market dominance. It was a much bigger than expected fine, with most predicting a penalty in the region of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn. EU antitrust officials have accused the search engine giant of illegally favouring its shopping service. It is the biggest fine for a single company in an EU antitrust case, and follows a seven-year investigation. European commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: Google has come up with many innovative products and services that have made a difference to our lives. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good thing. But Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy for its comparison shopping service wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just about attracting customers by making its product better than those of its rivals. Instead, Google abused its market dominance as a search engine by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results, and demoting those of competitors. What Google has done is illegal under EU antitrust rules. It denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation. More soon... And here is the background: City experts are trawling through the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report. Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group has spotted a chart showing how consumer credit losses rise when unemployment increases. No wonder the Bank is forcing lenders to stash more capital in their vaults now, in case an economic downturn forces more consumers to default on their loans. Alistair McQueen of Aviva points to another chart, showing how a drop in house prices can ripple through the system, triggering \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfire sales\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and further losses. Steve Hawkes of The Sun has a pithy summary: The BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report is online here. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an infographic form the Bank, setting the scene: The Bank of England is also boosting its work on cybercrime and continuing its work on Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on top of ordering UK banks to set aside more capital, and rushing forwards its consumer stress tests. Here are the five key points from the financial stability report. The Bank of England is.... \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Increasing the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate to 0.5%, from 0%. Absent a material change in the outlook, and consistent with its stated policy for a standard risk environment and of moving gradually, the FPC expects to increase the rate to 1% at its November meeting. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Bringing forward the assessment of stressed losses on consumer credit lending in the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2017 annual stress test. This will inform the FPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment at its next meeting of any additional resilience required in aggregate against this lending. The FPC further supports the intentions of the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority to publish, in July, their expectations of lenders in the consumer credit market. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Clarifying its existing insurance measures in the mortgage market, designed to prevent excessive growth in the number of highly indebted households. This will promote consistency across lenders in their application of tests to assess whether new mortgage borrowers can afford repayments. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Consistent with its previous commitment, restoring the level of resilience delivered by its leverage ratio standard to the level it delivered in July 2016 before the FPC excluded central bank reserves from the leverage ratio exposure measure. The FPC intends to set the minimum leverage requirement at 3.25% of non-reserve exposures, subject to consultation. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Overseeing contingency planning to mitigate risks to financial stability as the United Kingdom withdraws from the European Union. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Building on the programme of cyber resilience testing it instigated in 2013, by setting out the essential elements of the regulatory framework for maintaining cyber resilience. It will now monitor that each element is being fulfilled by the relevant UK authorities. Another important point: the Bank of England is also bringing forwards its planned stress test on consumer credit lending to September, from November. That test will assess whether UK banks can handle a jump in consumer credit losses. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s change means that UK banks will have to set aside more than \u00c2\u00a311bn of extra capital to cover potential losses if the economy weakens: From the BoE, my colleague Jill Treanor explains: The Bank of England is to force banks to hold more capital in the face of rapid growth in lending on credit cards, car finance and personal loans. The intervention by Threadneedle Street, which could amount to banks needing \u00c2\u00a311.4bn of extra capital in the next 18 months, is one of a number of measures intended to protect the financial system from the growth in consumer finance. Here we go! The Bank of England has told Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks to start setting aside more capital to protect themselves from a financial downturn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the key lines from the Financial Stability Report. As predicted, the BoE is raising the counter-cyclical capital buffer (CCyB), so that banks must set aside 0.5% of their assets as capital in case of a rainy day. That means it is reversing one of measures taken after the Brexit vote, a year ago. Interestingly, the BoE says it expecs to raise CCyB again, in November, to 1%. More to follow.... Tension is building in the City as traders wait for the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report to hit the wires, in just five minutes. The rise in the euro has pushed Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets down. Ever index is now in the red, with the Stoxx 600 losing 0.6%. A stronger euro isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great news for eurozone exporters, of course. But the key point is that Draghi is being optimistic -- that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no reason to dump shares. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says traders shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too skittish: Draghi suggested inflation is becoming more sustainable and deflationary forces have been replaced by reflationary forces. Importantly he suggests deflationary forces are external, temporary shocks and the ECB can overlook. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what happens when you open the taps on a massive stimulus programme. The question is whether the Eurozone would survive without the QE support. Draghi sounded more circumspect on that front, arguing that he is confident that monetary policy is working but still needs to remain very loose. Again it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a stretch to describe it as hawkish \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Draghi is simply affirming that loose monetary policy is working without significant adverse consequences and therefore should be maintained. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not advocating tightening any time soon. The European commission just dropped a loud hint that the Google antitrust fine is coming this morning.... This tweet is from EC press officer Yizhou Ren: Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bullish talk has also sent the pound down against the euro, shedding 0.4% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.133. That means one euro buys 88.2p, up from 87.9p on Monday. Good news for eurozone holidaymakers heading to the UK this summer, but a blow to Britons planning a continental jaunt. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters take on Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech: The euro zone still needs \u00e2\u20ac\u0153considerable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd monetary support from the European CentralBank even as its economy recovers steadily and inflation picks up, ECB President Mario Draghi said on Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All the signs now point to a strengthening and broadening recovery in the euro area. Deflationary forces have been replaced by reflationary ones,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Draghi said at the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual policy forum in Sintra, Portugal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, a considerable degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for inflation dynamics to become durable and self-sustaining.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing how the euro spiked as Draghi spoke in Portugal: Oooh. The euro is rallying as Mario Draghi tells the ECB Forum that reflationary pressures in the eurozone are building, as the economy recovers. The single currency has jumped by half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.1235, with Draghi sounding more upbeat and hawkish than expected. Draghi has also told his audience that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a considerable degree\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of stimulus is still needed in the eurozone, and that the ECB must be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprudent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in how it unwinds it. Draghi has previously talked about a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsubstantial degree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of help being needed, and Arne Petimezas, analyst at AFS Group in the Netherlands, thinks this wording is significant. Not for the first (or last) time, Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message is that his policies are delivering the goods.... Over in Sintra, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is giving the keynote speech at the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Forum now. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being streamed here. Draghi says there are clear signs of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strengthening and broadening\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd recovery underway in the eurozone area. There have been 16 straight quarters of growth in the euro area, he says. But this nascent growth needs to become sustainable, and that means higher productivity growth. Central bankers face an unusual challenge today, Draghi continues \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they face growth that is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153above trend and well distributed across the euro area\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But at the same time, inflation is more muted than you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect. To decide the right approach (ie, when to cut the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus package), you need to understand the causes, Draghi cautions. And Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment is that monetary policy is working to build up reflationary pressures. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being slowed by external price shocks, slack in the labour market, and a change in how the labour market and inflation interact, he concludes. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Giles has pulled together a list of key issues to watch for today, when the Bank of England releases its twice-yearly report on financial stability. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Will the BoE remove its emergency support for banks? It could raise its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153counter-cyclical capital buffer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, to force banks to hold more capital. A year ago, after the EU referendum, the BoE reduced this buffer to zero, but it may now conclude that this emergency help is no longer needed. Will it try to curb consumer borrowing? The FPC may tell banks to cut back on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153teaser\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd interest rates, to prevent a surge in defaults. Is car finance out of control? UK car sales have been strong for many months, thanks to cheap credit and new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal contract payment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd deals that make it easier to buy a new vehicle. Is the mortgage market a worry? A housing crash would have very serious consequences for the economy, so investors will want to hear Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views Brexit blues? With negotiations with Brussels finally underway, will the Bank say anything about the risks of a drop in confidence in UK assets? More here. UK consumer confidence has plunged since June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election, as the shock of a hung parliament hits households. It gives the Bank of England a fresh headache as it considers the health of the UK economy, ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Stability Report. Pollsters at YouGov found that UK citizens are fretting about political uncertainty, rising inflation, falling real wages, and the state of the housing market. YouGov found there was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pronounced collapse in consumer confidence following the election\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The sight of Theresa May losing her majority sent its consumer morale index sliding to 105.2 from 109.1. For June as a whole, consumer confidence dropped to 106.9, its second-lowest level since the summer of 2013. Stephen Harmston, head of YouGov, says that the UK housing slowdown is causing particular alarm (Nationwide says prices have fallen for the last three months) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The hung parliament seems to have further dampened consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 spirits, which were already sinking following the continued squeeze on household finances. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the real cause for alarm will be the cooling of the property market, as this is one of the key things that has propped up consumer confidence over the past few years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re facing central bank overload today, with monetary policy chiefs speaking in London, and the Portuguese town of Sintra. All eyes will be on the Bank of England, as its powerful Financial Policy Committee releases its latest report followed by a press conference with Governor Mark Carney. The FPC, which is charged with maintaining financial stability, could order banks to rein in their riskier lending, following growing fears that consumer borrowing is getting out of hand. The Bank could also tell City banks to start restocking their capital buffers, having previously told banks to lend more after the Brexit vote. Meanwhile in sunny (ish) Sintra, the European Central Bank is holding its annual forum. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be hearing from Mario Draghi, ECB president, who last night told students in Portugal that his massive stimulus scheme was creating employment. Challenged over the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge money-printing programme, Draghi declared that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The millennials that found a job because of our policy, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pretty sure they are okay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [with the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies] . And he also denied that savers had been unfairly treated, arguing that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also benefitting from the recovery, as: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recessions are not good for anybody, savers or non-savers, It could be a busy morning, as there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a strong chance that Google will be hit with a whopping fine this morning, of over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn, for breaching Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition rules. That would end a long inquiry into whether Google used its dominant search engine to unfairly promote its Google Shopping service, but could spark an angry response from America. And then tonight, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful central banker, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, is speaking at London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Royal Academy. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re promised a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wide-ranging discussion about global economic issues.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On the corporate front, retail group Debenhams and car hire chain Northgate are reporting results, plus there are retail sales figures in the UK and consumer confidence stats from America to keep us on our toes.

Thank you for all your comments today and please join us again tomorrow. AM Over in Dublin, Irish tourism leaders have been expressing concerns about the impact of Brexit on the industry. Reilly Dugery reports: At a British Irish Chamber of Commerce seminar on Thursday, Brexit was described as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153train with lights coming screaming down the track at us\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by Eoin O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Mara Walsh of the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation. Shane Clarke of Tourism Ireland warned that Brexit had already had a negative impact on tourism, with 900,000 fewer visitors from the UK and a 20% decrease in British spending on the island since the beginning of 2017. Over 12 months, this decrease is expected to cost the island more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100 million. John Concannon of Creative Ireland insisted that in order to maintain its appeal to tourists, Ireland must find an identity, comparing the country to a younger sibling having the chance to step outside of his older brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow. Concannon stated that economic investment in cultural events and initiatives would increase the satisfaction of the local population and subsequently entice potential visitors to the island. All members of the panel agreed that the loss of a soft border and a common travel area would be detrimental for the industry and that significant investment would be necessary to ensure a sustainable future for tourism in Ireland. George Osborne, editor of the Evening Standard and former chancellor of the exchequer, has got another job, taking the total to six. He will take on the unpaid role of honorary professor of economics at the University of Manchester, starting in July. In a series of lectures and masterclasses he will build on his work on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153northern powerhouse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which he began in number 11. Osborne said he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bowled over by this honour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He now has six jobs: Editor, Evening Standard Chairman, Northern Powerhouse Partnership Advisor, Blackrock Speechmaker, Washington Speakers Bureau Fellow, McCain Institute Professor of economics, University of Manchester Read our full story here: There were no new revelations on interest rates when Mark Carney was interviewed earlier by Bloomberg TV. In fact there was no mention of rates at all, with the focus of the interview on a new report on climate change. Read our story on the report here: IG traders are forecasting a mixed opening for Wall Street: Sticking with the US, there were 244,000 new claims for jobless benefits last week, more than the 240,000 forecast by economists in Reuters poll. The figure for the previous week was revised up to by 1,000 to 242,000. US growth has been revised up to 1.4% (on an annual basis) in the first quarter, from an earlier estimate of 1.2%, the Commerce Department said. The boost came from unexpectedly higher consumer spending and a bigger rise in exports. It was still a slowdown compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, when GDP increased 2.1%. Thousands of striking public sector workers have held a mass protest rally in Athens as unionists consider whether they should continue a 12-day walk-out that has left tonnes of rotting rubbish on the streets. The government has not ruled out bringing in the army, or forcibly mobilising the strikers through recourse to the courts, if they decide to continue with the industrial action. Marching on parliament earlier, municipal employees held banners proclaiming : \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No firings, make all contract workers permanent now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Temperatures hit 44C in some parts of Athens on Thursday with the heatwave now fuelling fears of a public health crisis on account of the massive mounds of rubbish that have accumulated. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Depending on developments, all available state mechanisms will be used not to endanger public health,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the government spokesman Dimitirs Tzanakopoulos. With temperatures expected to rise on Friday the army could be brought in as early as this evening. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, who held talks with unionists on Tuesday, said obligations to creditors behind the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three international bailouts made it impossible to satisfy all demands. German consumer inflation rose unexpectedly in June, to 1.6% from 1.5% in May, the Federal Statistics Office said. It had been expected to fall to 1.4%. When harmonised to make the figures comparable with other EU countries, the rate rose to 1.5% from 1.4%. Carsten Brzeski, ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist for Germany, said this could be the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153last inflation hooray\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and considers the dilemma facing the ECB. Looking ahead, lower oil prices and the stronger euro exchange rate should lower headline inflation in the coming months. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s German inflation data provides further evidence for the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (and other central banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) current dilemma: a cyclical upswing without significant inflationary pressure. If even an economy which has just entered its ninth year of economic expansion and which has record high employment hardly shows any inflationary pressures, how could the eurozone as a whole do so any time soon? Over the last 48 hours, financial markets have been overly excited about the ECB and possible tapering. Looking back at the now famous Sintra speech of ECB president Draghi confirms our earlier view that the ECB has not drastically changed its stance, neither its own take on the economy or the future path of monetary policy. The ECB will strike a very cautious balance between moving towards tapering, without jumping the gun and distorting markets. This week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market reaction has been a clear reminder for the ECB that steering market expectations is an extremely tough job to do. Over in Greece, finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos is in confident mood. Speaking at a conference in Athens, Euclid Tsakalotos signalled that the debt-stricken country plans to return to markets within a year. He took many aback saying the country would attempt to access markets whether it had been included in the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond-buying programme or not. Backtracking from the Greek government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous stance that entry into the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quantitative easing programme was essential to market return, Tsakalotos said the belief now was that it would have a largely \u00e2\u20ac\u0153symbolic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd effect and, as such, should not be given with too much significance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t elevate it too high \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it would be very useful. It is important but mostly in symbolic terms,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told the conference also attended this year by officials representing Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quartet of creditors. The leftist-led government, he said, was now placing more emphasis on persuading investors that when the thrice-bailed out nation does tap markets it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a one-off. He insisted it was important that Greece - essentially exiled from capital markets since 2010 - didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too early.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we need to do is ensure that the investment community knows there will be a programme of access to the markets. When we do go, we want to ensure that the markets know that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apart of a strategy of going two, three, four times, so they understand not the details but the process.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here is our story on the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to refer the Sky bid to the competition watchdog: Bradley says parties will have until 14 July to make representations before a final decision is made. Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are up: Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, says she is referring Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a311.7bn offer for Sky to the Competition and Markets Authority for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153phase two\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd inquiry on the grounds of media plurality. The culture secretary is making a statement on her decision on Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed takeover of Sky... Eurozone economic sentiment rose more than expected in June to its highest level in almost 10 years, according to monthly data from the European commission. Optimism rose across all sectors of the economy, pushing the headline index to 111.1 in June from 109.2 in May. It was the highest since August 2007, and beat expectations of a smaller increase to 109.5. The commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business confidence also rose, to its highest level since April 2011. So all in all, eurozone firms do not seem ruffled at the prospect of Brexit. Peter Vanden Houte, ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist for the eurozone, says the survey suggests the European Central Bank is safe to take \u00e2\u20ac\u0153baby steps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd towards tightening policy. The eurozone economy continues its winning streak, making a growth figure above 2% no longer a fantasy. The current figures fit the picture painted by [ECB president] Mario Draghi earlier this week pretty well: the eurozone economy is definitely gaining momentum. One should note that the recent trend in oil prices is likely to push headline inflation down again in the coming months. At the same time, expectations for unemployment in the consumer survey fell to the lowest level since 2007. This could increase wage bargaining power and ultimately lead to higher wages, which is according to Mario Draghi the lynchpin for monetary policy. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item forecasting group, says that even small rises in interest rates could cause problems for households: It may be that the heightened squeeze on consumer purchasing power is increasing the need for some consumers to borrow. The Bank of England will be far from happy with the May consumer credit data, and it could bolster the case for a near-term interest rate hike to try to curb consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 readiness to borrow. While any interest rate hike would be small with further increases some way off, even small increases could cause problems for some consumers given high borrowing levels. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist and dove-turned-hawk, has been out and about on a mini tour of Wales (Barry, Porth and Ely in Cardiff). He reiterated his point that interest rates might have to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153edge up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if the cost of living continues to rise in Britain. He told BBC Wales: We need to look seriously at the possibility of raising interest rates to keep the lid on those cost of living increases. For now we are happy with where the rates are, we need to be vigilant for what happens next. Last week Haldane stunned markets with the declaration that UK rates may have to rise later this year. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of comparison site money.co.uk, says the rise in consumer credit is worrying. This jump is concerning - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worrying providers have been lending more money while the gap between how much credit they are willing to give v how much people are actually earning has got wider. Rock bottom interest rates have made borrowing cheap and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve definitely been making the most of it. The harsh reality is many households would struggle to pay back what they owe if interest rates went up. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re thinking of borrowing money you must be realistic with yourself. Work out if you can actually afford it and how stretched it will leave you each month. If you were to lose your job do you have the means to pay it back? News flash! The pound broke through the $1.30 barrier for the first time in five weeks. It is up more than half a cent or 0.5% against the dollar. Traders are standing by their bet that the Bank of England is readying for a rate rise after those comments from Governor Mark Carney on Wednesday. The stronger than expected consumer credit and mortgage approvals figures come just two days after the Bank of England told banks they must hold more capital in the face of a rapid growth in borrowing on credit cards, car finance and personal loans. Household finances are coming under increasing strain as inflation outpaces wage growth. That means consumers are forced to dip into their savings or take on more debt in order to maintain spending. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, says the latest figures suggest consumers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t losing too much sleep over the pay squeeze: May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK money and credit figures provide another reason to think that the consumer slowdown shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too severe. Not only was the monthly rise in consumer credit of \u00c2\u00a31.7bn up on April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a31.5bn increase, but it was well above the consensus expectation (\u00c2\u00a31.4bn) too. Meanwhile, the number of mortgages approved for new house purchase rose from an upwardly-revised 65,051 in April to 65,202 in May, also higher than the consensus expectation (of 64,000). This suggests that households remain confident enough to increase borrowing to help smooth consumption, in the face of the squeeze on their real incomes. Of course, this will do nothing to allay policymakers concerns about the recent rapid increases in unsecured lending and strengthens the case for the Financial Policy Committee to act to address this issue at its next meeting in September. The Bank of England has just published its latest consumer credit and mortgage approvals figures. Consumer lending rose by \u00c2\u00a31.7bn in May, following a \u00c2\u00a31.5bn rise in April. UK economists were predicting a slowdown in lending to \u00c2\u00a31.4bn. There was a 10.2% rise in unsecured consumer borrowing, year-on-year in the three months to May, up from 9.7% in April. It was the joint highest since November. Meanwhile the number of mortgages approved for house purchase rose to 65,202 in May, little changed from April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 65,051. It beat economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts of 64,000 approvals. UK banking shares are benefiting this morning from developments in the US, where banks passed the second round of the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress test. It opened the door to higher payouts to shareholders, and boosted confidence about the general health of the sector. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said UK banking shares are enjoying the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153US halo effect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Banking stocks jumped on the open after regulators in the US gave the greenlight to higher dividends and buybacks, whilst the hints of a shift in tone from central bankers towards tightening is spurring hopes of higher interest rates again. HSBC led the FTSE 100, rising nearly 4% at the start of play. Standard Chartered rose 2%, while Barclays, Lloyds and RBS were all up more than 1%. With a big index weighting that HSBC boost powered the FTSE 100 higher, while gains for mining stocks as metal prices firmed also supported. The boost seems to have been the halo effect from the US, as all the major banks passed stress tests, which means they can now significantly raise shareholder returns. The Fed has effectively green-lighted up to $100bn in dividends and buybacks. US banks rose in after-hours trading as a result. FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest risers this morning: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a mixed start for European markets this morning. The FTSE is leading the risers, boosted by the banking and mining sectors. The scores so far: FTSE 100: +0.4% at 7,42 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.2% at 12,674 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.1% at 5,248 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.3% at 20,994 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.1% at 10,697 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: flat at 386 The government is due to announce today whether or not it will give the go ahead to 21st Century Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed \u00c2\u00a311.7bn takeover of Sky. Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, is expected to make the announcement later this morning. She could decide to wave the deal through, discuss options with Fox to address any issues raised by Ofcom, or refer the takeover to the Competition and Markets Authority. Here is a reminder of the background: Some UK corporate news now. The Financial Reporting Council is to take a deeper look at the role played by \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBig Four\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 accountant PricewaterhouseCoopers in BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a3530m Italian accounting scandal. After \u00e2\u20ac\u0153initial enquiries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate governance watchdog announced a full investigation into the audits performed by PwC on BT over the three years from 2015 to 2017. BT wrote off \u00c2\u00a3530m in January over \u00e2\u20ac\u0153improper practices\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, sending its shares tumbling 21% in a day. Chief executive Gavin Patterson has since seen his pay packet slashed by \u00c2\u00a34m, while the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European head Corrado Sciolla lost his job over the affair. The euro is also climbing higher against the dollar this morning as investors bet on tighter monetary policy across Europe. It is currently up 0.4% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1425, boosted by comments on Tuesday from Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank. Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reflation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was returning to the eurozone prompted speculation of policy tightening, even after ECB sources felt compelled to clarify on Wednesday that he was not signalling immediate action. Bloomberg TV will be showing an interview with Mark Carney at 11.30. Markets are now pricing in a 50% chance of a UK rate rise by the end of 2017. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s see if the Bank of England governor provides any more clarity. The pound dropped sharply immediately after the 8 June general election, when it became clear Theresa May had lost her majority. Sterling has now returned to pre-election levels after Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise hint. It is edging closer towards $1.30 this morning, at $1.2974. Traders at spread-betting firm IG predict European markets will open higher this morning: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Markets had much to digest on Wednesday after surprise comments from Mark Carney were interpreted as a hint that he is moving closer to a vote for a rate hike. The pound jumped to a post-election high after his remarks at a European Central Bank conference in Portugal, and the currency has built on those gains this morning. The pound is currently up 0.3% against the dollar at $1.2963. However, the devil is in the detail and some analysts say that while his comments were certainly less dovish than his Mansion House speech, Carney wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suggesting he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ready to press the button on a rate rise just yet. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep you updated on all the latest developments. Also coming up today... At 9.30am the Bank of England will publish the latest data on consumer credit and mortgage approvals data. This should be interesting following the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning earlier this week of a rapid growth in borrowing on credit cards, car finance and personal loans. A snapshot of eurozone business confidence in June is scheduled for 10am. German inflation data at 13.00 is expected to show a slight dip in the rate to 1.4% in June from 1.5% in May. In the US we have the second revision of first-quarter growth, and weekly jobless claims data, both at 13.30. And here is a reminder of what Mark Carney had to say on Wednesday:",

Issuing a clarion call to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors to deal with a debt mountain approaching 180% of GDP, the central bank warned that failure to address the problem could risk Greece ultimately needing a fourth bailout package when its current rescue programme ends in 2018.

Thank you for all your comments, and please join us again next week. Have a great weekend. AM The Bank of Greece has today raised the alarm over the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt pile. Issuing a clarion call to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors to deal with a debt mountain approaching 180% of GDP, the central bank warned that failure to address the problem could risk Greece ultimately needing a fourth bailout package when its current rescue programme ends in 2018. Lenders, it said, needed to spell out their commitment to medium-term debt relief imminently. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Letting this pending matter drag on poses potentially serious risks,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Bank said in its annual monetary policy report. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[It] might even foreshadow the need for a new financial assistance agreement post- 2018, something that neither Greece not its partners would want.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Germany, the biggest contributor to the three bailouts the country has received since 2010, is opposed to even discussing the issue of some form of debt relief before federal elections in September. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt pile, by far the highest in the EU, is currently in excess of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300bn. The traditional relationship between the level of unemployment and inflation rate appears to have vanished: US consumer spending rose by just 0.1% last month, a slowdown compared with growth of 0.2% in April and 0.6% in March. Meanwhile consumer prices excluding food and energy were up 1.4% from a year earlier, compared with 1.5% in April according to the Commerce Department figures. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said that despite weaker spending and inflation, the US Federal Reserve was likely to press ahead with plans to raise interest rates. Despite the modest 0.1% increase in real spending in May, real consumption growth is still on track to record a solid 3% annualised gain over the second quarter as a whole. The fundamentals suggest that consumption growth should continue at a solid pace in the third quarter too. Real personal disposable income increased by a very strong 0.6% in May and, as a result, the saving rate rebounded to 5.5%, from 5.1%. Although the real economy is doing well, Fed officials are concerned that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t translating into stronger inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, with the unemployment rate plummeting even further below its long-run sustainable level, we expect the Fed to push ahead with additional interest rate hikes. Over in Greece, public sector workers are cleaning mountains of rubbish off the streets after a 12-day walk-out prompted health concerns. Helena Smith reports: Authorities say it will take at least four days to remove the mounds of rotting rubbish that have accumulated during the strike. With the country in the grip of its first summer heat wave, and worries of a public health crisis, sanitation employees are expected to work around-the-clock. Giorgos Broulias, an Athens vice mayor, told the Greek daily Kathimerini it would take even longer to disinfect urban centres where streets are now dotted with decomposing waste. The 12-day walk-out had enraged citizens and the tourism sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the engine of the Greek economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with many denouncing the workers for holding the country hostage to their demands. But the strike has also been successful for the municipal workers with the government eventually caving in to demands for short term contracts to be renewed. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras, who stepped in personally to break the deadlock, had argued that it was impossible to challenge the hiring freeze imposed on Greece by international creditors keeping the debt-stricken country afloat. The workers had demanded that thousands of jobs be turned into permanent posts. The stand-off was the first major run-in between the leftist-led government and labour unions and while halted for now, it may well re-erupt if disgruntlement mounts among unionists over this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s compromise. Analysts at Oxford Economics believe markets have overreacted to comments made by Mark Carney on Wednesday, when he said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some removal of monetary stimulus is likely to become necessary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if certain conditions prevail. Andrew Goodwin, lead economist, does not think the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MPC will be rushing to raise rates this year. Markets have been very sensitive to commentary from MPC members, particularly Governor Mark Carney. But in our view, the sudden move to price a rate hike in late-2017 is a major overreaction which was not in keeping with the substance of the comments. A reminder of those Carney comments: The FSTE 100 has clawed back its earlier losses and is now rising, after UK GDP data prompted a dip in the pound. Here are the latest scores across Europe: FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,374 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.3% at 12,448 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.7% at 5,188 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.4% at 20,786 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.4% at 10,575 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.5% at 383 Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, gives his take: The pound trickled back below $1.30 after that weak GDP was revealed, while against the euro, sterling saw its 0.3% rise shrink to 0.2%. This, combined with the halving of BP and Shell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s morning losses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the oil giants are now down 0.7% apiece after Brent Crude clawed its way back above $48 per barrel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c allowed the FTSE to climb out of the red. There was a similar situation in the eurozone as the DAX and CAC jumped 0.3% and 0.7% respectively. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the euro has lost some of its lustre, slipping 0.2% against both the dollar and the pound. Despite the region-wide inflation figure arriving at a [higher] than expected 1.3% (the more important core reading also beat estimates at 1.1%), that is still a decline month-on-month, damaging the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recently renewed hopes of an ECB rate hike. Here is the full story on the UK growth figures from Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics editor: Eurozone inflation eased to 1.3% June from 1.4% in May because of weaker energy price rises according to a flash estimate from the Eurostat statistics office. Economists had been expecting a bigger fall in the headline rate to 1.2%. Meanwhile core inflation - which strips out volatile items such as energy and food - actually rose to 1.1% in June from 0.9% in May. Jennifer McKeown, chief European economist at Capital Economists, said that despite the June rise in core inflation, the European Central Bank was unlikely to cut interest rates any time soon. The data will add to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sense that reflationary pressures are appearing. But core inflation is still well below the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near-2% medium-term target for the headline rate, and its rise has been concentrated in Germany. The Bank has repeatedly stressed that it will wait for core inflation to be on a clear upward path throughout the euro-zone before raising interest rates and we suspect that this is still some way off. The health of the consumer sector combined with the slight rise in core inflation reinforces our view that the ECB will announce at its September meeting that it plans to taper its asset purchases from January 2018. But we doubt that it will act before then and expect it to keep stressing that interest rate hikes are a distant prospect. Scotiabank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alan Clarke says the chance of an August rate hike is still on a knife-edge, after the ONS said services output grew by 0.2% in April (in line with expectations). The services sector is crucial to the growth outlook, accounting for more than three quarters of the UK economy according to the ONS. Clarke says growth in April puts the services sector on track to grow 0.4% in the second quarter overall, as predicted by the Bank of England. Unfortunately, that is going to leave us in agony for another month leading up to August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Super Thursday [when the Bank will announce its next rates decision and update forecasts]. Growth will probably be in line with where the Bank expected, but their inflation forecast will be shunted up. We are probably right on the borderline for a hike. The squeeze on UK household incomes is a concern for the wider growth outlook, according to Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item forecasting group. Consumer spending growth in the first quarter was supported by the household savings ratio falling to a record low of 1.7% from the previous low of 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016. This is not sustainable and fuels the belief that weakened consumer spending is likely to hold back the economy over the coming months. Archer believes that while there might be a bounce in GDP growth in the second quarter - from 0.2% in the first - the second half of the year will be more challenging for the UK economy. Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady, general secretary of the TUC, says the drop in the saving ratio to a record low is a big concern. These figures make for grim reading. People raiding their piggy banks is bad news for working people and the economy. But with wages falling as living costs rise, many families are having to run down their savings or rely on credit cards and loans to get through the month. With household debt now at crisis levels, we urgently need to create better paid jobs. And the government must do its part by lifting the unfair pay restrictions on public sector workers. Ministers need to get their act together quickly. It looks like we are at the start of another living standards crisis. The ONS data has provided fresh evidence that UK consumers are suffering from an income squeeze and declining living standards. Household disposable income, adjusted for inflation, fell for the third quarter in a row between January and March, which was the worst run since the 1970s. It dragged the household saving ratio to new record low of 1.7%, as consumers grappling with rising prices and weak pay growth run down their savings. The ONS said the drop in the savings ratio was partly down to tax payments, but added \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the underlying trend is downwards, reflecting relatively strong consumption volumes, increasing consumer prices and subdued wage growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The dark blue line below tells the story of what is happening to the saving ratio: The pound has dipped below $1.30 following the GDP data. It is currently down 0.1% at $1.2984. Darren Morgan, head of GDP at the Office for National Statistics has commented on the Q1 growth update: GDP growth for the first three months of 2017 remained unrevised at 0.2%. Growth was driven by business services and construction, partially offset by declines in some consumer-focused industries, such as retail sales and accommodation. The saving ratio has fallen again this quarter to a new record low, partly as a result of higher tax payments reducing disposable income. Some of the fall could be as a result of the timing of those payments, but the underlying trend is for a continued fall in the saving ratio. Services output in April was up slightly on the month, with the largest contribution to the month-on-month growth coming from the retail trade. The Office for National Statistics has confirmed the UK economy grew by just 0.2% in the first quarter of 2017, following 0.7% growth in the previous quarter. More soon... The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s August decision on interest rates is on a knife edge according to Scotiabank economist, Alan Clarke. He says much will be dependent on how the crucial services sector performed in April. He calculates that a 0.2% increase in services output would put in on track for a 0.4% increase over the second quarter as a whole... That would meet the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own expectation and make an August rate hike a 50-50 bet. Any reading above 0.2% in services output in April would make a rate hike in August more likely than not,while a reading below 0.2% would probably rule out a rate hike. The services data is due at 9.30 so let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s see what it brings. George Osborne came within weeks of scrapping the 1p and 2p pieces, the Guardian has been told. The former chancellor of the exchequer apparently wanted to make the change in late 2015, after winning the general election, but was stopped by David Cameron who feared it would reflect badly the Tories. Read our full story here: Paul Donovan, global chief economist at UBS, is taking a relaxed approach to the recent hints from central bankers that ultra loose monetary policy might be coming to an end sooner rather than later. Relaxed in a cosy Sunday evening kind of way. Think feet up, Downtown Abbey on the box. Donovan says: Central bank comments have been correlated (but almost certainly not coordinated) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as economist-policymakers all react logically to similar economic circumstances. Policy tightening is to be expected \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it will be genteel, tasteful tightening (the economic equivalent of an episode of Downton Abbey). The FTSE 100 is taking the hit from the (relative) strength of the pound this morning, down 26 points or 0.4% at 7,324. It is being dragged lower by commodity-based stocks, despite a rise in Brent crude oil prices this morning (up 0.6% at $47.70 a barrel). Elsewhere in Europe: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.2% at 12,395 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.1% at 5,160 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.2% at 20,746 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.1% at 10,544 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.02% at 381 UK consumer confidence dropped to the lowest level since the Brexit vote in June as people become increasingly concerned about what the year ahead will bring. The monthly snapshot of consumer sentiment from GfK dropped five points to -10, which was the lowest since July last year, a month after the EU referendum. The survey covered the period before and after the general election, and signalled growing unease among consumers about their personal financial situation and the outlook for the wider economy. Joe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK, said people were more reluctant to spend money on non essential items. All this concern will worry the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retailers, with this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plunge in the major purchase index (down eight points) reflecting our increased caution over non-food spending and our softening appetite for debt. Strong consumer spending has propped up the economy since last June but now the twin pressures of higher prices and sluggish wage growth are squeezing household finances and adding to widespread fears of a Brexit- induced economic slowdown. Read our full story on the survey: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound is trading at $1.3017 this morning, its highest level in six weeks, as investors bring forward their expectations of a rise in interest rates. There has been a shift in thinking in recent days after both Mark Carney and Mario Draghi appeared to tweak their language to suggest that policy tightening might not be as far off as markets previously anticipated. Their comments have boosted both the pound and the euro, to the detriment of equities, which suffered fairly hefty losses on both sides of the Atlantic on Thursday. At 9.30 the ONS will publish its third and final estimate of growth in the first quarter of 2017. It is expected to confirm the economy grew by 0.2% in the first three months of the year, after a surprise downgrade from 0.3% at the time of the second estimate. Growth slowed in the first quarter as rising inflation in the wake of the Brexit vote took its toll on consumer spending. Other key data today includes a flash estimate of eurozone inflation in June at 10am, which could provide clues about the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next move. Economists are predicting a fall in the headline rate to 1.2% from 1.4% in May.",
