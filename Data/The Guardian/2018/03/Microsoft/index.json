Snapchat wasn\u2019t, because of the might of Facebook and its Instagram service. Snapchat is a second-tier player: Spotify and Dropbox are top-tier players. It is a completely different ballgame.\u201d</p> <p>Some big names are counting on Ek and his counterpart at Dropbox, Drew Houston. Lining up behind Dropbox and Spotify are ride-hailing service Uber \u2013 given a notional value of $50bn in 2015 \u2013 and the short-term letting agency Airbnb. The former isn\u2019t profitable; the latter is. With markets jittery, both Spotify and Dropbox are working hard to push a story of future profits and growth.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Spotify used a web presentation to reassure would-be investors that it has a clear path to profit, pointing out that revenues grew 39% to \u20ac4.1bn (\u00a33.6bn) in 2017, though financing costs from a \u20ac1bn loan helped push operating losses up 8% to \u20ac378m. \u201cThe trend towards profitability is clear when you look at operating losses as a percentage of revenue,\u201d it said soothingly.</p> <p>Spotify is also taking an unusual approach to its listing \u2013 going direct, so that its shares aren\u2019t handled by an investment bank or underwriters, but simply offered from the company on the exchange to would-be buyers.</p> <p>Analysing that approach last year, the <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/04/07/spotify-ipo-direct-listing/\" title=\"\">business magazine <em>Fortune</em> said</a>: \u201cIf an IPO is like a wedding, a direct listing is running off to elope. A faster, easier, cheaper route to the same result.\u201d Of course, like an elopement, you might not get the big benefits: an IPO guarantees money from institutional buyers snapping up millions of shares. A direct listing could flop.</p> <p>Others aren\u2019t so sure about Spotify\u2019s potential, based on its finances and its business model. Spotify users have the option of a free service, in exchange for listening to adverts intermittently, or paying a monthly subscription fee of \u00a39.99, $9.99 or \u20ac9.99 for no-advert streaming. It is a compelling service with 71 &#xa0;million paying users, but the cost in payments to artists and record companies is huge: it has forked out $9bn in royalties since it launched.</p> <p>According to one investor, Spotify\u2019s gross margin \u2013 a measure of profitability once certain costs are stripped out \u2013 is not high enough and indicates that royalty rates have to come down. \u201cA 20% gross margin business is not a good business,\u201d says venture capitalist David B Pakman. \u201cOne of two things has to happen: they have to enter new business lines with higher gross margins, or somehow magically transform the rate structure with labels.\u201d The latter rate is how much Spotify has to pay per track streamed.</p> <p>Dropbox, meanwhile, was valued at $10bn when it last raised capital in 2014, but that has been slashed to between $7bn and $8bn for its forthcoming IPO, which is intended to raise about $610m. Steve Jobs was famously dismissive of the company: in a 2009 meeting, the late Apple chief <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/23/dld-2012-drew-houston-yes-steve-jobs-called-dropbox-a-feature/\" title=\"\">told</a> Houston that he had \u201ca feature, not a product\u201d. In other words: Apple or Microsoft or Google could add Dropbox\u2019s functionality \u2013 you drop a file in the folder on your PC, and it\u2019s available on your phone or tablet \u2013 to their existing software for free.</p> <p>Houston shrugged off Jobs\u2019s disdain to build a company that in 2017 had 500 million users and $1.11bn in revenues. Not bad for a \u201cfeature\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9b00a5b0e8306bb74190791c9d69a2308ed3c8ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b00a5b0e8306bb74190791c9d69a2308ed3c8ef/0_0_1992_2490/800.jpg\" alt=\"Spotify\u2019s Daniel Ek\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spotify\u2019s Daniel Ek has some big startups watching his IPO closely.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ilya S Savenok/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So why has its notional value gone down? Partly it\u2019s the company\u2019s revenues: in the absence of profits (it made a net loss of $112m in 2017, almost halved from $210m in 2016), a typical measure of capitalisation is a five- or six-fold revenue multiple.

In 2012, the venture capitalist Bill Gurley <a href=\"http://abovethecrowd.com/2012/02/23/why-dropbox-is-a-major-disruption/\" title=\"\">called Dropbox \u201ca major disruption\u201d</a>, saying that Houston and his team had \u201ctaken a hard problem \u2013 file synchronisation \u2013 and made it brain-dead simple\u201d. But now such synchronisation is a feature offered by almost everyone.

Dropbox\u2019s challenge is persuading people to flip over to paying for something they can largely get for free: Apple and Google both offer unlimited photo storage and as much free file storage as Dropbox.</p> <p>So, for both companies, plenty of ancillary questions remain over these valuations.

coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong><br></p> \n  <p>The battle to take control of one of Britain\u2019s oldest engineering firms is hotting up today.</p> \n  <p>Melrose, the turnaround group, has intensified the pressure as it tries to seize control of GKN, in an increasingly bitter fight.</p> \n  <p>Over the weekend, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/03/17/melrose-chief-launches-attack-gkn-bosses-losing-citys-confidence/\">Melrose CEO Simon Peckham blasted GKN\u2019s management, telling the Sunday Telegraph that</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cGKN has been run by people who don\u2019t have an owner mentality, they have a manager mentality.</p> \n   <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a business that has slowly but surely lost the support of the UK institutional investment community.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Relations between the two companies were already chilly (Melrose\u2019s plan for GKN includes dismissing its management and giving its staff more involvement). Peckham\u2019s intervention, at a time when major shareholders are having to choose who to back, ensures they are now sub-zero.</p> \n  <p><strong>And this morning, Melrose has announced that it has offered to put more money into GKN\u2019s pension scheme -- roughly \u00a31bn over the time it expected to own GKN.</strong></p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.investegate.co.uk/melrose-industries--mro-/rns/statement-re-final-offer-for-gkn-plc/201803190700060707I/\">It told the City</a> that this proposal is almost twice the amount of the \u00a3528 million deficit reduction package that the trustees recently agreed with GKN.</p> \n  <p>Melrose chairman <strong>Christopher Miller </strong>says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The proposal we have made to the trustees of up to \u00a31 billion of contributions under our ownership is a clear example of what Melrose does which is good for pensioners and shareholders alike and shows we are a good custodian for all stakeholders.</p> \n   <p>Melrose\u2019s measured approach represents certainty of strategy, value and management. We strongly urge GKN shareholders to accept our offer without delay.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>That might assuage some concerns about whether Melrose is a suitable owner for GKN.</p> \n  <p>GKN, though, insists that Melrose\u2019s latest offer (worth around \u00a38bn) is too low. MPs also have concerns, given Melrose\u2019s track record of buying companies and breaking them up to release value.</p> \n  <p>Unions also fear job losses - and are expect to meet with Melrose today.</p> \n  <p>Shareholders have until 29th March to make a decision....</p> \n  <h2>Also coming up today....</h2> \n  <p>Finance ministers from the G20 group of advanced economies are meeting in Argentina today.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap: Around $36bn has been wiped off Facebook\u2019s market capitalisation, after its worst day\u2019s trading in several years. Shares slumped by 6.7% after a whistleblower revealed a vast data breach that affected tens of millions of people. Politicians on both sides of the Atlantic are demanding answers. In America, senators are pushing for senior executives to be questioned on Capitol Hill. The Connecticut Attorney General is also opening a probe. In the UK, the information commissioner is launching an investigation. The ICO may search the offices of Cambridge Analytica on Tuesday, after Theresa May\u2019s spokesperson expressed concern over the revelations. Tonight, Channel 4 have revealed how the company\u2019s bosses talked of using honey traps, spies and fake news to help clients World stock markets were also dragged down by worries that Donald Trump\u2019s steel and aluminium tariffs would spark a trade war. In London, the FTSE 100 sagged to a 15-month low That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. Just in: the Connecticut Attorney General is launching an investigation into Facebook. It will centre on the Observer\u2019s revelations that the Facebook profiles of 50 million people were harvested by Cambridge Analytica. Attorney General George Jepsen says: \u201cNews reports that personal user information from Facebook profiles was provided to third parties without user consent are concerning and raise serious questions about how this happened in the specific situation involving Cambridge Analytica and about Facebook\u2019s policies and practices more generally. Today, my office has in writing initiated an inquiry asking Facebook to answer a series of questions about this matter. While we cannot comment further at this time, Connecticut residents should know that my office takes privacy matters very seriously, and we will move as quickly as we responsibly can to get to the bottom of this situation.\u201d Bloomberg have more details of the growing pressure to make top tech executives face a Capitol Hill grilling: U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, and John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, have called on the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to bring in technology company CEOs, including from Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, for public questioning In a letter Monday to Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, Klobuchar and Kennedy said they have \u201cserious concern regarding recent reports that data from millions of American was misused in order to influence voters.\u201d \u201cThe lack of oversight on how data is stored and how political advertisements are sold raises concerns about the integrity of American elections as well as privacy rights,\u201d the senators wrote. A hearing with the CEOs would allow the committee to learn \u201cwhat is being done to protect Americans\u2019 data and limit abuse of the platforms, as well as to assess what measures should be taken before the next elections.\u201d Global stock markets are now on their worst run since last November, according to Reuters data. Facebook was obviously one factor behind today\u2019s selloff. But, traders are also worried about a protectionist trade war breaking out. This overshadowed the \u2018Brexit breakthrough\u2019 between the UK and Brussels over a transition deal this morning. Breaking! Around $36bn has been wiped off Facebook\u2019s value today, as trading ends in New York after a rough session. Shares in the embattled social media giant ended down 6.7% at $172.5. That looks to be its biggest one-day loss in four years (and its biggest drop in value ever). That takes Facebook\u2019s market capitalisation down to just over $500bn, from $537bn on Friday night. Other tech stocks also suffered, dragging the Nasdaq down by 1.8%. The broad S&amp;P 500 index fell by 1.4%, with Facebook the biggest faller. Facebook\u2019s decision to hire a data forensic firm to examine the claims against Cambridge Analytica has caused some concern. Particularly as the UK Information Commissioner is planning to obtain a warrant on Tuesday to search its offices. New details of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s activities are emerging tonight. Undercover Channel 4 News reporters have recorded CEO Alexander Nix discussing the tactics it used. Here\u2019s a flavour: In a series of meetings with a reporter posing as a representative of a wealthy Sri Lankan family seeking political influence, Cambridge Analytica executives initially denied the company was in the business of using entrapment techniques. But Nix later detailed the dirty tricks the company would be prepared to pull behind the scenes to help its clients. When the reporter asked if Cambridge Analytica could offer investigations into the damaging secrets of rivals, Nix said it worked with former spies from Britain and Israel to look for political dirt. He also volunteered that his team were ready to go further than an investigation. \u201cOh, we do a lot more than that,\u201d he said over dinner at an exclusive hotel in London. \u201cDeep digging is interesting, but you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that\u2019s too good to be true and make sure that that\u2019s video recorded. Newsflash: Facebook has just released a statement, saying it has hired a forensics firm to investigate the claims against Cambridge Analytica. The social media giant says that Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan, who orchestrated the harvesting of Facebook data, has verbally agreed to take part in the audit. Whistleblower Christopher Wylie has \u2018thus far declined\u2019, Facebook says. The Wall Street selloff is gathering pace. Facebook\u2019s problems seem to be sparking wider alarm in the markets, with investors also worried about the risk of a trade war (and the prospect of a US interest rate rise on Wednesday) With just over an hour\u2019s trading to go, the Nasdaq is down almost 3% while the Dow is staring at a 450-point loss (-1.8%). More than $100bn has been wiped off the value of America\u2019s biggest tech companies today. Facebook is the worst performer (-7%), shedding around $35bn at pixel time. According to the Financial Times, that is one of the ten biggest one-day losses (in dollar terms) ever suffered by a technology company. Every member of the Nasdaq is currently in the red; Alphabet/Google is down 3.5%, Amazon are down 2.3%, NVIDIA has lost 4.8%, Apple is off 2% and Microsoft has shed 2.2%. The revelations about how Cambridge Analytica harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles is fuelling calls for tighter regulation of the tech sector. And if that happens, the world\u2019s largest technology firms could find their growth squeezed, making it hard to justify their immense valuations (Facebook is still worth half a trillion dollars, despite today\u2019s share price slide) Jake Dollarhide of Longbow Asset Management believes the implications could be huge. He says (via Reuters): \u201cThere\u2019s the thought that the government might try to regulate tech. You open a slippery slope. If you regulate Facebook what\u2019s to say that wouldn\u2019t have a domino effect. Google, maybe Uber?\u201d What\u2019s to stop the government for getting its fingers in all these areas. People have thought right now the tech growth rate has no boundaries, no ceiling. Today people are beginning to question that. If it\u2019s the case now, will it still be the case in the future.\u201d US senator Amy Klobuchar, who represents Minnesota, is calling for top tech executives including Mark Zuckerberg to be called to account: Facebook\u2019s share price is stubbornly in the red, and on track for its worst day in five years: The UK government has weighed in on the unfolding Facebook data story. Theresa May\u2019s spokesman has said the PM backs an investigation by the information commissioner into the use of Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica, adding: The allegations are clearly very concerning, it\u2019s essential people can have confidence that their personal data can be protected and used in an appropriate way. More here: It\u2019s a grim start to the week for stock markets, as a combination of factors leave investors nursing losses. The technology sector has been hit by the Facebook controversy, and in the UK, the slump in Micro Focus shares following a profit warning. There is also nervousness ahead of this week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, which is expected to sanction another interest rate rise. The interest will be in seeing whether new Fed chair Jerome Powell hints at three or four increases in total this year. Signs of some agreement in the Brexit transition talks has lifted the pound to a one month high against the dollar. But the strength of sterling has helped push the FTSE 100 to its lowest level since December 2016. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 121.21 points or 1.69% to 7042.93 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.39% to 12,217.02 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.13% at 5222.84 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished 0.98% lower at 22,633.10 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.99% at 9664.1 In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.79% to 807.44 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 429 points or 1.72%. The Facebook controversy means investors are shying away from risk in general, sayd Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG: Markets are in full retreat this afternoon, and the drop has been exemplified by a triple-digit decline on the FTSE 100. The index has returned to December 2016 levels, a remarkable change from last when it was riding high above 7200. Devoid of big macro data, investors have focused on the growing scandal at Facebook and this has resulted in a full-blown flight from risk. Investors have begun to fear that the social media giant has encountered its first real obstacle, and that further investigation will uncover other data breaches. The market has been in love with Facebook for a long time now, but with questions surrounding other tech giants and their use of data, it could be only a matter of time until others of the hitherto untouchable \u2018FANG\u2019 stocks find themselves dragged into an official investigation. Another retailer in trouble, as US jewellery and accessories group Claire\u2019s files for bankruptcy. The company said its international operations were not included but it does plan to cut back on the number of its stores in Europe. The full story is here: Meanwhile in the UK, Carpetright shares are down 17.5% and Mothercare has lost 12.5% as investors fret about store closures and future prospects for both chains. It\u2019s not getting any better for Facebook. It\u2019s shares are now down 7% in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica controversy. The technology gloom on both sides of the Atlantic, including worries about an EU tax and in the UK the slump in Micro Focus shares, is one of the reasons for the day\u2019s market weakness. On Wall Street the Nasdaq Composite is down 2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost 280 points or 1.1%. Investors are also nervous ahead of this week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting. A rate rise announcement on Wednesday is almost a done deal, but there is much nervousness about whether there will be three or four increases in total this year. In Europe, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.2% and France\u2019s Cac is 0.89% lower while the FTSE 100 has fallen 1.59%, not helped by a stronger pound after positive noises from the Brexit negotiations. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: A sharp decline in tech stocks, US politcal tension between and a \u2018death cross\u2019 on Germany\u2019s benchmark DAX index were all weighing on sentiment. Investors are extra touchy in the lead up to Wednesday\u2019s FOMC meeting and the first press conference from new Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The death cross, when the 50 day moving average crosses below the two-hundred day moving average, is a technical indication that the price trend for German stocks has turned downwards. Tech stocks saw some of the biggest declines on the day. Facebook\u2019s monopoly on personal data has put the company under the microscope again. There has been public outcry over the use of personal data harvested from Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica for use in election campaigns. The latest data scandal might well be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back for tighter industry regulation. Tighter regulation of how data is collected and used will inevitably curb growth for tech and social media companies that use the data to attract advertisers. Back with Facebook, and the company could now face regulation, sayis Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank: Facebook shares are down almost 4% as the Cambridge Analytica Files were revealed over the weekend by the Guardian. The files expose a major data scandal that Facebook did little to contain or correct. This scandal will fuel into the Mueller investigation and potentially pave the way for the regulation of Facebook as the social media platform is a national security asset because people\u2019s behaviour can be impacted through the network. Garney also warns about the impact of the EU Commission considering a technology tax of 3% on revenues: This is move to make technology companies, that are extensively using transfer pricing to avoid taxes in high tax rate countries, to pay more to society. These are just the first signs that major technology companies will be more regulated in the future. It is key for long-term investors in technology to have this on the radar. On a day when markets in Europe and the US are heavily in negative territory, Barclays is one exception to the rule. The bank\u2019s shares are up nearly 4% after it emerged that activist investor Edward Bramson had taken control of a 5% stake through his Sherborne Investors. It owns 1.94% of the bank\u2019s shares directly and the rest of the 5% through derivatives. Russ Mould, AJ Bell investment director, said: Sherborne has built a formidable reputation for squeezing improved financial and operational performance from the companies in which it invests and Edward Bramson clearly feels that Barclays shares are going cheap, given the prevailing discount to the book, or net asset value. The question now is what the activist investor thinks Barclays should be doing differently and how he intends to get those views across to the bank\u2019s boss, Jes Staley. The fall in Facebook\u2019s value has also hit founder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s personal wealth. His stake in the business has fallen by around $4bn in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica controversy. But don\u2019t worry too much. He is still worth around $71bn, making him the world\u2019s fourth richest person according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Today\u2019s sell off has wiped some $27bn off Facebook\u2019s value, as investors react to the revelations about its relationship with Cambridge Analytica. Breaking: Shares in Facebook have fallen at the start of trading in New York, after the social media giant was hit by a major data scandal. Yesterday, the Observer reported that data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica had harvested the Facebook profiles of millions of US voters, and used them to built a sophisticated tools to predict, and influence, how they would vote. The disclosure creates some huge questions for Facebook, as Cambridge Analytica worked for Donald Trump\u2019s successful election campaign. As my colleague Carole Cadwalladr reported: Christopher Wylie, who worked with a Cambridge University academic to obtain the data, told the Observer: \u201cWe exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people\u2019s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.\u201d Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals. Facebook is now facing criticism from politicians on both sides of the Atlantic. There are with suggestions that founder Mark Zuckerberg could be summoned to the UK parliament to answer questions. Conservative MP Damian Collins, who chairs the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, has said he plans to recall Cambridge Analytica\u2019s CEO to explain why he told MPs last month that his company had not received data from Facebook. Collins says: \u201cWe will be contacting Alexander Nix next week asking him to explain his comments\u201d. Tech shares are also being hit by reports that Brussels is preparing to impose a digital tax on the EU revenues of companies such as Google, Facebook and Apple. Facebook is leading the selloff, falling from $185 per share to below $176 in early trading. Ding ding. The New York stock market has opened, and stocks are dropping in a broad-based selloff. The Dow Jones industrial average has shed around 100 points, or 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is down almost 1%. Adam Leyland of The Grocer reckons the Conviviality crisis began after it floated on the stock market in 2013, and started executing ambitious takeover deal to consolidate the drinks trade. He point out that the company changed CFOs last autumn, and has also been hit by recent bad weather and the post-festive slump. Leyland writes: It seems incredible that a business could unravel as quickly as Conviviality has. But with tighter margins and sales commonplace after Christmas, plus tough trading and the snow to contend with, it\u2019s not inconceivable that an operation can quickly lose control of cashflow. And you lose it at your peril. The Grocer: Why has Conviviality spent out on company-owned stores? Newsflash: The CEO of Conviviality, which owns the Bargain Booze and Wine Rack chains, has resigned. Diana Hunter has stepped down with immediate effect, the company says, less than a week after the company\u2019s shares were suspended after two profits warnings. Conviviality is in a pickle. Firstly, it revealed that a spreadsheet error meant profits this year would be \u00a35.2m lower than expected. That was compounded last week when it discovered an unpaid \u00a330m tax bill. Conviviality, which is also a drinks wholesaler, is urgently seeking fresh funds from investors. Last week, Sky News reported that some were demanding Hunter\u2019s exit in return for their support. Brexit means colour-coding! The new draft Brexit deal text has been neatly shaded to show areas where there is full agreement (green), political agreement (yellow) and areas which are still under discussion (white0). It\u2019s official! Britain and the EU have taken a \u201cdecisive step\u201d towards withdrawal agreement, says Michel Barnier in Brussels. After intensive work, the two sides have jointly published a new version of the draft withdrawal deal for Brexit, says Barnier at his joint press-conference with David Davis. This includes \u201ccomplete accord\u201d on citizens right and Britain\u2019s financial settlement. But.. Barnier also cautions that a step is just a step - a lot of work remains to be done, especially on the Ireland border issue. So, they\u2019re closer, but they\u2019re not there yet. The pound is pushing a little higher, now up 0.7% against both the US dollar (to $1.405), and the euro (to \u20ac1.147). Politics Live has full details. Disappointingly, another 46 Carillion workers have been made redundant today by the Official Receiver. The receiver was unable to find fresh employment for these staff, following Carillion\u2019s fall into liquidation two months ago. This takes the total laid off to 1,582. In better news, 71 workers have been successfully transferred to a new supplier, which means 8,592 jobs have been saved - or almost half Carillion\u2019s workers. That leaves around 7,000 workers who are still working on outsourced public or private sector contracts which haven\u2019t yet been transferred to a new operator, or cancelled. The surge in the pound is helping to drag Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 down to a two-week low. Micro Focus is also doing its bit - shares are down a staggering 55% after this morning\u2019s gloomy update. This has helped wipe 90 points off the Footsie, or 1.2%. Other European markets are also starting the new week rather, er, weakly, with losses in Frankfurt (-0.9%), Paris (-0.7%), Milan (-0.4%) and Madrid (-0.5%) Investors are edgy ahead of several big news events this week, including the G20 finance ministers meeting in Buenos Aires (ending tomorrow), and Wednesday\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting which is likely to lead to a hike in US interest rates. Fed chair Jerome Powell\u2019s first press conference since replacing Janet Yellen will give the markets an insight into his thinking, and the likely pace of future rate hikes. A frisson of excitement is rippling through the foreign exchange floors, amid rumours of a Brexit breakthough. Britain\u2019s Brexit secretary David David is meeting with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier now, ahead of the crunch EU summit later this week. And there are rumours that the two men will announce that the \u2018broad\u2019 terms of a transition deal have been agreed. If so, that would calm fears that Britain would crash over the cliff-edge into a hard Brexit in March 2019. The pound has gained almost a cent against the US dollar to $1.40, and is up 0.5% against the euro to \u20ac1.14 (both the highest levels since February) Barnier and Davis are due to hold a press conference at around 12.45pm Brussels time (11.45am GMT). Our Politics Live blog will have all the action (plus the latest on the Skripal poisoning). Back to GKN.... and Melrose has swiftly rubbished today\u2019s news that America\u2019s Dana will list shares in London if it succeeds in merging with GKN\u2019s auto business. A Melrose spokeswoman argues that City investors will still lose out, due to London\u2019s listing rules. \u2018A secondary UK listing will make little difference to the problems it creates for UK holders with Ohio-headquartered Dana maintaining its primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Without a primary UK listing the shares will remain outside the investment mandate of many UK funds who benchmark their performance against the UK indices. Such a listing does not allow indexation, so UK tracker funds can\u2019t hold the shares. Perhaps more significantly many of the UK listing rules which govern corporate behaviour, such as shareholder approval for significant acquisitions, do not apply to a standard listing. There will still be a major flowback issue which has implications for the underlying price the shares are offered at. Basically, it\u2019s a fudge which is unattractive to UK shareholders\u2019 In a busy morning for takeover news, UK property group Hammerson is fending off an approach from French mall operator Kl\u00e9pierre. Kl\u00e9pierre has announced this morning that it approached Hammerson about a possible \u00a35bn offer. If it went through, it would thwart Hammerson\u2019s attempt to merge with rival Intu and create Britain\u2019s biggest property firm. Hammerson has swiftly rejected Kl\u00e9pierre\u2019s approach as \u201centirely opportunistic\u201d and without merit, even though the 615p per share offer is around 40% over Hammerson\u2019s value last week. Hammerson shares have jumped 25% this morning, as traders anticipate a bidding battle for the company - which owns 37 shopping centres and retail parks including Birmingham\u2019s Bullring shopping centre. More here: Reuters reckons the takeover battle for GKN is heating up today, with both sides sweetening their pitch to shareholders. They write: Melrose, making a hostile bid, said it would inject about 1 billion pounds ($1.39 billion) into GKN\u2019s pension scheme, its latest attempt to convince shareholders to back its offer and win over political opponents of the deal. Shareholders have until March 29 to decide on that offer. GKN is trying to fight off the Melrose bid with an alternative $6.1 billion deal to merge its automotive business with U.S. company Dana Incorporated leaving GKN focused on its aerospace division. Dana said on Monday it would seek a secondary listing in London, enabling more UK shareholders to back the rival plan as some funds are subject to rules which prevent them from holding US stock. The US company also promised GKN investors a slice of its dividend as it said it would pay its current quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share to the enlarged shareholder base. Bloomberg\u2019s Sam Unsted says it\u2019s turning into a full-blown saga: Over in the City, investors have been distracted from the GKN-Melrose battle by a truly grim announcement from tech firm Micro Focus. Micro Focus, a FTSE 100-listed software provider, warned that revenues will fall by between 6% and 9% this year, which will eat into profits. It blames integration problems following its \u00a36.8bn takeover of Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s software business last autumn, a deal that made Micro Focus Britain\u2019s biggest tech company. Micro Focus admits that it has struggled to implement its new IT system, which hit sales - leading to sales people quitting the business. Splitting HP\u2019s software operations from the rest of the business has caused further disruption to customer accounts, it admits, making it harder to win sales. Quite a mess. CEO Chris Hsu has resigned and is leaving with immediate effect to \u201cspend more time with his family and pursue another opportunity\u201d. Micro Focus insists it can fix these problems, and that the HP deal makes sense. But shareholders have reacted by wiping 50% off Micro Focus\u2019s share price. The unions who represent GKN employees across the UK will demand answers from Melrose over its plans for the company, when they meet today. Many GKN workers fear for their future, as Melrose\u2019s business model is to buy companies, make them more profitable, and then sell them again. One person\u2019s \u2018asset-stripper\u2019 is another one\u2019s \u2018turnaround specialist\u2019, of course. But unions are concerned that Melrose could load GKN up with debt, and take a dangerously short-term approach. Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary Steve Turner has warned: \u201cMelrose\u2019s bosses have been far from clear about the detail of their true intentions for GKN beyond vague platitudes and soundbites. \u201cQuestion marks remain around the levels of debt Melrose will pile on the company and what it means for jobs, long-term investment and product development. Turner also points out that aerospace giant Airbus - GKN\u2019s largest customer - has warned it couldn\u2019t work with the firm unless it knew its long-term plans. \u201cGKN\u2019s highly skilled UK workforce fear they will end up being sold off piecemeal, with their jobs either axed or shipped overseas to fund a debt-fuelled pay day if Melrose gets its way. That concern over Melrose\u2019s short-termism extends to major GKN customers such as Airbus too, which relies on a long-term relationship with GKN to develop the wings of the future. \u201cIf Airbus or other major customers take their business elsewhere it would blow a hole in revenues and destroy jobs and innovation. In another development, Melrose has lowered the \u2018Acceptance Condition\u2019 of its GKN offer, from 90% to 50% plus one share. That means it has lowered the bar to a successful takeover. GKN has hit back against Melrose\u2019s takeover bid. The UK engineering group has announced that, once it sells its Driveline business to American firm Dana, the resulting company will have a secondary listing on the London stock exchange as well as a primary listing in New York. That is designed to help GKN investors, who might have been forced to sell the shares they\u2019ll own in Dana-GKN Driveline if the deal goes through Driveline is GKN\u2019s automobile division. The \u00a34.4bn sale to Dana (who make axels and driveshafts) was hammered out 10 days ago as GKN battled to repel Melrose\u2019s advances. CEO Anne Stevens says that the deal makes sense for GKN shareholders, especially if they\u2019ll be able to hold onto equity in the new business through a London listing. \u201cSince announcing the deal to bring GKN Driveline and Dana together, I have had the opportunity to speak to many of our shareholders and explain why I am so excited about this prospect. \u201cThe complementary nature of the two businesses and our shared commitment to R&amp;D and long term investment creates a fantastic opportunity to build a world leading company and create meaningful shareholder value by delivering $235 million in synergies. \u201cThe listing on the London Stock Exchange will make it possible for more of our shareholders to participate in the expected value creation opportunity from the combined Dana and GKN Driveline business.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The battle to take control of one of Britain\u2019s oldest engineering firms is hotting up today. Melrose, the turnaround group, has intensified the pressure as it tries to seize control of GKN, in an increasingly bitter fight. Over the weekend, Melrose CEO Simon Peckham blasted GKN\u2019s management, telling the Sunday Telegraph that: \u201cGKN has been run by people who don\u2019t have an owner mentality, they have a manager mentality. \u201cIt\u2019s a business that has slowly but surely lost the support of the UK institutional investment community.\u201d Relations between the two companies were already chilly (Melrose\u2019s plan for GKN includes dismissing its management and giving its staff more involvement). Peckham\u2019s intervention, at a time when major shareholders are having to choose who to back, ensures they are now sub-zero. And this morning, Melrose has announced that it has offered to put more money into GKN\u2019s pension scheme -- roughly \u00a31bn over the time it expected to own GKN. It told the City that this proposal is almost twice the amount of the \u00a3528 million deficit reduction package that the trustees recently agreed with GKN. Melrose chairman Christopher Miller says: The proposal we have made to the trustees of up to \u00a31 billion of contributions under our ownership is a clear example of what Melrose does which is good for pensioners and shareholders alike and shows we are a good custodian for all stakeholders. Melrose\u2019s measured approach represents certainty of strategy, value and management. We strongly urge GKN shareholders to accept our offer without delay.\u201d That might assuage some concerns about whether Melrose is a suitable owner for GKN. GKN, though, insists that Melrose\u2019s latest offer (worth around \u00a38bn) is too low. MPs also have concerns, given Melrose\u2019s track record of buying companies and breaking them up to release value. Unions also fear job losses - and are expect to meet with Melrose today. Shareholders have until 29th March to make a decision.... Also coming up today.... Finance ministers from the G20 group of advanced economies are meeting in Argentina today. They\u2019ll be discussing trade, financial stability and cryptocurrencies (among other issues). The economic calendar heats up later this week, with UK inflation and unemployment data, plus interest rate decisions from the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve. However, today is quieter, apart from some eurozone trade and construction data. The agenda: 10am GMT: Eurozone trade balance for January 10am GMT: Eurozone construction output figures for January All day: G20 finance ministers meet in Buenos Aires",

Nevertheless Takeda\u2019s near.$42bn market cap versus Shire\u2019s $47bn or $66bn enterprise value raises questions on a potential deal structure....</p> <p>We presume Takeda would need a significant equity raise to acquire Shire, suggesting a \u201cmerger\u201d is perhaps better terminology, which may raise hurdles to the successful completion of any future deal.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jack Scannell at UBS says other bidders could emerge:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Since Takeda\u2019s market cap is close to Shire\u2019s we assume a potential offer would have to include a substantial percentage in equity and how Shire\u2019s board and shareholders would react is hard to predict. However as Shire\u2019s share price is significantly below the net present value of our cash flow estimates, Takeda could trigger discussion of other bidders.</p> <p> Shire does not strike us as an obvious take-over candidate. There is presumably a price at which the financial engineering would work. However, Shire\u2019s specialty focus and mix of therapeutic foci means that most buyers would struggle to extract substantial operational synergies while escaping from competition problems, in our view. Also Shire\u2019s low corporate tax rate could rise in most scenarios were the company acquired. It would also be a bold acquisition in our view given the uncertain trajectory of Shire\u2019s haemophilia business. A merger of equals in this context might be more feasible.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-03-28T12:15:53.943Z\">at 1.15pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5abb7826e4b0ea82609d1836\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-28T11:13:46.699Z\">12.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The potential offer for Shire has helped the FTSE 100 come off its worst levels after the morning\u2019s earlier declines.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s leading index is now down just 0.12% or around 8 points, with Shire up 18% and fellow drugs group GlaxoSmithKline 1.5% better.</p> <p>Elsewhere though the fallout from the US tech slump continues.

In a new report, the agency says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Global momentum has lifted the eurozone\u2019s economic prospects, and it now appears to have reached cruising altitude. The economic and monetary union closed 2017 on a high note, with GDP growth at 2.5%, its fastest pace in a decade.</p> <p>...S&amp;P Global Ratings\u2019 economists say the chief reason for this is the revival of world trade, which has put the eurozone\u2019s industries back in motion. Capacity utilization was just short of its 2007 high, triggering stronger investment and boosting industry prospects for this year.</p> <p>However, the general fall in sentiment surveys at the start of 2018 indicates that eurozone growth is leveling off. Firms are increasingly reporting that supply constraints, rather than demand, are a drag on output. Nonetheless, for now, we expect the growth momentum will stay solid, thanks to the broad-based economic expansion and strong domestic fundamentals.</p> </blockquote> <p>It added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Strong fundamentals in the eurozone suggest that economic expansion will continue at a brisk pace, and we have raised our GDP growth forecasts for the region to 2.3% this year and 1.9% in 2019.</p> <p>We\u2019ve also raised our euro-dollar exchange rate forecast to $1.27 in 2018 and $1.3 in 2019, since we expect the dollar\u2019s weakness will persist.</p> <p>The current growth cycle appears to have peaked, but the remaining slack in the labor market and productivity rebound will keep inflationary pressures in check until the end of 2019.</p> <p>Because inflation will likely remain subdued this year, we expect the ECB will only gradually wind down its asset purchase program from September until the end of this year. As the gap between structural and real unemployment diminishes, earnings growth will accelerate. Thus, we think underlying inflation is set to move closer to the ECB\u2019s target at the end of 2019, giving the ECB enough leeway to raise rates in Q3 2019.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5abb4edde4b0ea82609d1665\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-28T08:14:25.264Z\">9.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/neilwilson_etx/status/978906437593325569\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ftse100?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ftse100</a> under pressure, trend support being tested, touch here could signal a chance to rally? <a href=\"https://t.co/FAa65abmtJ\">pic.twitter.com/FAa65abmtJ</a></p>&mdash; Neil Wilson (@neilwilson_etx) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/neilwilson_etx/status/978906437593325569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 28, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5abb4c34e4b0ee234a057697\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-28T08:06:39.350Z\">9.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile the pound is edging higher, up 0.16% against the dollar at $1.4177 and 0.21% better against the euro at \u20ac1.1430.

Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The economic backdrop was supportive in the last quarter of 2017. Robust jobs growth and healthy consumer spending comfortably propped up the economy, which is expected to be reflected in an upwards revision for economic growth to 2.7% on an annualised basis from 2.5% in the previous estimate. The reading will not yet include the benefits from the tax cuts, nor the more recent uncertainties over global trade.

                "bodyText":"It was another volatile session for stock markets. After Tuesday\u2019s slump on Wall Street, driven predominantly by sharp declines in technology stocks, European markets opened mostly lower. However they came off their worst levels as the US market managed to stage a mild recovery, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently marginally in positive territory, up 35 points, although the tech-heavy Nasdaq is down around 1%. Amazon in particular is being hit by reports that the US president plans to go after the company and altering its tax treatment. The FTSE 100, now up around 9 points, was supported by news of a potential bid for UK listed pharmaceutical group Shire from Japan\u2019s Takeda. Shire\u2019s shares jumped, valuing the company at more than \u00a335bn at one point. Elsewhere there was more bad news for the UK high street, with retail sales falling in March for the first time since October, according to the CBI. But the US economy grew more strongly than expected in the final quarter. And there was a positive report on the eurozone economy from S&amp;P Global ratings. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Back with Shire, and Ketan Patel at EdenTree Investment Management says it could be a key moment if a deal goes ahead: If a bid does materialise from Takeda for drug maker Shire, it would be a watershed moment for Japanese pharma. There hasn\u2019t been a cross border transaction in the sector, excluding joint ventures and small generic M&amp;A. Takeda\u2019s cash laden balance sheet appears a good fit for Shire\u2019s struggling balance sheet, following recent large scale M&amp;A. The attraction for Takeda is the highly lucrative rare disease market in the US, which comes with exceedingly high margins and is largely exempt from the usual pricing pressure that affects the wider pharmaceutical sector. After Tuesday\u2019s tech-inspired slump, there is little respite for the sector despite US markets generally starting the day on a slightly more positive note. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 121 points or 0.53% in early trading, while the S&amp;P 500 has edged up 0.05%. But the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has opened down 0.35%. The stronger than expected US GDP figure will revive talk about how many interest rate rises the Federal Reserve will sanction this year. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Robust jobs growth and healthy consumer spending have been attributed to today\u2019s stronger than expected US GDP data, as the country\u2019s economic outlook appears in rude health and the 3% growth target appears within touching distance. ...As a result of the strong economic outlook, questions may be raised around the possibility of Fed Chair Jerome Powell introducing a June rate hike. It may be a case of US growth being monitored before any rate decision is made, but markets could be volatile between now and then. The 2.9% growth in the US economy, although better than the initial estimates, shows a slowdown from the 3.2% rise recorded in the third quarter. The figures were helped by the biggest rise in consumer spending for three years, offset by a surge in imports. The Bureau of Economic Analysis said: The increase in real GDP in the fourth quarter primarily reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures, nonresidential fixed investment, exports, residential fixed investment, state and local government spending, and federal government spending that were partly offset by a negative contribution from private inventory investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased. Breaking news: Something for Donald Trump to tweet about. The US economy grew more strongly than expected in the final quarter, up 2.9% on an annualised basis compared to expectations of a 2.7% increase and an initial estimate of 2.5% growth. Here\u2019s some analyst reaction to the possible Shire deal. Peter Welford at Jefferies says the structure of any deal is uncertain: We see the potential strategic rationale for the deal and have long highlighted Shire is currently trading at a substantial discount to our fundamental 4300p or so value given overhangs, notably haemophilia competitive concerns. Nevertheless Takeda\u2019s near.$42bn market cap versus Shire\u2019s $47bn or $66bn enterprise value raises questions on a potential deal structure.... We presume Takeda would need a significant equity raise to acquire Shire, suggesting a \u201cmerger\u201d is perhaps better terminology, which may raise hurdles to the successful completion of any future deal. Jack Scannell at UBS says other bidders could emerge: Since Takeda\u2019s market cap is close to Shire\u2019s we assume a potential offer would have to include a substantial percentage in equity and how Shire\u2019s board and shareholders would react is hard to predict. However as Shire\u2019s share price is significantly below the net present value of our cash flow estimates, Takeda could trigger discussion of other bidders. Shire does not strike us as an obvious take-over candidate. There is presumably a price at which the financial engineering would work. However, Shire\u2019s specialty focus and mix of therapeutic foci means that most buyers would struggle to extract substantial operational synergies while escaping from competition problems, in our view. Also Shire\u2019s low corporate tax rate could rise in most scenarios were the company acquired. It would also be a bold acquisition in our view given the uncertain trajectory of Shire\u2019s haemophilia business. A merger of equals in this context might be more feasible. The potential offer for Shire has helped the FTSE 100 come off its worst levels after the morning\u2019s earlier declines. The UK\u2019s leading index is now down just 0.12% or around 8 points, with Shire up 18% and fellow drugs group GlaxoSmithKline 1.5% better. Elsewhere though the fallout from the US tech slump continues. Germany\u2019s Dax remains down 0.7%, while France\u2019s Cac is 0.9% lower. Meanwhile US futures are suggesting a rebound of sorts on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average forecast to open around 67 points higher. Here\u2019s our story on the possible takeover of Shire by Japan\u2019s Takeda: Shares in the UK-listed drugmaker Shire surged after Japan\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical company, Takeda Pharmaceutical, said it was considering making a takeover approach. Shire\u2019s shares jumped as much as 33% to \u00a338.79 on the news, and later traded 17% higher at \u00a336, valuing the company at \u00a332.8bn. Takeda\u2019s market value is about \u00a329bn, around the same as Shire\u2019s at last night\u2019s closing price. Shire is best known for its ADHD drug Adderall but its focus in recent years has been on rare diseases. The company is based in Dublin for tax purposes but run from Boston. Most of its operations are in the US. The news comes three-and-a-half years after US firm AbbVie abandoned its agreed $54bn (\u00a334bn) takeover of Shire, after a US clampdown on so-called tax inversions by US companies buying an overseas business to secure a lower tax rate. Shire then turned acquiror and completed its $32bn purchase of US firm Baxalta last June. In November it reported a drop in sales of haemophilia drugs, which became its biggest source of revenue following the deal. The full report is here: Here is the full statement from Takeda, which includes more detail of the Japanese company\u2019s thinking: Takeda believes that a potential transaction with Shire presents an opportunity to advance Takeda\u2019s stated Vision 2025, build on its current strong momentum, and create a truly global, value-based Japanese biopharmaceutical leader. In particular, a transaction with Shire would: \u00b7 strengthen Takeda\u2019s core therapeutic areas of oncology, GI and neuroscience \u00b7 accelerate Takeda\u2019s vision to be a leader in specialized medicines that are transformative to patients through the addition of Shire\u2019s leading global rare disease franchise \u00b7 further enhance Takeda\u2019s robust R&amp;D strategy, concentrating on key therapeutic areas \u00b7 reinforce a strong and large-molecule focused late-stage pipeline within Takeda\u2019s core therapeutic areas to complement Takeda\u2019s own pipeline and discovery capabilities \u00b7 balance Takeda\u2019s geographic focus to align with the market opportunity in the U.S. \u00b7 drive financial value from a strong combined financial profile Clearly defined strategic and financial objectives are core to Takeda\u2019s disciplined approach to acquisitions, including in relation to its dividend policy and credit rating, which are well-established. Any potential offer for Shire, if made, would have to align with this strict investment criteria. Back to Shire: More from the CBI\u2019s high street survey: More bad news for the high street, with a new survey showing a slump in sales this month. Reuters reports: British retail sales fell for the first time in five months in March as heavy snowfall combined with the financial strains on many households, a survey by the Confederation of British Industry showed on Wednesday. The CBI distributive trades survey\u2019s retail sales balance fell to -8 from +8 in February, confounding a median forecast of +15 in a Reuters poll of economists. \u201cAgainst a backdrop of stagnating household incomes and weak consumer confidence, the lengthy cold snap earlier this month has heaped added pressure on retailers,\u201d Ben Jones, a CBI economist, said. \u201cFreezing conditions and transport disruption caused people to avoid the high street. With many forced to work from home, telecoms firms saw record internet traffic, yet on-line shopping slowed sharply given the potential for disrupted deliveries.\u201d A measure of sales for the time of year was the weakest since April 2013, the survey showed. Retailers expected sales volumes and orders to grow in April but only at a subdued pace. Elsewhere, the latest report from the Bank of England\u2019s network of regional agents has just come out with some good news to cheer British workers. Used to detect early warning signs for the economy, the quarterly report compiles the views of businesses recorded by the Bank\u2019s 12 regional outposts. In their latest assessment, the agents say companies are handing out pay rises worth between 2.5% and 3.5% - which would be inflation-busting for staff at the top end of that range. Firms are also telling the agents inflation is beginning to fade. Elsewhere in the report for the first three months of the year, there\u2019s an interesting look at how company chief executives are preparing for Brexit. Apparently, two fifths from more than 3,000 firms surveyed are not spending any time at all each week on Brexit. They had better hope the government\u2019s transitional arrangements, agreed in principal earlier this month, will help smooth the process as advertised. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a contrarian view over the collapse of Carillion. Far from being the disaster for the wider construction industry forecast by experts, firms tell the agents it hasn\u2019t had much of an impact at all. There has been \u201clittle evidence of a significant impact on the supply chain or on the availability of credit to the sector\u201d so far, the agents report. Shire shares - which climbed as high as \u00a338.79 on news of the possible approach by Takeda - have come off their best levels. The rather conditional nature of the Japanese statement means Shire is now at \u00a335.45, still 15% better on the day. Takeda says it is at a preliminary and exploratory stage in considering a bid, and no approach has been made to the Shire board. Meanwhile Takeda - Japan\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical company - is worth some \u00a329bn. This is less than Shire\u2019s value after today\u2019s jump, but around the same as the UK-listed company was worth at last night\u2019s closing price. Shire is worth \u00a335bn after its shares jumped to \u00a338 on the news of Takeda\u2019s possible approach. Breaking news: Pharmaceutical group Shire has soared 25% after Japan\u2019s Takeda says it is considering making a takeover approach to the company. Takeda has until 5pm on 25 April to decide whether to make a firm bid or walk away. The Easter break couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time for stock markets, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at GKFX: Investors were already on edge having been shocked by February\u2019s equity sell-off triggered by the dual spike in volatility and bond yields. Despite a strong rebound, the major stock indices remain fragile with many in danger of breaking back below some major technical levels \u2013 in particular, the lower level of the S&amp;P\u2019s bullish trendline advance since February 2016. This has been brought sharply into focus with the sell-off in tech stocks, which have lead the market rally for so long, catalysed by the scandal surrounding Facebook\u2019s cavalier attitude to its users\u2019 data. Now we have a long holiday weekend which coincides with the close of the first quarter. Once again, bonds are in focus \u2013 particularly the US 10-year Treasury. But this time yields have slumped with the 10-year crashing back below the key 2.80% level which has held as support for the past six weeks. Investors are piling back into the perceived \u201csafe haven\u201d of fixed income as stock markets slide... And this comes against a backdrop of tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, concerns over the outbreak of trade wars and worries about changes in key White House personnel leading to a more hawkish foreign policy. All-in-all, investors will see plenty of reasons to reduce equity exposure as we head into the weekend. Markets could be in for a run of volatility similar to the summer of 2015, says Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG: Markets remain under pressure as the sell-off in tech spreads once more to the wider equities space. The bounce on Tuesday looks like a flash in the pan, with more and more investors heading to the exit. It is looking increasingly likely that we have a re-run of August 2015 on our hands; equities then had months of volatility to contend with before the rally resumed. With trade wars and the tech scandal weighing on sentiment we may well have more downside to content with... The rout in global growth stocks has been seen in the falls in mining and bank names in London. Particularly hard hit among the banks are the Asia-focussed giants HSBC and Standard Chartered, while miners have seen further outflows as investors downgrade their optimistic views on global economic expansion. Oil prices are on the slide after a surprise rise in US stockpiles. Brent crude is currently down 0.6% at $69.68 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 1% lower at $64.6. The American Petroleum Institute said late on Tuesday that US weekly crude stocks had risen unexpectedly by 5.3m barrels to 430.6m barrels. Here\u2019s an interesting chart on market bubbles: The eurozone is seeing steady economic growth, thanks to a revival in world trade, according to S&amp;P Global Ratings. In a new report, the agency says: Global momentum has lifted the eurozone\u2019s economic prospects, and it now appears to have reached cruising altitude. The economic and monetary union closed 2017 on a high note, with GDP growth at 2.5%, its fastest pace in a decade. ...S&amp;P Global Ratings\u2019 economists say the chief reason for this is the revival of world trade, which has put the eurozone\u2019s industries back in motion. Capacity utilization was just short of its 2007 high, triggering stronger investment and boosting industry prospects for this year. However, the general fall in sentiment surveys at the start of 2018 indicates that eurozone growth is leveling off. Firms are increasingly reporting that supply constraints, rather than demand, are a drag on output. Nonetheless, for now, we expect the growth momentum will stay solid, thanks to the broad-based economic expansion and strong domestic fundamentals. It added: Strong fundamentals in the eurozone suggest that economic expansion will continue at a brisk pace, and we have raised our GDP growth forecasts for the region to 2.3% this year and 1.9% in 2019. We\u2019ve also raised our euro-dollar exchange rate forecast to $1.27 in 2018 and $1.3 in 2019, since we expect the dollar\u2019s weakness will persist. The current growth cycle appears to have peaked, but the remaining slack in the labor market and productivity rebound will keep inflationary pressures in check until the end of 2019. Because inflation will likely remain subdued this year, we expect the ECB will only gradually wind down its asset purchase program from September until the end of this year. As the gap between structural and real unemployment diminishes, earnings growth will accelerate. Thus, we think underlying inflation is set to move closer to the ECB\u2019s target at the end of 2019, giving the ECB enough leeway to raise rates in Q3 2019. Meanwhile the pound is edging higher, up 0.16% against the dollar at $1.4177 and 0.21% better against the euro at \u20ac1.1430. Lee Hardman, currency analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said: The ongoing reduction in Brexit risks and more hawkish outlook for Bank of England policy are the key drivers behind the pound\u2019s upward momentum. The pound has derived some additional support from a report that Irish officials have been told to expect new plans \u201cimminently\u201d on how Britain plans to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland. While short on details, the report has further boosted confidence that the UK and EU can find a workable and timely solution to the Irish border issue to support plans for a \u201csmooth &amp; orderly Brexit\u201d. Nevertheless, it still remains a potential banana skin for the pound in the coming months if intensified Brexit talks do not progress as well as hoped. Among the day\u2019s company news, furniture group DFS has bucked the gloom in the high street with an upbeat outlook. It reported a 7.4% fall in underlying half year profits to \u00a330m, in line with expectations, and chief executive Ian Filby said: We have seen a strengthening trading performance across the first half of the financial year and through February into March. We therefore remain confident that, despite the current challenging market conditions, the group will deliver modest growth in [earnings] and generate strong cashflow across this financial year, in line with our expectations. Analysts at Stifel issued a buy note, saying: Management is striking a confident tone today (despite a challenging market), as the group heads into an easier comparison phase....The shares were pricing in bad news, so we\u2019d expect to see a decent relief rally today. Indeed the shares are up nearly 6% in early trading. Stifel added We still believe in the long-term attractions of DFS Furniture. It is a highly cash generative market leader, which is consolidating the physical market at the same time as some online pure players re-evaluate their business models. More on the tech fallout, which saw the US FANG stocks have their worst day for more than two years. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said: The tech sector is predominantly getting battered, mainly due to the woes of Facebook\u2019s data breach. We clearly have three kind of investors when it comes to the Facebook; firstly there are some who are jumping out of the ship, pushing the stock price lower. Secondly, we have investors who are watching the show from the sideline and thinking there is more pain to come as we do not know how big the potential fine could be. This is not helping the stock price either. Finally, we have those who are not interested in Facebook anymore as they think that the regulatory burdensome on Facebook is too risky for their appetite and they do not want to get involved in this stock. We personally think, that Facebook has strong fundamentals and it has become the part of everyone\u2019s daily life, so once we have a clear idea about the potential sum which the firm would have to pay as a result of this situation, the stock price could present a potential opportunity. As for the FANG stock including Microsoft, Twitter, it is likely that the Facebook incident would open the door for more scrutiny for other firms, and lawmakers would see how other firms are using user data. This could really open the can of worms and open a potential opportunity for short sellers. Following the falls on Wall Street and in Asia, European markets have indeed dropped back in early trading. The FTSE 100 is down 0.7%, with software group Sage slipping 1.8% and mining shares also among the leading fallers. France\u2019s Cac and Spain\u2019s Ibex have fallen 0.9% while Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is 0.88% lower. In Germany, the Dax has dropped 0.77%. In the wake of the decline of the US technology stocks, Europe\u2019s tech index is down 1.1%. Here are IG\u2019s opening calls for European markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. An early rally on Wall Street went south by the close of play yesterday, and the turnaround is likely to weigh on European markets at today\u2019s open. Relief that the US and China appeared to be talking about averting a damaging trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies had given some support to markets. But a tech turnaround saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average drop 1.4% while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.93% and the S&amp;P 500 fell 1.73%. The so-called FANG technology stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet) were under pressure on fears of growing regulation in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica revelations. Tesla was also a big faller, down more than 8% on news of a Federal investigation into a fatal crash in California. The drop in the US filtered through to Asia, with the NIkkei 225 down 1.4% and the Hang Seng 1.57% lower. In Europe the FTSE 100 is forecast to open down around 50 points, back below 7000, while Germany\u2019s Dax could drop 120 points after European markets ended higher on Tuesday. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: For all the gains seen in US markets over the past 18 months the bulk of these have been driven by tech stocks, and yesterday these tech stocks swooned quite sharply, reversing a good proportion of Monday\u2019s gains, in the process dragging the S&amp;P500 back down towards its 200 day moving average. This rolling over in tech stocks looks set to weigh on European markets this morning, with a lower open as markets mull over the potential for uncertainty over a tech sector that could catch a cold as a result of Facebook\u2019s woes around user data. With the increasing focus on what is going with respect to how Facebook has managed its users personal data, it must surely be only a matter of time before attention turns to the rest of the tech sector, and how companies like Alphabet, Twitter, Microsoft and Apple to name a few, manage their own users personal data. If lawmakers do turn their attention to the rest of the sector, which seems likely, then it is hard not to see how other tech companies will escape scrutiny on how they use this user data, raising the prospect that we could uncover other practices that invite scrutiny. In the run-up to the Easter break there is a smattering of economic news in the form of the CBI\u2019s monthly snapshot of the retail sector and the latest US GDP figures. The US economy is expected to have grown by 2.7% in the fourth quarter on an annualised basis, up from 2.5%. Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group said: The economic backdrop was supportive in the last quarter of 2017. Robust jobs growth and healthy consumer spending comfortably propped up the economy, which is expected to be reflected in an upwards revision for economic growth to 2.7% on an annualised basis from 2.5% in the previous estimate. The reading will not yet include the benefits from the tax cuts, nor the more recent uncertainties over global trade. However, given how quiet the economic calendar is, the reading is expected to attract attention anyway. A surprise to the upside, could boost the possibility of a June rate hike up from the CME FedWatch odds of 78%, lifting the dollar back towards 90.00. On the contrary, should growth remain around 2.5%, we could see buying demand for the dollar decline and the greenback look to test 89.00 once more.
