                "bodyText":"The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest advertising and marketing services group, WPP, has said last year was its worst since the 2009 recession, as it published gender pay gap figures. The UK company reported a 0.9% fall in revenues to \u00c2\u00a315.2bn in its results for 2017, making it WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst year in growth terms since 2009 when the company reported a fall of 8.1% during the depths of the recession following the credit crunch. WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price fell more than 14% in early trading on Thursday, the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, after the company said there had been no improvement in trading so far this year and cut its long-term profit outlook. Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, admitted 2017 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was not a pretty year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the company but denied it was because his agencies were being cut out of deals between advertisers and Google and Facebook. The tech companies account for almost 60% of the \u00c2\u00a319.7bn UK internet market and hoover up as much as 90% of all new money coming in. However, Sorrell said advertisers were still using his agencies to spend money with the technology companies, and were not cutting them out by doing direct deals. Sorrell, one of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highest-paid chief executives, who took home \u00c2\u00a348m in 2016, said WPP spent more than $6bn (\u00c2\u00a34.4bn) of its clients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 advertising and marketing money with Google, its biggest single investment, last year, a 10% rise. Facebook received about $2.1bn of its ad spend last year, a 30% rise. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The major factors influencing [WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] performance were probably the long-term impact of technological disruption and more the short-term focus of zero-based budgeters, activist investors and private equity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Zero-based budgeting is a marketing strategy where a company starts with a clean slate each year, rather than taking the previous year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advertising spend as a benchmark. WPP also published a gender pay gap report for the 14,000 staff in the UK. For basic pay excluding bonuses there was a median hourly gap of 14.6% between men and women, compared with the UK average of 18.4%. The difference between men and women was far higher on bonuses, with a median gap of 46.3%. The report found that while overall 51% of WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK workforce are men, only 38% of women employees were in the most senior roles in the top 25% pay bracket. WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pre-tax profits rose 7.7% to \u00c2\u00a32.1bn last year, but the company indicated that this year there would probably be job cuts among its 130,000 global staff. WPP needed to put a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continued emphasis on balancing revenue growth with headcount increases and improvement in staff costs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it said. Staff costs climbed from \u00c2\u00a37.78bn to \u00c2\u00a38.3bn last year, with more than \u00c2\u00a3320m paid out in cash and share-based performance bonuses.",

Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Powell is also making some interesting points about student debt; suggesting it could be wiped away if an individual is made bankrupt. Background: The US Education Department said this week it will review when borrowers can discharge student loans, an indication it could become easier to expunge those loans in bankruptcy. Fed chair Jerome Powell is exhibiting a more dovish plumage to Congress today, having come over as quite the hawk on Tuesday. Jerome Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious comments about wage inflation have taken some of the sizzle out of the US dollar. Shares have also pushed higher on Wall Street, as traders shed some of their worries about rate increases. Over in Washington, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is testifying to the Senate banking committee. His prepared testimony was the same as Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offering to the House, so it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t move the markets. But Powell now taking questions....and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delivered a dovish-sound comment on wages increases. Perhaps importantly, the new Fed chief says there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any signs of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdecisive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 move in wages. That could dampen expectations of hefty interest rate rises this year. CNBC has the details: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that there are no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153decisive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd signs of wage inflation yet. Speaking in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, the central bank head also said more gains can come in the labor market without causing harmful levels of inflation. The remarks are significant in that during Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks two days ago before the House Financial Services Committee were interpreted as being more concerned about inflation, leading the Fed to a more aggressive path in interest rate hikes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any strong evidence yet of a decisive move up in wages. We see wages by a couple of measures trending up a little bit, but most of them continuing to grow at two and a half percent,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nothing is suggesting to me that wage inflation is at a point of accelerating. I would expect that some continued strengthening in the labor market can take place without causing inflation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics is impressed by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US manufacturing figures: The rise in the ISM manufacturing index in February to 60.8, from 59.1, left it at a 13-year high and suggests that growth is set to pick up following a soft start to the year. On past form, the index is consistent with real GDP growth of more than 5% annualised. Rupert Harrison of BlackRock suggests Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reforms are helping: James Knightley of ING says the data supports the case for four US interest rate rises this year: Given orders and production are also well above the 60 level \u00e2\u20ac\u201c remember that a reading of 50 notionally means stable output - the report suggests that the manufacturing sector will continue to contribute significantly to economic activity in coming months. However, inflation pressures are also clearly building with prices paid the highest since 2011. As such, this report supports our predictions that the US economy will expand 3% this year and that headline inflation could hit 3% in the summer. With new Fed Chair Jay Powell seemingly backing the case for further policy tightening, we look for a March 21st rate hike with three more to follow later this year. Charlie Bilello of Pension Partners puts today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data in context: More strong US economic data! Growth among American factories jumped last month, to the highest level in 13 years. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the Institute of Supply Management. Its monthly manufacturing PMI survey has risen to 60.3 in February, up from January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 59.1. Economists had expected a small fall. Instead, ISM reports that new orders and employment growth were both strong, keeping activity in the sector bubbling away. In contrast, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory PMI fell to 55.2 this morning, while the eurozone posted 58.6. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Back in the UK, households have been told to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccarry on cooking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, despite the shortfall in gas supplies. Energy minister Claire Perry has pledged that domestic supplies won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be disrupted, so Britons should \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdcarrying on using your gas heating and cooking meals as normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, on the surprise drop in US jobless claims: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the final week of February 1969, 201,000 US workers made jobless claims (seasonally adjusted). Led Zeppelin had just released their debut album, the Vietnam war was raging, and some 69 million workers were on Non-Farm Payrolls. Unemployment was below 4%. The fact that a comparable number of initial jobless claims are being made today illustrates just how tight the US labour market is getting. We also have fresh data showing that inflationary pressure are building in America, although not dramatically. The prices paid by US consumers rose by 0.4% in January, although the annual rate remains below the significant 2% level. Reuters has the details: U.S. consumer prices increased in January, with a gauge of underlying inflation posting its largest gain in 12 months, bolstering views that price pressures will accelerate this year. The Commerce Department said on Thursday consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 0.4%. That was the biggest increase since September and followed a 0.1 percent gain in December. In the 12 months through January, the PCE price index rose 1.7% after a similar gain in December because of base effects. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index advanced 0.3% in January - the largest gain since January 2017. Economist Danny Blanchflower reckons this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an excuse to raise US interest rates.... Significantly, the four-week moving average of US jobless claims has also hit a 48-year low. This measure, which strips out week-to-week volatility, fell 5,000 to 220,500 last week. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mike McKee says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US unemployment data is seriously impressive: Analyst Marco Mazzocco says the figures highlight the strength of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery Financial blogger Bill McBride has tweeted a graph showing the initial claims figures over the decades: Breaking: The number of Americans signing on for unemployment benefit has hit its lowest level in almost 50 years. The weekly initial claims survey shows that just 210,000 US citizens filed new claims last week, down from 220,000 the previous week. This extends a long run of impressive jobs data, underlining the strength of the US labor market (which is why interest rates are likely to rise three or four times this year). The shortage of gas in the UK has pushed prices to new record levels. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s same-day gas prices have surged by more than 130 per cent to 275p per therm. That extends todays record highs, and beats the previous record high of 150p set in 2013. Last week, wholesale gas for immediate use was trading around 60p per therm, but the snowy weather - and National Grid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that supplies can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t meet demand today - has triggered a scramble to get hold of gas. Dr Jonathan Marshall, energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, says a range of factors have left Britain short of supplies. He explains (via PA) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Behind today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gas deficit warning is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcperfect storm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of unrelated short-term issues - freezing conditions, diminished Dutch gas production due to earthquake concerns, weather-related issues curbing imports from Europe, and a global LNG market in which supplies are being pulled to Asia by higher prices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But underlying it is another set of issues that speak to a failure by successive governments to map out a secure gas future in the way that they have done so successfully for electricity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Allowing Centrica to close the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only big long-term gas store without consideration for supply during cold snaps, failing to develop a coherent plan for low-carbon heating, and above all a head-in-the-sand approach to improving energy efficiency in homes have all put households and businesses at risk of shortages and price spikes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound and the euro are both losing ground against the US dollar today. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency is benefiting from the prospect of several interest rate rises this year (which would make it more profitable to hold cash in dollars, rather than sterling or euros). The euro has slipped to a seven-week low against the dollar, at $1.216, while the pound has dipped to $1.374, a six-week low. The London stock market has fallen deeper into the red, after a morning of generally bad news. The FTSE 100 is now down 63 points, or 0.9%, at 7170. Ad firm WPP remains the biggest faller, down 13%, after reporting its weakest growth since 2009 this morning. The smaller FTSE 250 index, of medium-sized companies is also down, shedding 135 points or 0.7% . The latest gloom at Carpetright, the drop in UK house prices, and the slowdown in factory growth have all dampened the mood in the City. But there are chunky losses across Europe too -- with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX down 1.6%. Wall Street is also expected to drop, when trading begins in over two hours time. Investors remain nervous about the prospect for US interest rates -- with new Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaking at the US Senate in a few hours time. Will Powell repeat his upbeat words from Tuesday, when he testified before the lower House of Congress? Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA explains why traders will be watching closely: It would appear markets are bracing for more hawkish commentary from Powell today when he appears before the Senate Banking Committee, once again discussing the semi-annual monetary policy report. Given everything that he said on Tuesday, it seems pretty clear that economic forecasts will be revised higher this month and the pace of tightening will likely therefore pick up, which may make today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less eventful as he reiterates many of the views already expressed. That said, should he wish to back pedal on anything or clarify points that have been misinterpreted, it may attract some attention. Even the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t immune to the snowy weather. The Irish stock exchange is closing at noon today, and will be shut all Friday, due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extreme weather conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The ISE says: Due to the announcement by the Irish Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Emergency Coordination Committee and the severe weather-related nationwide Status Red Warning, and to protect against any potential risk to market integrity in these exceptional circumstances, the Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) is altering its trading calendar to facilitate an earlier closing of the market today, Thursday, 1 March 2018 and will close all day on Friday, 2 March 2018. Earlier today, a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 weather alert was extended to cover the entire Republic of Ireland, which means people should stay at home to avoid the severe winter storm that is hitting the country. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weather blog has full coverage of Storm Emma, and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBeast from the East\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Heads-up, UK readers. This is the last day to spend your old \u00c2\u00a310 notes (the ones with Charles Darwin on them). From Friday morning, only the new Jane Austen ones will do (although you can always change out-of-date notes at the Bank of England). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Mark Sweney on ad giant WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results, which have sent its shares sliding: The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest advertising and marketing services group, WPP, has said last year was its worst year since the 2009 recession. The UK company reported a 0.3% fall in revenues to \u00c2\u00a315.2bn in its results for 2017, making it WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst year in growth terms since 2009 when the company reported a fall of 8.1% during the depths of the recession following the credit crunch. WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price fell more than 10% in early trading on Thursday, the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, admitted 2017 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was not a pretty year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the company but denied it was because his agencies were being cut out of deals between advertisers and Google and Facebook. More here: Mike Rigby, Head of Manufacturing at Barclays, fears that Brexit uncertainty is hitting UK factory growth. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing report: Although the sector remains positive, the continuing uncertainty over Brexit negotiations can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be helping the investment intentions of manufacturers who are looking for some degree of clarity over the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later. Manufacturers will also need to remain flexible in their planning as they negotiate the uncertain market conditions in 2018. With current Barclays data highlighting the premia that international consumers are prepared to pay for British goods, and given the continuing improvement in key overseas markets, manufacturing businesses should be increasingly focusing on differentiating their products on quality and service.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, reckons Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector is still in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a positive mood\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, despite the drop in the manufacturing PMI last month. Brexit uncertainty is a key factor, he adds: Recent ONS figures show sector productivity is increasing, although there is still some way to go before the UK catches up to its G7 counterparts. But manufacturers are taking steps to make this happen by investing in automation and exploring the opportunities presented by Industry 4.0. Many are using specialist asset finance facilities to invest in equipment, protecting their working capital which can be used to support growth opportunities. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Clearly, challenges and uncertainties lay ahead. All firms are keen for clarity on the future trading relationship with the EU, but manufacturers, which account for nearly half of UK exports, are disproportionately exposed to uncertainty associated with international trade agreements. The PMI will therefore be closely watched in the coming months for any clues as to how exporting firms are managing this uncertainty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: UK factory activity growth has hit its lowest level in eight months, according to data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly healthcheck. Manufacturers have reported that production increased at the slowest pace for 11 months in February, with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153decelerations seen across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods sectors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Firms also suffered a sharp rise in input costs, as raw materials and other commodities became pricier. Some companies passed this onto their own customers -- which could push inflation up. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news too - new orders picked up, and firms kept hiring staff: Duncan Brock, Director of Customer Relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bonhomie\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the UK manufacturing sector last month. All sectors lost their drive as manufacturing activity crawled at a snail\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pace not seen for almost a year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Amidst these signs of a moderate slowdown, it was supply chain disruptions that were largely at fault. Suppliers underperformed not only on the timely delivery of goods but in their inability to meet the demand from makers for some raw materials. This intensified capacity issues and acted as a drag on overall purchasing activity. Time for some data... The euro zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing boom slowed a little last month, new figures from Markit show. But Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories are still in a rosy period, and enjoying their strongest growth spell in almost 20 years. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Index (which tracks activity in the sector) dipped to 58.6 in February from 59.6. Any reading over 50 shows growth. France and Germany both reported a small drop in growth. National Grid has issued a warning that the UK will not have enough gas to meet demand on Thursday, as temperatures plummeted and imports were hit by outages. It is thought unlikely that the situation will affect supply to households, but if enough extra gas supplies by pipeline or ship are not forthcoming, it could affect industrial users. Within-day wholesale gas prices soared 74% to 200p per therm this morning after the formal deficit warning, which acts as a call to suppliers to bring forward more gas on Thursday. Prices have since fallen back to 170p. More here: European stock markets are all in the red this morning, following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late slide on Wall Street. In London, the FTSE 100 is being dragged down by advertising giant WPP - which has shed 13% after reporting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slow start\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the new year, and a 0.3% drop in like-for-like revenues in 2017. Otherwise, traders are continuing to fret about the prospect of sharp hikes in US interest rates this year (as the Federal Reserve tries to prevent inflation getting out of hand). Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says European markets got off to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153another duff start\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, after traders saw America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones shed 380 points last night. Interactive Investor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lee Wild explains what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on: A strong US economy is great for confidence and jobs, but corporate America will have to absorb more expensive debt, which is why equity traders are selling into the rally from mid-February lows. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all eyes on Jerome Powell again on Thursday when the Fed chair testifies before the Senate Banking Committee. Any further talk about an overheating economy will give equity market bears another reason to dump stock. Retail analyst Nick Bubb is amazed that Carpetright has produced another profit warning today: It is only 6 weeks or so since the last Carpetright profit warning on Jan 19th, but, almost unbelievably it has issued yet another profit warning today and flagged, ominously, that it is in discussions with its banks about to prop up the balance sheet. Whether Carpetright needs to raise more equity remains unclear, as does the issue of how far its problems are to do with intense competition from its rival Tapi, but shareholders will fear the worst today\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says Carpetright has deteriorated sharply in recent months. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A bad week for retail as Carpetright\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes get worse: now the company expects to report a loss for the year to the end of April as its store investment programme is not paying off. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been quite a climb-down from just a few months ago. In December it issued a profits warning, guiding underlying profit before tax for the year to be at the lower end of the previous range of \u00c2\u00a313.8m to \u00c2\u00a316.7m. As we noted at the time, profits warnings have a nasty habit of not coming alone and that guidance appeared to be wishful thinking. In January management slashed this to a range of \u00c2\u00a32m-\u00c2\u00a36m. Horrendous post-Christmas sales were to blame then but the trend is not improving. Now a small loss is expected as trading remains very difficult. That loss may not remain small if Easter doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go well. Like-for-like sales are negative and below management expectations. Lee Wild, Head of Equity Strategy at interactive investor, says the next few months will be crucial for Carpetright. Carpetright\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long and painful decline clearly has further to run. Things haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t improved since the last profits warning in January, and the company will lose money this year. It has the backing of its lenders for now, but a strong Easter is crucial for the business and any goodwill that remains. Newsflash: Shares in Carpetright, the UK flooring and furnishing business, have plunged by 25% in early trading. In another sign of retail gloom, Carpetright has issued a profits warning (its fourth in three months, according to Reuters). It now expects to make a small underlying pre-tax loss for the current financial year. Carpetright admits that sales in the UK have been weaker than hoped, saying: Trading conditions in the weeks since the Group last updated the market on 19 January 2018 have remained difficult, characterised by continued weak consumer confidence. While the trend in the Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK like-for-like sales has improved through the intervening period, it remains negative. Carpetright says it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proactively engaged in constructive discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with its banks, to ensure it sticks with its bank facilities. They add: The bank lenders have indicated that they currently remain fully supportive. This comes a day after Toys R Us and Maplin, two other UK retailers, both fell into administration putting over 5,500 jobs at risk. The drop in UK house prices in February is a surprise, says Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent . He explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u2122As one of the most closely-watched indicators of property market strength due to its longevity and accuracy, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures may cause concern. At this time of the year we would have expected an increase, not a fall, in house price growth although of course these figures are in contrast to the previous month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHowever, it goes to show the limitations of a national snapshot of the market. While Nationwide reports a lack of supply, on the ground, we are finding more balance between supply and demand in our part of London as buyers, spoilt for more choice, hesitate before making commitments and identifying whether they are dealing with serious sellers.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Simon French, chief economist of Panmure Gordon, predicts that the slowdown in UK house prices will continue this year: Jonathan Samuels, CEO of the property lender, Octane Capital, believes the property market is being battered by weak consumer confidence. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the ongoing financial squeeze on households, you sense the house price slowdown has now begun in earnest. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153High living costs, low wage growth, potential rate rises and a lethargic economy in the shadow of Brexit: for consumers, the bad news is in stereo mode. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While weak supply and very low borrowing costs will prevent a collapse in prices, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see 2018 delivering anything other than very low single digit growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153February could go down as the month the big freeze on prices took hold. Newsflash: UK house prices fell in February, fuelling suspicions that the housing market is cooling fast. The Nationwide Building Society has reported that prices fell by 0.3% last month, crushing expectations of a rise, following January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.8% increase. That drags the annual rate of house price growth down to 2.2%, from 3.2% a month ago. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Economist, blames falling consumer confidence and the squeeze on household budgets: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Month-to-month changes can be volatile, but the slowdown is consistent with signs of softening in the household sector in recent months. Retail sales were relatively soft over the Christmas period and at the start of the new year, as were key measures of consumer confidence, as the squeeze on household incomes continued to take its toll. Gardner points out that mortgage approvals fell to their weakest level for three years in December - a sign that activity in the sector has fallen. Nationwide expects house prices to only rise by 1% this year, due to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsubdued economic activity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How the housing market performs in the year ahead will be determined in large part by developments in the wider economy and the path of interest rates. Brexit developments will remain a key factor, though these remain hard to foresee. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull some reaction together now... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European stock markets are facing fresh losses today, after a late wobble on Wall Street sent the Dow Jones industrial average down almost 400 points, or 1.5%. The selloff ended Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s run of 11 monthly gains, and was triggered by renewed jitters about the pace of US interest rate rises . The big fear is that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, the Fed, will hike interest rates four times in 2017. This has sparked declines in Asia, where Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei shed 1.5%. As AFP put it: After a couple of weeks of calm, the volatility that kicked off February has returned on worries that the strong US economy and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts will lead the Federal Reserve to tighten borrowing costs more than previously thought. European markets are set to follow, with the main indices being called down 0.5%. The new chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, worried investors on Tuesday by indicating that borrowing costs must rise to prevent the US economy overheating. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear from Powell again today, when he testifies to the Senate banking committee. If he repeats his hawkish tone, then the markets could take fright. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: Mr Powell returns for a second round today with US lawmakers and markets will be looking to see whether he rows back a little from Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkish interpretation of his remarks or whether he reaffirms them. If he does the latter then we could well see further gains for the US dollar and increased pressure on stock markets. On the corporate side, advertising giant WPP and theme park operator Merlin are reporting results. We also find out how the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing companies fared last month, as data firms Markit and ISM release their monthly healthchecks: The agenda: 9am GMT: Eurozone manufacturing PMI report for February 9.30am GMT: UK manufacturing PMI report for February 10am GMT: Eurozone unemployment figures for January 1.30pm GMT: US personal income and spending figures 3pm GMT: US manufacturing PMI for February 3pm GMT: Fed chair Jerome Powell testifies to Congress (again)",

GKN closed on Thursday at 435p versus an offer, which is mostly in the form of Melrose shares, worth 413p. And that was before the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report on Thursday night that GKN is talking to US group Dana about a deal to sell or combine its automotive division.

                "bodyText":"It would be an exaggeration to say GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders, after being blasted by management presentations for the past week, have suddenly fallen in love with their misfiring engineering giant. But something may be stirring. For almost the first time since Melrose launched its \u00c2\u00a37bn reverse takeover bid, GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are trading consistently above the value of the offer. GKN closed on Thursday at 435p versus an offer, which is mostly in the form of Melrose shares, worth 413p. And that was before the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report on Thursday night that GKN is talking to US group Dana about a deal to sell or combine its automotive division. The gap isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t huge, but the position is more encouraging for GKN than a fortnight ago. Back then, it was too easy for Melrose to portray GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Anne Stevens, as a semi-retired recruit hauled from the non-executive benches and who could make only vague promises about corporate self-improvement. GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big plan, called Project Boost, does still require investors to take a lot on trust. But there were clear long-term cashflow forecasts in the mix, a promise to return \u00c2\u00a32.5bn to shareholders plus a firm commitment to demerge the two halves of the company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c aerospace and automotive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by the middle of next year. A demerger in itself should add no value. In practice, the move would address the old complaint that the stock market awards the lower rating - in this case, an automotive one - to any engineering group that serves two markets. Life shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work that way, but sometimes does. Project Boost won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convince everybody, but it prompted Jefferies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 analyst, for example, to place a valuation range of 448p to 523p on GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock. At the very least, it is probably safe to assume, even if Melrose were to walk away tomorrow, that GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tumble all the way back to their pre-action level of 326p. A price around 370p or 380p might be more like it. Viewed that way, Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current offer worth 413p looks outright mean. The real takeover premium is miserable. Yes, as the bidder keeps saying, one can view share-based takeover offers as a debate about which management team to prefer.

Similar promises of digital alchemy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c heavy cash investment transforming into an ever-burgeoning bottom line \u00e2\u20ac\u201c followed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/02/snapchat-ipo-valuation-evan-spiegel-bobby-murphy-snap-inc\" title=\"\">stock-market launch of Snap</a> last year. So far, investors in the owner of Snapchat have been underwhelmed, but last week 35-year-old Daniel Ek, Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s co-founder and chief executive, was adamant that his music streaming service would deliver the kind of returns that have proved elusive for tech upstarts since the blockbuster float of Facebook.</p> <p>The test for Stockholm-based Spotify will come when it floats in New York on 3 April, while Dropbox, the online file storage company, is preparing to launch its initial public offering this week. Those companies must answer two simple questions: will Spotify ever go into the black and justify the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/02/is-spotify-really-worth-20bn\" title=\"\">near-$20bn (\u00c2\u00a314.4bn) valuation</a> that private trades in its shares put on it; and is Dropbox really worth <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/12/dropbox-ipo-value-offfering-latest-stock-share-price\" title=\"\">between $7bn and $8bn</a>?</p> <p>With both companies preparing to join US stock markets, they could determine whether investors regain their enthusiasm for new technology stocks after a disappointing year in 2017, during which Snap, meal-kit company Blue Apron and big-data business Cloudera all went for public listings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and disappointed. Shares in Snap are down a quarter since it floated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a poor performance for investors hoping it would emulate Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/15/facebook-raises-float-price-investors\" title=\"\">which has risen nearly 400% since it floated in 2012</a>.

Snapchat wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, because of the might of Facebook and its Instagram service. Snapchat is a second-tier player: Spotify and Dropbox are top-tier players. It is a completely different ballgame.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Some big names are counting on Ek and his counterpart at Dropbox, Drew Houston. Lining up behind Dropbox and Spotify are ride-hailing service Uber \u00e2\u20ac\u201c given a notional value of $50bn in 2015 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the short-term letting agency Airbnb. The former isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t profitable; the latter is. With markets jittery, both Spotify and Dropbox are working hard to push a story of future profits and growth.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Spotify used a web presentation to reassure would-be investors that it has a clear path to profit, pointing out that revenues grew 39% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.1bn (\u00c2\u00a33.6bn) in 2017, though financing costs from a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn loan helped push operating losses up 8% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac378m. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The trend towards profitability is clear when you look at operating losses as a percentage of revenue,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it said soothingly.</p> <p>Spotify is also taking an unusual approach to its listing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c going direct, so that its shares aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t handled by an investment bank or underwriters, but simply offered from the company on the exchange to would-be buyers.</p> <p>Analysing that approach last year, the <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/04/07/spotify-ipo-direct-listing/\" title=\"\">business magazine <em>Fortune</em> said</a>: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If an IPO is like a wedding, a direct listing is running off to elope. A faster, easier, cheaper route to the same result.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Of course, like an elopement, you might not get the big benefits: an IPO guarantees money from institutional buyers snapping up millions of shares. A direct listing could flop.</p> <p>Others aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so sure about Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential, based on its finances and its business model. Spotify users have the option of a free service, in exchange for listening to adverts intermittently, or paying a monthly subscription fee of \u00c2\u00a39.99, $9.99 or \u00e2\u201a\u00ac9.99 for no-advert streaming. It is a compelling service with 71 &#xa0;million paying users, but the cost in payments to artists and record companies is huge: it has forked out $9bn in royalties since it launched.</p> <p>According to one investor, Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gross margin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a measure of profitability once certain costs are stripped out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is not high enough and indicates that royalty rates have to come down. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A 20% gross margin business is not a good business,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says venture capitalist David B Pakman. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of two things has to happen: they have to enter new business lines with higher gross margins, or somehow magically transform the rate structure with labels.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The latter rate is how much Spotify has to pay per track streamed.</p> <p>Dropbox, meanwhile, was valued at $10bn when it last raised capital in 2014, but that has been slashed to between $7bn and $8bn for its forthcoming IPO, which is intended to raise about $610m. Steve Jobs was famously dismissive of the company: in a 2009 meeting, the late Apple chief <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/23/dld-2012-drew-houston-yes-steve-jobs-called-dropbox-a-feature/\" title=\"\">told</a> Houston that he had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a feature, not a product\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In other words: Apple or Microsoft or Google could add Dropbox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s functionality \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you drop a file in the folder on your PC, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s available on your phone or tablet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to their existing software for free.</p> <p>Houston shrugged off Jobs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disdain to build a company that in 2017 had 500 million users and $1.11bn in revenues. Not bad for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feature\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9b00a5b0e8306bb74190791c9d69a2308ed3c8ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b00a5b0e8306bb74190791c9d69a2308ed3c8ef/0_0_1992_2490/800.jpg\" alt=\"Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daniel Ek\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daniel Ek has some big startups watching his IPO closely.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ilya S Savenok/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So why has its notional value gone down?

                "bodyText":"The message to investors from Spotify last week had a familiar ring for any veteran of the tech gold rush: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The trend towards profitability is clear.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The music streaming service is hoping to banish the memory of a difficult year for technology flotations. Similar promises of digital alchemy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c heavy cash investment transforming into an ever-burgeoning bottom line \u00e2\u20ac\u201c followed the stock-market launch of Snap last year. So far, investors in the owner of Snapchat have been underwhelmed, but last week 35-year-old Daniel Ek, Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s co-founder and chief executive, was adamant that his music streaming service would deliver the kind of returns that have proved elusive for tech upstarts since the blockbuster float of Facebook. The test for Stockholm-based Spotify will come when it floats in New York on 3 April, while Dropbox, the online file storage company, is preparing to launch its initial public offering this week. Those companies must answer two simple questions: will Spotify ever go into the black and justify the near-$20bn (\u00c2\u00a314.4bn) valuation that private trades in its shares put on it; and is Dropbox really worth between $7bn and $8bn? With both companies preparing to join US stock markets, they could determine whether investors regain their enthusiasm for new technology stocks after a disappointing year in 2017, during which Snap, meal-kit company Blue Apron and big-data business Cloudera all went for public listings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and disappointed. Shares in Snap are down a quarter since it floated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a poor performance for investors hoping it would emulate Facebook, which has risen nearly 400% since it floated in 2012. (Twitter, meanwhile, finally recorded its first quarterly profit last month, five years after going public.) One analyst thinks the latest flotations will restore faith. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Spotify and Dropbox have a very good chance of success because the technology world is about one company dominating one sector,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Mark Mulligan, a tech analyst at Midia Research. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Spotify and Dropbox are each dominant forces in their respective sectors. Snapchat wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, because of the might of Facebook and its Instagram service. Snapchat is a second-tier player: Spotify and Dropbox are top-tier players. It is a completely different ballgame.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some big names are counting on Ek and his counterpart at Dropbox, Drew Houston. Lining up behind Dropbox and Spotify are ride-hailing service Uber \u00e2\u20ac\u201c given a notional value of $50bn in 2015 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the short-term letting agency Airbnb.

Analysing that approach last year, the business magazine Fortune said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If an IPO is like a wedding, a direct listing is running off to elope.

Shares slumped by 6.7% after a whistleblower revealed a vast data breach that affected tens of millions of people. Politicians on both sides of the Atlantic are demanding answers. In America, senators are pushing for senior executives to be questioned on Capitol Hill. The Connecticut Attorney General is also opening a probe. In the UK, the information commissioner is launching an investigation. The ICO may search the offices of Cambridge Analytica on Tuesday, after Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesperson expressed concern over the revelations. Tonight, Channel 4 have revealed how the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bosses talked of using honey traps, spies and fake news to help clients World stock markets were also dragged down by worries that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel and aluminium tariffs would spark a trade war. In London, the FTSE 100 sagged to a 15-month low That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. Just in: the Connecticut Attorney General is launching an investigation into Facebook. It will centre on the Observer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revelations that the Facebook profiles of 50 million people were harvested by Cambridge Analytica. Attorney General George Jepsen says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153News reports that personal user information from Facebook profiles was provided to third parties without user consent are concerning and raise serious questions about how this happened in the specific situation involving Cambridge Analytica and about Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies and practices more generally. Today, my office has in writing initiated an inquiry asking Facebook to answer a series of questions about this matter. While we cannot comment further at this time, Connecticut residents should know that my office takes privacy matters very seriously, and we will move as quickly as we responsibly can to get to the bottom of this situation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bloomberg have more details of the growing pressure to make top tech executives face a Capitol Hill grilling: U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, and John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, have called on the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to bring in technology company CEOs, including from Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Google, for public questioning In a letter Monday to Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, Klobuchar and Kennedy said they have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious concern regarding recent reports that data from millions of American was misused in order to influence voters.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The lack of oversight on how data is stored and how political advertisements are sold raises concerns about the integrity of American elections as well as privacy rights,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the senators wrote. A hearing with the CEOs would allow the committee to learn \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what is being done to protect Americans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data and limit abuse of the platforms, as well as to assess what measures should be taken before the next elections.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Global stock markets are now on their worst run since last November, according to Reuters data. Facebook was obviously one factor behind today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. But, traders are also worried about a protectionist trade war breaking out. This overshadowed the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit breakthrough\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 between the UK and Brussels over a transition deal this morning. Breaking! Around $36bn has been wiped off Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value today, as trading ends in New York after a rough session. Shares in the embattled social media giant ended down 6.7% at $172.5. That looks to be its biggest one-day loss in four years (and its biggest drop in value ever). That takes Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market capitalisation down to just over $500bn, from $537bn on Friday night. Other tech stocks also suffered, dragging the Nasdaq down by 1.8%. The broad S&amp;P 500 index fell by 1.4%, with Facebook the biggest faller. Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to hire a data forensic firm to examine the claims against Cambridge Analytica has caused some concern. Particularly as the UK Information Commissioner is planning to obtain a warrant on Tuesday to search its offices. New details of Cambridge Analytica\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activities are emerging tonight. Undercover Channel 4 News reporters have recorded CEO Alexander Nix discussing the tactics it used. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: In a series of meetings with a reporter posing as a representative of a wealthy Sri Lankan family seeking political influence, Cambridge Analytica executives initially denied the company was in the business of using entrapment techniques. But Nix later detailed the dirty tricks the company would be prepared to pull behind the scenes to help its clients. When the reporter asked if Cambridge Analytica could offer investigations into the damaging secrets of rivals, Nix said it worked with former spies from Britain and Israel to look for political dirt. He also volunteered that his team were ready to go further than an investigation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, we do a lot more than that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said over dinner at an exclusive hotel in London. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Deep digging is interesting, but you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too good to be true and make sure that that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s video recorded. Newsflash: Facebook has just released a statement, saying it has hired a forensics firm to investigate the claims against Cambridge Analytica. The social media giant says that Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan, who orchestrated the harvesting of Facebook data, has verbally agreed to take part in the audit. Whistleblower Christopher Wylie has \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthus far declined\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Facebook says. The Wall Street selloff is gathering pace. Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems seem to be sparking wider alarm in the markets, with investors also worried about the risk of a trade war (and the prospect of a US interest rate rise on Wednesday) With just over an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading to go, the Nasdaq is down almost 3% while the Dow is staring at a 450-point loss (-1.8%). More than $100bn has been wiped off the value of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest tech companies today. Facebook is the worst performer (-7%), shedding around $35bn at pixel time. According to the Financial Times, that is one of the ten biggest one-day losses (in dollar terms) ever suffered by a technology company. Every member of the Nasdaq is currently in the red; Alphabet/Google is down 3.5%, Amazon are down 2.3%, NVIDIA has lost 4.8%, Apple is off 2% and Microsoft has shed 2.2%. The revelations about how Cambridge Analytica harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles is fuelling calls for tighter regulation of the tech sector. And if that happens, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest technology firms could find their growth squeezed, making it hard to justify their immense valuations (Facebook is still worth half a trillion dollars, despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price slide) Jake Dollarhide of Longbow Asset Management believes the implications could be huge. He says (via Reuters): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the thought that the government might try to regulate tech. You open a slippery slope. If you regulate Facebook what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to say that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a domino effect. Google, maybe Uber?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to stop the government for getting its fingers in all these areas. People have thought right now the tech growth rate has no boundaries, no ceiling. Today people are beginning to question that. If it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the case now, will it still be the case in the future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US senator Amy Klobuchar, who represents Minnesota, is calling for top tech executives including Mark Zuckerberg to be called to account: Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price is stubbornly in the red, and on track for its worst day in five years: The UK government has weighed in on the unfolding Facebook data story. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman has said the PM backs an investigation by the information commissioner into the use of Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica, adding: The allegations are clearly very concerning, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s essential people can have confidence that their personal data can be protected and used in an appropriate way. More here: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a grim start to the week for stock markets, as a combination of factors leave investors nursing losses. The technology sector has been hit by the Facebook controversy, and in the UK, the slump in Micro Focus shares following a profit warning. There is also nervousness ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting, which is expected to sanction another interest rate rise. The interest will be in seeing whether new Fed chair Jerome Powell hints at three or four increases in total this year. Signs of some agreement in the Brexit transition talks has lifted the pound to a one month high against the dollar. But the strength of sterling has helped push the FTSE 100 to its lowest level since December 2016. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 121.21 points or 1.69% to 7042.93 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.39% to 12,217.02 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.13% at 5222.84 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished 0.98% lower at 22,633.10 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.99% at 9664.1 In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.79% to 807.44 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 429 points or 1.72%. The Facebook controversy means investors are shying away from risk in general, sayd Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG: Markets are in full retreat this afternoon, and the drop has been exemplified by a triple-digit decline on the FTSE 100. The index has returned to December 2016 levels, a remarkable change from last when it was riding high above 7200. Devoid of big macro data, investors have focused on the growing scandal at Facebook and this has resulted in a full-blown flight from risk. Investors have begun to fear that the social media giant has encountered its first real obstacle, and that further investigation will uncover other data breaches. The market has been in love with Facebook for a long time now, but with questions surrounding other tech giants and their use of data, it could be only a matter of time until others of the hitherto untouchable \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFANG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stocks find themselves dragged into an official investigation. Another retailer in trouble, as US jewellery and accessories group Claire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s files for bankruptcy. The company said its international operations were not included but it does plan to cut back on the number of its stores in Europe. The full story is here: Meanwhile in the UK, Carpetright shares are down 17.5% and Mothercare has lost 12.5% as investors fret about store closures and future prospects for both chains. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not getting any better for Facebook. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are now down 7% in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica controversy. The technology gloom on both sides of the Atlantic, including worries about an EU tax and in the UK the slump in Micro Focus shares, is one of the reasons for the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market weakness. On Wall Street the Nasdaq Composite is down 2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost 280 points or 1.1%. Investors are also nervous ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting. A rate rise announcement on Wednesday is almost a done deal, but there is much nervousness about whether there will be three or four increases in total this year. In Europe, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 1.2% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is 0.89% lower while the FTSE 100 has fallen 1.59%, not helped by a stronger pound after positive noises from the Brexit negotiations. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: A sharp decline in tech stocks, US politcal tension between and a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeath cross\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark DAX index were all weighing on sentiment. Investors are extra touchy in the lead up to Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FOMC meeting and the first press conference from new Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The death cross, when the 50 day moving average crosses below the two-hundred day moving average, is a technical indication that the price trend for German stocks has turned downwards. Tech stocks saw some of the biggest declines on the day. Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monopoly on personal data has put the company under the microscope again. There has been public outcry over the use of personal data harvested from Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica for use in election campaigns. The latest data scandal might well be the straw that breaks the camel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back for tighter industry regulation. Tighter regulation of how data is collected and used will inevitably curb growth for tech and social media companies that use the data to attract advertisers. Back with Facebook, and the company could now face regulation, sayis Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank: Facebook shares are down almost 4% as the Cambridge Analytica Files were revealed over the weekend by the Guardian. The files expose a major data scandal that Facebook did little to contain or correct. This scandal will fuel into the Mueller investigation and potentially pave the way for the regulation of Facebook as the social media platform is a national security asset because people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behaviour can be impacted through the network. Garney also warns about the impact of the EU Commission considering a technology tax of 3% on revenues: This is move to make technology companies, that are extensively using transfer pricing to avoid taxes in high tax rate countries, to pay more to society. These are just the first signs that major technology companies will be more regulated in the future. It is key for long-term investors in technology to have this on the radar. On a day when markets in Europe and the US are heavily in negative territory, Barclays is one exception to the rule. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are up nearly 4% after it emerged that activist investor Edward Bramson had taken control of a 5% stake through his Sherborne Investors. It owns 1.94% of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares directly and the rest of the 5% through derivatives. Russ Mould, AJ Bell investment director, said: Sherborne has built a formidable reputation for squeezing improved financial and operational performance from the companies in which it invests and Edward Bramson clearly feels that Barclays shares are going cheap, given the prevailing discount to the book, or net asset value. The question now is what the activist investor thinks Barclays should be doing differently and how he intends to get those views across to the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boss, Jes Staley. The fall in Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value has also hit founder Mark Zuckerberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal wealth. His stake in the business has fallen by around $4bn in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica controversy. But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry too much. He is still worth around $71bn, making him the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth richest person according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell off has wiped some $27bn off Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value, as investors react to the revelations about its relationship with Cambridge Analytica. Breaking: Shares in Facebook have fallen at the start of trading in New York, after the social media giant was hit by a major data scandal. Yesterday, the Observer reported that data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica had harvested the Facebook profiles of millions of US voters, and used them to built a sophisticated tools to predict, and influence, how they would vote. The disclosure creates some huge questions for Facebook, as Cambridge Analytica worked for Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successful election campaign. As my colleague Carole Cadwalladr reported: Christopher Wylie, who worked with a Cambridge University academic to obtain the data, told the Observer: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals. Facebook is now facing criticism from politicians on both sides of the Atlantic. There are with suggestions that founder Mark Zuckerberg could be summoned to the UK parliament to answer questions. Conservative MP Damian Collins, who chairs the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, has said he plans to recall Cambridge Analytica\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO to explain why he told MPs last month that his company had not received data from Facebook. Collins says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will be contacting Alexander Nix next week asking him to explain his comments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Tech shares are also being hit by reports that Brussels is preparing to impose a digital tax on the EU revenues of companies such as Google, Facebook and Apple. Facebook is leading the selloff, falling from $185 per share to below $176 in early trading. Ding ding. The New York stock market has opened, and stocks are dropping in a broad-based selloff. The Dow Jones industrial average has shed around 100 points, or 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is down almost 1%. Adam Leyland of The Grocer reckons the Conviviality crisis began after it floated on the stock market in 2013, and started executing ambitious takeover deal to consolidate the drinks trade. He point out that the company changed CFOs last autumn, and has also been hit by recent bad weather and the post-festive slump. Leyland writes: It seems incredible that a business could unravel as quickly as Conviviality has. But with tighter margins and sales commonplace after Christmas, plus tough trading and the snow to contend with, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not inconceivable that an operation can quickly lose control of cashflow. And you lose it at your peril. The Grocer: Why has Conviviality spent out on company-owned stores? Newsflash: The CEO of Conviviality, which owns the Bargain Booze and Wine Rack chains, has resigned. Diana Hunter has stepped down with immediate effect, the company says, less than a week after the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares were suspended after two profits warnings. Conviviality is in a pickle. Firstly, it revealed that a spreadsheet error meant profits this year would be \u00c2\u00a35.2m lower than expected. That was compounded last week when it discovered an unpaid \u00c2\u00a330m tax bill. Conviviality, which is also a drinks wholesaler, is urgently seeking fresh funds from investors. Last week, Sky News reported that some were demanding Hunter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit in return for their support. Brexit means colour-coding! The new draft Brexit deal text has been neatly shaded to show areas where there is full agreement (green), political agreement (yellow) and areas which are still under discussion (white0). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official! Britain and the EU have taken a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153decisive step\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd towards withdrawal agreement, says Michel Barnier in Brussels. After intensive work, the two sides have jointly published a new version of the draft withdrawal deal for Brexit, says Barnier at his joint press-conference with David Davis. This includes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153complete accord\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on citizens right and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial settlement. But.. Barnier also cautions that a step is just a step - a lot of work remains to be done, especially on the Ireland border issue. So, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re closer, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not there yet. The pound is pushing a little higher, now up 0.7% against both the US dollar (to $1.405), and the euro (to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.147). Politics Live has full details. Disappointingly, another 46 Carillion workers have been made redundant today by the Official Receiver. The receiver was unable to find fresh employment for these staff, following Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall into liquidation two months ago. This takes the total laid off to 1,582. In better news, 71 workers have been successfully transferred to a new supplier, which means 8,592 jobs have been saved - or almost half Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workers. That leaves around 7,000 workers who are still working on outsourced public or private sector contracts which haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet been transferred to a new operator, or cancelled. The surge in the pound is helping to drag Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 down to a two-week low. Micro Focus is also doing its bit - shares are down a staggering 55% after this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy update. This has helped wipe 90 points off the Footsie, or 1.2%. Other European markets are also starting the new week rather, er, weakly, with losses in Frankfurt (-0.9%), Paris (-0.7%), Milan (-0.4%) and Madrid (-0.5%) Investors are edgy ahead of several big news events this week, including the G20 finance ministers meeting in Buenos Aires (ending tomorrow), and Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting which is likely to lead to a hike in US interest rates. Fed chair Jerome Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first press conference since replacing Janet Yellen will give the markets an insight into his thinking, and the likely pace of future rate hikes. A frisson of excitement is rippling through the foreign exchange floors, amid rumours of a Brexit breakthough. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit secretary David David is meeting with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier now, ahead of the crunch EU summit later this week. And there are rumours that the two men will announce that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbroad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 terms of a transition deal have been agreed. If so, that would calm fears that Britain would crash over the cliff-edge into a hard Brexit in March 2019. The pound has gained almost a cent against the US dollar to $1.40, and is up 0.5% against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.14 (both the highest levels since February) Barnier and Davis are due to hold a press conference at around 12.45pm Brussels time (11.45am GMT). Our Politics Live blog will have all the action (plus the latest on the Skripal poisoning). Back to GKN.... and Melrose has swiftly rubbished today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dana will list shares in London if it succeeds in merging with GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auto business. A Melrose spokeswoman argues that City investors will still lose out, due to London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing rules. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA secondary UK listing will make little difference to the problems it creates for UK holders with Ohio-headquartered Dana maintaining its primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Without a primary UK listing the shares will remain outside the investment mandate of many UK funds who benchmark their performance against the UK indices. Such a listing does not allow indexation, so UK tracker funds can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hold the shares. Perhaps more significantly many of the UK listing rules which govern corporate behaviour, such as shareholder approval for significant acquisitions, do not apply to a standard listing. There will still be a major flowback issue which has implications for the underlying price the shares are offered at. Basically, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fudge which is unattractive to UK shareholders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 In a busy morning for takeover news, UK property group Hammerson is fending off an approach from French mall operator Kl\u00c3\u00a9pierre. Kl\u00c3\u00a9pierre has announced this morning that it approached Hammerson about a possible \u00c2\u00a35bn offer. If it went through, it would thwart Hammerson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to merge with rival Intu and create Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest property firm. Hammerson has swiftly rejected Kl\u00c3\u00a9pierre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153entirely opportunistic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and without merit, even though the 615p per share offer is around 40% over Hammerson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value last week. Hammerson shares have jumped 25% this morning, as traders anticipate a bidding battle for the company - which owns 37 shopping centres and retail parks including Birmingham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bullring shopping centre. More here: Reuters reckons the takeover battle for GKN is heating up today, with both sides sweetening their pitch to shareholders. They write: Melrose, making a hostile bid, said it would inject about 1 billion pounds ($1.39 billion) into GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension scheme, its latest attempt to convince shareholders to back its offer and win over political opponents of the deal. Shareholders have until March 29 to decide on that offer. GKN is trying to fight off the Melrose bid with an alternative $6.1 billion deal to merge its automotive business with U.S. company Dana Incorporated leaving GKN focused on its aerospace division. Dana said on Monday it would seek a secondary listing in London, enabling more UK shareholders to back the rival plan as some funds are subject to rules which prevent them from holding US stock. The US company also promised GKN investors a slice of its dividend as it said it would pay its current quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share to the enlarged shareholder base. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sam Unsted says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning into a full-blown saga: Over in the City, investors have been distracted from the GKN-Melrose battle by a truly grim announcement from tech firm Micro Focus. Micro Focus, a FTSE 100-listed software provider, warned that revenues will fall by between 6% and 9% this year, which will eat into profits. It blames integration problems following its \u00c2\u00a36.8bn takeover of Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s software business last autumn, a deal that made Micro Focus Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest tech company. Micro Focus admits that it has struggled to implement its new IT system, which hit sales - leading to sales people quitting the business. Splitting HP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s software operations from the rest of the business has caused further disruption to customer accounts, it admits, making it harder to win sales. Quite a mess. CEO Chris Hsu has resigned and is leaving with immediate effect to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spend more time with his family and pursue another opportunity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Micro Focus insists it can fix these problems, and that the HP deal makes sense. But shareholders have reacted by wiping 50% off Micro Focus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price. The unions who represent GKN employees across the UK will demand answers from Melrose over its plans for the company, when they meet today. Many GKN workers fear for their future, as Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business model is to buy companies, make them more profitable, and then sell them again. One person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcasset-stripper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is another one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcturnaround specialist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, of course. But unions are concerned that Melrose could load GKN up with debt, and take a dangerously short-term approach. Unite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assistant general secretary Steve Turner has warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bosses have been far from clear about the detail of their true intentions for GKN beyond vague platitudes and soundbites. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Question marks remain around the levels of debt Melrose will pile on the company and what it means for jobs, long-term investment and product development. Turner also points out that aerospace giant Airbus - GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest customer - has warned it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work with the firm unless it knew its long-term plans. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly skilled UK workforce fear they will end up being sold off piecemeal, with their jobs either axed or shipped overseas to fund a debt-fuelled pay day if Melrose gets its way. That concern over Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s short-termism extends to major GKN customers such as Airbus too, which relies on a long-term relationship with GKN to develop the wings of the future. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If Airbus or other major customers take their business elsewhere it would blow a hole in revenues and destroy jobs and innovation. In another development, Melrose has lowered the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAcceptance Condition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of its GKN offer, from 90% to 50% plus one share. That means it has lowered the bar to a successful takeover. GKN has hit back against Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover bid. The UK engineering group has announced that, once it sells its Driveline business to American firm Dana, the resulting company will have a secondary listing on the London stock exchange as well as a primary listing in New York. That is designed to help GKN investors, who might have been forced to sell the shares they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll own in Dana-GKN Driveline if the deal goes through Driveline is GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s automobile division. The \u00c2\u00a34.4bn sale to Dana (who make axels and driveshafts) was hammered out 10 days ago as GKN battled to repel Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advances. CEO Anne Stevens says that the deal makes sense for GKN shareholders, especially if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be able to hold onto equity in the new business through a London listing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since announcing the deal to bring GKN Driveline and Dana together, I have had the opportunity to speak to many of our shareholders and explain why I am so excited about this prospect. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The complementary nature of the two businesses and our shared commitment to R&amp;D and long term investment creates a fantastic opportunity to build a world leading company and create meaningful shareholder value by delivering $235 million in synergies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The listing on the London Stock Exchange will make it possible for more of our shareholders to participate in the expected value creation opportunity from the combined Dana and GKN Driveline business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The battle to take control of one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest engineering firms is hotting up today. Melrose, the turnaround group, has intensified the pressure as it tries to seize control of GKN, in an increasingly bitter fight. Over the weekend, Melrose CEO Simon Peckham blasted GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management, telling the Sunday Telegraph that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153GKN has been run by people who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have an owner mentality, they have a manager mentality. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a business that has slowly but surely lost the support of the UK institutional investment community.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Relations between the two companies were already chilly (Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan for GKN includes dismissing its management and giving its staff more involvement). Peckham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention, at a time when major shareholders are having to choose who to back, ensures they are now sub-zero. And this morning, Melrose has announced that it has offered to put more money into GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension scheme -- roughly \u00c2\u00a31bn over the time it expected to own GKN. It told the City that this proposal is almost twice the amount of the \u00c2\u00a3528 million deficit reduction package that the trustees recently agreed with GKN. Melrose chairman Christopher Miller says: The proposal we have made to the trustees of up to \u00c2\u00a31 billion of contributions under our ownership is a clear example of what Melrose does which is good for pensioners and shareholders alike and shows we are a good custodian for all stakeholders. Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measured approach represents certainty of strategy, value and management. We strongly urge GKN shareholders to accept our offer without delay.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That might assuage some concerns about whether Melrose is a suitable owner for GKN. GKN, though, insists that Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest offer (worth around \u00c2\u00a38bn) is too low. MPs also have concerns, given Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s track record of buying companies and breaking them up to release value. Unions also fear job losses - and are expect to meet with Melrose today. Shareholders have until 29th March to make a decision.... Also coming up today.... Finance ministers from the G20 group of advanced economies are meeting in Argentina today. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be discussing trade, financial stability and cryptocurrencies (among other issues). The economic calendar heats up later this week, with UK inflation and unemployment data, plus interest rate decisions from the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve. However, today is quieter, apart from some eurozone trade and construction data. The agenda: 10am GMT: Eurozone trade balance for January 10am GMT: Eurozone construction output figures for January All day: G20 finance ministers meet in Buenos Aires",

A senior Downing Street source said they recognised the international tax system was designed the best part of a century ago and was no longer suitable for a modern economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are constructive proposals, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to look at them seriously,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the source said. <br></p> <p>Despite the long gestation, the digital tax is likely to raise tensions between Brussels and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s White House. The US Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, told the New York Times that gross taxes on internet companies were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not fair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, on the sidelines of a debate among G20 finance ministers on taxation in Buenos Aires this week.</p> <p>The commission rejected claims that the plan was targeting US companies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not an anti-American tax, this is not an anti-Gafa tax, this is a digital tax,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for tax, who said 150 firms would be affected, including European, American and Asian ones.</p> <p>Moscovici said he had stressed this point to ministers at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting in the Argentine capital, adding that the commission saw the plans as compatible with EU obligations under the World Trade Organization. </p> <p>The commission believes the tax will generate \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn for European treasuries each year, but Moscovici suggested this sum would rise over time.<br></p> <p>The growing dominance of digital companies is seen as a long-term threat to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax base, while also sparking questions of fairness. The commission estimates that digital businesses pay an effective average tax rate of only 9.5%, compared with 23.2% for bricks-and-mortar firms.<br></p> <p>The proposals must be agreed unanimously by EU member states before they become law, so details may change. </p> <p>The commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred option is reform of EU corporate tax rules that would include new ways to identify companies with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153digital presence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A company would be deemed to have digital presence in a country if its revenues exceed \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7m (\u00c2\u00a36m), or it has more than 100,000 users, or has signed more than 3,000 business contracts.<br></p> <p>Pending this bigger reform, the commission is looking at interim measures, such as the 3% tax on revenues from digital activities, which would include selling online advertising space. The measure would only apply to companies with global revenues of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac750m and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50m in the EU.</p> <p>The commission hopes member states will agree the 3% tax by the end of the year, meaning it is likely the UK would have to apply it during a Brexit transition period mooted to end in 2021.</p> <p>EU officials have said they want to prevent European companies being undercut by their neighbour across the channel after Brexit. </p>",

Theresa May is set to give cautious backing to the plans at the summit on Thursday. A senior Downing Street source said they recognised the international tax system was designed the best part of a century ago and was no longer suitable for a modern economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are constructive proposals, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to look at them seriously,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the source said. Despite the long gestation, the digital tax is likely to raise tensions between Brussels and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s White House. The US Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, told the New York Times that gross taxes on internet companies were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not fair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, on the sidelines of a debate among G20 finance ministers on taxation in Buenos Aires this week. The commission rejected claims that the plan was targeting US companies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not an anti-American tax, this is not an anti-Gafa tax, this is a digital tax,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for tax, who said 150 firms would be affected, including European, American and Asian ones. Moscovici said he had stressed this point to ministers at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting in the Argentine capital, adding that the commission saw the plans as compatible with EU obligations under the World Trade Organization. The commission believes the tax will generate \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn for European treasuries each year, but Moscovici suggested this sum would rise over time. The growing dominance of digital companies is seen as a long-term threat to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax base, while also sparking questions of fairness. The commission estimates that digital businesses pay an effective average tax rate of only 9.5%, compared with 23.2% for bricks-and-mortar firms. The proposals must be agreed unanimously by EU member states before they become law, so details may change. The commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred option is reform of EU corporate tax rules that would include new ways to identify companies with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153digital presence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A company would be deemed to have digital presence in a country if its revenues exceed \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7m (\u00c2\u00a36m), or it has more than 100,000 users, or has signed more than 3,000 business contracts. Pending this bigger reform, the commission is looking at interim measures, such as the 3% tax on revenues from digital activities, which would include selling online advertising space. The measure would only apply to companies with global revenues of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac750m and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50m in the EU. The commission hopes member states will agree the 3% tax by the end of the year, meaning it is likely the UK would have to apply it during a Brexit transition period mooted to end in 2021. EU officials have said they want to prevent European companies being undercut by their neighbour across the channel after Brexit.",

                "body":"<p>In the first decade of the 20th century, Standard Oil was as mighty as the tech giants of Silicon Valley are today. The company had grown from a single refinery in Cleveland in 1863 to produce 87% of all US refined oil output. In 1911, the supreme court decided that Standard Oil was in breach of anti-trust legislation passed by Congress and ordered that the company be broken up.</p> \n<p>Even before the data mining revelations that have engulfed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/24/cambridge-analytica-week-that-shattered-facebook-privacy\">Facebook</a>, there was pressure in the US for similar action to be taken against the social media networking site and two other globally dominant companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Google and Amazon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that have come from nowhere in the past two decades. <br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The argument goes like this. Data is as vital to the modern digital economy as oil was a century ago. The tech giants have the same sort of monopoly power that Standard Oil once had (Google and Facebook accounted for two-thirds of online advertising spending in the US last year and Amazon was responsible for 75% of online book sales). Mark Zuckerberg might wear chinos rather than the top hat sported by Rockefeller but a robber baron is a robber baron. It is time for anti-trust legislation to be used to break up Facebook, Google and Amazon.</p> \n<p>The charge sheet is a long one: the tech giants are exploiting their monopoly power to stifle competition; they are spreading fake news; their fantastically rich owners portray themselves as right-on yet go to a great deal of trouble to minimise their corporate tax bills; they are ripping the heart out of communities through the closure of bricks-and-mortar retailers. To the list can now be added (in Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election\">the harvesting of the personal data </a>of 50 million Americans and its use for political purposes.</p> \n<p>No question, Big Tech is more vulnerable to a backlash from Washington than it has ever been.

                "bodyText":"In the first decade of the 20th century, Standard Oil was as mighty as the tech giants of Silicon Valley are today. The company had grown from a single refinery in Cleveland in 1863 to produce 87% of all US refined oil output. In 1911, the supreme court decided that Standard Oil was in breach of anti-trust legislation passed by Congress and ordered that the company be broken up. Even before the data mining revelations that have engulfed Facebook, there was pressure in the US for similar action to be taken against the social media networking site and two other globally dominant companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Google and Amazon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that have come from nowhere in the past two decades. The argument goes like this. Data is as vital to the modern digital economy as oil was a century ago. The tech giants have the same sort of monopoly power that Standard Oil once had (Google and Facebook accounted for two-thirds of online advertising spending in the US last year and Amazon was responsible for 75% of online book sales). Mark Zuckerberg might wear chinos rather than the top hat sported by Rockefeller but a robber baron is a robber baron. It is time for anti-trust legislation to be used to break up Facebook, Google and Amazon. The charge sheet is a long one: the tech giants are exploiting their monopoly power to stifle competition; they are spreading fake news; their fantastically rich owners portray themselves as right-on yet go to a great deal of trouble to minimise their corporate tax bills; they are ripping the heart out of communities through the closure of bricks-and-mortar retailers. To the list can now be added (in Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case) the harvesting of the personal data of 50 million Americans and its use for political purposes. No question, Big Tech is more vulnerable to a backlash from Washington than it has ever been. Companies have outgrown management systems that were not designed for systemically important businesses and have used their market power to gobble up rivals. It is this charge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that the disruptive startup companies of yesteryear are today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-capitalists \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that creates the biggest risk of anti-trust action. Those who have Facebook, Google and Amazon in their sights can draw on Adam Smith for support.

In which case, shareholders are cashing out as close to the top as they can.</p> <p>Those hanging on may be expecting a second revision from IP before it gives up. And history tells us this could well happen. The second bid does, after all, show willingness to maintain the bid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 67% cash value to Smurfit shareholders. However, given Smurfit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second rejection, and unless any third offer is for something closer to recent record highs (10% higher), it may not prove enough to convince management and shareholders alike to agree to tender.

That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the view of S&amp;P Global Ratings:</p> <blockquote> <p>President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-threatened package of trade sanctions on China has landed, but a trade war isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet inevitable. In general, the threatened tariffs and investment restrictions on China won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t likely cause deep pain to the Chinese economy, nor will they have a material impact on corporate borrowers in either country.</p> <p>However, S&amp;P Global Ratings believes China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response will be the key determinant on what happens next. So far China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response has been relatively measured, indicating potential tariffs on about $3 billion of U.S. imports. But will China take additional retaliatory action?</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153More aggressive moves could escalate into a full-blown trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies--with spillover effects on global business confidence, investment, and growth,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said managing director Terry Chan....</p> <p>Preliminary analysis shows that the overall impact on Chinese corporates and banks will be contained because the US represents only about 15% of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exports, and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s domestic activity now drives its economic growth rather than exports. The $50 billion-$60 billion targeted by potential tariffs could affect up to 10%-12% of Chinese imports to the US.</p> <p>The trade dispute appears to be about technology and intellectual property, so products subject to the tariffs could include computers and cell phones. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unclear whether the tariffs will focus on just one or two product categories or be more widespread.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The near-term effects on corporate credit will likely be muted--barring an immediate escalation of retaliatory measures--but there will still be some impact for certain sectors, depending on their reliance on the Chinese market,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said managing director of corporate ratings David Tesher. However, our base case for limited ratings impact doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t factor in a Sino-US trade war. China has so far flagged that it may impose tariffs on 128 US product imports, including pork, recyclable aluminum, fruit/nuts, wine, and steel pipes. However, these products represent a relatively modest portion of trade from the US. If China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response is more retaliatory, we would re-analyze the impact on industry sectors in both countries.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ab8a4fde4b01a4d38bab087\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-26T07:52:02.502Z\">8.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">JD Sports steps into US footwear market</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back in the corporate world, and the US has proved a step too far for many UK retailers, even such big names as Marks &amp; Spencer and Tesco.

                "bodyText":"The US markets have made a bright start after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout following news that the US planned to impose $60bn of tariffs on Chinese imports. Investors have turned slightly more positive on hopes that the US and China could resolve the row before it turned into a full blown trade war, following positive comments over the weekend from US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin. S&amp;P said we were not in a trade war yet but much would depend on China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for retaliation to the $60bn worth of sanctions announced by Donald Trump last week. So on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 430 points or 1.83% higher, while the S&amp;P 500 has climbed 1.6% and the Nasdaq Composite is up 1.98%. In Europe Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 0.4% better while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.34%. The FTSE 100 had added 0.3%. Earlier there was better than expected growth from the French economy but in the UK, mortgage approvals showed an 11% month on month fall in February. Elsewhere IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said the eurozone should set up a rainy day fund to cope with any future financial difficulties member states might get into. On the corporate front, UK retailer JD Sports stepped into the US market, while packaging group Smurfit Kappa rejected an increased bid from rival International Paper. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Ahead of the US market open, a positive bit of economic data. The Chicago Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national activity index has jumped from +0.02 in January to +0.88 in February. January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure was however revised down from +0.12. Speaking of Brexit, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Investors Service says the agreement between the UK and the EU on the terms of a transition arrangement is positive but there is still much uncertainty. In a report just published, it said: The agreement provides clarity that is credit positive for a broad range of UK issuers because it extends the narrow time frame that is available to shape and implement a new trade agreement and regulatory regimes with the EU until existing common rules cease to apply. It also buys the UK limited time to negotiate free trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries. However, the agreement remains conditional on the UK and the EU overcoming other challenges, such as the need to find a solution that prevents the creation of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Until a conclusive final agreement is reached, uncertainty over the terms of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future long-term relationship with the EU will persist, weighing on the operating environment for UK issuers and hampering corporate investment With a year to go until Britain leaves the European Union, there are a host of unresolved issues facing business. Dan Roberts has been taking a look: In the currency markets, the pound is edging higher against both the dollar and euro. Against the dollar it is up 0.6% at $1.4223 while against the euro it is up 0.17% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1458. The single currency is also benefiting from dollar weakness. All this is helping limit the gains in European stock markets, says Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets: Equities have started the week on the front foot, with reports of US-China talks helping ease the trade war fears which pushed equities lower last week, as well as Trump signing rather than vetoing a US government spending bill. That said, US dollar weakness, and thus pound and euro strength, is keeping equity bullishness in check, holding indices from breaking back above key levels, to inspire confidence in a turnaround. Europe should create a rainy day fund to help any countries that get into financial difficulties in the future, said IMF managing director Christine Lagarde. In a speech in Berlin she said: [A new IMF paper] proposes creating a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rainy-day fund\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that countries contribute to each year to build up assets in good times. Then, depending on the depth of a downturn countries would receive transfers to help them offset budget shortfalls. In extreme circumstances, the fund would be allowed to borrow, however any borrowing would be repaid by members\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 future contributions. By itself, the capacity may not be enough to solve the next crisis \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but it certainly would help. Eurozone officials have been considering such a fund since last year, with France in particular backing the idea. European markets are managing to hold onto their early gains. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.4%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 0.5% higher and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.24%. On Wall Street, the futures are suggesting the Dow Jones Industrial Average will open more than 300 points higher. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest update from the receivers at collapsed construction giant Carillion. Another 123 employees have lost their jobs and will leave the business later this week. But 481 jobs have been saved, with the staff transferring to new suppliers. That means so far 9,073 employees have now found secure ongoing employment, said the receivers, while 1,705 jobs have been axed. They added: More than 6,400 employees are currently retained to enable Carillion to deliver the remaining services it is providing for public and private sector customers until decisions are taken to transfer or cease these contracts. Talks to sell the remaining businesses are still going on, said a spokesperson for the receivers: Discussions with potential purchasers continue. I am continuing to engage with staff, elected employee representatives and unions to keep them informed as these arrangements are confirmed. Back in the corporate world, and excitement in the paper and packaging realm. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Smurfit Kappa has seen its shares drop by nearly 4%, making it the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, after it rejected an increased \u00e2\u201a\u00ac9.5bn offer from US rival International Paper. Smurfit said the offer undervalued its business and made no strategic sense. Its chairman Liam O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Mahony said: The revised proposal does not offer Smurfit Kappa shareholders much more than compensation for the fall in International Paper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price since [the first offer] and again entirely fails to value the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true intrinsic business worth and future prospects. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s [share price] reaction suggests concern among Smurfit holders (sitting on still handsome 20% profits versus 2018\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s average) that IP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new 15% higher cash component is merely aimed at offsetting the now lower valued share component, and that the meagre 3% boost to the aggregate offer means it is unprepared to go much if any higher. The other worry is that Smurfit will continue to hold out for improved terms which may never materialise. In which case, shareholders are cashing out as close to the top as they can. Those hanging on may be expecting a second revision from IP before it gives up. And history tells us this could well happen. The second bid does, after all, show willingness to maintain the bid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 67% cash value to Smurfit shareholders. However, given Smurfit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second rejection, and unless any third offer is for something closer to recent record highs (10% higher), it may not prove enough to convince management and shareholders alike to agree to tender. Especially given the risk that the value of the 32% share component worsens further, assuming the deal requires at least some anti-trust approval. Apart from the hopes that the US and China can avert an all out trade war, markets have also been buoyed by news that South Korea has been granted an indefinite exemption from steel and aluminium tariffs. The US has already given the European Union a temporary extension, something the bloc is hoping to make permanent. But if the US and China cannot resolve their differences, investors are likely to take fright once more. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: It is a calm morning after the stormy atmosphere of last week. US futures have raced higher on weekend reports that the US and China are working towards a possible deal that improves access for US firms. With equity markets so heavily beaten down last week, a rebound was a definite possibility, the only questions are how long it lasts and how far it goes. Churchill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s observation that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcto jaw jaw is better than to war war\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 applies to these tariff battles as well. The decision to exempt key US allies from the tariffs is a sign that the White House is not as dogmatic as the rhetoric appears, and should give negotiators room for manoeuvre. Still, given how badly equities reacted last week a failure of negotiations would likely prompt another ugly sell-off. A new snapshot of the UK housing market shows mortage approvals fell by 11% in February to 38,120 compared to January, but were up 4.9% on a year ago. But according to UK Finance, net mortgage lending rose by \u00c2\u00a31.643bn compared to \u00c2\u00a31.038bn in January. Credit card borrowing grew by 6.3% compared to a year ago. Eric Leenders, managing director of personal finance at UK Finance said: There has been an increase in remortgage approvals compared to last year, as borrowers look to lock in to attractive deals amid speculation of further interest rate rises later this year. We are also seeing a continuing rise in credit card spending, reflecting the growing number of transactions carried out using cards, while other forms of borrowing such as overdrafts continue to fall. Meanwhile real wages continue to be squeezed by inflation, impacting on consumer confidence and retail sales. This pressure on household incomes should ease in the coming months, as the effect of the fall in sterling begins to fade and the strong labour market leads to a better outlook for wage growth. Despite the US tariffs to be imposed on Chinese products, we are not in a trade war - yet. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the view of S&amp;P Global Ratings: President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-threatened package of trade sanctions on China has landed, but a trade war isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet inevitable. In general, the threatened tariffs and investment restrictions on China won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t likely cause deep pain to the Chinese economy, nor will they have a material impact on corporate borrowers in either country. However, S&amp;P Global Ratings believes China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response will be the key determinant on what happens next. So far China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response has been relatively measured, indicating potential tariffs on about $3 billion of U.S. imports. But will China take additional retaliatory action? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153More aggressive moves could escalate into a full-blown trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies--with spillover effects on global business confidence, investment, and growth,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said managing director Terry Chan.... Preliminary analysis shows that the overall impact on Chinese corporates and banks will be contained because the US represents only about 15% of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exports, and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s domestic activity now drives its economic growth rather than exports. The $50 billion-$60 billion targeted by potential tariffs could affect up to 10%-12% of Chinese imports to the US. The trade dispute appears to be about technology and intellectual property, so products subject to the tariffs could include computers and cell phones. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unclear whether the tariffs will focus on just one or two product categories or be more widespread. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The near-term effects on corporate credit will likely be muted--barring an immediate escalation of retaliatory measures--but there will still be some impact for certain sectors, depending on their reliance on the Chinese market,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said managing director of corporate ratings David Tesher. However, our base case for limited ratings impact doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t factor in a Sino-US trade war. China has so far flagged that it may impose tariffs on 128 US product imports, including pork, recyclable aluminum, fruit/nuts, wine, and steel pipes. However, these products represent a relatively modest portion of trade from the US. If China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response is more retaliatory, we would re-analyze the impact on industry sectors in both countries. Back in the corporate world, and the US has proved a step too far for many UK retailers, even such big names as Marks &amp; Spencer and Tesco. Still, this has not stopped highly rated JD Sports from taking the plunge. Reuters has the details: British sports and fashion retailer JD Sports Fashion said on Monday it has agreed to buy US firm The Finish Line for $558m (\u00c2\u00a3396m), boosting its presence in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest sportswear market. JD Sports has exploited growing demand for branded sports shoes and clothes to overtake Sports Direct as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading sportswear retailer by market value and in recent years has also been expanding overseas. It said it has agreed to pay $13.50 per share for Finish Line, one of the largest retailers of premium multi-branded athletic footwear, apparel and accessories in the US. The firm trades from 556 Finish Line branded retail stores across 44 U.S. states and Puerto Rico and also has an online presence. Finish Line is also the exclusive retailer of athletic shoes, both in-store and online, for Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, operating 375 branded and 188 unbranded concessions within Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stores. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The acquisition offers the company the opportunity to expand its market leading elevated proposition into the most significant global market,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd JD said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It immediately gains the benefit of a significant physical and online retail presence and increases the importance of the company to its major international brand partners.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd JD Sports said it would fund the deal through a new revolving credit facility and a new asset backed lending facility secured against Finish Line\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inventory and receivables. It forecast the acquisition would make a small incremental positive contribution to its results and earnings per share in the year to Feb. 2 2019. Despite the moves higher in Europe, markets remain edgy, says Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM: US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin commented over the weekend that he is cautiously optimistic that an agreement would be reached between the U.S. and China, and this would likely calm the markets when the U.S. trading session kicks off. However, the longer the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wait and see\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mode lasts, the more pressure will be felt in the equities market. After all, many companies will need to adjust their expansion and capital spending plans according to the new developments. This will certainly impact investor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confidence and risk global economic growth, which has been the key pillar of the nine-year-old bull run. Positive signs from the French economy are also giving some support to European markets. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP grew by 0.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the previous three months, better than the 0.6% originally estimated. The estimate for 2017 as a whole remained at 2%, according to the INSEE statistics agency. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nervy start to trading in Europe, but markets have managed to edge higher despite the continuing tariff tensions. Investors are hoping the suggestion that the US and China are in discussions behind the scenes might avoid a full blown trade war between the two. So the FTSE 100 is up 0.21%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has added 0.3% and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is 0.29% better. In Asia there has been a turnaround from early losses, with the Hang Seng 0.13% higher while the Nikkei 225 is now up 0.72%. The US futures are suggesting a gain of more than 200 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average at the open, although this would mean it recovers only half the losses experienced on Friday. Uber has announced a deal to regroup its operations in south-east Asia: Ride-hailing firm Uber has agreed to sell its south-east Asian business to bigger regional rival Grab, marking the US company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second retreat from an Asian market. The deal is the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first big consolidation in south-east Asia, home to about 640 million people, and puts pressure on Indonesia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Go-Jek, which is backed by Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Google and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tencent. A shake-up in Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiercely competitive ride-hailing industry became likely earlier this year when Japan-based SoftBank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vision Fund made a multi-billion dollar investment in Uber. SoftBank also invested in Grab. As part of the transaction, Uber will take a 27.5% stake in Singapore-based Grab and Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, will join Grab\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full report: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to impose $60bn worth of tariffs on China - on top of wider sanctions on steel and aluminium - raised fears of a trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies and sent shivers through global stock markets. Those tensions are not going away quickly, and despite signs that China and the US may be attempting to resolve the issue behind the scenes, investors remain nervous. After Wall Street endured another tough day on Friday in the wake of the tariff announcements - the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped another 424 points or 1.77% - Asian markets have also been under pressure. Here is our latest report: So European markets are expected to open in a rather mixed fashion: Michael Hewson at CMC Markets UK said: As we come to the end of this first quarter of 2018 all of the optimism that we saw at the end of January now appears to be an almost distant memory, and it will need a significant change of tone to prevent stock markets finishing this quarter lower, despite this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record highs. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initially measured response to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement of tariffs to the US administrations announcement does appear to offer some hope in terms of a possible stabilisation this week, but sentiment is likely to remain volatile, particularly if Chinese authorities follow up with further large scale measures which target, larger US corporations like Boeing or Apple. US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments at the weekend that he was cautiously optimistic that a US agreement with China could be reached also offers hope that some form of accommodation can be reached in the coming days or weeks. At the beginning of the month President Trump indicated that he would implement tariffs in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153loving way\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, maybe in an attempt to suggest that he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to spook equity investors. If recent price action is any guide markets are clearly not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153loving\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd what is happening right now, which is also being exacerbated by rising concerns that the tech sector, which has driven most of the gains in US equity markets, could be on the cusp of being clobbered by increasing regulation, as well as possible taxation changes. On a pretty quiet day for corporate and economic news, GKN continues to try and persuade its shareholders to back its management rather than be tempted by the \u00c2\u00a37.8bn offer from turnaround specialist Melrose. Investors have until Thursday this week to decide, and ahead of that GKN has just announced an improvement in the terms of its deal to merge its Driveline business with US group Dana. Dana has added another $140m (\u00c2\u00a3100m) in cash, making a total of $1.77bn in cash after deducting $1bn for the transfer of the pension deficit to the combined group. GKN plans to return \u00c2\u00a3700m to shareholders as soon as possible after the Dana deal is down, the first part of a \u00c2\u00a32.5bn cash return programme.

Peter Welford at Jefferies says the structure of any deal is uncertain:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> We see the potential strategic rationale for the deal and have long highlighted Shire is currently trading at a substantial discount to our fundamental 4300p or so value given overhangs, notably haemophilia competitive concerns. Nevertheless Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near.$42bn market cap versus Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $47bn or $66bn enterprise value raises questions on a potential deal structure....</p> <p>We presume Takeda would need a significant equity raise to acquire Shire, suggesting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153merger\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is perhaps better terminology, which may raise hurdles to the successful completion of any future deal.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jack Scannell at UBS says other bidders could emerge:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Since Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market cap is close to Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s we assume a potential offer would have to include a substantial percentage in equity and how Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board and shareholders would react is hard to predict. However as Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price is significantly below the net present value of our cash flow estimates, Takeda could trigger discussion of other bidders.</p> <p> Shire does not strike us as an obvious take-over candidate. There is presumably a price at which the financial engineering would work. However, Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s specialty focus and mix of therapeutic foci means that most buyers would struggle to extract substantial operational synergies while escaping from competition problems, in our view. Also Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low corporate tax rate could rise in most scenarios were the company acquired. It would also be a bold acquisition in our view given the uncertain trajectory of Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s haemophilia business. A merger of equals in this context might be more feasible.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-03-28T12:15:53.943Z\">at 1.15pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5abb7826e4b0ea82609d1836\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-28T11:13:46.699Z\">12.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The potential offer for Shire has helped the FTSE 100 come off its worst levels after the morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier declines.</p> <p>The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index is now down just 0.12% or around 8 points, with Shire up 18% and fellow drugs group GlaxoSmithKline 1.5% better.</p> <p>Elsewhere though the fallout from the US tech slump continues.

In a new report, the agency says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Global momentum has lifted the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic prospects, and it now appears to have reached cruising altitude. The economic and monetary union closed 2017 on a high note, with GDP growth at 2.5%, its fastest pace in a decade.</p> <p>...S&amp;P Global Ratings\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economists say the chief reason for this is the revival of world trade, which has put the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industries back in motion. Capacity utilization was just short of its 2007 high, triggering stronger investment and boosting industry prospects for this year.</p> <p>However, the general fall in sentiment surveys at the start of 2018 indicates that eurozone growth is leveling off. Firms are increasingly reporting that supply constraints, rather than demand, are a drag on output. Nonetheless, for now, we expect the growth momentum will stay solid, thanks to the broad-based economic expansion and strong domestic fundamentals.</p> </blockquote> <p>It added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Strong fundamentals in the eurozone suggest that economic expansion will continue at a brisk pace, and we have raised our GDP growth forecasts for the region to 2.3% this year and 1.9% in 2019.</p> <p>We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also raised our euro-dollar exchange rate forecast to $1.27 in 2018 and $1.3 in 2019, since we expect the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness will persist.</p> <p>The current growth cycle appears to have peaked, but the remaining slack in the labor market and productivity rebound will keep inflationary pressures in check until the end of 2019.</p> <p>Because inflation will likely remain subdued this year, we expect the ECB will only gradually wind down its asset purchase program from September until the end of this year. As the gap between structural and real unemployment diminishes, earnings growth will accelerate.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For all the gains seen in US markets over the past 18 months the bulk of these have been driven by tech stocks, and yesterday these tech stocks swooned quite sharply, reversing a good proportion of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, in the process dragging the S&amp;P500 back down towards its 200 day moving average. </p> <p>This rolling over in tech stocks looks set to weigh on European markets this morning, with a lower open as markets mull over the potential for uncertainty over a tech sector that could catch a cold as a result of Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes around user data. </p> <p>With the increasing focus on what is going with respect to how Facebook has managed its users personal data, it must surely be only a matter of time before attention turns to the rest of the tech sector, and how companies like Alphabet, Twitter, Microsoft and Apple to name a few, manage their own users personal data.

The US economy is expected to have grown by 2.7% in the fourth quarter on an annualised basis, up from 2.5%. Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The economic backdrop was supportive in the last quarter of 2017. Robust jobs growth and healthy consumer spending comfortably propped up the economy, which is expected to be reflected in an upwards revision for economic growth to 2.7% on an annualised basis from 2.5% in the previous estimate. The reading will not yet include the benefits from the tax cuts, nor the more recent uncertainties over global trade. However, given how quiet the economic calendar is, the reading is expected to attract attention anyway.</p> <p>A surprise to the upside, could boost the possibility of a June rate hike up from the CME FedWatch odds of 78%, lifting the dollar back towards 90.00. On the contrary, should growth remain around 2.5%, we could see buying demand for the dollar decline and the greenback look to test 89.00 once more.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>The agenda:</strong></p> <p>11.00 BST: CBI distributive trades survey</p> <p>13.30 BST: US fourth quarter GDP</p> </div>   </div>",
                "bodyText":"It was another volatile session for stock markets. After Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump on Wall Street, driven predominantly by sharp declines in technology stocks, European markets opened mostly lower. However they came off their worst levels as the US market managed to stage a mild recovery, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently marginally in positive territory, up 35 points, although the tech-heavy Nasdaq is down around 1%. Amazon in particular is being hit by reports that the US president plans to go after the company and altering its tax treatment. The FTSE 100, now up around 9 points, was supported by news of a potential bid for UK listed pharmaceutical group Shire from Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Takeda. Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares jumped, valuing the company at more than \u00c2\u00a335bn at one point. Elsewhere there was more bad news for the UK high street, with retail sales falling in March for the first time since October, according to the CBI. But the US economy grew more strongly than expected in the final quarter. And there was a positive report on the eurozone economy from S&amp;P Global ratings. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Back with Shire, and Ketan Patel at EdenTree Investment Management says it could be a key moment if a deal goes ahead: If a bid does materialise from Takeda for drug maker Shire, it would be a watershed moment for Japanese pharma. There hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been a cross border transaction in the sector, excluding joint ventures and small generic M&amp;A. Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cash laden balance sheet appears a good fit for Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling balance sheet, following recent large scale M&amp;A. The attraction for Takeda is the highly lucrative rare disease market in the US, which comes with exceedingly high margins and is largely exempt from the usual pricing pressure that affects the wider pharmaceutical sector. After Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tech-inspired slump, there is little respite for the sector despite US markets generally starting the day on a slightly more positive note. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 121 points or 0.53% in early trading, while the S&amp;P 500 has edged up 0.05%. But the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has opened down 0.35%. The stronger than expected US GDP figure will revive talk about how many interest rate rises the Federal Reserve will sanction this year. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Robust jobs growth and healthy consumer spending have been attributed to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stronger than expected US GDP data, as the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic outlook appears in rude health and the 3% growth target appears within touching distance. ...As a result of the strong economic outlook, questions may be raised around the possibility of Fed Chair Jerome Powell introducing a June rate hike. It may be a case of US growth being monitored before any rate decision is made, but markets could be volatile between now and then. The 2.9% growth in the US economy, although better than the initial estimates, shows a slowdown from the 3.2% rise recorded in the third quarter. The figures were helped by the biggest rise in consumer spending for three years, offset by a surge in imports. The Bureau of Economic Analysis said: The increase in real GDP in the fourth quarter primarily reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures, nonresidential fixed investment, exports, residential fixed investment, state and local government spending, and federal government spending that were partly offset by a negative contribution from private inventory investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased. Breaking news: Something for Donald Trump to tweet about. The US economy grew more strongly than expected in the final quarter, up 2.9% on an annualised basis compared to expectations of a 2.7% increase and an initial estimate of 2.5% growth. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some analyst reaction to the possible Shire deal. Peter Welford at Jefferies says the structure of any deal is uncertain: We see the potential strategic rationale for the deal and have long highlighted Shire is currently trading at a substantial discount to our fundamental 4300p or so value given overhangs, notably haemophilia competitive concerns. Nevertheless Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near.$42bn market cap versus Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $47bn or $66bn enterprise value raises questions on a potential deal structure.... We presume Takeda would need a significant equity raise to acquire Shire, suggesting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153merger\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is perhaps better terminology, which may raise hurdles to the successful completion of any future deal. Jack Scannell at UBS says other bidders could emerge: Since Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market cap is close to Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s we assume a potential offer would have to include a substantial percentage in equity and how Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board and shareholders would react is hard to predict. However as Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price is significantly below the net present value of our cash flow estimates, Takeda could trigger discussion of other bidders. Shire does not strike us as an obvious take-over candidate. There is presumably a price at which the financial engineering would work. However, Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s specialty focus and mix of therapeutic foci means that most buyers would struggle to extract substantial operational synergies while escaping from competition problems, in our view. Also Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low corporate tax rate could rise in most scenarios were the company acquired. It would also be a bold acquisition in our view given the uncertain trajectory of Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s haemophilia business. A merger of equals in this context might be more feasible. The potential offer for Shire has helped the FTSE 100 come off its worst levels after the morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier declines. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index is now down just 0.12% or around 8 points, with Shire up 18% and fellow drugs group GlaxoSmithKline 1.5% better. Elsewhere though the fallout from the US tech slump continues. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax remains down 0.7%, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is 0.9% lower. Meanwhile US futures are suggesting a rebound of sorts on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average forecast to open around 67 points higher. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the possible takeover of Shire by Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Takeda: Shares in the UK-listed drugmaker Shire surged after Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest pharmaceutical company, Takeda Pharmaceutical, said it was considering making a takeover approach. Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares jumped as much as 33% to \u00c2\u00a338.79 on the news, and later traded 17% higher at \u00c2\u00a336, valuing the company at \u00c2\u00a332.8bn. Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market value is about \u00c2\u00a329bn, around the same as Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closing price. Shire is best known for its ADHD drug Adderall but its focus in recent years has been on rare diseases. The company is based in Dublin for tax purposes but run from Boston. Most of its operations are in the US. The news comes three-and-a-half years after US firm AbbVie abandoned its agreed $54bn (\u00c2\u00a334bn) takeover of Shire, after a US clampdown on so-called tax inversions by US companies buying an overseas business to secure a lower tax rate. Shire then turned acquiror and completed its $32bn purchase of US firm Baxalta last June. In November it reported a drop in sales of haemophilia drugs, which became its biggest source of revenue following the deal. The full report is here: Here is the full statement from Takeda, which includes more detail of the Japanese company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking: Takeda believes that a potential transaction with Shire presents an opportunity to advance Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stated Vision 2025, build on its current strong momentum, and create a truly global, value-based Japanese biopharmaceutical leader. In particular, a transaction with Shire would: \u00c2\u00b7 strengthen Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core therapeutic areas of oncology, GI and neuroscience \u00c2\u00b7 accelerate Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vision to be a leader in specialized medicines that are transformative to patients through the addition of Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading global rare disease franchise \u00c2\u00b7 further enhance Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s robust R&amp;D strategy, concentrating on key therapeutic areas \u00c2\u00b7 reinforce a strong and large-molecule focused late-stage pipeline within Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core therapeutic areas to complement Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own pipeline and discovery capabilities \u00c2\u00b7 balance Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s geographic focus to align with the market opportunity in the U.S. \u00c2\u00b7 drive financial value from a strong combined financial profile Clearly defined strategic and financial objectives are core to Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disciplined approach to acquisitions, including in relation to its dividend policy and credit rating, which are well-established. Any potential offer for Shire, if made, would have to align with this strict investment criteria. Back to Shire: More from the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high street survey: More bad news for the high street, with a new survey showing a slump in sales this month. Reuters reports: British retail sales fell for the first time in five months in March as heavy snowfall combined with the financial strains on many households, a survey by the Confederation of British Industry showed on Wednesday. The CBI distributive trades survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales balance fell to -8 from +8 in February, confounding a median forecast of +15 in a Reuters poll of economists. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Against a backdrop of stagnating household incomes and weak consumer confidence, the lengthy cold snap earlier this month has heaped added pressure on retailers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ben Jones, a CBI economist, said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Freezing conditions and transport disruption caused people to avoid the high street. With many forced to work from home, telecoms firms saw record internet traffic, yet on-line shopping slowed sharply given the potential for disrupted deliveries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A measure of sales for the time of year was the weakest since April 2013, the survey showed. Retailers expected sales volumes and orders to grow in April but only at a subdued pace. Elsewhere, the latest report from the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s network of regional agents has just come out with some good news to cheer British workers. Used to detect early warning signs for the economy, the quarterly report compiles the views of businesses recorded by the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 12 regional outposts. In their latest assessment, the agents say companies are handing out pay rises worth between 2.5% and 3.5% - which would be inflation-busting for staff at the top end of that range. Firms are also telling the agents inflation is beginning to fade. Elsewhere in the report for the first three months of the year, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an interesting look at how company chief executives are preparing for Brexit. Apparently, two fifths from more than 3,000 firms surveyed are not spending any time at all each week on Brexit. They had better hope the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transitional arrangements, agreed in principal earlier this month, will help smooth the process as advertised. Meanwhile, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a contrarian view over the collapse of Carillion. Far from being the disaster for the wider construction industry forecast by experts, firms tell the agents it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had much of an impact at all. There has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153little evidence of a significant impact on the supply chain or on the availability of credit to the sector\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so far, the agents report. Shire shares - which climbed as high as \u00c2\u00a338.79 on news of the possible approach by Takeda - have come off their best levels. The rather conditional nature of the Japanese statement means Shire is now at \u00c2\u00a335.45, still 15% better on the day. Takeda says it is at a preliminary and exploratory stage in considering a bid, and no approach has been made to the Shire board. Meanwhile Takeda - Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest pharmaceutical company - is worth some \u00c2\u00a329bn. This is less than Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value after today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jump, but around the same as the UK-listed company was worth at last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closing price. Shire is worth \u00c2\u00a335bn after its shares jumped to \u00c2\u00a338 on the news of Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible approach. Breaking news: Pharmaceutical group Shire has soared 25% after Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Takeda says it is considering making a takeover approach to the company. Takeda has until 5pm on 25 April to decide whether to make a firm bid or walk away. The Easter break couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have come at a worse time for stock markets, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at GKFX: Investors were already on edge having been shocked by February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equity sell-off triggered by the dual spike in volatility and bond yields. Despite a strong rebound, the major stock indices remain fragile with many in danger of breaking back below some major technical levels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in particular, the lower level of the S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bullish trendline advance since February 2016. This has been brought sharply into focus with the sell-off in tech stocks, which have lead the market rally for so long, catalysed by the scandal surrounding Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cavalier attitude to its users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data. Now we have a long holiday weekend which coincides with the close of the first quarter. Once again, bonds are in focus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly the US 10-year Treasury. But this time yields have slumped with the 10-year crashing back below the key 2.80% level which has held as support for the past six weeks. Investors are piling back into the perceived \u00e2\u20ac\u0153safe haven\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of fixed income as stock markets slide... And this comes against a backdrop of tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, concerns over the outbreak of trade wars and worries about changes in key White House personnel leading to a more hawkish foreign policy. All-in-all, investors will see plenty of reasons to reduce equity exposure as we head into the weekend. Markets could be in for a run of volatility similar to the summer of 2015, says Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG: Markets remain under pressure as the sell-off in tech spreads once more to the wider equities space. The bounce on Tuesday looks like a flash in the pan, with more and more investors heading to the exit. It is looking increasingly likely that we have a re-run of August 2015 on our hands; equities then had months of volatility to contend with before the rally resumed. With trade wars and the tech scandal weighing on sentiment we may well have more downside to content with... The rout in global growth stocks has been seen in the falls in mining and bank names in London. Particularly hard hit among the banks are the Asia-focussed giants HSBC and Standard Chartered, while miners have seen further outflows as investors downgrade their optimistic views on global economic expansion. Oil prices are on the slide after a surprise rise in US stockpiles. Brent crude is currently down 0.6% at $69.68 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 1% lower at $64.6. The American Petroleum Institute said late on Tuesday that US weekly crude stocks had risen unexpectedly by 5.3m barrels to 430.6m barrels. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an interesting chart on market bubbles: The eurozone is seeing steady economic growth, thanks to a revival in world trade, according to S&amp;P Global Ratings. In a new report, the agency says: Global momentum has lifted the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic prospects, and it now appears to have reached cruising altitude. The economic and monetary union closed 2017 on a high note, with GDP growth at 2.5%, its fastest pace in a decade. ...S&amp;P Global Ratings\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economists say the chief reason for this is the revival of world trade, which has put the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industries back in motion. Capacity utilization was just short of its 2007 high, triggering stronger investment and boosting industry prospects for this year. However, the general fall in sentiment surveys at the start of 2018 indicates that eurozone growth is leveling off. Firms are increasingly reporting that supply constraints, rather than demand, are a drag on output. Nonetheless, for now, we expect the growth momentum will stay solid, thanks to the broad-based economic expansion and strong domestic fundamentals. It added: Strong fundamentals in the eurozone suggest that economic expansion will continue at a brisk pace, and we have raised our GDP growth forecasts for the region to 2.3% this year and 1.9% in 2019. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also raised our euro-dollar exchange rate forecast to $1.27 in 2018 and $1.3 in 2019, since we expect the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness will persist. The current growth cycle appears to have peaked, but the remaining slack in the labor market and productivity rebound will keep inflationary pressures in check until the end of 2019. Because inflation will likely remain subdued this year, we expect the ECB will only gradually wind down its asset purchase program from September until the end of this year. As the gap between structural and real unemployment diminishes, earnings growth will accelerate. Thus, we think underlying inflation is set to move closer to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target at the end of 2019, giving the ECB enough leeway to raise rates in Q3 2019. Meanwhile the pound is edging higher, up 0.16% against the dollar at $1.4177 and 0.21% better against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1430. Lee Hardman, currency analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said: The ongoing reduction in Brexit risks and more hawkish outlook for Bank of England policy are the key drivers behind the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upward momentum. The pound has derived some additional support from a report that Irish officials have been told to expect new plans \u00e2\u20ac\u0153imminently\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on how Britain plans to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland. While short on details, the report has further boosted confidence that the UK and EU can find a workable and timely solution to the Irish border issue to support plans for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153smooth &amp; orderly Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Nevertheless, it still remains a potential banana skin for the pound in the coming months if intensified Brexit talks do not progress as well as hoped. Among the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s company news, furniture group DFS has bucked the gloom in the high street with an upbeat outlook. It reported a 7.4% fall in underlying half year profits to \u00c2\u00a330m, in line with expectations, and chief executive Ian Filby said: We have seen a strengthening trading performance across the first half of the financial year and through February into March. We therefore remain confident that, despite the current challenging market conditions, the group will deliver modest growth in [earnings] and generate strong cashflow across this financial year, in line with our expectations. Analysts at Stifel issued a buy note, saying: Management is striking a confident tone today (despite a challenging market), as the group heads into an easier comparison phase....The shares were pricing in bad news, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect to see a decent relief rally today. Indeed the shares are up nearly 6% in early trading. Stifel added We still believe in the long-term attractions of DFS Furniture. It is a highly cash generative market leader, which is consolidating the physical market at the same time as some online pure players re-evaluate their business models. More on the tech fallout, which saw the US FANG stocks have their worst day for more than two years. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said: The tech sector is predominantly getting battered, mainly due to the woes of Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data breach. We clearly have three kind of investors when it comes to the Facebook; firstly there are some who are jumping out of the ship, pushing the stock price lower. Secondly, we have investors who are watching the show from the sideline and thinking there is more pain to come as we do not know how big the potential fine could be. This is not helping the stock price either. Finally, we have those who are not interested in Facebook anymore as they think that the regulatory burdensome on Facebook is too risky for their appetite and they do not want to get involved in this stock. We personally think, that Facebook has strong fundamentals and it has become the part of everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daily life, so once we have a clear idea about the potential sum which the firm would have to pay as a result of this situation, the stock price could present a potential opportunity. As for the FANG stock including Microsoft, Twitter, it is likely that the Facebook incident would open the door for more scrutiny for other firms, and lawmakers would see how other firms are using user data. This could really open the can of worms and open a potential opportunity for short sellers. Following the falls on Wall Street and in Asia, European markets have indeed dropped back in early trading. The FTSE 100 is down 0.7%, with software group Sage slipping 1.8% and mining shares also among the leading fallers. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex have fallen 0.9% while Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is 0.88% lower. In Germany, the Dax has dropped 0.77%. In the wake of the decline of the US technology stocks, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tech index is down 1.1%. Here are IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening calls for European markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. An early rally on Wall Street went south by the close of play yesterday, and the turnaround is likely to weigh on European markets at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open. Relief that the US and China appeared to be talking about averting a damaging trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two biggest economies had given some support to markets. But a tech turnaround saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average drop 1.4% while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.93% and the S&amp;P 500 fell 1.73%. The so-called FANG technology stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet) were under pressure on fears of growing regulation in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica revelations. Tesla was also a big faller, down more than 8% on news of a Federal investigation into a fatal crash in California. The drop in the US filtered through to Asia, with the NIkkei 225 down 1.4% and the Hang Seng 1.57% lower. In Europe the FTSE 100 is forecast to open down around 50 points, back below 7000, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax could drop 120 points after European markets ended higher on Tuesday. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: For all the gains seen in US markets over the past 18 months the bulk of these have been driven by tech stocks, and yesterday these tech stocks swooned quite sharply, reversing a good proportion of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, in the process dragging the S&amp;P500 back down towards its 200 day moving average. This rolling over in tech stocks looks set to weigh on European markets this morning, with a lower open as markets mull over the potential for uncertainty over a tech sector that could catch a cold as a result of Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes around user data. With the increasing focus on what is going with respect to how Facebook has managed its users personal data, it must surely be only a matter of time before attention turns to the rest of the tech sector, and how companies like Alphabet, Twitter, Microsoft and Apple to name a few, manage their own users personal data. If lawmakers do turn their attention to the rest of the sector, which seems likely, then it is hard not to see how other tech companies will escape scrutiny on how they use this user data, raising the prospect that we could uncover other practices that invite scrutiny. In the run-up to the Easter break there is a smattering of economic news in the form of the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly snapshot of the retail sector and the latest US GDP figures. The US economy is expected to have grown by 2.7% in the fourth quarter on an annualised basis, up from 2.5%. Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group said: The economic backdrop was supportive in the last quarter of 2017. Robust jobs growth and healthy consumer spending comfortably propped up the economy, which is expected to be reflected in an upwards revision for economic growth to 2.7% on an annualised basis from 2.5% in the previous estimate. The reading will not yet include the benefits from the tax cuts, nor the more recent uncertainties over global trade. However, given how quiet the economic calendar is, the reading is expected to attract attention anyway. A surprise to the upside, could boost the possibility of a June rate hike up from the CME FedWatch odds of 78%, lifting the dollar back towards 90.00. On the contrary, should growth remain around 2.5%, we could see buying demand for the dollar decline and the greenback look to test 89.00 once more.

The FTSE 100 is up 0.3% or 19 points at 7,064. There was some bad news from the UK retail sector, as the owner of Bargain Booze and Wine Rack - Conviviality - said it would appoint administrators within a fortnight after failing to secure emergency funds. UK house prices fell for a second month in March according to Nationwide, by 0.2%, as cash-strapped consumers proved unwilling to make major spending commitments. London continues to lag the rest of the country. The ONS confirmed the UK economy grew by 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017, and revised up annual growth in 2017 to 1.8% from an earlier estimate of 1.7%. A breakdown of the GDP report showed that household spending growth of 1.7% in 2017 was the weakest in six years, as falling real pay took its toll on family finances. In the US, initial jobless claims dropped to a 45-year low of 215,000 last week, in a further show of strength for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labor market. The US Department of Justice announced that Barclays has agreed to pay $2bn to settle claims that it fraudulently sold residential mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Tuesday. US markets after the opening bell: Dow Jones: +0.5% at 23,974 S&amp;P 500: +0.5% at 2,617 Nasdaq: +0.5% at 23,974 Barclays has agreed to pay $2bn to settle claims that it fraudulently sold residential mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. Announcing the levy, the US Department of Justice said Barclays had caused billions of dollars in losses to investors by engaging in a fraudulent scheme to sell 36 residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) deals between 2005 and 2007, misleading investors about the quality of the mortgage loans backing those deals. Richard Donoghue, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said: This settlement reflects the ongoing commitment of the Department of Justice, and this Office, to hold banks and other entities and individuals accountable for their fraudulent conduct. The substantial penalty Barclays and its executives have agreed to pay is an important step in recognizing the harm that was caused to the national economy and to investors in RMBS. As well as the fine imposed on the bank, two former Barclays executives have agreed to pay a combined sum of $2m in exchange for a dismissal of claims brought against them individually. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to the lowest level in 45 years last week. Initial claims fell 12,000 to 215,000 in the week ending 24 March, the lowest since January 1973, the US Labor Department said. It followed 227,000 claims a week earlier, and was well below the 230,000 claims forecast by economists. Claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold - considered a measure of a strong labour market - for 158 consecutive weeks. That is the longest run of growth since 1970. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, says he is concerned by this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ONS figures, which showed the savings ratio hit a record low of 4.9% in 2017. He says: These are deeply worrying figures. The fact that for the first time in 30 years households are now net borrowers, taking on more debt and seeing their incomes squeezed by inflation, while the savings ratio is at its lowest level since records began, should be setting off alarm bells in the Treasury. The chancellor stubbornly refused to use the spring statement to help working families, but he must now reconsider his policy of inaction as households are clearly reeling from the effects of eight years of Tory economic failure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with real wages still lower than when the Conservatives first came to power in 2010. The next Labour government will end austerity, introduce a \u00c2\u00a310 per hour real living wage and cap interest on credit cards, to build a high wage, high skill economy of the future. President Trump has made very clear his feelings about Amazon in his first tweet of the day: Time for a European market update: FTSE 100: +0.2% at 7,061 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.8% at 12,037 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.6% at 5,161 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.2% at 22,386 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.7% at 9,620 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.4% at 371 US stock index futures are up with tech shares posting slim gains after being hammered earlier in the week. Shares in the so-called FANG group - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet) - were up between 0.6% and 1.6% in pre-market trading. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report from the ONS showed that household spending grew by 1.7% in 2017 - the weakest since 2011. It reflects the tough backdrop faced by consumers since the Brexit vote in 2016, which drove a sharp fall in the value of the pound and pushed up the price of goods imported from abroad. As those price rises fed through to higher inflation, wage growth failed to keep pace, signalling falling real pay for workers. Households have responded to tighter budgets by spending less on non-essential items and becoming reluctant to commit to major spending decisions. Victoria Clarke, economist at Investec, explains: The detail today laid bare the squeeze on the household cash position sitting behind this subdued spending backdrop. Real household disposable income rose by just 0.1% over the quarter, a softening from the already subdued 0.3% increase in Q3. Wages and salaries were a positive influence to incomes growth but their influence was almost completely offset by the impact of rising inflation. Following a run of soft outturns, real household incomes grew by just 0.3% in 2017 as a whole. However, Paul Hollingsworth at Capital Economics say there is light at the end of the tunnel for UK consumers as inflation has already started to fall. With a sustained rises in real wages on the horizon, the outlook for spending growth remains bright. This supports our view that the economy will grow by around 2% this year, above the consensus estimate of 1.5%. Shares in Renault rose more than 5% after Bloomberg reported the French car maker is in talks to merge with Japanese car giant Nissan. Bloomberg says: Renault SA and Nissan Motor Co. are in talks to merge, seeking to solidify their two-decade-old alliance under a single stock as an unprecedented shift toward electric and shared cars transforms the industry, people with knowledge of the matter said. A deal would end the current alliance between the companies and marry them as one corporation, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the details aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t public. Renault currently owns 43 percent of Nissan while the Japanese carmaker has a 15 percent stake in its French counterpart. Carlos Ghosn, the chairman of both companies, is driving the negotiations and would run the combined entity, the people said. A merged giant would be a more formidable rival for Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp., allowing the partners to better pool resources as the industry shifts toward new-energy vehicles, autonomous driving and car-sharing services. While the alliance of Renault and Nissan has brought savings, the fragmented ownership structure has prevented the companies from reaping full benefits from their union. How the pound has fared against the dollar since the EU referendum: The pound is on course for its best quarterly performance against the dollar since 2015, despite dipping this morning. After taking a hammering in the aftermath of the Brexit vote in June 2016, the pound is currently up 4% against the dollar over the first quarter as it draws to a close. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest quarterly rise since mid 2015. Against the euro, the pound has risen 1.4% since January, which would be the best performance since 2016. Growing expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates faster than expected over the coming months has boosted the pound. Developments in Brexit negotiations that have been interpreted as broadly positive have also helped the UK currency. Current trading: The pound is roughly flat against the dollar at $1.4066 It is down 0.1% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1420 CME agrees \u00c2\u00a33.9bn deal for Michael Spencer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nex Group The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest futures exchange, CME Group, has agreed to buy Michael Spencer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nex Group in a \u00c2\u00a33.9bn deal that will net the former Tory party treasurer \u00c2\u00a3670m. CME also picked London as its European headquarters, giving a much-needed boost to the UK government during its Brexit negotiations. The move comes after CME\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision last year to shut its loss-making London bourse and clearing house. Spencer, chief executive of Nex, owns a 17.6% stake in the financial broker he founded in 1986. It changed its name from Icap at the end of 2016 and is one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest money-broking firms. Spencer will join the CME board as a special advisor and will stay on for a minimum of two years to oversee the integration of the two businesses. The takeover, which still has to be approved by Nex shareholders, will lead to 750 job losses over the next three years in the combined business, or 16% of the total workforce. It is not clear where they will occur. Nex has 1,900 employees globally, including 634 in London and 42 in Bristol. CME employs 2,800 people worldwide, 400 of them in London. Last year Nex agreed to pay back donations of \u00c2\u00a325,000 made to Conservative general election candidates following a shareholder revolt. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector continued to be the main driver of growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, despite being revised down. It accounts for about three quarters of the UK economy. Output in the sector increased by 0.4%, lower than the 0.6% growth estimated previously. Transport, storage and communications services grew by 1.1%, while output at hotels and restaurants fell 0.1%. Here are how some of the other major parts of the economy performed between October and December: Industrial production grew by 0.4% Manufacturing output rose 1.3% Construction output fell 0.1% Agriculture contracted by 1% Household spending grew by 0.3% Government spending increased by 0.4% The trade deficit widened to \u00c2\u00a39.34bn from \u00c2\u00a37.6bn in Q3 Business investment increased by 0.3% The ONS has revised its estimate for annual growth in 2017 back up to 1.8%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in line with its first estimate, before the ONS revised it down to 1.7% in its first revision. It is still the weakest growth in five years. Consumer spending grew, but at a weaker rate than previous years as the fall in real wages took its toll: The UK economy grew by 0.4% in the final three months of 2017, the Office for National Statistics confirmed in its latest estimate of GDP. It was unchanged from previous estimates. Rob Kent-Smith, a statistician at the ONS, gives a handy overview: Economic growth at the end of last year was unrevised with services and manufacturing continuing to drive growth. Household borrowing increased throughout 2017, while their saving was the lowest on record. However, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit with the rest of the world shrank, as the UK received increased earnings on foreign investments thanks to a growing world economy. The service sector picked up in the three months to January with architecture, leasing companies and health work all boosting growth. Brian Murphy, head of lending for the Mortgage Advice Bureau, has commented on the 0.2% fall in UK house prices reported by Nationwide: Given that some areas of the country, such as Northern Ireland and Wales, are seeing more significant increases in prices, while London is still seeing prices cool, suggests that the [headline figure] masks a broad degree of variance across the regions, which rather underscores the effect that dipping London and South East values are having on the wider average. That there is still such a marked North-South divide in average house properties values is, of course, no surprise. However, market conditions in London and thew South East market would appear to be somewhat lacklustre when compared to other areas, proving that consumer confidence is still very strong outside the capital and its commuter belt, as underscored by the ongoing paucity of stock in these areas. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate fell to 5.3% in March from 5.4% in February. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest rate since German reunification in 1990. The total number of unemployed people fell more than expected by 19,000 to 2.37 million. The positive backdrop for employment is likely to further boost consumer confidence in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. Nationwide has published its latest monthly house price index which shows the average price fell 0.2% in March, to \u00c2\u00a3211,625. It followed a 0.4% fall in March, and took the annual rate of house price growth to 2.1%. The last time the annual rate was weaker was June 2013. Here is how the picture looks regionally, where London is lagging behind the rest of the country: Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, gives his view of the market: On the surface, the relatively subdued pace of house price growth appears at odds with recent healthy rates of employment growth, a modest pick-up in wage growth and historically low borrowing costs. However, consumer confidence has remained subdued, due to the ongoing squeeze on household finances as wage growth continues to lag behind increases in the cost of living. Looking ahead, much will depend on how broader economic conditions evolve, especially in the labour market, but also with respect to interest rates. Subdued economic activity and the ongoing squeeze on household budgets is likely to continue to exert a modest drag on housing market activity and house price growth this year. Nationwide is predicting house price growth of just 1% in 2018 overall. Here is our full story on Conviviality, which this morning said it would file for administration within a fortnight: The number of cars rolling off UK production lines fell again in February after a 17% drop in demand from the home market. A total of 145,475 cars were made in British factories last month, down 4.4% on a year earlier. Cars built for export, which account for about 80% of UK production, dipped 0.8%. Mike Hawes, chief executive, of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders which produces the figures, said the figures were concerning: Another month of double digit decline in production for the UK is of considerable concern, but we hope that the degree of certainty provided by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit transition agreement will help stimulate business and consumer confidence over the coming months. These figures also highlight the scale of our sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dependency on exports, so a final deal that keeps our frictionless trade links with our biggest market, the EU, after December 2020 is now a pressing priority. Conviviality, the firm behind Bargain Booze and Wine Rack has announced this morning that it will appoint administrators within a fortnight, putting 2,600 jobs at risk. The British Beer &amp; Pub Association has warned some pubs could face shortage of some drinks in the short-term, because the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Matthew Clark and Bibendum subsidiaries are major suppliers. After failing to secure emergency funding from investors, Conviviality a brief statement: Following discussions with its lending banks, the board has resolved to file notice of intention to appoint administrators to the Company. Unless circumstances change, and in accordance with statutory requirements, the board intend to appoint administrators within 10 business days. The secured creditors can, however, appoint administrators without the requirement for notice. The directors intend to allow the business to continue to trade and the company continues to work alongside advisers in order to preserve as much value as possible for all stakeholders as it explores a number of inbound enquiries regarding a potential sale of all or parts of the business. Further announcements will be made as appropriate. Here is the background: And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off. Here are the opening scores across Europe: FTSE 100: +0.1% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.1% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.3% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.2% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.4% Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.1% Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The one-year countdown to Brexit has begun. Concerns that the UK economy would suffer an immediate slump following the vote to leave the EU proved unfounded, and GDP has continued to grow, albeit at a modest pace. However, Britain is now lagging behind peers in the G7 and major eurozone economies, as the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and strained household finances weigh on activity. Figures to be published by the Office for National Statistics at 9.30am are expected to show the UK economy grew by 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017, unchanged from earlier estimates and following growth of 0.5% in the third quarter. Also coming up today: 9.30am BST: February mortgage approvals and consumer credit data from the Bank of England 1pm-5pm BST: After weeks of bitter wrangling, we will learn the fate of GKN at some point this afternoon. Will the UK engineering giant win its fight to retain independence, or will shareholders vote in favour of Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a38bn hostile takeover? 1.30pm BST: US weekly job losses will give the latest snapshot of the labour market in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy",
