                "bodyText":"Donald Trump took the unusual step of blocking the Singaporean chip maker Broadcom\u2019s bid for its US rival Qualcomm on Monday night, citing national security concerns and ending what would have been the biggest-ever tech deal. Announcing the extraordinary move, Trump said \u201cthere is credible evidence\u201d that allowing the Singapore-based company to take control of Qualcomm could lead to \u201caction that threatens to impair the national security of the United States\u201d. The decision underlines the economic protectionism of the Trump administration and comes just days after the US announced it would impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in order to protect US firms. Last November, Trump said he was \u201cthrilled\u201d to welcome Broadcom to the US. At a White House event with the CEO, Hock Tan, he called Broadcom \u201cone of the great, great companies\u201d. Trump noted the company already employed over 7,500 workers in the US and said: \u201cWe are looking forward to seeing that number grow very substantially.\u201d The president\u2019s intervention follows a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (Cfius), which told the companies on Sunday that it was minded to refer the deal to Trump for rejection. Following the $117bn bid, Broadcom was in the process of relocating its legal base to the US and had hoped to complete the move by 3 April, but Cfius said in its letter that it had identified \u201cpotential national security concerns\u201d and the company had not given the agency enough notice of its decision to move its legal base to the US. \u201cBroadcom strongly disagrees that its proposed acquisition of Qualcomm raises any national security concerns,\u201d it said in a statement in response to the decision. Had the company become US-domiciled, it could have argued that the takeover fell outside of Cfius\u2019s jurisdiction. The Trump administration\u2019s concerns appear to be focused more on China than Singapore \u2013 that allowing a US semiconductor company to be acquired by a foreign company would weaken the US\u2019s position while benefitting China. The Trump administration is concerned about the US losing ground in 5G technology, the latest iteration of wireless technology, which is expected to greatly improve wireless networks and prove essential to the next generation of self-driving cars as well as other technologies. According to a letter from Cfius seen by the Washington Post, the US was concerned that Broadcom would cut back on research and development at Qualcomm following the takeover. Such a move would offer an advantage to China\u2019s Huawei Technologies, a major producer of mobile chips. Earlier this month, in response to those fears, Broadcom announced the creation of a $1.5bn fund \u201cto ensure US leadership in future wireless technology\u201d. Broadcom also promised not to sell off any \u201ccritical national security assets\u201d to foreign firms. The decision is the latest in a series of decisions by the Trump administration to block foreign takeovers. Following a Cfius review, the US stopped Moneygram\u2019s sale to an affiliate of China\u2019s internet conglomerate Alibaba Group and the sale of Lattice Semiconductor to an investment firm with ties to the Chinese government. \u201cThe proposed takeover of Qualcomm by the Purchaser is prohibited, and any substantially equivalent merger, acquisition, or takeover, whether effected directly or indirectly, is also prohibited,\u201d said the presidential order, signed by Trump.
