Too many home loans had been extended to borrowers with no chance of ever repaying them. There was even a nickname for them \u2013 \u201cninja\u201d loans \u2013 for people with no income and no job or assets. Those risky loans were sliced up and bundled with less risky ones and sold off in parcels to banks around the world. The belief was that these collateralised securities offered high returns at minimal risk. The belief was that not all mortgage borrowers would default at the same time. That belief was wrong.</p>\n    <p>Lehman\u2019s fate was sealed when Alistair Darling, the then chancellor, refused to provide state guarantees for the bank\u2019s takeover by Barclays. Bob Diamond, who was then the head of Barclays\u2019 investment bank, had been trying to broker over the weekend of 13-14 September. Darling later recalled: \u201cI could not imagine standing up in the House of Commons on the Monday morning explaining that we had put the UK taxpayer in hock so that Barclays could buy Lehman. Half the Barclays board was relieved.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At 1am in New York on Monday 15 September the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers was declared.
