                "body":"<p>The IPPR commission on economic justice sets out a 10-point plan to improve the British economy and make it fairer for its participants. The policy proposals include reviving trade unions in workplaces and raising the minimum wage. Here is a summary of the recommendations.</p> <h2>Reshaping the economy</h2> <p>The report calls for an activist government with an expanded industrial strategy, focused on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/16/government-recession-lord-myners\">spurring economic growth through investment</a> in infrastructure such as transport links. The expectation is that this will improve Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial base, drive up exports, raise productivity (the amount of economic output generated per hour worked) and address the regional imbalances in the UK economy.</p> <p>The commission also proposes an industrial strategy act to set out clear goals and criteria for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/11/keynesian-economics-is-it-time-for-the-theory-to-rise-from-the-dead\">state support for industry</a>, and create an independent industrial strategy committee to provide oversight and guidance. A national investment bank would invest in infrastructure and innovation, and over time should become the main mechanism through which government spends on industrial strategy.</p> <h2>Securing good pay and good jobs</h2> <p>The commission calls for an immediate increase of around \u00c2\u00a31 an hour in the government-mandated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/13/how-much-is-an-hour-worth-the-war-over-the-minimum-wage\">minimum wage</a>, which stands at \u00c2\u00a37.83 per hour for over-25s, in order to bring it up to the levels of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd living wage. This is a voluntary measure adopted by companies including consumer goods firm Unilever, which is set at \u00c2\u00a38.75 an hour outside London and \u00c2\u00a310.20 an hour in the capital.</p> <p>The role of trade unions is flagged by the commission. It says collective bargaining \u00e2\u20ac\u201c union-led pay negotiations carried out on behalf of a workforce \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is a route to higher productivity.

                "bodyText":"The IPPR commission on economic justice sets out a 10-point plan to improve the British economy and make it fairer for its participants. The policy proposals include reviving trade unions in workplaces and raising the minimum wage. Here is a summary of the recommendations. Reshaping the economy The report calls for an activist government with an expanded industrial strategy, focused on spurring economic growth through investment in infrastructure such as transport links. The expectation is that this will improve Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial base, drive up exports, raise productivity (the amount of economic output generated per hour worked) and address the regional imbalances in the UK economy. The commission also proposes an industrial strategy act to set out clear goals and criteria for state support for industry, and create an independent industrial strategy committee to provide oversight and guidance. A national investment bank would invest in infrastructure and innovation, and over time should become the main mechanism through which government spends on industrial strategy. Securing good pay and good jobs The commission calls for an immediate increase of around \u00c2\u00a31 an hour in the government-mandated minimum wage, which stands at \u00c2\u00a37.83 per hour for over-25s, in order to bring it up to the levels of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd living wage. This is a voluntary measure adopted by companies including consumer goods firm Unilever, which is set at \u00c2\u00a38.75 an hour outside London and \u00c2\u00a310.20 an hour in the capital. The role of trade unions is flagged by the commission. It says collective bargaining \u00e2\u20ac\u201c union-led pay negotiations carried out on behalf of a workforce \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is a route to higher productivity. Ministers should adopt a target of doubling the amount of collective bargaining in the UK economy to 50% of workers by 2030, with a focus on the lowest paid sectors. Improving the private sector The report calls for company directors to be given duties that go wider than just addressing the interests of shareholders. The commission believes that investors extract more cash from UK businesses than they put in through dividends and share buyback programmes, which holds back investment and improvements in productivity. The inclusion of workers on company boards and remuneration committees, a proposal that has gathered momentum in recent years, also features. Promoting competition and protecting consumers The remit of the competition watchdog, the CMA, should be broadened to include a focus on protecting the public from companies that become too powerful, alongside existing commitments to promote consumer welfare. To arrest the growing power of Google, Facebook and other internet platforms, there should be a new regulator, the office of digital platforms, which will give the public greater access to their own data. Increasing public investment Public investment spending in areas such as broadband should be increased by at least \u00c2\u00a315bn over and above the latest government forecasts to 3.5% of GDP. This is the average level for economies in the G7 between 1997 and 2017. The commission calls for a revised remit for the Bank of England that ties interest rates to the level of unemployment and economic growth, as well as inflation. Strengthening the financial system There should be a clampdown on borrowing by financial institutions to limit the damage to the City in a crisis, the commission says, adding that the government must go further in tackling tax avoidance and stopping illicit money flowing into Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system. The commission addresses the role of housing in banking speculation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a key cause of the 2008 crash \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by calling for UK regulators to set a house price inflation target, which would enable the Bank of England to regulate property lending more closely. Tackling wealth inequality Sovereign wealth funds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c state owned investment firms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are a feature of many emerging market economies such as China and Qatar, and developed ones such as Norway and New Zealand. The commission suggests setting up a sovereign wealth fund with the sale of Royal Bank of Scotland shares and gains from wealth taxes that could be worth \u00c2\u00a3186bn in next 10 years. The fund would use its proceeds to pay 25-year-olds a lump sum of \u00c2\u00a310,000 as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153universal minimum inheritance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. To build more homes, the government should allow local authorities to buy land prior to giving planning permission. This would reduce property speculation and allow councils to prioritise affordable homes. Fair and simple taxes Work and wealth should be taxed on the same basis with a new, single, income tax schedule for all types of income. This would mean the abolition of capital gains tax and dividend tax. It would tax the gains from wealth more heavily, the commission claims. Replace business rates, which are levied on properties like shops, with a new land value tax. This would be a fairer tax than business rates, the report states. It would also force landowners to register and value their land, making ownership more transparent. Environmental sustainability The commission makes the case for legislation to limit the environmental damage caused by individual industries. The law would require industries to set long-term plans to reduce pollutants and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Expanding on the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clean growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd plan and the Climate Change Act, ministers would adopt a green industrial strategy to promote reducing carbon dioxide, increasing use of recycled materials and conserving natural habitats. Devolution The commission backs a new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic constitution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the UK, devolving more economic powers to the nations and regions through new economic zones for the north, midlands, south-west, and south-east of England. It also calls for a \u00c2\u00a310bn state fund to help narrow the gap between the regions over a five year period. This would replace the \u00c2\u00a310.9bn due to be spent by the European Union on regional British development between 2014 and 2020.",

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest piece on the US-China trade dispute: The ISM report also shows that the US-China trade spat is pushing up costs for companies. One executive at a construction firm warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tariff-related cost increases are beginning to accelerate, whether tariffs have been put into effect or not.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Another business leader, though, is expecting a record-breaking month: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Based on current trends on customer quote requests and conversions to orders, we are trending for this month to be the best August in the history of our company.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector grew strongly last month, according to the latest PMI report from the Institute of Supply Management. The ISM Services index jumped to 58.5 for August, up from 55.7 in July, signalling faster growth. Companies reported a pick-up in new orders (including exports) and overall activity, suggesting the US economy remains in decent fettle. Wall Street has opened cautiously, with the Dow Jones gaining 72 points or 0.3%. Facebook and Twitter are lagging, though, as the fallout from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Congress investigation into social media, and foreign interference in elections. Trade war and emerging market jitters are weighing on the City today. The FTSE 100 is down 10 points, or 0.1%, having closed at a four-month low yesterday. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s despite energy firms rallying. Centrica is up 5.3%, after the government outlined plans to cap bills. The plan will save households around \u00c2\u00a375 each -- good news, but not as much as PM Theresa May had promised... Some better jobs news just arrived: the number of Americans signing on for unemployment benefit hit its lowest level in almost 50 years! Initial claims for jobless benefits dropped by 10,000 last week to 203,000, the smallest number since December 1969. It extends a long run of decent US employment data, which hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been derailed by the trade wars (yet, anyway). Newsflash: American companies created fewer jobs in August than in July, and less than expected. US payroll operator ADP has reported that 163,000 private sector jobs were created last month, down from 217,000 in July. Economists had expected a figure close to 190,000. It may be a sign that Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs report (the non-farm payroll) will miss expectations. Some lunchtime reading: Joseph Stiglitz on how policymakers have failed to make the right decisions since the financial crisis a decade ago: China has warned that it will retaliate if America imposes fresh tariffs on its goods. Economic ministry spokesman Gao Feng told reporters in Beijing today that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the United States, regardless of opposition, adopts any new tariff measures, China will be forced to roll out necessary retaliatory measures.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in July, the US outlined plans for tariffs on $200bn of Chinese exports (on top of the existing $50bn of tariffs). That includes literally thousands of products; machinery, IT, aerospace parts, paper, leather, chemicals, furniture, meat and fish are all on the list. The consultation period on that plan ends today, meaning Donald Trump could sign them off imminently. In August, China outlined plans for retaliatory tariffs on $60bn of goods if Trump does indeed press the button. This would see levies imposed on over 5,000 items imported from the US, including aircraft, soya bean oil, smoked beef, coffee and flour. China only imported around $129bn of goods from America last year, while exporting around $500bn. That means Beijing can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t match Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $200bn threat in full. The Economist Intelligence Unit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global economist, John Ferguson, believes emerging market tensions will continue to build over the next couple of years. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on the EM situation: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most emerging-market economies should be able to weather this pace of economic tightening, provided that their trading conditions remain favourable. However, investors are on the alert for financial, economic or political weaknesses.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The turbulence experienced by Argentina and Turkey in mid-2018 is a reminder of how difficult it can be for policymakers to regain market confidence where external imbalances are large and macroeconomic policy frameworks are fragile.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For now, a full-blown emerging-market crisis should be averted, but we expect the number of countries seeing their currencies come under pressure to rise over the next two years. It is likely that we will see periods of volatility as the global trade dispute interacts with the shift away from easy money.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After days of losses, some emerging economy currencies are struggling off the mat. The Argentina peso has gained 1.2% today, having hit a record low earlier this week. The South African rand has gained almost 0.5%, and the Mexican peso is 0.35% higher. Some relief, and perhaps a sign that the recent selloff is bottoming out? Kathleen Brooks of Capital Index argues that the recent rout has been \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcindiscriminate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. She thinks traders have been too quick to ditch emerging market assets. After all, EM isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only part of the economy with economic and political problems. The fundamentals didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t add up: we would firstly like to add a caveat that some EM assets are at risk from political and economic pressures (read Turkey), however justifying the ZAR [South African rand] sell off when SA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit is lower than the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right now isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a good investment decision. Also, political risk is not just the preserve of the emerging market space, take a read of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s New York Times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 anonymous op-ed from a Trump cabinet member and you will see how close the US is to a constitutional crisis. The EM selloff has pulled world stock markets down for the fifth day in a row. The losses in Asia overnight, followed by the early dip in Europe, pulled the MSCI All-Country World Index down by another 0.2%. The drop in German factory orders added to concerns that trade war rhetoric, and tariffs, is causing economic harm. Economists are also concerned that the problems in certain emerging market economies are now spreading across the sector, and beyond. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says: As global monetary conditions slowly tighten, the global economic cycle rolls over and the US President disturbs the global trade cycle, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely more to the emerging markets sell-off than a few unrelated spots of weakness. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, agrees that contagion risks can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be ignored. Crashes in the Argentine Peso and Turkish Lira were first believed to be idiosyncratic risks that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lead to any spillover. But now it looks like the concern over contagion risks are spreading to all asset classes. EM equities entered into a bear market, falling 20% from their January peak. The Indonesian Rupee, Indian Rupee, South African Rand, and several other EM currencies are either trading at record or multi-year lows. Investors who have been on the sidelines may think of the selloff as a good opportunity to start accumulating some oversold EM assets. However, the prospects of more U.S. interest rate hikes, and continuing global trade tensions make it difficult to jump in. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial belt has taken another hit from the US-China trade war: German industrial orders shank by 0.9% in July, new figures show, driven by a drop in overseas demand. Economists had expected a rise of 1.8%, following a 3.9% slump in June. But instead, manufacturers reported another decline: Although domestic orders rose, German factories suffered from weaker business overseas, as Destatis explains: Domestic orders increased by 2.4% and foreign orders decreased by 3.4% in July 2018 on the previous month. New orders from the euro area were down 2.7%, new orders from other countries decreased 4.0% compared to June 2018. European stock markets have hit a five-month low this morning. The emerging markets rout, and fears of an escalating trade war, drove the Stoxx 600 index down to its lowest since early April. In London the FTSE 100 dipped to a new four-month low in early trading, at 7,357. Newsflash: The Indian rupee has dropped to an all-time low, as the emerging market currency selloff continues. The rupee fell to 72.095 against the US dollar, breaching the 72-mark for the first time. Last night, the Financial Times calculated that emerging markets are now officially in a bear market -- defined as falling 20% from their recent high. Capital Economics fears that the emerging market rout has further to run: We think that the US Federal Reserve will press ahead with its tightening cycle, and worries about contagion from the crisis in Turkey may linger. At the same time, we expect China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy to slow further, and are not anticipating a ceasefire in the US-China trade war any time soon. This snapshot of the markets, from Bloomberg TV, shows how stock markets have lost ground (first column). The second column shows currencies dropping against the US dollar. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff has wiped more than 1% off the main Chinese stock index, the CSI 300. Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng is down almost 1.5%. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market has lost 1.1%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest one-day loss since March, taking the index to a two-month low. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a worrying time in the financial markets, as emerging economies across the globe come under pressure. Emerging market stocks have fallen steadily for several days, hit by worries over global growth prospects, the strength of the US dollar, and the various trade disputes being driven by the White House this year. Markets were a sea of red yesterday, with notable losses in China, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, as traders scurried for safer assets. There are fresh losses in Asia today, dragging stocks in the region towards a one-year low (more on that shortly). The dollar is currently at its highest level in over a year against a basket of emerging markets currencies, with some at a record lows. That makes it tougher to service foreign debts, and drives up inflation. This forces policymakers to consider steep interest rate rises that will throttle growth. With Argentina signing up for an IMF bailout, Turkey fighting a currency crisis, and Brazil gripped by a corruption scandal, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty to worry the City right now. Another concern: Donald Trump could deepen the trade war with China, by signing off tariffs on an extra $200bn of imports. An announcement could come today. Such an escalation could cause further harm to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, with ripple effects hurting other companies in the global supply chain too. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another reason emerging markets are feeling the strain today. As Christophe Barraud, an economist at the Paris-based brokerage Market Securities, put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are looking closely at what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening in emerging markets, at the trade war and the fact that the United States is likely to implement another wave of tariffs against China. If you look at global growth, more and more signs are that it will slow in coming months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European markets are expected to dip this morning, after the FTSE 100 hit a four-month low yesterday. This follows losses on Wall Street last night, led by the technology sector, after Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jack Dorsey were grilled at Congress. The session has raised speculation that social media could face tougher regulation, to crack down on fake news, harassment and interference by rogue states. As Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: Calls for a negative open come courtesy of downbeat trading on Wall Street, with the Tech sector sharply lower following testimony from Twitter and Facebook to US Congress. The turmoil within emerging markets also continues, widening from Argentina and Turkey, dampening global sentiment even further all the while we await the US decision on additional China import tariffs.

                "bodyText":"European stock markets are still trading higher, while Asian shares saw losses overnight, dragged down by trade tensions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in particular Chinese stock markets. Beijing reiterated at a regular news briefing that it would retaliate if the US imposed new tariffs. A barrage of better-than-expected data showed the UK was in better shape than thought over the summer. GDP growth accelerated to 0.6% in the three months to July from 0.4% in the three months to June, with retail sales and construction strong while industrial production declined. Economists cautiously welcomed the pick-up but voiced some concerns over the outlook once the World Cup and heatwave effects fade and we get closer to Brexit. With this, we are closing the blog for the day. Thank you for all your comments. We will be back tomorrow. Sterling has edged higher today following the better-than-expected GDP numbers, although the data were overshadowed by fresh worries over Brexit. The pound has gained 0.2% to $1.2946 after hitting a session high of $1.2954. Last week it tumbled 0.3% against the dollar, its biggest weekly drop in a month. Against the euro, sterling is now flat at 89.43 pence. The struggling department chain Debenhams has issued a statement insisting it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go bust - after its share price plummeted 17% this morning, hit by rumours that it was considering mass store closures. It emerged at the weekend that the firm has called in restructuring specialists KPMG to assess its options, including a company voluntary arrangement that would enable it to shut stores and renegotiate rents. The shares are now down 11% at 11.4p. The company said it expects to report pretax profits of \u00c2\u00a333m this year, within the market range of \u00c2\u00a331m to \u00c2\u00a336.5m, excluding one-off costs. It said it had strengthened its financial position to ensure \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maximum flexibility amidst volatile market trading conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The early weeks of the new season have shown more positive trends and any sustained upturn would result in a rebound in our profit performance.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sergio Bucher, the chief executive, said: The market environment remains challenging and underlying trends deteriorated through the summer months. Nevertheless the product and format improvements we have tested are gaining traction and we are ready to scale up some of our strategic activity ahead of peak. Having put in place a leaner operational structure and strong leadership team, and taken action to strengthen our financial position, we are well equipped to navigate these market conditions and take advantage of any trading opportunities that emerge. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a helpful comment from one of our readers on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news that the UK economy grew 0.6% between May and July, boosted by the World Cup and the heatwave. European stock markets are trading higher after their weak start to the week. There is some relief over the Italian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. Investors are increasingly optimistic that the budget will respect EU fiscal rules \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this is lifting banking stocks across Europe. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB has jumped 2.3% and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex has risen 1.2%. The FTSE 100 in London is up 0.36%, with Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group amid the biggest risers. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 0.4% ahead and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC has gained 0.5%. Muhammet Mercan, Turkey economist at ING, said: Strong growth in the first half of this year is attributable to fiscal measures introduced by the government to support private consumption and investment, with increasing capital spending. Given that increased financial volatility is weighing on sentiment, the likely difficulties in external financing, an ongoing uptrend in inflation and already sharp monetary tightening since early 2018 with likely further steps, a strong underperformance in growth could well be seen in the second half, likely turning to negative on a sequential basis. Back to the Turkish economy, whose growth slowed to a 5.2% annualised rate in the second quarter, from 7.4%. The breakdown shows the agricultural sector shrank 1.5% year-on-year, while industry grew 4.3%, construction expanded 0.8% services powered 8% ahead. The Turkish economy is expected to grow 3.3% this year, according to a Reuters poll, below a 5.5% government target. Rabobank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emerging markets foreign exchange strategist Piotr Matys said: The Turkish economy is widely expected to lose even more momentum in the coming quarters as a result of significant lira depreciation. The lira has lost two-fifths of its value against the dollar this year, amid concerns that the Turkish central bank lacks independence and a diplomatic row with the US. The central bank meets on Thursday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c investors expect it to raise interest rates but the size of any hike will be crucial. Rates were left on hold at July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, wrongfooting analysts and investors. Data last week showed inflation hit 17.9% in August, the highest rate since late 2003. Here is our full story: PricewaterhouseCoopers have sent us their thoughts on UK GDP. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says: The UK economy continued to pick up momentum, growing by 0.6% in the three months to July. This was the fastest quarterly growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2016 and supports the decision of the Bank of England to raise interest rates in August. The hot summer and the World Cup boosted retail spending in June and July, and latest business surveys suggest that positive services sector growth continued in August. But manufacturing output growth has weakened. Looking ahead, however, the long hot summer could give way to a stormy autumn as Brexit-related uncertainty leads businesses to defer major investment decisions and subdued real wage growth weighs on consumer spending. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade position also improved in July. The overall trade in goods deficit was the smallest since February, at \u00c2\u00a39.97bn, according to the ONS. The gap with the EU narrowed to \u00c2\u00a37.2bn, the lowest since April 2016, while the deficit with the rest of the world shrank to \u00c2\u00a32.8bn, the smallest since February. Exports rose 2% in July while imports fell 1%. The total trade deficit, including services, shrank to just \u00c2\u00a3100m in July from \u00c2\u00a3900m in June \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much better than expected. Michael Thirkettle, chief executive of construction consulting and design agency McBains, said the bounceback in construction, which was hit hard by the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beast from the East\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd during the winter, represented a much-needed boost to confidence in the sector. But he cautioned: Underlying growth remains fragile however, and the real test will be if this can be sustained in the months to come, given the uncertainty over issues like Brexit that have impacted on UK companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 commitment to new projects over the last two years. In particular, separate figures published by the ONS recently show the lowest level of net migration from the EU since 2012, which has again raised concerns as to how construction will cope with a reduction of a skilled labour supply from the EU post-Brexit. If sustained growth is to be realised, then the industry will need the workforce with the right skills, but this is far from clear at present. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation, says: While not quite in rude health, the economy does look to have been on the up over the summer with consumers spurred on by some good weather and modest increases in real wages. Export demand also looks to have been a bit more supportive, consistent with some of the survey evidence over the summer. It is still unclear that there is enough momentum here to counteract what feels like a rising tide of uncertainty about Brexit and global trade policy concerns.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Construction output rose 0.5% in July, the biggest rise since last December, while manufacturing fell 0.2%, worse than expected. This was largely due to a decline in pharmaceuticals, which can be volatile, the ONS cautioned. Overall production, which also includes utilities, mining and quarrying, edged up 0.1%. The statistics office\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of GDP Rob Kent-Smith said: Growth in the economy picked up in the three months to July. Services grew particularly strongly, with retail sales performing well, boosted by warm weather and the World Cup. The construction sector also bounced back after a weak start to the year. However, production fell back, with manufacturing again slipping a little while energy generation and supply fell due to reduced demand. The dominant service sector again led economic growth in the month of July with engineers, accountants and lawyers all enjoying a busy period, backed up by growth in construction, which hit another record high level. The biggest contributor to growth was the services sector, which expanded 0.6% in the three months to July, while retail trade grew by 2.1%. The Office for National Statistics highlighted the good weather between May and July, citing Met Office data that this summer was the joint hottest summer in the UK since records began. Construction output jumped 3.3%, largely driven by repair and maintenance work. The production sector, however, weighed on growth, with a 0.5% decline. The UK figures are out. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew 0.6% in the three months to July, the fastest pace in almost a year and up from 0.4% in the three months to June. It was boosted by the World Cup and the heatwave, which encouraged many people to go out and spend more at pubs and restaurants. In July alone, GDP rose 0.3% compared with June. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign ministry has reiterated that Beijing will respond if the US announces new tariffs on Chinese goods. On Friday, Donald Trump said he was ready to impose duties on pretty much all Chinese imports into the US. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular briefing: If the US said obstinately clings to its course and takes any new tariff measures against China, then the Chinese side will inevitably take countermeasures to resolutely protect our legitimate rights. The US and China imposed tariffs on $50bn of each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goods in early July after trade talks broke down. Trump then threatened tariffs on a further $200bn of Chinese goods, whereupon China unveiled a proposed list of retaliatory tariffs on $60bn of US goods in August. On Friday, Trump talked about another package of duties on $267bn of goods, escalating the trade war. This would include mobile phones, the biggest US import from China, for the first time. The $200bn list includes a broad range of consumer products such as cameras, luggage and vacuum cleaners, along with meat and fish, many metals and commodities. The existing and threatened tariffs cover $517bn of Chinese goods \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which would exceed last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imports of $505bn from China. Last week, Apple warned that products made in China, including the Apple Watch and Air Pods headphones, would cost more if Trump went ahead with the first tariff package. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, has sent us his thoughts on Debenhams: A CVA is being talked about, but given the weakness in the share price and the recent acquisition of House of Fraser, we must consider the possibility that Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sports Direct \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which has a near 30% stake in Debenhams - will swoop. The rationale for combining the two to create the House of Debenhams is compelling enough. As previously noted, combining the two businesses, reducing overheads and at a stroke removing a key leg of competition, seems like the only viable solution for the two ailing department stores. The fact is the market is screaming for restructuring and consolidation looks a sensible route to take given the well documented structural pressures on the sector. Primark, owned by Associated British Foods, expects to post a 6% rise in sales in the year to 15 September, helped by favourable exchange rates and new store openings. But sales melted away during the summer heatwave in northern Europe, with like-for-like sales down 2%. In the UK, full-year sales are also expected to be 6% ahead while like-for-like growth is set to be 1.5%. Primark said it had ramped up its share of the clothing market. Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb says: Primark is slightly more subdued than the last update in early July, with overall LFL sales 2% down, but ABF call out the outperformance of the core UK operation. Primark was held back by sales in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Northern Europe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but the operating profit margin recovered well in the second half. In terms of new store expansion, the much-vaunted US operation continues to edge forward (with 9 stores now open), but the highlight is that the new UK site in the old Birmingham Pavilions centre will, at 160,000 sq ft, become the largest store in the whole Primark estate. Aston Martin, the luxury car brand favoured by James Bond, has strengthened its board with several experienced FTSE executives ahead of its planned stock market flotation. Its board will be chaired by former Royal Bank of Scotland director Penny Hughes. Richard Solomons, who ran InterContinental Hotels until last year, will serve as a senior independent director and chair the audit and risk committee. Imelda Walsh, the former HR director of Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s who chairs the remuneration committee at transport firm FirstGroup; the former Deutsche Bank and Deloitte director Peter Espenhahn; and Lord Carrington, a director of the Arab British Chambers of Commerce, will also join the Aston Martin board as non-executive directors. The carmaker said it would release further details on the float, such as the indicative price range and the maximum number of shares to be sold, around 20 September. Turning to company news, Debenhams shares have plunged 17% this morning, to 10p. The department store chain called in administrators KPMG over the weekend to assess its options, including a company voluntary arrangement. This \u00e2\u20ac\u201c also used by other retailers recently \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would allow it to close stores and to renegotiate rents at others. The Turkish economy is expected to slow further in the second half, as the country battles with the fallout from its currency crisis. The lira has plummeted, partly due to concerns over president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s influence over monetary policy. Economists say the central bank should raise interest rates to rein in inflation, but Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has resisted this. The central bank meets on Thursday. The Turkish GDP figures are out. The economy grew at an annualised rate of 5.2% in the second quarter, down from 7.4% in the first quarter, but in line with economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations. The dollar is rising again amid mounting trade tensions, and the Swedish krona is also up following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. The dollar index, which measures the US currency against a basket of six currencies, is 0.13% higher. The Swedish krona rose 0.6% against the euro following the election. Jon Henley reports from Stockholm: Sweden faces a protracted period of political uncertainty after an election that left the two main parliamentary blocs tied but well short of a majority, and the far-right Sweden Democrats promising to wield \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real influence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in parliament despite making more modest gains than many had predicted. The populist, anti-immigrant party won 17.6% of the vote, according to preliminary official results \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well up on the 12.9% it scored in 2014, but far below the 25%-plus some polls had predicted earlier in the summer. It looked highly likely, however, to play a significant role as kingmaker. European stock markets have opened slightly lower. FTSE 100 in London down 0.1% Dax in Frankfurt down 0.09% CAC in Paris down 0.05% Ibex in Madrid up 0.08% David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says in his morning note: The trade numbers from Beijing are likely to have struck a nerve with Mr Trump, and given that he thinks the US are winning the trade spat on account of the recent weakness in the Chinese stock market, he is likely to stick to his protectionist line. Beijing said they would retaliate should the US impose fresh tariffs, and traders are fearful they might weaken the yuan or target US firms operating in China. Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, warned President Trump that if he continues down the route of protectionism, it could hurt the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits. The tech sector has been the standout performer of the US market this year, but it has come under pressure recently on account of the update last week from Washington DC that tighter regulation would be required for the industry, and in particular social media stocks like Facebook and Twitter. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Tensions between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two biggest economies over trade have deepened further, after China revealed a record trade surplus with the US on Saturday. Customs data showed it jumped to $31.05bn in August from $28.09bn in July, while overall export growth slowed to the slowest pace since March. Donald Trump is yet to activate the threatened fresh tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods imported to the US, but on Friday suggested duties on a further $267bn could be imposed. Hours before his threats, China announced measures to support some of the exporters affected by higher duties. Beijing has warned that it will retaliate, but has limited room to do so. Analysts at JPMorgan said: The overall sense is that the United States will continue to escalate the pressure until China submits to US demands which does not seem likely any time soon. Overall, the impact of tariffs and high levels of uncertainty will both continue to weigh on markets into the end of the year. Asian stocks started the week in the red, falling for the eighth trading day in a row. Chinese stocks were among the biggest losers, with the blue-chip CSI 300 index falling 1.2% and Shanghai\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Composite shedding nearly 1%. Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng lost 1.1%. European shares are set for a mixed open. A barrage of figures, all out at 9.30am BST, will shed some light on the health of the UK economy: monthly GDP for July, along with trade, manufacturing and industrial production and construction. Tomorrow we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get the latest labour market data. It is also a big data week for the US. And on Thursday, the Bank of England, European Central Bank and the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey hold their monthly meetings.

Too many home loans had been extended to borrowers with no chance of ever repaying them.

Those risky loans were sliced up and bundled with less risky ones and sold off in parcels to banks around the world.

That belief was wrong.</p>\n    <p>Lehman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fate was sealed when Alistair Darling, the then chancellor, refused to provide state guarantees for the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover by Barclays. Bob Diamond, who was then the head of Barclays\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 investment bank, had been trying to broker over the weekend of 13-14 September. Darling later recalled: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I could not imagine standing up in the House of Commons on the Monday morning explaining that we had put the UK taxpayer in hock so that Barclays could buy Lehman. Half the Barclays board was relieved.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At 1am in New York on Monday 15 September the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers was declared.

The 10-year gilt yield, which is a proxy for the interest rate paid on government bonds, fell from 4.5% before the collapse of Lehman to around 3% in the aftermath, then fell back to below 2% during the eurozone debt crisis, then to a little over 0.5% after the Brexit vote.</p> \n<p>Pension liabilities, which are the long-term costs faced by a retirement plan, rise as gilt yields fall.

The 10-year gilt yield, which is a proxy for the interest rate paid on government bonds, fell from 4.5% before the collapse of Lehman to around 3% in the aftermath, then fell back to below 2% during the eurozone debt crisis, then to a little over 0.5% after the Brexit vote. Pension liabilities, which are the long-term costs faced by a retirement plan, rise as gilt yields fall. So while lower interest payments on government debt is good for the Treasury, pension funds found their deficits widening. The 10-year gilt is now 1.49%. House prices Like share prices, house prices dipped following the crash only to recover in most parts of the country \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and spectacularly in London. In September 2007 the average UK house price was \u00c2\u00a3190,032. By March 2009 it was \u00c2\u00a3154,452, according to ONS/HM Land Resistry data. The average house price is now \u00c2\u00a3228,384. The strongest growth has been in the capital, the east and the south-east of England. Prices in Northern Ireland and the north-east are still below September 2007 levels. A lost decade for savers Huge sums have poured into savings accounts since the crash. Unfortunately the low interest rates adopted to help the economy mean the average interest paid on deposit accounts has slumped from 3.1% in 2008 to 0.43%, according to Bank of England figures. Many accounts pay no interest at all and the sums in these has swollen from \u00c2\u00a348bn in September 2008 to \u00c2\u00a3164bn today. A sum of \u00c2\u00a310,000 held on deposit for the last 10 years would now be worth \u00c2\u00a310,852 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or \u00c2\u00a38,790 when inflation is taken into account.

Charlotte Kerr\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post on Facebook is typical: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been nearly a month and I still haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heard anything, my emails are being ignored and my credit card company has told me that I have to keep pursuing a refund from HoF. Not sure how I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m supposed to do that when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re ignoring all attempts to contact them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The promise of refunds came the day after House of Fraser shut down its website amid a dispute over payment between Sports Direct and XPO, the company that delivered online orders. The website was expected to reopen this week after a deal was agreed with XPO, but was still closed on Thursday afternoon. Shoppers who have tried to return faulty goods have found them returned by Royal Mail after House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warehouse refused to accept them. Holders of the House of Fraser gift cards who were told to send them to a Glasgow office are still waiting to hear whether they will be replaced, as previously suggested. Sports Direct has no legal obligation to refund orders made before House of Fraser went into administration. EY said there was little prospect of customers awaiting goods receiving any money back from the administration process. A spokeswoman said it could be a few pence for each pound spent, if that, and any payments would take at least 12 months. She suggested affected customers should be claiming from their card or payment providers first. The Guardian has repeatedly asked House of Fraser to clarify its position on refunds, but the retailer has declined to respond. Steve Nowottny, of MoneySavingExpert, said House of Fraser customers had been left in limbo. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s often confusion in this sort of situation, communication to House of Fraser customers has been particularly poor, with many unanswered questions over online orders, gift cards and return rights,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nowottny said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153House of Fraser needs to act straight away to ensure that customers who have been left sometimes hundreds of pounds out of pocket are refunded immediately.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Last week one customer who had ordered an undelivered sofa entered the Darlington store with friends and removed the sofa she had bought. Staff called the police, who pulled over her van as she drove home, but officers let her continue when she showed them the receipt.",

Those initiatives range from gender pay gap and diversity initiatives to corporate governance reforms; from efforts to increase lobbying transparency to prohibitions on doing business with companies tied to genocide and other human rights violations.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in the months before Just fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s launch, Goldman was <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2018/harringtoninvestments031218-14a8.pdf\">slammed</a> for blocking a human rights resolution at its own company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and one of Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key lobbying groups in Washington was <a href=\"https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=529E9269-FC6B-4457-B821-E9A91D030A34&amp;filingTypeID=60\">working</a> to shape Republican legislation that would make it far more difficult for shareholders to file environmental, human rights and other socially minded initiatives in the future.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153You shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to, with a straight face, invest in the <a href=\"https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/news/who's-banking-dakota-access-pipeline\">Dakota Access Pipeline</a> with your left hand, and with your right hand tell people that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing responsible investing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lisa Lindsley, capital markets adviser for the shareholder advocacy group SumOfUs, told Capital &amp; Main. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The compartmentalization is very hypocritical.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Through a spokesperson, Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the process by which its equity funds vote on shareholder proposals, and how that process may differ with the Just fund \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which, as a newly launched fund, has not yet participated in proxy voting for any of the companies in which it holds stock.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ccaecde975f4d9d6aa3bdddd20b0057a8c1aeb95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccaecde975f4d9d6aa3bdddd20b0057a8c1aeb95/0_0_747_637/500.png\" alt=\"JUST Graph\" width=\"500\" height=\"426\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">JUST Graph</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcEthically </strong><strong>motivated </strong><strong>versus a </strong><strong>more </strong><strong>greenwashing </strong><strong>approach</strong><strong>\u00e2\u20ac\u2122</strong></h2> <p>Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new fund spotlights socially responsible investing (SRI) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a financial strategy that represents Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more affirmative answer to negative or exclusionary \u00e2\u20ac\u0153screening\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tactics like divestment from fossil fuel producers and tobacco firms.</p> <p>While a recent <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/employers-and-advisers/guidance/field-assistance-bulletins/2018-01\">directive</a> by the Trump administration has been viewed by some <a href=\"https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=87ab35ca-a937-4f6a-a749-37cf8449b5ca\">experts</a> as an effort to limit SRI strategies, the market for such investments remains strong. According to the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, US-based assets managed using SRI strategies <a href=\"https://www.ussif.org/files/Trends/US%20SIF%202016%20Trends%20Overview.pdf\">more than doubled</a> to $8.7tn between 2012 and 2016, and now account for more than <a href=\"https://www.ussif.org/files/Infographics/Overview%20Infographic.pdf\">one in five</a> dollars under professional management in the country.</p> <p>The rise in SRI investment comes amid questions about whether corporate boards are adequately evaluating environmental and social justice concerns when they look at their company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term financial prospects. PwC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/governance-insights-center/annual-corporate-directors-survey/assets/pwc-2017-annual-corporate--directors--survey.pdf\">2017 survey</a> of corporate officials found \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that directors are clearly out of step with investor priorities in some critical areas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the report added that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of these areas is environmental issues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>High-profile initiatives like the Just fund are a chance for the industry to tout its eagerness, as the Goldman Sachs executive Timothy O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill put it in a <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180612005943/en/Goldman-Sachs-Asset-Management-Announces-Launch-Exchange-Traded\">press release</a>, to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[allow] investment to flow toward a more sustainable and equitable future, while seeking to generate attractive returns for investors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>The trend has given Wall Street an opportunity for an image makeover in a time of growing public distrust in the financial system: According to a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/14/fewer-than-half-of-young-americans-are-positive-about-capitalism.html\">Gallup poll</a> conducted last month, fewer than half of Americans under 30 report having a positive view of capitalism, a 12-point drop in just the past two years.</p> <p>For some activists and investors, though, the rapid expansion of the market for SRI-branded financial products has raised concerns about <a href=\"http://www.greenwashingindex.com/about-greenwashing/\">greenwashing</a> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the practice by which companies market themselves as socially or environmentally responsible without actually adopting business practices that meet those goals.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Putting the word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcethical\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsustainable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the name of a fund does not make it so,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a report by British investment advisory firm Castlefield, whose <a href=\"http://www.castlefield.com/media/1957/winners-and-spinners-report-2017-final.pdf\">recent</a> <a href=\"http://www.castlefield.com/news-media/company-news/winners-and-spinners-report-2015/\">reports</a> documented how some environmental funds include investments in fossil fuel firms. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is increasingly important to differentiate between those funds genuinely responding to customer demand for a sustainable approach and those which use terms like ethical, Socially Responsible Investment or stewardship in their name but include companies such as British American Tobacco or Shell in their key holdings.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <h2><strong>Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s </strong><strong>record on </strong><strong>socially </strong><strong>responsible </strong><strong>investing</strong></h2> <p>Amid surging interest in SRI funds, Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Just US Large Cap Equity ETF aims to convince investors that the company is serious about injecting a spirit of ethics and morality into its financial strategies. To that end, the fund says it directs money only into companies that are ranked highly by <a href=\"https://justcapital.com/\">Just</a><a href=\"https://justcapital.com/\"> Capital</a>.</p> <p>The 426 companies featured in the Just index were selected on the basis of their performance across seven different criteria, including labor practices, customer service and environmental impacts. Goldman itself ranks in the top tenth of the Just rankings, despite the company being <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/global-fossil-fuels-banks-report_us_5aba989fe4b04a59a3122636\">attacked</a> for supporting the fossil fuel industry and also being <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/goldman-sachs-agrees-pay-more-5-billion-connection-its-sale-residential-mortgage-backed\">fined</a> $5bn in 2016 by the Department of Justice for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages, when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>Whether Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Just fund represents a step in a larger shift towards socially responsible investment remains to be seen. Baruch College\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jared Peifer says that one way to judge a firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to social responsibility is to watch how it deals with resolutions brought by shareholders, whereby investors attempt to force management to adopt socially responsible policies.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is variance to the degree that SRI funds are ethically motivated versus a more greenwashing approach,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Peifer said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is the fund dialoguing with management? Issuing shareholder proxy votes, voting on others? If so, that seems like a more ethically motivated fund to me, because they are exerting additional effort many other funds do not bother with.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>In recent years, Goldman executives have been fighting off SRI resolutions at their own company, including initiatives that have asked management to more transparently disclose their <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/s/2018-proxy-statement/images/Goldman_Sach-Proxy2018.pdf\">political lobbying</a> and create a <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-relations/financials/archived/proxy-statements/docs/2013-proxy-statement-pdf.pdf\">human rights committee</a> to review the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies regarding doing business with governments engaged in censorship and repression. Only three months before Goldman announced the Just fund, Goldman successfully <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2018/harringtoninvestments031218-14a8.pdf\">pressed</a> the Securities and Exchange Commission to bless its move to block shareholders from voting on a resolution asking the company to honor indigenous peoples\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extraordinary no action request shows the notable lengths that the company is willing to go, and to stretch credulity, in order to prevent its directors from shouldering fiduciary obligations on indigenous and human rights,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wrote shareholder proponents at the time.</p> <p>Last year, Goldman was lauded by <a href=\"https://shareaction.org/warming-up-to-climate-resolutions/\">Share Action</a>, an SRI activist group, for switching its position and using its holdings to support a series of climate-change-related shareholder initiatives. In its <a href=\"https://www.gsam.com/content/dam/gsam/pdfs/us/en/miscellaneous/voting_proxy_policy.pdf?sa=n&amp;rd=n\">proxy voting guidelines</a>, Goldman says it will generally vote for proposals asking companies to report on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153policies, initiatives and oversight mechanisms related to environmental sustainability, or how the company may be impacted by climate change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>However, those guidelines do not make the same commitment when it comes to initiatives requiring companies to actually reduce their carbon emissions. The guidelines also say the company will generally vote against \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proposals requesting increased disclosure of a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies with respect to political contributions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The company further says it will vote to remove representatives of employees or organized labor from a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board if they are overseeing company audits or executive compensation, and if there is no legal requirement for them to be in that position.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eb8e34e46eb40f84b582a75761928e2ba31e4b44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb8e34e46eb40f84b582a75761928e2ba31e4b44/0_0_1359_1600/849.jpg\" alt=\"JUST Table\" width=\"849\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">JUST Table</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Goldman </strong><strong>votes </strong><strong>against </strong><strong>resolutions at Just</strong><strong> </strong><strong>fund </strong><strong>companies</strong></h2> <p>Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hostility toward many SRI initiatives is illustrated by its votes on resolutions at the companies now in its Just fund.</p> <p>For example, there is Chevron Corporation, which ranks as the Just fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 17th-largest holding as it <a href=\"http://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/41323-In-SLAPP-Attack-Chevron-Trying-to-Intimidate-Citizens-Who-Challenged-Company-Over-Massive-Pollution-In-Amazon\">faces</a> <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/16448/chevrons-slapp-suit-against-ecuadorians-corporate-intimidation/\">accusations</a> that it is trying to intimidate environmentalists and avoid cleaning up pollution in the Amazon rainforest.</p> <p>In May, the oil giant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders were asked to vote on a slate of <a href=\"https://www.chevron.com/-/media/shared-media/documents/chevron-proxy-statement-2018.pdf\">seven proposals</a>, including a requirement for the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board to nominate a director with environmental experience; the preparation of a report on transitioning to a low-carbon business model; increased transparency relating to lobbying activities; and stronger prohibitions on Chevron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interests overseas from doing business with governments that are complicit in genocide or crimes against humanity.</p> <p>As shareholders in Chevron, 14 different Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) funds voted on these proposals. The majority of funds voted in support of just one, a request for the company to prepare a report on its efforts to minimize methane emissions. In every other case, the funds unanimously or overwhelmingly opposed the proposals.</p> <p>Proxy-voting records from dozens of shareholder meetings reviewed by Capital &amp; Main show a similar pattern. In rare cases, Goldman funds did vote in favor of some shareholder reforms, including the preparation of a report on the gender pay gap at Facebook and Google. At several pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie, Amgen and Eli Lilly, Goldman funds supported increased accountability for executives regarding high drug prices.</p> <p>Such votes, however, were few and far between. Of the 10 companies that make up the largest share of Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Just fund, eight considered shareholder-proposed reforms that were overwhelmingly opposed by Goldman-managed funds at their most recent annual meetings. The proposals included prohibitions on offshore tax avoidance schemes, increased transparency on lobbying activities and requirements that companies appoint an independent board chair \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a governance model that advocates say leads to more responsible corporate behavior. The remaining two companies, Microsoft and Visa, did not consider any shareholder proposals.</p> <p>At JPMorgan, the recipient of Just\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth-largest investment, Goldman funds voted unanimously against a requirement for the company to release a report on its investments in PetroChina, a firm that <a href=\"https://www.investorsagainstgenocide.org/\">activists accuse</a> of helping to fund crimes against humanity due to its ongoing business relationships with oppressive regimes in Syria and Sudan. Goldman made that move despite its own <a href=\"https://www.gsam.com/content/dam/gsam/pdfs/us/en/miscellaneous/voting_proxy_policy.pdf?sa=n&amp;rd=n\">proxy voting guidelines</a> saying the company would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153generally vote for proposals requesting a report on company or company supplier labor and/or human rights standards and policies, or on the impact of its operations on society\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>Eighteen of the 19 Goldman funds with shares in JPMorgan also voted against an effort to prohibit the accelerated vesting of awards for executives who enter government service, a practice often <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/120967/wall-street-pays-bankers-work-government-and-wants-it-secret\">criticized</a> for fueling the revolving door between Wall Street and financial regulators.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.investor.jnj.com/_document/2018-proxy-statement?id=00000162-2469-d298-ad7a-657f7bcf0000\">shareholder proposal</a> to the board of pharmaceutical manufacturer Johnson &amp; Johnson, expressing concern that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s compensation practices \u00e2\u20ac\u0153may insulate senior executives from legal risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd relating to the opioids crisis, recommended that opioid-related litigation costs be factored into executive pay.

                "bodyText":"When Goldman Sachs and billionaire Paul Tudor Jones announced a partnership three months ago to help socially conscious investors support \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just business behavior\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, they promised that their new index fund would generate solid returns for savers while directing their investment dollars towards truly humane companies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Capitalism should be a positive force for change,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jones in a press release announcing the fund, which is designed to track an index of socially responsible companies identified by his non-profit Just Capital. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Its future will be driven by a new definition of corporate success that is aligned with the values and priorities of the public.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The partnership comes as pension funds, university endowments and other institutional investors increasingly seek to put their financial weight behind ethical and sustainable corporate behavior. So far, the rebrand seems to be working: the Just fund debuted in June to rave reviews from the financial press and ended its first day of trading with over $250m in assets, making its launch one of the most successful in recent history. However, a Capital &amp; Main review of corporate documents shows that some of Just\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest investments are in fossil fuel firms that have been sued for suppressing global climate research, Wall Street behemoths fined for defrauding investors, a social media platform accused of helping rig elections and a tech industry giant criticized for paying its workers starvation wages. Moreover, proxy voting records reveal that even as Goldman Sachs now markets itself as a champion of social responsibility, the firm has been using its existing stakes in many Just fund companies to help CEOs block key environmental and social justice reforms proposed by their shareholders. Those initiatives range from gender pay gap and diversity initiatives to corporate governance reforms; from efforts to increase lobbying transparency to prohibitions on doing business with companies tied to genocide and other human rights violations. Meanwhile, in the months before Just fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s launch, Goldman was slammed for blocking a human rights resolution at its own company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and one of Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key lobbying groups in Washington was working to shape Republican legislation that would make it far more difficult for shareholders to file environmental, human rights and other socially minded initiatives in the future. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to, with a straight face, invest in the Dakota Access Pipeline with your left hand, and with your right hand tell people that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing responsible investing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lisa Lindsley, capital markets adviser for the shareholder advocacy group SumOfUs, told Capital &amp; Main. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The compartmentalization is very hypocritical.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Through a spokesperson, Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the process by which its equity funds vote on shareholder proposals, and how that process may differ with the Just fund \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which, as a newly launched fund, has not yet participated in proxy voting for any of the companies in which it holds stock. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcEthically motivated versus a more greenwashing approach\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new fund spotlights socially responsible investing (SRI) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a financial strategy that represents Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more affirmative answer to negative or exclusionary \u00e2\u20ac\u0153screening\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tactics like divestment from fossil fuel producers and tobacco firms. While a recent directive by the Trump administration has been viewed by some experts as an effort to limit SRI strategies, the market for such investments remains strong. According to the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, US-based assets managed using SRI strategies more than doubled to $8.7tn between 2012 and 2016, and now account for more than one in five dollars under professional management in the country. The rise in SRI investment comes amid questions about whether corporate boards are adequately evaluating environmental and social justice concerns when they look at their company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term financial prospects. PwC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2017 survey of corporate officials found \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that directors are clearly out of step with investor priorities in some critical areas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the report added that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of these areas is environmental issues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. High-profile initiatives like the Just fund are a chance for the industry to tout its eagerness, as the Goldman Sachs executive Timothy O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill put it in a press release, to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[allow] investment to flow toward a more sustainable and equitable future, while seeking to generate attractive returns for investors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The trend has given Wall Street an opportunity for an image makeover in a time of growing public distrust in the financial system: According to a Gallup poll conducted last month, fewer than half of Americans under 30 report having a positive view of capitalism, a 12-point drop in just the past two years. For some activists and investors, though, the rapid expansion of the market for SRI-branded financial products has raised concerns about greenwashing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the practice by which companies market themselves as socially or environmentally responsible without actually adopting business practices that meet those goals. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Putting the word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcethical\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsustainable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the name of a fund does not make it so,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a report by British investment advisory firm Castlefield, whose recent reports documented how some environmental funds include investments in fossil fuel firms. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is increasingly important to differentiate between those funds genuinely responding to customer demand for a sustainable approach and those which use terms like ethical, Socially Responsible Investment or stewardship in their name but include companies such as British American Tobacco or Shell in their key holdings.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record on socially responsible investing Amid surging interest in SRI funds, Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Just US Large Cap Equity ETF aims to convince investors that the company is serious about injecting a spirit of ethics and morality into its financial strategies. To that end, the fund says it directs money only into companies that are ranked highly by Just Capital. The 426 companies featured in the Just index were selected on the basis of their performance across seven different criteria, including labor practices, customer service and environmental impacts. Goldman itself ranks in the top tenth of the Just rankings, despite the company being attacked for supporting the fossil fuel industry and also being fined $5bn in 2016 by the Department of Justice for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages, when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Whether Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Just fund represents a step in a larger shift towards socially responsible investment remains to be seen. Baruch College\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jared Peifer says that one way to judge a firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to social responsibility is to watch how it deals with resolutions brought by shareholders, whereby investors attempt to force management to adopt socially responsible policies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is variance to the degree that SRI funds are ethically motivated versus a more greenwashing approach,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Peifer said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is the fund dialoguing with management? Issuing shareholder proxy votes, voting on others? If so, that seems like a more ethically motivated fund to me, because they are exerting additional effort many other funds do not bother with.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In recent years, Goldman executives have been fighting off SRI resolutions at their own company, including initiatives that have asked management to more transparently disclose their political lobbying and create a human rights committee to review the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies regarding doing business with governments engaged in censorship and repression. Only three months before Goldman announced the Just fund, Goldman successfully pressed the Securities and Exchange Commission to bless its move to block shareholders from voting on a resolution asking the company to honor indigenous peoples\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extraordinary no action request shows the notable lengths that the company is willing to go, and to stretch credulity, in order to prevent its directors from shouldering fiduciary obligations on indigenous and human rights,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wrote shareholder proponents at the time. Last year, Goldman was lauded by Share Action, an SRI activist group, for switching its position and using its holdings to support a series of climate-change-related shareholder initiatives. In its proxy voting guidelines, Goldman says it will generally vote for proposals asking companies to report on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153policies, initiatives and oversight mechanisms related to environmental sustainability, or how the company may be impacted by climate change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, those guidelines do not make the same commitment when it comes to initiatives requiring companies to actually reduce their carbon emissions. The guidelines also say the company will generally vote against \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proposals requesting increased disclosure of a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies with respect to political contributions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The company further says it will vote to remove representatives of employees or organized labor from a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board if they are overseeing company audits or executive compensation, and if there is no legal requirement for them to be in that position. Goldman votes against resolutions at Just fund companies Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hostility toward many SRI initiatives is illustrated by its votes on resolutions at the companies now in its Just fund. For example, there is Chevron Corporation, which ranks as the Just fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 17th-largest holding as it faces accusations that it is trying to intimidate environmentalists and avoid cleaning up pollution in the Amazon rainforest. In May, the oil giant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders were asked to vote on a slate of seven proposals, including a requirement for the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board to nominate a director with environmental experience; the preparation of a report on transitioning to a low-carbon business model; increased transparency relating to lobbying activities; and stronger prohibitions on Chevron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interests overseas from doing business with governments that are complicit in genocide or crimes against humanity. As shareholders in Chevron, 14 different Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) funds voted on these proposals. The majority of funds voted in support of just one, a request for the company to prepare a report on its efforts to minimize methane emissions. In every other case, the funds unanimously or overwhelmingly opposed the proposals. Proxy-voting records from dozens of shareholder meetings reviewed by Capital &amp; Main show a similar pattern. In rare cases, Goldman funds did vote in favor of some shareholder reforms, including the preparation of a report on the gender pay gap at Facebook and Google. At several pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie, Amgen and Eli Lilly, Goldman funds supported increased accountability for executives regarding high drug prices. Such votes, however, were few and far between. Of the 10 companies that make up the largest share of Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Just fund, eight considered shareholder-proposed reforms that were overwhelmingly opposed by Goldman-managed funds at their most recent annual meetings. The proposals included prohibitions on offshore tax avoidance schemes, increased transparency on lobbying activities and requirements that companies appoint an independent board chair \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a governance model that advocates say leads to more responsible corporate behavior. The remaining two companies, Microsoft and Visa, did not consider any shareholder proposals. At JPMorgan, the recipient of Just\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth-largest investment, Goldman funds voted unanimously against a requirement for the company to release a report on its investments in PetroChina, a firm that activists accuse of helping to fund crimes against humanity due to its ongoing business relationships with oppressive regimes in Syria and Sudan. Goldman made that move despite its own proxy voting guidelines saying the company would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153generally vote for proposals requesting a report on company or company supplier labor and/or human rights standards and policies, or on the impact of its operations on society\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Eighteen of the 19 Goldman funds with shares in JPMorgan also voted against an effort to prohibit the accelerated vesting of awards for executives who enter government service, a practice often criticized for fueling the revolving door between Wall Street and financial regulators. A shareholder proposal to the board of pharmaceutical manufacturer Johnson &amp; Johnson, expressing concern that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s compensation practices \u00e2\u20ac\u0153may insulate senior executives from legal risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd relating to the opioids crisis, recommended that opioid-related litigation costs be factored into executive pay. All 16 Goldman funds with stock in Johnson &amp; Johnson voted to defeat the proposal. Goldman asserts that its fund is designed to invest in firms that rank well in Just Capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ratings. But even that assertion is not what it seems. Because the index features companies ranked in the top half of their respective industries, it includes dozens of firms in sectors like energy and financial services that score poorly overall. For example, the fund invests in both National Oilwell Varco, a drilling equipment firm, and Entergy, a Louisiana utility, despite the fact that the companies rank 626th and 676th, respectively, among the 875 companies evaluated by Just Capital. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every industry is represented at approximately the same weight as [in] the Russell 1000,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Just Capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hernando Cortina, referring to the best-known index fund tracking the largest publicly traded companies. Cortina added that the Just fund is designed to feature responsible companies \u00e2\u20ac\u0153while providing diversified equity exposure to every industry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Lisa Lindsley of SumOfUs said the situation spotlights how socially responsible investing is seen on Wall Street not as a values-based cause, but as yet another way to trick investors into believing that the investment industry has reformed itself a decade after the financial crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The reason they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going into this is that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money there.
