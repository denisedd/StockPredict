                "bodyText":"Time for a recap: Mark Carney has taken a big step towards staying on as Bank of England governor to help Britain through the choppy waters after Brexit. After days of speculation, Carney revealed that he had offered to do whatever he could to ensure Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU was smooth. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big hint that he could stay in post beyond June 2019 - potentially for another year, or even until the end of a Brexit transition period. He told the Treasury committee that: I am willing to do whatever else I can in order to promote both a smooth Brexit and effective transition at the Bank of England. The chancellor and I have discussed this. I would expect an announcement to be made in due course.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know exactly what Carney is proposing.... Carney also flagged up that it could be easier to appoint a successor once there is more clarity about Brexit, and insisted there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no shortage of good candidates for one of the biggest jobs in central banking. The Treasury has declined to respond, saying Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153speak for themselves\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but promised that an announcement is coming. Commitee chair Nicky Morgan is pushing for a quick decision. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office has indicated that the PM wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t oppose an extension to Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contract, saying he has done a good job. Carney also tried to placate Brexit-supporters, indicating that the prospect of Boris Johnson or even Jacob Rees-Mogg becoming PM wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shake his enthusiasm for the job. Some City investors have welcomed the news, saying it would provide much-needed stability. During the hearing at parliament, the Bank of England also warned MPs that a no-deal Brexit would drive up prices in the shops and send the pound tumbling (just the sort of comments that have upset Leave supporters in the past). As Carney put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely that the real income squeeze will return for households across the country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t avoid that medium-term impact on real incomes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There was little reaction in the markets to Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer, with the pound dipping against the US dollar today. In other news... Amazon has followed Apple to become America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second $1trn company (although shares have dropped back from their earlier peak). TSB CEO Paul Pester has (finally) paid the price for the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IT meltdown. Growth in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector has hit a three-month low South Africa has lurched into recession, sending its currency sliding again. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Another central banker, Alan Greenspan, once remarked that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mark Carney has hacked back to that particular Greenspan doctrine at times over the last five years. And even today, as Channel 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business editor, Siobhan Kennedy, points out, we still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know exactly what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening over the governorship.... Back in the financial markets, Amazon just hit a $1trn market capitalisation. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price rose over the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmagic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 figure of $2050.27, making it the second US company - after Apple - to be worth $1,000,000,000,000. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value has surged in the last year, as the company has continued to post strong sales growth and cement its strong position in web services and the cloud. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s super news for anyone who bought shares 20 years ago, or indeed last autumn! The Treasury committee hearing has wrapped up. And across the road in Westminster, Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokeswoman has confirmed that an announcement on Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future is being worked on. Reuters has the details: British Prime Minister Theresa May thinks Mark Carney has done a good job as governor of the Bank of England, her spokeswoman said on Tuesday, adding that there would be further announcements on the matter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The prime minister obviously thinks he has done a good job in his time as governor, and there will be more to say on that in due course,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the spokeswoman told reporters. Carney said earlier he was ready to extend his time in charge of the central bank to help Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy as it leaves the EU. Nicky Morgan MP, Chair of the Treasury Committee, has urged the Treasury to make a decision about Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future soon - and press on with finding his successor too. She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In his evidence session with the Treasury Committee today, Mark Carney indicated that he is willing to stay as Governor of the Bank of England beyond June 2019 if it would assist the Government. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stability is vital during this important period. The sooner the Government provides clarity, the better. Any extension to Dr Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s term should not be used to delay succession planning.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd John Mann MP then asks BoE chief economist Andy Haldane how he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d deliver on Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy to make the Bank boost UK productivity. Under this plan, the BoE would be set a new 3% productivity growth target (alongside its 2% inflation goal) How, Mann asks, would this be achieved? What tools would be deployed? Haldane scratches his ear, and explains that while such targets are a good idea, the key question is who is best placed to deliver them. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existing mandate for price stability and financial stability should help productivity growth, but they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deliver it on their own, he says. In the long run, though, productivity growth depends on having a skilled and educated workforce, and infrastructure improvements. And, Haldane concludes, central banks do not build roads or railways, hospitals or schools. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t train apprentices, and they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t teach schoolchildren. Governor Carney adds that the Bank would have greater responsibility for productivity, but not more powers to solve the problems. We wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the tools, Mr Mann, to achieve it. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Giles suggests this might put the bank in a sticky situation: John Mann MP asks Carney if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d still want to be Bank of England governor if Boris Johnson or Jacob Rees-Mogg were prime minister in June 2019. Carney suggests that this wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put him off. These jobs are technocratic jobs. You serve the remit set by parliament and the government of the day. A former Bank of England policymaker, Andrew Sentance, has criticised the whole circus around Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session follows days of speculation about whether the Treasury and the Bank were trying to hammer out an agreement to keep the governor for longer. That, Sentance told Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World at One, bad for the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credibility: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It seems like the appointment of the governor is something that is happening between the Chancellor and the governor, and is not happening in a transparent way. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It seems an awful lot is happening in this appointment process behind the scenes and that is not good in terms of the independence of the Bank of England.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Treasury committee member Wes Streeting has welcomed Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer to stay on longer, and hopes an announcement comes soon. Ed Conway of Sky News suspects that Carney could actually extend his governorship to 2021, rather than leaving in June 2019 as currently planned. That would mean a full eight-year stint (he started in summer 2013) - the standard term for BoE governors. Q: How vulnerable is sterling to a sudden devaluation? Mark Carney takes a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglass half-full\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 approach. He thinks the pound is currently suffering from the risk of a no-deal Brexit, so it might rise if an agreement and a transition deal is reached. But if that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen, the pound would move the other way, he explains. Quilter Investors head of investment, Anthony Gillham, believes the UK government should accept Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer to stay longer at the Bank of England. Gillham concedes that Carney hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153universally popular\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (particularly with Leave supporters, who have hated his warnings about Brexit). But even so, Britain would benefit from an experienced hand at the top of the Bank in the likely turbulent times ahead. Gillham writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Central banks have done a lot of heavy lifting over the last decade in an effort to restore economic stability, although they have often been required to swim upstream against a current of destabilising political uncertainty. As if to illustrate the point, despite the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to protect sterling over the summer, we have seen the pound chasing up positive sentiment around Brexit, before following it back down when the political rhetoric changes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenure is extended he will have his work cut out, but the case for an experienced captain to guide the UK through dangerous waters has grown stronger as Brexit negotiations have dragged on. He will install a measure of certainty on monetary policy, which provides some air cover through what will surely be an unpredictable spell. As Bank of England governor Mark Carney hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always been universally popular, but appointing him as temporary caretaker through this period of transition does make sense.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Treasury have declined to comment on Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments today, but have confirmed that an announcement will come in due course. The committee have moved away from Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future, and onto the impact of artificial intelligence on the UK economy (are they suggesting the governor could be replaced by a robot?). Q: How many jobs will be lost to the fourth industrial revolution? Chief economist Andy Haldane says estimates for gross job losses range from 10% and 50% of the global workforce - as jobs are automated or entire professions are replaced with software. Of course, you also need to factor in how many new jobs are created (coding all those robots etc) But the big picture is that the gross job losses due to AI, big data, etc, the gross job losses will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at least as large and possibly larger as in previous industrial revolutions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Haldane adds. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on governor Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to help Britain through Brexit by serving longer at the Bank of England: Mark Carney has confirmed he is in talks with the Treasury over staying on at the Bank of England to smooth any potential fallout from Brexit. Dropping the broadest possible hint he could remain at Threadneedle Street beyond his scheduled departure date in June, the Bank of England governor said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even though I have already agreed to extend my time to support a smooth Brexit, I am willing to do whatever else I can in order to promote both a smooth Brexit and an effective transition at the Bank of England.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney confirmed he had held talks with the chancellor, Philip Hammond, over his future, and said an announcement would be made by the government \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in due course\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Speaking to MPs on the Treasury committee, tasked with scrutinising appointments at the central bank, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am signalling a willingness to do whatever I can to support this process.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd...

Carney says that any such cut in tariffs would be countered by a slump in sterling after a no-deal Brexit (driving up imports). There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much reaction in the financial markets to Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer to serve longer at the Bank of England. The pound is still down 0.25% against the US dollar today, at $1.284. I guess that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because a) there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no actual announcement yet, b) the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns about Brexit extend well beyond the identity of the Bank of England governor, and c) most currencies have slipped against the US dollar today. Mary Carney weighs in too -- he says that it is unlikely that Britain would leave the EU without a deal or a transition deal in March. But if that unlikely scenario does happen, the Bank would do what it could to mitigate the impact on UK real incomes, the governor says. However, there are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclimits\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to how much the Bank could tolerate a slump in the pound (in other words, it might be forced to raise interest rates to support sterling). The Treasury committee are now quizzing the Bank about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the UK economy. What might happen to food prices and the cost of living if we reach March 2019 without a deal between the UK and the EU, and both sides walk away? Chief economist Andy Haldane says it would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153material rise in the cost of things in the shops\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, particularly items that are imported from overseas. That would be due to a weaker pound and higher tariffs on those goods, he explains. Q: How long would that effect last for? History shows that it often persists for several years, Haldane replies. Carney is asked about his warning last month that a no-deal Brexit is an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncomfortably high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd risk. Q: Does that mean that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now a 60:40 chance? [as trade secretary Liam Fox claimed]. Carney replies that this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t what he meant. Brexit negotiations are approaching a critical time, and thus the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee is very focused on the risks. Mark Carney is also asked about the resignation of TSB chief executive Paul Pester this morning, following its IT meltdown. He replies that senior managers must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd take responsibility for failures on their watch - be they conduct, operational or financial. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Responsibility has now been taken\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a series of quite fundamental failings that have disadvantaged many customers and hurt confidence in TSB, he continues coldly (is he suggesting Pester should have quit earlier?) We look forward to a new team being put in place, the governor continues briskly. Q: Has the governor given any thought to who might (eventually) succeed him? Mark Carney declines to suggest a shortlist, saying only that there are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153many qualified candidates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Then, rather interestingly, he says there are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some advantages\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to running the recruitment process at a time when both sides have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153full knowledge of the exact form of Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which the country has chosen. In other words: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather hard to recruit a world-class central banker to run the Bank of England when you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know whether Britain will crash out of the EU without a deal before they even get their feet under the desk.... Some snap reaction to Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments: Unfortunately, Mark Carney has declined to reveal his decision today - after all, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to announce. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made them aware of my willingness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to do what I can to help, he adds. Carney adds that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a privilege to work at the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Treasury committee member Wes Streeting has welcomed Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments. [For anyone just tuning in... Mark Carney is currently due to leave the Bank in nine months time. He was originally due to depart this summer, but in 2016 he agreed to stay on until June 2019. Now a further extension is on the cards...] Nicky Morgan begins the session by joking that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t attracted much press attention -- and then reads out a stream of headlines about Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future at the Bank of England. Can he shed any light on whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stay longer at the Bank? Governor Carney replies that at this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153critical period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153important that everyone does everything they can to help with the transition of exiting the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That includes parliamentarians, business people and central bankers. Carney says: Accordingly, even though I have already agreed to extend my time to support a smooth Brexit, I am willing to do whatever else I can in order to promote both a smooth Brexit and an effective transition at the Bank of England. That sounds like a heavy hint that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stay at the Bank, beyond June 2019 - his current exit date. Carney adds that he has already discussed this issue with the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and he expects an announcement to be made in due course. More to follow! Parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury committee has begun its hearing with Bank of England governor Mark Carney. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accompanied by chief economist Andy Haldane, and Monetary Policy Committee member Silvana Tenreyro. On the agenda: Last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise, the outlook for UK growth and inflation, and the state of the economy. Brexit, and Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own future, will surely also come up too..... The session is being streamed here. Joel Hills of ITV News reckons Mark Carney wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t considering an an extra shift at the Bank of England two months ago. But perhaps things have changed, now the Treasury have been (apparently) proposing the governor stays in post until 2020. Just an hour to wait until MPs on the Treasury committee grill Mark Carney about the possibility of extending his contract beyond June 2019. Craig Erlam of City trading firm OANDA suggests the governor might refuse to be drawn about the issue today (he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s officially there to discuss August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report). Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance before the Treasury Select Committee on Tuesday comes with an additional twist, following reports that the Treasury is trying to persuade him to extend his term \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which ends in the middle of next year - by another 12 months. Carney has already agreed to one extension in order to oversee the Brexit process and the government is clearly hopeful that he will contemplate one more so as to provide some source of stability in otherwise uncertain times. He hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been the most popular of Governors, primarily among Brexiteers, who are still angry about his predictions on the economy prior to the referendum in the event of a vote to leave. You have to wonder why Carney would choose to remain in the hot seat given the hand he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been given and the constant criticism he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s received. Perhaps this is one reason why efforts are being made to retain him for now, it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be one of the most sought after jobs at the minute. The Press Association have compiled a handy Q&amp;A on the IT crisis at TSB. Q: Why has TSB come under the spotlight? A: Problems erupted following a migration of customer data from former owner Lloyds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 IT system to a new one managed by TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current owner Sabadell. Up to 1.9 million people using TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s digital and mobile banking found themselves locked out of their bank accounts. Some customers were unable to access their cash or pay bills - while others reported being able to see other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accounts. The Information Commissioner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office, which monitors data and privacy, previously said it was looking into the situation. MPs on the Treasury Committee heard from the bank in April that 40,000 complaints were received over a 10-day period. By the end of July, over 135,000 complaints had been logged. Q:What about people who have incurred charges because of the hitches? A: TSB has promised that its customers will not be left out of pocket as a result of the glitches. They can raise a complaint with the bank, and if they are still unhappy after giving it a chance to respond they can complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service, which resolves disputes between consumers and firms. Q: Have other problems emerged? A: MPs have voiced strong concerns over how the problems were handled and fears were also raised about some people being targeted by fraudsters following the IT issues. The saga took another twist when it emerged some former TSB customers had found their direct debits had been cancelled and firms were apparently told that they had died. And customers of the bank have faced further frustration just this week, with many unable to access their accounts on Monday. Q: What indications have there been as to how TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s customers are feeling about the bank? A: A recent survey from MoneySavingExpert.com saw TSB tumble down the website\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rankings in terms of customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 satisfaction with their bank. MoneySavingExpert.com said last week that TSB had plummeted from 4th to 11th place in its latest banking customer service survey, which the consumer help website carries out twice a year. Some 49% of those who graded TSB said its service was poor and just 23% deemed it great. Meanwhile, a separate survey carried out in July for GoCompare Money found 16% of TSB customers surveyed are considering switching banks. Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Treasury Minister, has also welcomed Paul Pester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153TSB customers have suffered inexcusable levels of disruption and received service which has fallen far short of accepted standards. It is right that the most senior person at the bank has been held accountable for this. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A decade on from the financial crisis, senior individuals taking responsibility in this way will be an essential building block of restoring public trust in our banking sector.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Angela Monaghan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news story on the shake-up at TSB (and its latest technology problems). TSB have written to Treasury committee chair Nicky Morgan MP, confirming that Paul Pester has stepped down (three months after the committee said they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d lost confidence in him). They may not have much confidence in Pester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacement either; executive chairman Richard Meddings apparently thinks it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019! Not a great look from a bank trying to shake off a reputation for IT problems. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine the right honourable member for Loughborough appreciates being hailed as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd either! In reply, Nicky Morgan has welcomed Pester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure...and warned that that bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over. The Committee remains concerned about the continuing problems at TSB, including unacceptable delays in compensating customers who have been badly let down. It is to be hoped that Dr Pester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successor is able to restore the confidence of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-suffering customers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lurch into recession is a blow to new prime minister Cyril Ramaphosa, who succeeded Jacob Zuma earlier this year: Newsflash: South Africa has fallen into recession. New figures show that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP shrank by 0.7% in the second quarter of 2018 - news which is sending currency into a fresh dive. Economists had expected growth of around 0.6%, after a sharp slump earlier this year. Instead, South Africa has now racked up two consecutive quarterly contractions - the classic definition of a recession. The South African rand has promptly slumped by 2% against the US dollar, extending its earlier losses. Blane Perrotton, managing director of property consultancy and surveyors Naismiths, spies an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uneasy calm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building sector. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on drop in the UK construction PMI in August: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Though levels of optimism have sagged, construction firms continue to hire, though this is likely to be driven by the need to get existing projects completed rather than a great bet on future demand. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With Brexit storm clouds still looming on the horizon, the current modest progress is as much as can be expected \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially in the South East. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Other markets are looking more buoyant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly the West Midlands and Bristol \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but as the countdown to Brexit enters its final months, businesses\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 gnawing sense of uncertainty will continue to peg back levels of investment. In that context, a steady ship should be seen as a real achievement.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Financial analyst Emanuele Canegrati of BP Prime says the PMI is much weaker than expected. But Max Jones of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking is more optimistic: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recent results from contractors indicate some softness in civil engineering and sentiment here has not been helped by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement that Crossrail project is behind schedule. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yet even if the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current infrastructure pipeline may not be quite as bulging as some would hope, mega-projects like Heathrow, Hinkley Point and HS2 continue to offer quality work for firms right down the supply chain. Importantly, minds are focused on discipline, with anecdotal evidence that firms are holding prices during bidding negotiations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the commercial market still looks fragile, much of this has to do with fears about the London market. Confidence in the capital remains intrinsically tied to Brexit, so any developments or certainty in negotiations will be warmly welcomed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Growth in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector has hit a three-month low in August, a new survey shows. Housebuilding growth slipped to its weakest rate since March, according to data firm Markit. That won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide the new homes needed to tackle the UK housing shortage. Civil engineering output was also disappointing, and actually fell in August, while commercial building work accelerated. This pulled Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI down to 52.9, much weaker than July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 55.8. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not far from the 50-point mark showing stagnation. It means builders could take breather after a busy few months, as Tim Moore, associate director at IHS Markit, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The construction sector slipped back into a slower growth phase in August, with this summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s catch- up effect starting to unwind after projects were delayed by adverse weather at the start of 2018. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Civil engineering was the worst performing area of the construction sector, with output in this category falling for the first time since March amid reports citing a lack of new work on infrastructure projects. House building saw a particularly sharp slowdown since July, meaning that commercial construction was the fastest growing sub-sector in August. The pound isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only currency under pressure today. Indeed, the US dollar is strengthening across the board, bringing more pain to emerging markets such as South Africa and Indonesia. Several senior economists are unimpressed by the swirling uncertainty over Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management school, argues that the governor should pledge to stay until 2021. That would be the typical eight-year term, rather than Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned six-year stint [ending in June 2019]. In a letter to the FT, professor Milas says this is the wrong time for a change of governor: The rumour is that Mr Carney is considering a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Treasury request to serve another year as governor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This will make it a seven-year service at the bank rather than the eight-year service advertised by the Treasury back in 2012. Assuming that the rumour is a fact, the Treasury is indeed correct in asking Mr Carney to continue as governor at the bank. A critical, yet unwritten, rule of football is never substituting a player \u00e2\u20ac\u201d let alone your (monetary policy) captain \u00e2\u20ac\u201d when defending a corner. Indeed, with Brexit headwinds remaining quite strong, this is not the time to replace the governor. That said, Mr Carney needs to commit to his full eight-year tenure. He is not a player on loan where he has the luxury to extend by one year and then by another one. As simple as that. However, former Bank of England policymaker Andrew Sentance has criticised the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153charade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd around the governorship. He argues that the independence of the Bank is at risk: In the City, the pound is dropping again as traders fret about Brexit....and the uncertainty at the Bank of England. Sterling is down half a cent against the US dollar at $1.2825, having lost almost a cent on Monday. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Speculation over Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future at the Bank of England, and the continued opposition to Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chequers plan failed to help the pound recover Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses as Tuesday got underway. The problem isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that Carney might stay on longer, but the fact he might not, his tenure as central bank chief set to end just after Britain officially leaves the EU. Combine this with the renewed attacks on May from Brexit hardliners and sterling couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really do anything positive after the bell. Despite the sometimes-shambolic state of TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service since April, it appears that Paul Pester could still pick up a bonus. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official line: Paul will be paid in line with the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remuneration policy and the terms of his contract. The release of variable pay will take into account the outcome of performance conditions as well as ongoing regulatory and independent investigations. Wes Streeting MP, another member of the Treasury committee, thinks Paul Pester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come fast enough . Alison McGovern MP reminds us that the Treasury committee asked TSB to consider Pester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position three months ago. Still, at least they got today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement out.... Paul Pester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure comes five months after TSB suffered one of the worst IT crises in years, when a technology migration was botched, leaving thousands of customers unable to access their accounts. Pester was roasted by MPs over his handling of the crisis; his future has been in doubt since June when the Treasury Committee said they had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lost confidence\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in him. And the gremlins returned to TSB over the weekend, when \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcplanned maintenance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 went wrong, leaving customers fuming. Perhaps that was the last straw - either for Sabadell or Pester himself.... Breaking: Paul Pester, the boss of TSB, has resigned - as the bank is struck by ANOTHER tech meltdown. In a statement, the bank says: The Board of TSB Bank Plc has today announced that after 7 years as CEO, Paul Pester will be stepping down from his position and leaving the company. Richard Meddings, current Non Executive Chairman of TSB, will take on the role of Executive Chairman with immediate effect in order to enable a full public search to commence for a new CEO. Whilst there is still work to do to achieve full stability for customers, TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s systems and services are much improved since the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IT migration earlier this year. Paul and the Board have therefore agreed that this is the right time for Paul to step down and to appoint a new CEO for TSB. More to follow.... Conservative MP George Freeman has also called on Mark Carney to stay longer at the Bank, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need a Brexit that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t damage business confidence, investment and jobs. Mark Carney is the Alex Ferguson of the City - if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do it he would be a smart pick.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The problem, though, is that Carney may have had enough of playing on the hallowed turf of Threadneedle Street. Plus, crucially, the rest of the Carney family are heading back to Canada this year (two of the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daughters have A-levels and GCSEs this summer). Having already agreed to remain at the BoE another year (till summer 2019), would he really want to stay even longer? Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Mark Carney was described as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the outstanding central banker of his generation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when he was dramatically appointed as Bank of England governor in 2012. Since then, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been called everything from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high priest of Project Fear\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153George Clooney of finance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Now, with his stint at the Bank almost over, could the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd change his mind again? There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing pressure on Carney to stick around longer at the Bank, rather than leave in June 2019 as planned. This would let him help the UK through the Brexit transition (or do I mean upheaval?), and calm the markets. The rumour mill is working overtime, with the Treasury and the Bank of England apparently in discussions about Mark Carney staying on longer as governor. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury committee will try to get to the bottom of the situation today, when they question the governor about last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise. Some MPs are hoping that Carney could be persuaded to extend his stint in London longer, even though he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned to return to Canada for family reasons. Stewart Hosie, a Scottish National Party MP on the committee, told us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a surprise at all if a member would ask [about Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future]. Carney has done a very good job in what, in many cases, have been very difficult economic circumstances. There would be a lot of merit in the chancellor asking him to extend his term should that be the decision the chancellor were to take. Brexit-loving MPs, though, won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t relish the thought of Mark Carney remaining (so to speak) at the Bank for longer, given his warnings about the cost of leaving the EU.

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our round-up of the slide in emerging market stocks today, and the factors behind it: Goodnight! GW Emerging markets have fallen into a bear market tonight, the FT reports. That means stocks in developing countries, such as Indonesia, South Africa, Argentina and Turkey, have fallen 20% from their recent peak. As the FT puts it: The FTSE Emerging index of nearly 800 of the biggest companies in the developing world fell 1.6 per cent, its sixth straight decline and the biggest in three weeks, which pushed the benchmark to its lowest since July 2017. They also flag up that currencies, as well as equities, are feeling the strain against the US dollar: Indonesia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rupiah traded close to its weakest level since the 1998 Asian financial crisis, while the South African rand slipped to a record low after data on Tuesday showed the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy had contracted for the first time since 2009, exacerbating concerns over the developing world more broadly. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major stock markets also had a bad day today, amid the ripples from the emerging markets rout. In London, the FTSE 100 shed 74 points, or 1%, to 7,383 - its lowest close since April (partly due to the sterling rally) But there were bigger losses in Europe, with the French CAC down 1.5% and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX shedding 1.4%. David Madden of CMC Markets says: worries about global trading relationships and the decline in emerging market economies are hurting market confidence. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, has written a blogpost to mark the 10th anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In it, she warns that not enough has been done to repair the damage caused by the financial crisis, or to avoid another one. In the article, she says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have come a long way, but not far enough. The system is safer, but not safe enough. Growth has rebounded but is not shared enough.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking back today, the pressure points seem obvious. But they were less obvious at the time. Most economists failed to predict what was coming. It is a sobering lesson in groupthink.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the policy response to these pre-crisis risks was inadequate, I would say that the immediate policy response to the crisis was impressive. The governments of the major economies represented by the G20 coordinated policies on a global scale. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Indeed, the importance of international cooperation in meeting 21st century challenges is one of the enduring lessons of the crisis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lagarde also suggests that male dominance of Wall Street was a factor - a few more sisters at the top could have made a big difference.... More here: Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, flags up that the South African rand is being dragged lower by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emerging market selloff. The spike in the pound has hit shares in London (as it makes overseas earnings in foreign currencies less valuable). The FTSE 100 is now down by 93 points, or 1.25%, in late trading. Newsflash from Ottawa: The Bank of Canada has left Canadian interest rates on hold, at 1.5%. The BoC also warns that trade uncertainty is hurting Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy: Elevated trade tensions remain a key risk to the global outlook and are pulling some commodity prices lower. Meanwhile, financial stresses have intensified in certain emerging market economies, but with limited spillovers to other countries. Boom! The pound has just jumped on the foreign exchange markets, on report of a Brexit breakthrough. But investors should stay cautious - there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing official at this stage. Bloomberg is reporting that Germany is ready to accept a less-detailed agreement on future ties between the UK and the European Union, to get a deal done. The UK, for its part, would accept a more vague statement of intent on the future relationship, according to anonymous sources quoted by the newswire. If true, this would suggest the two sides are amenable to unblocking the current deadlock. This could cut the risk that Britain crashes out of the EU next March without a deal. Traders reacted quickly, sending the pound back to $1.296 - its highest level this week. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says there are two reasons to treat the news cautiously: First, Germany does not \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite its clear dominance of the bloc economically - actually speak for the EU position. Michel Barnier may well have something to say about this report. As might Theresa May. Second, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard these kinds of rumours lift the pound before and it should be treated with caution. There is a strong chance that this rally could run out of steam and retrace in fairly short order. But, it nevertheless it does still point to a degree of softening in the general tone of talks and that a deal is more likely than not. Both the widening American trade gap, and the slide in emerging markets today, can be partly blamed on the stronger US dollar. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to the robust US economy, and the prospect of higher interest rates to curb inflation -- as Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts give the economy a sugar rush. Quite... Mexican politician Jorge Guajardo believes Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attacks on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading partners are partly to blame for the widening US trade gap: White House insiders might want to hide today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade data from the president... Not only has the US trade deficit widened, but the gap with Canada has hit a 10-year high. This surplus widened to 5.3bn Canadian dollars in July, from C$4.1 billion the previous month, This may make Trump even more determined to reach a new North American trade deal, as NAFTA talks restart in Washington. Bloomberg says: The figures released Wednesday in Ottawa are likely to play into the resumption of bilateral talks in Washington over the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump has signed a new deal with Mexico and has threatened to leave Canada out and impose stiff auto tariffs if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make concessions. Even the metal products targeted by U.S. tariffs showed some resilience in the latest figures. Canadian shipments of steel climbed 16 percent in July after a 36 percent drop in June, while a 2 percent fall in aluminum still left those exports 8.1 percent higher than they were a year prior. Newsflash: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit has widened to a five-month high, in a blow to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to cut it. US imports jumped by $2.2bn to $261bn in July, according to the latest trade data from the Census Bureau. Exports shrank by $2.1bn, though, to around $211bn, due to lower sales of aircraft and soybeans (which now face tariffs when sold to China). This drove America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall trade deficit up to over $50bn. The White House won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be pleased to see that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goods trade deficit with China surged 10% to a record $36.8 billion. So what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening? The Wall Street Journal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theory is that tax cuts and higher federal spending \u00e2\u20ac\u0153goosed up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd domestic demand, while a cooling economy overseas hampered exports. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, blames trade war anxiety and the strengthening US dollar for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Global stock markets continue to be volatile as the trade dispute between the United States and China continues to escalate. Slowing Chinese growth has unsettled investors as the impact of the ongoing trade dispute continues to impact the Chinese economy. Asian stocks are currently lower with all major markets recording losses. The Shanghai Composite index, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei and South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s KOSPI all made losses in light on going spat between the two largest economies. The Indonesian Index is down 3.7% as downward pressure on EMs continues. European markets have also opened lower, due to the same concerns. Emerging markets are also continuing to suffer as the likes of Turkish inflation are causing concern amongst investors. Most EM currencies are under pressure with today concerns being focused on Indonesia, Argentina and South Africa. As a result of these risky economies and markets, the dollar has become a safe haven for many, allowing it to surge to its latest high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It feels as if the dollar and Amazon stock price is the only asset going up! Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dean Popplewell of City firm OANDA on the losses across emerging markets today: Soured sentiment has left several Asian stock markets with their biggest declines in a fortnight, at least since the bout of EM worries that were fuelled by the TRY\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plunge. In Japan, equities held up better than most, perhaps helped by the overnight yen softness (\u00c2\u00a5111.47). Nevertheless, investors remain worried that Sino-U.S tariff war could escalate weighed on sentiment. The Nikkei share average dropped -0.51% for a fourth consecutive session while the broader Topix fell -0.77%. Down-under, Aussie shares extended their losses for a fifth consecutive session overnight, closing down -1%, brushing aside a robust economic growth report (Q2 GDP +0.9% vs. +0.7%) as materials stocks slid on weaker commodity prices. In S. Korea, the Kospi plunged -1.03% as trade war fears intensify. In Hong Kong, stocks posted their biggest loss in 11-weeks on growth and trade war fears. Overnight, investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dumped property, energy and tech stocks amid worries about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and the Sino-U.S trade war. The Hang Seng index fell -2.6%, while the China Enterprises Index lost -2.3%. Emerging market currencies are also having a bad day, with most falling against the US dollar today: Back in the financial world, the rout in emerging markets is gathering pace. Emerging stock markets across the globe are in the red, as a nasty cocktail of threats hit equities. The selloff in Asia overnight has now spread to the Middle East. Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is the worst performer, plunging more than 4% at the last count. Indonesia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market has slumped by 3.7%, and there are losses from Shanghai and Hong Kong to Mumbai, Cairo and Johannesburg. Shares are being hit by several factors, including: The slowdown in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector last month The global impact of the US-China trade war, and the prospect that America implements tariffs on an extra $200bn of Chinese imports later this week The strengthening US dollar, which is sucking capital out of emerging markets and pushing up the cost of repaying debts taken out in dollars There are also isolated individual factors. South Africa fell into recession yesterday, while Argentina is pushing the IMF for a larger bailout to support its economy. So investors are fretting that the global economy may slow, especially if more emerging markets follow Argentina and Turkey into financial crisis. As Christoph Barraud, an economist at Paris-based brokerage Market Securities, put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Until last month people were focusing on U.S. company earnings but now they are looking closely at what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening in emerging markets, at the trade war and the fact that the United States is likely to implement another wave of tariffs against China. If you look at global growth, more and more signs are that it will slow in coming months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cambridge, Oxford, Warrington, Reading and Swindon are all feeling the brunt of the worker shortage, apparently. Jobs site Adzuna says each of these cities have more than 15 vacancies for every jobseeker, putting labour in a strong position (theoretically, anyway). Despite the hiring struggle, the UK economy is on track to grow by 0.4% in the current quarter, Markit estimates. That would match the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate in April-June, and beat some City forecasts. But still, it would be fairly modest growth compared to the years before the EU referendum.... Morgan Stanley say they \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continue to anticipate weakness in the economy going forward, as we enter the final stretch of Brexit negotiations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, is concerned that UK firms can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find the staff they need. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on the PMI report: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The services sector was a little more upbeat than the other sectors this month maintaining a steady level of activity growth, and the number of new orders ticked higher. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite this, optimism was more subdued and lower than the survey average. With the weakest business optimism since March, uncertainty around the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave the EU continued to dampen client operations. Struggles around securing talent and the right skills were also a drag on a sector highly-dependent on trained staff even though job creation rose to its highest levels for half a year. UK firms are also suffering from uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. Business confidence about future prospects hit the lowest level since March, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI report shows. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153political uncertainty and the unpredictable impact of Brexit on clients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 business operations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chris Williamson of Markit adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business expectations for the year ahead meanwhile sank markedly lower, down across all three sectors to one of the lowest levels seen since the EU referendum, largely reflecting increased anxiety over Brexit negotiations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given the increasingly unbalanced nature of growth and the darkening business mood, risks to the immediate outlook seem tilted to the downside.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good news for UK workers -- the staff shortage is forcing some services firms to pay them more. Markit says: Difficulties recruiting suitably skilled staff contributed to higher salary payments in August. Breaking: Growth in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector rose last month...but firms are finding it harder to recruit the workers they need. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly survey of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services companies. Purchasing managers from large and small UK service firms reported that business activity rose at a faster rate in August, partly thanks to a boost in new work. However, many also said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a lack of suitably skilled candidates to fill vacancies had held back staff hiring\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That staff shortage held some firms back. Markit explains: Backlogs of work increased for the fourth month running in August, which pointed to sustained pressure on operating capacity at service sector companies. A number of firms linked rising volumes of unfinished business to difficulties replacing departing staff. This may be a sign that EU workers are heading home ahead of Brexit, or that potential migrants aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t coming over the UK at all. Last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment figures showed a record annual decline in migrants from the European Union to the UK. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate is also at a 43-year low, so firms may simply be suffering from a tight labour market. Overall, Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK service PMI jumped to 54.3 in August, up from 53.5 in July -- the second highest level since February. That shows faster growth. More to follow.... Just in: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car sales rose by almost a quarter in August. Just over 94 thousand new cars were registered in the UK last month, a jump of 23.1% compared to August 2017. That sounds impressive... until you remember that August is typically a quiet month for car sales (drivers who wait until September will get the new year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number plate). Despite this jump, registrations in 2018 are still 4.2% lower than this stage last year, according to the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders. But still, demand for hybrid and plug-in cars surged by 88.7%. One in 12 buyers chose an electric car - a new record. The SMMT adds: Demand was up across the board, with consumers and fleets boosting year-on-year registrations by 23.3% and 19.7% respectively, while the smaller business sector rose 166.4%, equivalent to an uplift of around 1,500 units against August last year. Superminis remained the most popular buy, followed by small family and dual purpose cars, with the luxury saloon and city car segments recording the most notable growth, up 120.8% and 39.6%. European companies are also worried about trade wars. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new survey of eurozone purchasing managers, just released, show that business expectations in the service sector hit a 21-month low in August. It blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153geo-political trade tensions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More encouragingly, the euro-area private sector kept growing last month. But as this chart shows, Italy moved worryingly close to stagnation (which would be a PMI of 50). Commodity prices are also being hit by the drop in Chinese company growth. The price of copper in Shanghai has hit a 14-month low, while prices in London are down 2.6%. This is dragging down the share prices of mining giants, and thus pulling Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 down by 0.4% in early trading. Global stock markets are in the red this morning, as the slowdown across China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies worries investors. The Shanghai Composite Index has dropped by 1.7%, while Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng index has shed 2.7%. Most European markets have opened lower too, with the Stoxx 600 index of major EU companies down almost 0.5%. Investors are fretting about trade, as Donald Trump could sign off an extra $200bn of tariffs on Chinese goods in the coming days. US officials are also due to resume trade talks with Canada later today, as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: The main preoccupation for investors continues to be on whether the US is serious about arriving at some form of deal with Canada over NAFTA in the wake of President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweets at the weekend, that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t and isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a political necessity to get a deal In addition to that anxiety levels are growing ahead of the weekend and the possible imposition of another $200bn worth of tariffs on Chinese goods later this week. Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies are also feeling a chill from the US-China trade wars. Growth across Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector declined in August, data firm Markit says. Output and new orders both shrank, forcing job cuts. It adds: Notably, export sales to China fell again amid escalating trade tensions. Companies remained pessimistic about future output, which was also accompanied by another drop in purchasing activity and input inventories. Consequently, firms reduced selling prices to support sales despite a further rise in input costs. Both employment and backlogs continued to decline. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business Trade war anxiety is growing this morning, after China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies posted disappointing growth. Business activity growth across China hit a five-month low in August, a new survey from data firm Caixin shows. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector led the slowdown, with growth hitting a 10-month low. Companies reported that new business growth was weak, forcing factory bosses to cut jobs. Business confidence was also subdued. Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, says China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth is on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153downward trajectory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: Inflationary pressures were pronounced as increases in both input prices and output prices accelerated. The future output sub-index went up after falling in August, which was likely boosted by the fine-tuning of macro policies. The employment sub-index was unchanged from July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading and remained in contraction territory. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI readings indicated that the effects of expansionary credit policy and active fiscal policy are yet to kick in. Signs of stagnation emerged as upward pressure on prices remained even though demand weakened at a faster rate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The report suggests that the trade dispute with America is hitting demand and confidence. The US has already imposed tariffs on $50bn of Chinese imports, with president Donald Trump threatening more. Caixin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Composite Output Index, which measures growth across Chinese companies, fell to a five- month low of 52.0 in August, with the services PMI hitting just 51.5 - the lowest since October 2017 (50 = stagnation). Here are the key points from the report: Services activity growth edges down to ten-month low, while manufacturing output increases at faster pace Composite new work expands at weakest pace for over two years Steeper rises in input costs across both the manufacturing and service sectors Reaction to follow.... Later today we discover how Britain, and the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, service sector firms fared in August -- as company bosses watched the clock tick towards Brexit in March 2019. Also coming up today... Ten years after the financial crisis, a UK thinktank is proposing some radical changes to fix the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems. The IPPR is calling for higher wages, more government spending on infrastructure, extra wealth taxes and more power for workers, to tackle growing inequality. The report comes out later today.

The current steps being taken to reform the digital economy so that large scale internet retailers pay a proper share of taxation \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 should be encouraged and implemented quickly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The shadow cast by internet home shopping over struggling high streets is one of the key themes of the 75 written submissions received by the housing, communities and local government committee ahead of its first hearing on Monday. Increasingly, fewer Britons are choosing to visit their local shops, which combined with the dramatic cull of bank branches seen in recent years, is contributing to a spiral of high street decline. Meanwhile, Amazon continues to power ahead \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this week it became the second company to be valued by Wall Street at $1tn (\u00c2\u00a3775bn), a matter of weeks after Apple reached the milestone first. Against the backdrop of a squeeze on consumer spending, there have been a series of high-profile retail failures in the UK, including Toys R Us, Poundworld and House of Fraser, while New Look, Mothercare, Marks &amp; Spencer and Homebase are closing hundreds of stores in total. The British Property Federation (BPF) told MPs that the high street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline needed to be taken more seriously by government policymakers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This inquiry seeks to establish what our high streets will look like in 2030,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the BPF said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is difficult to look at such a long-time horizon but what we can say with some certainty is most will look awful long before then if the status quo is maintained.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bill Grimsey, the former Wickes and Iceland chief executive, is among those being called to give evidence. He was among the authors of a recent independent review that suggested the crisis on UK high streets could leave 100,000 shops empty within a decade. The study suggested town centres could be reinvigorated as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153community hubs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but by focusing on alternatives to retail such as housing, leisure, education and offices. With many high street campaigners looking to their local council for help, the Local Government Association (LGA) said a lack of financial resources was preventing its members from doing more. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The ability of councils to proactively support their town centres is constrained as they prioritise their resources on vital and statutory services,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it said. This cash squeeze has had a direct consequences on councils\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to deliver the vital transport links, such as bus services, that would bring residents back into struggling town centres, the LGA said. Outside of London, 117m bus miles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nearly half of all council-subsidised services \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have been lost since 2011. One of the overriding concerns of the respondents was business rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a tax based on retail property values \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the British Beer and Pub Association, which represents the owners of 20,000 pubs, describing the property tax as punishing for landlords and shopkeepers. The tax burden on traditional retailers and pubs is higher than for online businesses because the property values, which underpin the business rates calculations, are typically higher in town centres than for out-of-town warehouses on industrial parks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business rates need to be reviewed and a new and fairer way to tax businesses needs to be developed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd its chief executive Brigid Simmonds said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the short term \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 businesses that benefit from online sales need to be paying more.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In the wake of House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse into administration last month, the government hinted that it was considering imposing an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Amazon tax\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on online sales. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We may have to look at temporary tax measures to rebalance the playing field until we can get international agreements sorted out,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Philip Hammond said at the time. An Amazon spokesman said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We pay all taxes required in the UK and every country where we operate. In May 2015, to ensure we had the best business structure to serve our customers going forward, we established a local country branch of Amazon EU Sarl in the UK, with all retail revenues, expenses, profits and taxes due now accounted for in the UK. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This year we plan to create 2,500 permanent jobs across the country in research and development, our head office, customer service and fulfilment centres, to bring our total workforce in the UK to over 27,500.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The submissions include a number of powerful appeals, including from independent retailer Chris Abbott, the third generation owner of Abbotts, a small DIY chain in Devon. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK high street as we know it \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 will face obliteration unless swift action is taken.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With \u00c2\u00a330bn flowing into government coffers from business rates, the Treasury is unlikely to abolish the tax soon but alternatives are being sought. Abbott suggests a parcel tax of 20p to \u00c2\u00a31 a package: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think people would accept that the balance is shifting from the high street to online and as a result online retailers will need to start paying their fair share.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

It was the beginning of a slump that by Christmas of that year had resulted in 23.4% being wiped off the value of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top 100 companies.</p> \n<p>As a stock market crash, it ranks alongside the dotcom bubble and the shock of 1987, says the analyst Laith Khalaf of stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown. However, while living standardshave flatlined since that date, the stock market revival has been nothing short of spectacular. An investment of \u00c2\u00a310,000 in the FTSE All-share index in August 2008, before the Lehman crash, would now be worth \u00c2\u00a314,893, without including dividends, and \u00c2\u00a321,352 with dividends reinvested.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7832602692bd7688af7edbf04278bcd7c6b6ec61\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7832602692bd7688af7edbf04278bcd7c6b6ec61/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The US technology giants collectively known as Faangs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The US technology giants collectively known as Faangs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The US markets have gained even more. A \u00c2\u00a310,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 in September 2008 would now be worth nearly \u00c2\u00a340,000, with dividends reinvested. That phenomenal performance is partly down to the rise in value of the Faang stocks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and also helped by the weaker pound boosting returns for UK investors.</p> \n<h2><strong>Best performing shares in the FTSE 100 since Lehman</strong></h2> \n<p>London Stock Exchange Group + 545%</p> \n<p>Intercontinental Hotels +515%</p> \n<p>Fashion chain Next, Costa coffee and Premier Inn group Whitbread and Sky TV are all up more than 200%</p> \n<h2><strong>Worst performing shares from </strong><strong>FTSE 100 when Lehman collapsed</strong></h2> \n<p>Lonmin (mining business, extracting platinum in South Africa) -99.8%</p> \n<p>Royal Bank of Scotland -89.7%</p> \n<p>Lloyds Banking Group, Thomas Cook, outsourcing firm Capita and transport firm First Group are all still down more than 50%</p> \n<h2><strong>UK recession and recovery</strong></h2> \n<p>Economic output fell by 6.1% after the crash and it took 21 quarters for GDP to return to pre-crisis levels, according to ONS data. Real wages are still below pre-crisis levels. In September 2008, regular pay stood at \u00c2\u00a3465 a week, compared with \u00c2\u00a3461 today when inflation is taken into account. It dipped to \u00c2\u00a3442 per week in March 2014, also according to figures from the ONS.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"59de6b9f-2330-43ca-9d62-5285d04e0b35\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy on 15 September 2008.

Those risky loans were sliced up and bundled with less risky ones and sold off in parcels to banks around the world. The belief was that these collateralised securities offered high returns at minimal risk. The belief was that not all mortgage borrowers would default at the same time. That belief was wrong.</p>\n    <p>Lehman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fate was sealed when Alistair Darling, the then chancellor, refused to provide state guarantees for the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover by Barclays. Bob Diamond, who was then the head of Barclays\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 investment bank, had been trying to broker over the weekend of 13-14 September. Darling later recalled: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I could not imagine standing up in the House of Commons on the Monday morning explaining that we had put the UK taxpayer in hock so that Barclays could buy Lehman.

                "bodyText":"Stock market returns since Lehman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy on 15 September 2008, prompting a fall in the FTSE 100 of 4%. It was the beginning of a slump that by Christmas of that year had resulted in 23.4% being wiped off the value of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top 100 companies. As a stock market crash, it ranks alongside the dotcom bubble and the shock of 1987, says the analyst Laith Khalaf of stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown. However, while living standardshave flatlined since that date, the stock market revival has been nothing short of spectacular. An investment of \u00c2\u00a310,000 in the FTSE All-share index in August 2008, before the Lehman crash, would now be worth \u00c2\u00a314,893, without including dividends, and \u00c2\u00a321,352 with dividends reinvested. The US markets have gained even more. A \u00c2\u00a310,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 in September 2008 would now be worth nearly \u00c2\u00a340,000, with dividends reinvested. That phenomenal performance is partly down to the rise in value of the Faang stocks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and also helped by the weaker pound boosting returns for UK investors. Best performing shares in the FTSE 100 since Lehman London Stock Exchange Group + 545% Intercontinental Hotels +515% Fashion chain Next, Costa coffee and Premier Inn group Whitbread and Sky TV are all up more than 200% Worst performing shares from FTSE 100 when Lehman collapsed Lonmin (mining business, extracting platinum in South Africa) -99.8% Royal Bank of Scotland -89.7% Lloyds Banking Group, Thomas Cook, outsourcing firm Capita and transport firm First Group are all still down more than 50% UK recession and recovery Economic output fell by 6.1% after the crash and it took 21 quarters for GDP to return to pre-crisis levels, according to ONS data. Real wages are still below pre-crisis levels. In September 2008, regular pay stood at \u00c2\u00a3465 a week, compared with \u00c2\u00a3461 today when inflation is taken into account. It dipped to \u00c2\u00a3442 per week in March 2014, also according to figures from the ONS. Employment, though, has soared in the last 10 years and unemployment has dropped to lows not seen since 1975. Following the 2008-09 recession the unemployment rate rose to 8.5% but has now receded to 4% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the lowest level for 43 years. Pension black holes Low interest rates and the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quantitative easing programme have driven down the interest rates pension funds can earn over the long term. The 10-year gilt yield, which is a proxy for the interest rate paid on government bonds, fell from 4.5% before the collapse of Lehman to around 3% in the aftermath, then fell back to below 2% during the eurozone debt crisis, then to a little over 0.5% after the Brexit vote. Pension liabilities, which are the long-term costs faced by a retirement plan, rise as gilt yields fall. So while lower interest payments on government debt is good for the Treasury, pension funds found their deficits widening. The 10-year gilt is now 1.49%. House prices Like share prices, house prices dipped following the crash only to recover in most parts of the country \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and spectacularly in London. In September 2007 the average UK house price was \u00c2\u00a3190,032. By March 2009 it was \u00c2\u00a3154,452, according to ONS/HM Land Resistry data.

                "bodyText":"The delivery company DPD is being sued over the death of a driver who collapsed after he missed hospital appointments because he feared the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s practice of charging drivers \u00c2\u00a3150 for missing work. The widow of Don Lane is demanding compensation from the firm which delivers parcels for retailers including Marks and Spencer and John Lewis. Lane, who had diabetes, died suddenly in January from the disease. DPD charged him \u00c2\u00a3150 when he attended one specialist renal appointment and he then missed others. He collapsed twice during rounds, including once while driving. Ruth Lane has lodged a claim at the employment tribunal in Bristol which alleges that Lane was ill and vomiting blood but attended work due to his fear of being fined for failing to attend work without permission. He completed his route but collapsed with a heart attack when he got home and died shortly afterwards in hospital. The claim also highlights the pressure Lane faced from DPD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s system of allocating short windows for each delivery which give customers certainty about when parcels will arrive. Lane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death was raised in parliament where both Labour and Conservatives reacted with outrage. It led to DPD promising to scrap the \u00c2\u00a3150 charges and offering couriers sick pay. The company made \u00c2\u00a3110m profit in the UK in 2016. Ruth Lane alleges her husband was bogusly self-employed and should have been classed as an employee with access to sick pay, holiday pay and the minimum wage. If the employment tribunal rules in her favour, DPD could be forced to change its entire business model which relies on self-employed couriers, which it describes as franchisees, being paid per parcel. A similar claim of bogus self-employment was upheld in the employment tribunal against the minicab firm Uber in 2017. Ruth Lane also alleges that DPD breached the Equalities Act by not adjusting its procedures to accommodate Lane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health condition. Her claim, on behalf of her husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s estate and filed by the solicitors Leigh Day, states: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153DPD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refusal to give permission for the claimant to take time off to attend these appointments meant that his disability was not properly monitored and that he did not have the opportunity to receive the appropriate treatments for his disability and related conditions, ultimately resulting in his death.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It also says Lane was given a rural route with long drives between stops, when he should have been given a more urban route with shorter stops to allow him to take more regular breaks and buy food. Lane collapsed twice at work with hypoglycemia, the first time at the wheel of his van, after which he was taken to hospital, the claim states. After the second collapse, three months before his death, his wife confronted his manager, Matt Poore. She complained that Lane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s route had not been changed despite his repeated requests. When Poore denied this, Ruth said other drivers had been given new routes which were local and less demanding, which Poore also denied. She pointed out that he needed regular meal breaks to maintain his blood sugar levels and Poore said this would be possible. However, the claim says, Lane and other DPD couriers started working to a system known by them as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153precise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which introduced shorter delivery windows that could not be changed by the driver. Lane often struggled to meet the required timeframes and complete all his deliveries. He was told he could be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153breached\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for missing slots and that three breaches could result in dismissal. A spokesman for DPD said the company was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unable to comment on any potential employment tribunal matters\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said drivers would be able to apply for a worker contract, rather than self-employment, from later this month. The contract would be for an average \u00c2\u00a328,800 per annum, based on a five-day week, with 28 days\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 paid holiday, a pension and sick pay.",

Those risky loans were sliced up and bundled with less risky ones and sold off in parcels to banks around the world. The belief was that these collateralised securities offered high returns at minimal risk. The belief was that not all mortgage borrowers would default at the same time. That belief was wrong.</p>\n    <p>Lehman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fate was sealed when Alistair Darling, the then chancellor, refused to provide state guarantees for the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover by Barclays. Bob Diamond, who was then the head of Barclays\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 investment bank, had been trying to broker over the weekend of 13-14 September. Darling later recalled: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I could not imagine standing up in the House of Commons on the Monday morning explaining that we had put the UK taxpayer in hock so that Barclays could buy Lehman. Half the Barclays board was relieved.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At 1am in New York on Monday 15 September the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers was declared.

                "bodyText":"The long, slow and premature death of the Post Office has been agonising to observe. Never has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153death by a thousand cuts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd been more apposite than the deliberate destruction of a once-proud service into the shabby shell of a business it is now. The litter-strewn floor of my scruffy and dimly-lit local branch is now squashed behind a Lebara phone merchant. As you join the long queue amid the discarded Coke cans and lottery scratchcards, you have time to scrutinise what is being advertised in the Post Office. The \u00c2\u00a3100 payday loan advert from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rhodes Finance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has outlasted the lender itself, which appears to be defunct. Nearby, a machine begs me to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153buy and sell crypto instantly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have more confidence in the spiritualist who, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m told, also used to advertise there. After trying to make sense speaking through screens (where staff wearily try to up-sell something or other), you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expected to deposit your parcel in an open-access window that almost invites thieves to walk off with your returned Amazon box. How different from the town-centre post office of my childhood, a grand and elegant high-ceilinged affair which sold not just stamps but represented the connection between the state and the citizen. It was where I sorted out my first passport and my first driving licence, where my dad paid his TV licence and my grandad picked up his pension. Yes, of course we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not sending letters like we used to. But need the business have sunk as low as it has? Unlike my bank branch, which I very rarely visit, there are still plenty of reasons to go to a post office. It can be the only explanation for the long queues.

                "body":"<p>Big business has predictably grumbled about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/23/labour-private-sector-employee-ownership-plan-john-mcdonnell\">John McDonnell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan</a> that every company with 250 or more employees should create an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inclusive ownership fund\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that will eventually own 10% of the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equity. But workers themselves may also have a few questions. One can understand the bald arithmetic that allows the shadow chancellor to say almost 11 million workers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could be \u00c2\u00a3500 a year better off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but, come on, his model is not employee share ownership as the rest of the world understands the term.</p> <p>First, why cap dividends per employee at \u00c2\u00a3500 a year? Last year Lloyds Banking Group paid \u00c2\u00a32.2bn to shareholders (ignoring the \u00c2\u00a31bn share buy-back), which would have meant \u00c2\u00a3220m for workers if their ownership fund had been at full size. Lloyds had 68,000 full-time equivalent employees on the last day of 2017, implying a shade over \u00c2\u00a33,200 per head for staff in dividends.

                "bodyText":"Big business has predictably grumbled about John McDonnell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan that every company with 250 or more employees should create an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inclusive ownership fund\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that will eventually own 10% of the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equity. But workers themselves may also have a few questions. One can understand the bald arithmetic that allows the shadow chancellor to say almost 11 million workers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could be \u00c2\u00a3500 a year better off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but, come on, his model is not employee share ownership as the rest of the world understands the term. First, why cap dividends per employee at \u00c2\u00a3500 a year? Last year Lloyds Banking Group paid \u00c2\u00a32.2bn to shareholders (ignoring the \u00c2\u00a31bn share buy-back), which would have meant \u00c2\u00a3220m for workers if their ownership fund had been at full size. Lloyds had 68,000 full-time equivalent employees on the last day of 2017, implying a shade over \u00c2\u00a33,200 per head for staff in dividends. But, under McDonnell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan, the annual maximum would be \u00c2\u00a3500 per employee. The bulk \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slightly more than \u00c2\u00a32,700 per employee, or about \u00c2\u00a3185m \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would go to Treasury coffers. That looks more like a dividend tax than a gain for lower-paid Lloyds staff. Second, what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to stop employers trying to suppress wages to compensate for the cost of the new shares? From companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 point of view, issuing equity is not free. The more shares that are issued, the more earnings per share are diluted.

Issuing shareholder proxy votes, voting on others? If so, that seems like a more ethically motivated fund to me, because they are exerting additional effort many other funds do not bother with.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>In recent years, Goldman executives have been fighting off SRI resolutions at their own company, including initiatives that have asked management to more transparently disclose their <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/s/2018-proxy-statement/images/Goldman_Sach-Proxy2018.pdf\">political lobbying</a> and create a <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-relations/financials/archived/proxy-statements/docs/2013-proxy-statement-pdf.pdf\">human rights committee</a> to review the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies regarding doing business with governments engaged in censorship and repression. Only three months before Goldman announced the Just fund, Goldman successfully <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2018/harringtoninvestments031218-14a8.pdf\">pressed</a> the Securities and Exchange Commission to bless its move to block shareholders from voting on a resolution asking the company to honor indigenous peoples\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extraordinary no action request shows the notable lengths that the company is willing to go, and to stretch credulity, in order to prevent its directors from shouldering fiduciary obligations on indigenous and human rights,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wrote shareholder proponents at the time.</p> <p>Last year, Goldman was lauded by <a href=\"https://shareaction.org/warming-up-to-climate-resolutions/\">Share Action</a>, an SRI activist group, for switching its position and using its holdings to support a series of climate-change-related shareholder initiatives. In its <a href=\"https://www.gsam.com/content/dam/gsam/pdfs/us/en/miscellaneous/voting_proxy_policy.pdf?sa=n&amp;rd=n\">proxy voting guidelines</a>, Goldman says it will generally vote for proposals asking companies to report on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153policies, initiatives and oversight mechanisms related to environmental sustainability, or how the company may be impacted by climate change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>However, those guidelines do not make the same commitment when it comes to initiatives requiring companies to actually reduce their carbon emissions. The guidelines also say the company will generally vote against \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proposals requesting increased disclosure of a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies with respect to political contributions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

The majority of funds voted in support of just one, a request for the company to prepare a report on its efforts to minimize methane emissions. In every other case, the funds unanimously or overwhelmingly opposed the proposals.</p> <p>Proxy-voting records from dozens of shareholder meetings reviewed by Capital &amp; Main show a similar pattern. In rare cases, Goldman funds did vote in favor of some shareholder reforms, including the preparation of a report on the gender pay gap at Facebook and Google. At several pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie, Amgen and Eli Lilly, Goldman funds supported increased accountability for executives regarding high drug prices.</p> <p>Such votes, however, were few and far between. Of the 10 companies that make up the largest share of Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Just fund, eight considered shareholder-proposed reforms that were overwhelmingly opposed by Goldman-managed funds at their most recent annual meetings. The proposals included prohibitions on offshore tax avoidance schemes, increased transparency on lobbying activities and requirements that companies appoint an independent board chair \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a governance model that advocates say leads to more responsible corporate behavior. The remaining two companies, Microsoft and Visa, did not consider any shareholder proposals.</p> <p>At JPMorgan, the recipient of Just\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth-largest investment, Goldman funds voted unanimously against a requirement for the company to release a report on its investments in PetroChina, a firm that <a href=\"https://www.investorsagainstgenocide.org/\">activists accuse</a> of helping to fund crimes against humanity due to its ongoing business relationships with oppressive regimes in Syria and Sudan. Goldman made that move despite its own <a href=\"https://www.gsam.com/content/dam/gsam/pdfs/us/en/miscellaneous/voting_proxy_policy.pdf?sa=n&amp;rd=n\">proxy voting guidelines</a> saying the company would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153generally vote for proposals requesting a report on company or company supplier labor and/or human rights standards and policies, or on the impact of its operations on society\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>Eighteen of the 19 Goldman funds with shares in JPMorgan also voted against an effort to prohibit the accelerated vesting of awards for executives who enter government service, a practice often <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/120967/wall-street-pays-bankers-work-government-and-wants-it-secret\">criticized</a> for fueling the revolving door between Wall Street and financial regulators.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.investor.jnj.com/_document/2018-proxy-statement?id=00000162-2469-d298-ad7a-657f7bcf0000\">shareholder proposal</a> to the board of pharmaceutical manufacturer Johnson &amp; Johnson, expressing concern that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s compensation practices \u00e2\u20ac\u0153may insulate senior executives from legal risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd relating to the opioids crisis, recommended that opioid-related litigation costs be factored into executive pay. All 16 Goldman funds with stock in Johnson &amp; Johnson voted to defeat the proposal.</p> <p>Goldman asserts that its fund is designed to invest in firms that rank well in Just Capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ratings. But even that assertion is not what it seems.</p> <p>Because the index features companies ranked in the top half of their respective industries, it includes dozens of firms in sectors like energy and financial services that score poorly overall. For example, the fund invests in both National Oilwell Varco, a drilling equipment firm, and Entergy, a Louisiana utility, despite the fact that the companies rank 626th and 676th, respectively, among the 875 companies evaluated by Just Capital.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every industry is represented at approximately the same weight as [in] the Russell 1000,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Just Capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hernando Cortina, referring to the best-known index fund tracking the largest publicly traded companies. Cortina added that the Just fund is designed to feature responsible companies \u00e2\u20ac\u0153while providing diversified equity exposure to every industry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>Lisa Lindsley of SumOfUs said the situation spotlights how socially responsible investing is seen on Wall Street not as a values-based cause, but as yet another way to trick investors into believing that the investment industry has reformed itself a decade after the financial crisis.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The reason they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going into this is that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money there.

                "bodyText":"When Goldman Sachs and billionaire Paul Tudor Jones announced a partnership three months ago to help socially conscious investors support \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just business behavior\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, they promised that their new index fund would generate solid returns for savers while directing their investment dollars towards truly humane companies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Capitalism should be a positive force for change,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jones in a press release announcing the fund, which is designed to track an index of socially responsible companies identified by his non-profit Just Capital. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Its future will be driven by a new definition of corporate success that is aligned with the values and priorities of the public.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The partnership comes as pension funds, university endowments and other institutional investors increasingly seek to put their financial weight behind ethical and sustainable corporate behavior. So far, the rebrand seems to be working: the Just fund debuted in June to rave reviews from the financial press and ended its first day of trading with over $250m in assets, making its launch one of the most successful in recent history. However, a Capital &amp; Main review of corporate documents shows that some of Just\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest investments are in fossil fuel firms that have been sued for suppressing global climate research, Wall Street behemoths fined for defrauding investors, a social media platform accused of helping rig elections and a tech industry giant criticized for paying its workers starvation wages. Moreover, proxy voting records reveal that even as Goldman Sachs now markets itself as a champion of social responsibility, the firm has been using its existing stakes in many Just fund companies to help CEOs block key environmental and social justice reforms proposed by their shareholders. Those initiatives range from gender pay gap and diversity initiatives to corporate governance reforms; from efforts to increase lobbying transparency to prohibitions on doing business with companies tied to genocide and other human rights violations. Meanwhile, in the months before Just fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s launch, Goldman was slammed for blocking a human rights resolution at its own company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and one of Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key lobbying groups in Washington was working to shape Republican legislation that would make it far more difficult for shareholders to file environmental, human rights and other socially minded initiatives in the future. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to, with a straight face, invest in the Dakota Access Pipeline with your left hand, and with your right hand tell people that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing responsible investing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lisa Lindsley, capital markets adviser for the shareholder advocacy group SumOfUs, told Capital &amp; Main. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The compartmentalization is very hypocritical.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Through a spokesperson, Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the process by which its equity funds vote on shareholder proposals, and how that process may differ with the Just fund \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which, as a newly launched fund, has not yet participated in proxy voting for any of the companies in which it holds stock. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcEthically motivated versus a more greenwashing approach\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new fund spotlights socially responsible investing (SRI) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a financial strategy that represents Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more affirmative answer to negative or exclusionary \u00e2\u20ac\u0153screening\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tactics like divestment from fossil fuel producers and tobacco firms. While a recent directive by the Trump administration has been viewed by some experts as an effort to limit SRI strategies, the market for such investments remains strong. According to the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, US-based assets managed using SRI strategies more than doubled to $8.7tn between 2012 and 2016, and now account for more than one in five dollars under professional management in the country. The rise in SRI investment comes amid questions about whether corporate boards are adequately evaluating environmental and social justice concerns when they look at their company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term financial prospects. PwC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2017 survey of corporate officials found \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that directors are clearly out of step with investor priorities in some critical areas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the report added that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of these areas is environmental issues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. High-profile initiatives like the Just fund are a chance for the industry to tout its eagerness, as the Goldman Sachs executive Timothy O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill put it in a press release, to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[allow] investment to flow toward a more sustainable and equitable future, while seeking to generate attractive returns for investors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The trend has given Wall Street an opportunity for an image makeover in a time of growing public distrust in the financial system: According to a Gallup poll conducted last month, fewer than half of Americans under 30 report having a positive view of capitalism, a 12-point drop in just the past two years. For some activists and investors, though, the rapid expansion of the market for SRI-branded financial products has raised concerns about greenwashing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the practice by which companies market themselves as socially or environmentally responsible without actually adopting business practices that meet those goals. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Putting the word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcethical\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsustainable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the name of a fund does not make it so,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a report by British investment advisory firm Castlefield, whose recent reports documented how some environmental funds include investments in fossil fuel firms. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is increasingly important to differentiate between those funds genuinely responding to customer demand for a sustainable approach and those which use terms like ethical, Socially Responsible Investment or stewardship in their name but include companies such as British American Tobacco or Shell in their key holdings.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record on socially responsible investing Amid surging interest in SRI funds, Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Just US Large Cap Equity ETF aims to convince investors that the company is serious about injecting a spirit of ethics and morality into its financial strategies. To that end, the fund says it directs money only into companies that are ranked highly by Just Capital. The 426 companies featured in the Just index were selected on the basis of their performance across seven different criteria, including labor practices, customer service and environmental impacts. Goldman itself ranks in the top tenth of the Just rankings, despite the company being attacked for supporting the fossil fuel industry and also being fined $5bn in 2016 by the Department of Justice for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages, when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Whether Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Just fund represents a step in a larger shift towards socially responsible investment remains to be seen. Baruch College\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jared Peifer says that one way to judge a firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to social responsibility is to watch how it deals with resolutions brought by shareholders, whereby investors attempt to force management to adopt socially responsible policies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is variance to the degree that SRI funds are ethically motivated versus a more greenwashing approach,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Peifer said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is the fund dialoguing with management? Issuing shareholder proxy votes, voting on others? If so, that seems like a more ethically motivated fund to me, because they are exerting additional effort many other funds do not bother with.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In recent years, Goldman executives have been fighting off SRI resolutions at their own company, including initiatives that have asked management to more transparently disclose their political lobbying and create a human rights committee to review the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies regarding doing business with governments engaged in censorship and repression. Only three months before Goldman announced the Just fund, Goldman successfully pressed the Securities and Exchange Commission to bless its move to block shareholders from voting on a resolution asking the company to honor indigenous peoples\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extraordinary no action request shows the notable lengths that the company is willing to go, and to stretch credulity, in order to prevent its directors from shouldering fiduciary obligations on indigenous and human rights,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wrote shareholder proponents at the time. Last year, Goldman was lauded by Share Action, an SRI activist group, for switching its position and using its holdings to support a series of climate-change-related shareholder initiatives. In its proxy voting guidelines, Goldman says it will generally vote for proposals asking companies to report on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153policies, initiatives and oversight mechanisms related to environmental sustainability, or how the company may be impacted by climate change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, those guidelines do not make the same commitment when it comes to initiatives requiring companies to actually reduce their carbon emissions. The guidelines also say the company will generally vote against \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proposals requesting increased disclosure of a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies with respect to political contributions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The company further says it will vote to remove representatives of employees or organized labor from a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board if they are overseeing company audits or executive compensation, and if there is no legal requirement for them to be in that position. Goldman votes against resolutions at Just fund companies Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hostility toward many SRI initiatives is illustrated by its votes on resolutions at the companies now in its Just fund. For example, there is Chevron Corporation, which ranks as the Just fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 17th-largest holding as it faces accusations that it is trying to intimidate environmentalists and avoid cleaning up pollution in the Amazon rainforest. In May, the oil giant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders were asked to vote on a slate of seven proposals, including a requirement for the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board to nominate a director with environmental experience; the preparation of a report on transitioning to a low-carbon business model; increased transparency relating to lobbying activities; and stronger prohibitions on Chevron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interests overseas from doing business with governments that are complicit in genocide or crimes against humanity. As shareholders in Chevron, 14 different Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) funds voted on these proposals. The majority of funds voted in support of just one, a request for the company to prepare a report on its efforts to minimize methane emissions. In every other case, the funds unanimously or overwhelmingly opposed the proposals. Proxy-voting records from dozens of shareholder meetings reviewed by Capital &amp; Main show a similar pattern. In rare cases, Goldman funds did vote in favor of some shareholder reforms, including the preparation of a report on the gender pay gap at Facebook and Google. At several pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie, Amgen and Eli Lilly, Goldman funds supported increased accountability for executives regarding high drug prices. Such votes, however, were few and far between. Of the 10 companies that make up the largest share of Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Just fund, eight considered shareholder-proposed reforms that were overwhelmingly opposed by Goldman-managed funds at their most recent annual meetings. The proposals included prohibitions on offshore tax avoidance schemes, increased transparency on lobbying activities and requirements that companies appoint an independent board chair \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a governance model that advocates say leads to more responsible corporate behavior. The remaining two companies, Microsoft and Visa, did not consider any shareholder proposals. At JPMorgan, the recipient of Just\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth-largest investment, Goldman funds voted unanimously against a requirement for the company to release a report on its investments in PetroChina, a firm that activists accuse of helping to fund crimes against humanity due to its ongoing business relationships with oppressive regimes in Syria and Sudan. Goldman made that move despite its own proxy voting guidelines saying the company would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153generally vote for proposals requesting a report on company or company supplier labor and/or human rights standards and policies, or on the impact of its operations on society\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Eighteen of the 19 Goldman funds with shares in JPMorgan also voted against an effort to prohibit the accelerated vesting of awards for executives who enter government service, a practice often criticized for fueling the revolving door between Wall Street and financial regulators. A shareholder proposal to the board of pharmaceutical manufacturer Johnson &amp; Johnson, expressing concern that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s compensation practices \u00e2\u20ac\u0153may insulate senior executives from legal risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd relating to the opioids crisis, recommended that opioid-related litigation costs be factored into executive pay. All 16 Goldman funds with stock in Johnson &amp; Johnson voted to defeat the proposal. Goldman asserts that its fund is designed to invest in firms that rank well in Just Capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ratings. But even that assertion is not what it seems. Because the index features companies ranked in the top half of their respective industries, it includes dozens of firms in sectors like energy and financial services that score poorly overall. For example, the fund invests in both National Oilwell Varco, a drilling equipment firm, and Entergy, a Louisiana utility, despite the fact that the companies rank 626th and 676th, respectively, among the 875 companies evaluated by Just Capital. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every industry is represented at approximately the same weight as [in] the Russell 1000,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Just Capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hernando Cortina, referring to the best-known index fund tracking the largest publicly traded companies. Cortina added that the Just fund is designed to feature responsible companies \u00e2\u20ac\u0153while providing diversified equity exposure to every industry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Lisa Lindsley of SumOfUs said the situation spotlights how socially responsible investing is seen on Wall Street not as a values-based cause, but as yet another way to trick investors into believing that the investment industry has reformed itself a decade after the financial crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The reason they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going into this is that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money there. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all driven by greed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty easy to do some greenwashing and call yourself a responsible investment manager.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As Goldman now markets its Just fund, it remains unclear whether the company will change its proxy voting or its posture towards shareholder resolutions in general. Those resolutions, though, could be more rare, if congressional Republicans pass their legislation that would make it more difficult for shareholder resolutions to qualify for a vote. Federal records show that the American Bankers Association \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which lists Goldman Sachs as a member \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has been lobbying on that bill, which critics say could undermine the SRI movement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Shareholder proposals play an important role in ensuring that owners get a say in how their companies are run, and in setting the broader agenda across the market,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wrote Dimitri Zagoroff of the shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Making it harder for shareholder proposals to be resubmitted from year to year would make it that much harder for proponents to refine their ideas and build a coalition of support. This often takes several years, both to generate interest in the underlying topic, and to convince other shareholders that the specific proposal offers the appropriate means of addressing the topic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Co-published by Capital &amp; Main, a non-profit investigative news site based in Los Angeles.",
