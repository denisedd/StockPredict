                "bodyText":"Time for a recap: Mark Carney has taken a big step towards staying on as Bank of England governor to help Britain through the choppy waters after Brexit. After days of speculation, Carney revealed that he had offered to do whatever he could to ensure Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU was smooth. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big hint that he could stay in post beyond June 2019 - potentially for another year, or even until the end of a Brexit transition period. He told the Treasury committee that: I am willing to do whatever else I can in order to promote both a smooth Brexit and effective transition at the Bank of England. The chancellor and I have discussed this. I would expect an announcement to be made in due course.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know exactly what Carney is proposing.... Carney also flagged up that it could be easier to appoint a successor once there is more clarity about Brexit, and insisted there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no shortage of good candidates for one of the biggest jobs in central banking. The Treasury has declined to respond, saying Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153speak for themselves\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but promised that an announcement is coming. Commitee chair Nicky Morgan is pushing for a quick decision. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office has indicated that the PM wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t oppose an extension to Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contract, saying he has done a good job. Carney also tried to placate Brexit-supporters, indicating that the prospect of Boris Johnson or even Jacob Rees-Mogg becoming PM wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shake his enthusiasm for the job. Some City investors have welcomed the news, saying it would provide much-needed stability. During the hearing at parliament, the Bank of England also warned MPs that a no-deal Brexit would drive up prices in the shops and send the pound tumbling (just the sort of comments that have upset Leave supporters in the past). As Carney put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely that the real income squeeze will return for households across the country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t avoid that medium-term impact on real incomes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There was little reaction in the markets to Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer, with the pound dipping against the US dollar today. In other news... Amazon has followed Apple to become America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second $1trn company (although shares have dropped back from their earlier peak). TSB CEO Paul Pester has (finally) paid the price for the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IT meltdown. Growth in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector has hit a three-month low South Africa has lurched into recession, sending its currency sliding again. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Another central banker, Alan Greenspan, once remarked that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mark Carney has hacked back to that particular Greenspan doctrine at times over the last five years. And even today, as Channel 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business editor, Siobhan Kennedy, points out, we still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know exactly what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening over the governorship.... Back in the financial markets, Amazon just hit a $1trn market capitalisation. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price rose over the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmagic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 figure of $2050.27, making it the second US company - after Apple - to be worth $1,000,000,000,000. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value has surged in the last year, as the company has continued to post strong sales growth and cement its strong position in web services and the cloud. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s super news for anyone who bought shares 20 years ago, or indeed last autumn! The Treasury committee hearing has wrapped up. And across the road in Westminster, Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokeswoman has confirmed that an announcement on Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future is being worked on. Reuters has the details: British Prime Minister Theresa May thinks Mark Carney has done a good job as governor of the Bank of England, her spokeswoman said on Tuesday, adding that there would be further announcements on the matter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The prime minister obviously thinks he has done a good job in his time as governor, and there will be more to say on that in due course,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the spokeswoman told reporters. Carney said earlier he was ready to extend his time in charge of the central bank to help Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy as it leaves the EU. Nicky Morgan MP, Chair of the Treasury Committee, has urged the Treasury to make a decision about Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future soon - and press on with finding his successor too. She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In his evidence session with the Treasury Committee today, Mark Carney indicated that he is willing to stay as Governor of the Bank of England beyond June 2019 if it would assist the Government. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stability is vital during this important period. The sooner the Government provides clarity, the better. Any extension to Dr Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s term should not be used to delay succession planning.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd John Mann MP then asks BoE chief economist Andy Haldane how he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d deliver on Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy to make the Bank boost UK productivity. Under this plan, the BoE would be set a new 3% productivity growth target (alongside its 2% inflation goal) How, Mann asks, would this be achieved? What tools would be deployed? Haldane scratches his ear, and explains that while such targets are a good idea, the key question is who is best placed to deliver them. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existing mandate for price stability and financial stability should help productivity growth, but they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deliver it on their own, he says. In the long run, though, productivity growth depends on having a skilled and educated workforce, and infrastructure improvements. And, Haldane concludes, central banks do not build roads or railways, hospitals or schools. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t train apprentices, and they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t teach schoolchildren. Governor Carney adds that the Bank would have greater responsibility for productivity, but not more powers to solve the problems. We wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the tools, Mr Mann, to achieve it. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Giles suggests this might put the bank in a sticky situation: John Mann MP asks Carney if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d still want to be Bank of England governor if Boris Johnson or Jacob Rees-Mogg were prime minister in June 2019. Carney suggests that this wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put him off. These jobs are technocratic jobs. You serve the remit set by parliament and the government of the day. A former Bank of England policymaker, Andrew Sentance, has criticised the whole circus around Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session follows days of speculation about whether the Treasury and the Bank were trying to hammer out an agreement to keep the governor for longer. That, Sentance told Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World at One, bad for the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credibility: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It seems like the appointment of the governor is something that is happening between the Chancellor and the governor, and is not happening in a transparent way. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It seems an awful lot is happening in this appointment process behind the scenes and that is not good in terms of the independence of the Bank of England.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Treasury committee member Wes Streeting has welcomed Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer to stay on longer, and hopes an announcement comes soon. Ed Conway of Sky News suspects that Carney could actually extend his governorship to 2021, rather than leaving in June 2019 as currently planned. That would mean a full eight-year stint (he started in summer 2013) - the standard term for BoE governors. Q: How vulnerable is sterling to a sudden devaluation? Mark Carney takes a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglass half-full\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 approach. He thinks the pound is currently suffering from the risk of a no-deal Brexit, so it might rise if an agreement and a transition deal is reached. But if that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen, the pound would move the other way, he explains. Quilter Investors head of investment, Anthony Gillham, believes the UK government should accept Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer to stay longer at the Bank of England. Gillham concedes that Carney hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153universally popular\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (particularly with Leave supporters, who have hated his warnings about Brexit). But even so, Britain would benefit from an experienced hand at the top of the Bank in the likely turbulent times ahead. Gillham writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Central banks have done a lot of heavy lifting over the last decade in an effort to restore economic stability, although they have often been required to swim upstream against a current of destabilising political uncertainty. As if to illustrate the point, despite the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to protect sterling over the summer, we have seen the pound chasing up positive sentiment around Brexit, before following it back down when the political rhetoric changes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenure is extended he will have his work cut out, but the case for an experienced captain to guide the UK through dangerous waters has grown stronger as Brexit negotiations have dragged on. He will install a measure of certainty on monetary policy, which provides some air cover through what will surely be an unpredictable spell. As Bank of England governor Mark Carney hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always been universally popular, but appointing him as temporary caretaker through this period of transition does make sense.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Treasury have declined to comment on Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments today, but have confirmed that an announcement will come in due course. The committee have moved away from Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future, and onto the impact of artificial intelligence on the UK economy (are they suggesting the governor could be replaced by a robot?). Q: How many jobs will be lost to the fourth industrial revolution? Chief economist Andy Haldane says estimates for gross job losses range from 10% and 50% of the global workforce - as jobs are automated or entire professions are replaced with software. Of course, you also need to factor in how many new jobs are created (coding all those robots etc) But the big picture is that the gross job losses due to AI, big data, etc, the gross job losses will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at least as large and possibly larger as in previous industrial revolutions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Haldane adds. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on governor Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to help Britain through Brexit by serving longer at the Bank of England: Mark Carney has confirmed he is in talks with the Treasury over staying on at the Bank of England to smooth any potential fallout from Brexit. Dropping the broadest possible hint he could remain at Threadneedle Street beyond his scheduled departure date in June, the Bank of England governor said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even though I have already agreed to extend my time to support a smooth Brexit, I am willing to do whatever else I can in order to promote both a smooth Brexit and an effective transition at the Bank of England.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney confirmed he had held talks with the chancellor, Philip Hammond, over his future, and said an announcement would be made by the government \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in due course\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Speaking to MPs on the Treasury committee, tasked with scrutinising appointments at the central bank, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am signalling a willingness to do whatever I can to support this process.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd...

Carney says that any such cut in tariffs would be countered by a slump in sterling after a no-deal Brexit (driving up imports). There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much reaction in the financial markets to Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer to serve longer at the Bank of England. The pound is still down 0.25% against the US dollar today, at $1.284. I guess that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because a) there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no actual announcement yet, b) the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns about Brexit extend well beyond the identity of the Bank of England governor, and c) most currencies have slipped against the US dollar today. Mary Carney weighs in too -- he says that it is unlikely that Britain would leave the EU without a deal or a transition deal in March. But if that unlikely scenario does happen, the Bank would do what it could to mitigate the impact on UK real incomes, the governor says. However, there are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclimits\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to how much the Bank could tolerate a slump in the pound (in other words, it might be forced to raise interest rates to support sterling). The Treasury committee are now quizzing the Bank about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the UK economy. What might happen to food prices and the cost of living if we reach March 2019 without a deal between the UK and the EU, and both sides walk away? Chief economist Andy Haldane says it would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153material rise in the cost of things in the shops\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, particularly items that are imported from overseas. That would be due to a weaker pound and higher tariffs on those goods, he explains. Q: How long would that effect last for? History shows that it often persists for several years, Haldane replies. Carney is asked about his warning last month that a no-deal Brexit is an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncomfortably high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd risk. Q: Does that mean that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now a 60:40 chance? [as trade secretary Liam Fox claimed]. Carney replies that this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t what he meant. Brexit negotiations are approaching a critical time, and thus the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee is very focused on the risks. Mark Carney is also asked about the resignation of TSB chief executive Paul Pester this morning, following its IT meltdown. He replies that senior managers must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd take responsibility for failures on their watch - be they conduct, operational or financial. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Responsibility has now been taken\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a series of quite fundamental failings that have disadvantaged many customers and hurt confidence in TSB, he continues coldly (is he suggesting Pester should have quit earlier?) We look forward to a new team being put in place, the governor continues briskly. Q: Has the governor given any thought to who might (eventually) succeed him? Mark Carney declines to suggest a shortlist, saying only that there are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153many qualified candidates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Then, rather interestingly, he says there are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some advantages\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to running the recruitment process at a time when both sides have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153full knowledge of the exact form of Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which the country has chosen. In other words: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather hard to recruit a world-class central banker to run the Bank of England when you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know whether Britain will crash out of the EU without a deal before they even get their feet under the desk.... Some snap reaction to Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments: Unfortunately, Mark Carney has declined to reveal his decision today - after all, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to announce. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made them aware of my willingness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to do what I can to help, he adds. Carney adds that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a privilege to work at the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Treasury committee member Wes Streeting has welcomed Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments. [For anyone just tuning in... Mark Carney is currently due to leave the Bank in nine months time. He was originally due to depart this summer, but in 2016 he agreed to stay on until June 2019. Now a further extension is on the cards...] Nicky Morgan begins the session by joking that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t attracted much press attention -- and then reads out a stream of headlines about Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future at the Bank of England. Can he shed any light on whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stay longer at the Bank? Governor Carney replies that at this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153critical period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153important that everyone does everything they can to help with the transition of exiting the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That includes parliamentarians, business people and central bankers. Carney says: Accordingly, even though I have already agreed to extend my time to support a smooth Brexit, I am willing to do whatever else I can in order to promote both a smooth Brexit and an effective transition at the Bank of England. That sounds like a heavy hint that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stay at the Bank, beyond June 2019 - his current exit date. Carney adds that he has already discussed this issue with the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and he expects an announcement to be made in due course. More to follow! Parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury committee has begun its hearing with Bank of England governor Mark Carney. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accompanied by chief economist Andy Haldane, and Monetary Policy Committee member Silvana Tenreyro. On the agenda: Last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise, the outlook for UK growth and inflation, and the state of the economy. Brexit, and Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own future, will surely also come up too..... The session is being streamed here. Joel Hills of ITV News reckons Mark Carney wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t considering an an extra shift at the Bank of England two months ago. But perhaps things have changed, now the Treasury have been (apparently) proposing the governor stays in post until 2020. Just an hour to wait until MPs on the Treasury committee grill Mark Carney about the possibility of extending his contract beyond June 2019. Craig Erlam of City trading firm OANDA suggests the governor might refuse to be drawn about the issue today (he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s officially there to discuss August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report). Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance before the Treasury Select Committee on Tuesday comes with an additional twist, following reports that the Treasury is trying to persuade him to extend his term \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which ends in the middle of next year - by another 12 months. Carney has already agreed to one extension in order to oversee the Brexit process and the government is clearly hopeful that he will contemplate one more so as to provide some source of stability in otherwise uncertain times. He hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been the most popular of Governors, primarily among Brexiteers, who are still angry about his predictions on the economy prior to the referendum in the event of a vote to leave. You have to wonder why Carney would choose to remain in the hot seat given the hand he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been given and the constant criticism he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s received. Perhaps this is one reason why efforts are being made to retain him for now, it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be one of the most sought after jobs at the minute. The Press Association have compiled a handy Q&amp;A on the IT crisis at TSB. Q: Why has TSB come under the spotlight? A: Problems erupted following a migration of customer data from former owner Lloyds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 IT system to a new one managed by TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current owner Sabadell. Up to 1.9 million people using TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s digital and mobile banking found themselves locked out of their bank accounts. Some customers were unable to access their cash or pay bills - while others reported being able to see other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accounts. The Information Commissioner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office, which monitors data and privacy, previously said it was looking into the situation. MPs on the Treasury Committee heard from the bank in April that 40,000 complaints were received over a 10-day period. By the end of July, over 135,000 complaints had been logged. Q:What about people who have incurred charges because of the hitches? A: TSB has promised that its customers will not be left out of pocket as a result of the glitches. They can raise a complaint with the bank, and if they are still unhappy after giving it a chance to respond they can complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service, which resolves disputes between consumers and firms. Q: Have other problems emerged? A: MPs have voiced strong concerns over how the problems were handled and fears were also raised about some people being targeted by fraudsters following the IT issues. The saga took another twist when it emerged some former TSB customers had found their direct debits had been cancelled and firms were apparently told that they had died. And customers of the bank have faced further frustration just this week, with many unable to access their accounts on Monday. Q: What indications have there been as to how TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s customers are feeling about the bank? A: A recent survey from MoneySavingExpert.com saw TSB tumble down the website\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rankings in terms of customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 satisfaction with their bank. MoneySavingExpert.com said last week that TSB had plummeted from 4th to 11th place in its latest banking customer service survey, which the consumer help website carries out twice a year. Some 49% of those who graded TSB said its service was poor and just 23% deemed it great. Meanwhile, a separate survey carried out in July for GoCompare Money found 16% of TSB customers surveyed are considering switching banks. Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Treasury Minister, has also welcomed Paul Pester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153TSB customers have suffered inexcusable levels of disruption and received service which has fallen far short of accepted standards. It is right that the most senior person at the bank has been held accountable for this. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A decade on from the financial crisis, senior individuals taking responsibility in this way will be an essential building block of restoring public trust in our banking sector.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Angela Monaghan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news story on the shake-up at TSB (and its latest technology problems). TSB have written to Treasury committee chair Nicky Morgan MP, confirming that Paul Pester has stepped down (three months after the committee said they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d lost confidence in him). They may not have much confidence in Pester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacement either; executive chairman Richard Meddings apparently thinks it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019! Not a great look from a bank trying to shake off a reputation for IT problems. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine the right honourable member for Loughborough appreciates being hailed as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd either! In reply, Nicky Morgan has welcomed Pester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure...and warned that that bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over. The Committee remains concerned about the continuing problems at TSB, including unacceptable delays in compensating customers who have been badly let down. It is to be hoped that Dr Pester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successor is able to restore the confidence of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-suffering customers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lurch into recession is a blow to new prime minister Cyril Ramaphosa, who succeeded Jacob Zuma earlier this year: Newsflash: South Africa has fallen into recession. New figures show that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP shrank by 0.7% in the second quarter of 2018 - news which is sending currency into a fresh dive. Economists had expected growth of around 0.6%, after a sharp slump earlier this year. Instead, South Africa has now racked up two consecutive quarterly contractions - the classic definition of a recession. The South African rand has promptly slumped by 2% against the US dollar, extending its earlier losses. Blane Perrotton, managing director of property consultancy and surveyors Naismiths, spies an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uneasy calm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building sector. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on drop in the UK construction PMI in August: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Though levels of optimism have sagged, construction firms continue to hire, though this is likely to be driven by the need to get existing projects completed rather than a great bet on future demand. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With Brexit storm clouds still looming on the horizon, the current modest progress is as much as can be expected \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially in the South East. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Other markets are looking more buoyant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly the West Midlands and Bristol \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but as the countdown to Brexit enters its final months, businesses\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 gnawing sense of uncertainty will continue to peg back levels of investment. In that context, a steady ship should be seen as a real achievement.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Financial analyst Emanuele Canegrati of BP Prime says the PMI is much weaker than expected. But Max Jones of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking is more optimistic: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recent results from contractors indicate some softness in civil engineering and sentiment here has not been helped by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement that Crossrail project is behind schedule. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yet even if the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current infrastructure pipeline may not be quite as bulging as some would hope, mega-projects like Heathrow, Hinkley Point and HS2 continue to offer quality work for firms right down the supply chain. Importantly, minds are focused on discipline, with anecdotal evidence that firms are holding prices during bidding negotiations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the commercial market still looks fragile, much of this has to do with fears about the London market. Confidence in the capital remains intrinsically tied to Brexit, so any developments or certainty in negotiations will be warmly welcomed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Growth in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector has hit a three-month low in August, a new survey shows. Housebuilding growth slipped to its weakest rate since March, according to data firm Markit. That won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide the new homes needed to tackle the UK housing shortage. Civil engineering output was also disappointing, and actually fell in August, while commercial building work accelerated. This pulled Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI down to 52.9, much weaker than July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 55.8. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not far from the 50-point mark showing stagnation. It means builders could take breather after a busy few months, as Tim Moore, associate director at IHS Markit, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The construction sector slipped back into a slower growth phase in August, with this summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s catch- up effect starting to unwind after projects were delayed by adverse weather at the start of 2018. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Civil engineering was the worst performing area of the construction sector, with output in this category falling for the first time since March amid reports citing a lack of new work on infrastructure projects. House building saw a particularly sharp slowdown since July, meaning that commercial construction was the fastest growing sub-sector in August. The pound isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only currency under pressure today. Indeed, the US dollar is strengthening across the board, bringing more pain to emerging markets such as South Africa and Indonesia. Several senior economists are unimpressed by the swirling uncertainty over Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management school, argues that the governor should pledge to stay until 2021. That would be the typical eight-year term, rather than Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned six-year stint [ending in June 2019]. In a letter to the FT, professor Milas says this is the wrong time for a change of governor: The rumour is that Mr Carney is considering a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Treasury request to serve another year as governor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This will make it a seven-year service at the bank rather than the eight-year service advertised by the Treasury back in 2012. Assuming that the rumour is a fact, the Treasury is indeed correct in asking Mr Carney to continue as governor at the bank. A critical, yet unwritten, rule of football is never substituting a player \u00e2\u20ac\u201d let alone your (monetary policy) captain \u00e2\u20ac\u201d when defending a corner. Indeed, with Brexit headwinds remaining quite strong, this is not the time to replace the governor. That said, Mr Carney needs to commit to his full eight-year tenure. He is not a player on loan where he has the luxury to extend by one year and then by another one. As simple as that. However, former Bank of England policymaker Andrew Sentance has criticised the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153charade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd around the governorship. He argues that the independence of the Bank is at risk: In the City, the pound is dropping again as traders fret about Brexit....and the uncertainty at the Bank of England. Sterling is down half a cent against the US dollar at $1.2825, having lost almost a cent on Monday. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Speculation over Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future at the Bank of England, and the continued opposition to Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chequers plan failed to help the pound recover Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses as Tuesday got underway. The problem isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that Carney might stay on longer, but the fact he might not, his tenure as central bank chief set to end just after Britain officially leaves the EU. Combine this with the renewed attacks on May from Brexit hardliners and sterling couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really do anything positive after the bell. Despite the sometimes-shambolic state of TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service since April, it appears that Paul Pester could still pick up a bonus. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official line: Paul will be paid in line with the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remuneration policy and the terms of his contract. The release of variable pay will take into account the outcome of performance conditions as well as ongoing regulatory and independent investigations. Wes Streeting MP, another member of the Treasury committee, thinks Paul Pester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come fast enough . Alison McGovern MP reminds us that the Treasury committee asked TSB to consider Pester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position three months ago. Still, at least they got today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement out.... Paul Pester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure comes five months after TSB suffered one of the worst IT crises in years, when a technology migration was botched, leaving thousands of customers unable to access their accounts. Pester was roasted by MPs over his handling of the crisis; his future has been in doubt since June when the Treasury Committee said they had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lost confidence\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in him. And the gremlins returned to TSB over the weekend, when \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcplanned maintenance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 went wrong, leaving customers fuming. Perhaps that was the last straw - either for Sabadell or Pester himself.... Breaking: Paul Pester, the boss of TSB, has resigned - as the bank is struck by ANOTHER tech meltdown. In a statement, the bank says: The Board of TSB Bank Plc has today announced that after 7 years as CEO, Paul Pester will be stepping down from his position and leaving the company. Richard Meddings, current Non Executive Chairman of TSB, will take on the role of Executive Chairman with immediate effect in order to enable a full public search to commence for a new CEO. Whilst there is still work to do to achieve full stability for customers, TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s systems and services are much improved since the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IT migration earlier this year. Paul and the Board have therefore agreed that this is the right time for Paul to step down and to appoint a new CEO for TSB. More to follow.... Conservative MP George Freeman has also called on Mark Carney to stay longer at the Bank, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need a Brexit that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t damage business confidence, investment and jobs. Mark Carney is the Alex Ferguson of the City - if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do it he would be a smart pick.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The problem, though, is that Carney may have had enough of playing on the hallowed turf of Threadneedle Street. Plus, crucially, the rest of the Carney family are heading back to Canada this year (two of the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daughters have A-levels and GCSEs this summer). Having already agreed to remain at the BoE another year (till summer 2019), would he really want to stay even longer? Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Mark Carney was described as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the outstanding central banker of his generation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when he was dramatically appointed as Bank of England governor in 2012. Since then, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been called everything from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high priest of Project Fear\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153George Clooney of finance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Now, with his stint at the Bank almost over, could the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd change his mind again? There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing pressure on Carney to stick around longer at the Bank, rather than leave in June 2019 as planned. This would let him help the UK through the Brexit transition (or do I mean upheaval?), and calm the markets. The rumour mill is working overtime, with the Treasury and the Bank of England apparently in discussions about Mark Carney staying on longer as governor. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury committee will try to get to the bottom of the situation today, when they question the governor about last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise. Some MPs are hoping that Carney could be persuaded to extend his stint in London longer, even though he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned to return to Canada for family reasons. Stewart Hosie, a Scottish National Party MP on the committee, told us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a surprise at all if a member would ask [about Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future]. Carney has done a very good job in what, in many cases, have been very difficult economic circumstances. There would be a lot of merit in the chancellor asking him to extend his term should that be the decision the chancellor were to take. Brexit-loving MPs, though, won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t relish the thought of Mark Carney remaining (so to speak) at the Bank for longer, given his warnings about the cost of leaving the EU.

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our round-up of the slide in emerging market stocks today, and the factors behind it: Goodnight! GW Emerging markets have fallen into a bear market tonight, the FT reports. That means stocks in developing countries, such as Indonesia, South Africa, Argentina and Turkey, have fallen 20% from their recent peak. As the FT puts it: The FTSE Emerging index of nearly 800 of the biggest companies in the developing world fell 1.6 per cent, its sixth straight decline and the biggest in three weeks, which pushed the benchmark to its lowest since July 2017. They also flag up that currencies, as well as equities, are feeling the strain against the US dollar: Indonesia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rupiah traded close to its weakest level since the 1998 Asian financial crisis, while the South African rand slipped to a record low after data on Tuesday showed the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy had contracted for the first time since 2009, exacerbating concerns over the developing world more broadly. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major stock markets also had a bad day today, amid the ripples from the emerging markets rout. In London, the FTSE 100 shed 74 points, or 1%, to 7,383 - its lowest close since April (partly due to the sterling rally) But there were bigger losses in Europe, with the French CAC down 1.5% and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX shedding 1.4%. David Madden of CMC Markets says: worries about global trading relationships and the decline in emerging market economies are hurting market confidence. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, has written a blogpost to mark the 10th anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In it, she warns that not enough has been done to repair the damage caused by the financial crisis, or to avoid another one. In the article, she says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have come a long way, but not far enough. The system is safer, but not safe enough. Growth has rebounded but is not shared enough.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking back today, the pressure points seem obvious. But they were less obvious at the time. Most economists failed to predict what was coming. It is a sobering lesson in groupthink.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the policy response to these pre-crisis risks was inadequate, I would say that the immediate policy response to the crisis was impressive. The governments of the major economies represented by the G20 coordinated policies on a global scale. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Indeed, the importance of international cooperation in meeting 21st century challenges is one of the enduring lessons of the crisis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lagarde also suggests that male dominance of Wall Street was a factor - a few more sisters at the top could have made a big difference.... More here: Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, flags up that the South African rand is being dragged lower by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emerging market selloff. The spike in the pound has hit shares in London (as it makes overseas earnings in foreign currencies less valuable). The FTSE 100 is now down by 93 points, or 1.25%, in late trading. Newsflash from Ottawa: The Bank of Canada has left Canadian interest rates on hold, at 1.5%. The BoC also warns that trade uncertainty is hurting Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy: Elevated trade tensions remain a key risk to the global outlook and are pulling some commodity prices lower. Meanwhile, financial stresses have intensified in certain emerging market economies, but with limited spillovers to other countries. Boom! The pound has just jumped on the foreign exchange markets, on report of a Brexit breakthrough. But investors should stay cautious - there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing official at this stage. Bloomberg is reporting that Germany is ready to accept a less-detailed agreement on future ties between the UK and the European Union, to get a deal done. The UK, for its part, would accept a more vague statement of intent on the future relationship, according to anonymous sources quoted by the newswire. If true, this would suggest the two sides are amenable to unblocking the current deadlock. This could cut the risk that Britain crashes out of the EU next March without a deal. Traders reacted quickly, sending the pound back to $1.296 - its highest level this week. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says there are two reasons to treat the news cautiously: First, Germany does not \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite its clear dominance of the bloc economically - actually speak for the EU position. Michel Barnier may well have something to say about this report. As might Theresa May. Second, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard these kinds of rumours lift the pound before and it should be treated with caution. There is a strong chance that this rally could run out of steam and retrace in fairly short order. But, it nevertheless it does still point to a degree of softening in the general tone of talks and that a deal is more likely than not. Both the widening American trade gap, and the slide in emerging markets today, can be partly blamed on the stronger US dollar. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to the robust US economy, and the prospect of higher interest rates to curb inflation -- as Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts give the economy a sugar rush. Quite... Mexican politician Jorge Guajardo believes Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attacks on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading partners are partly to blame for the widening US trade gap: White House insiders might want to hide today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade data from the president... Not only has the US trade deficit widened, but the gap with Canada has hit a 10-year high. This surplus widened to 5.3bn Canadian dollars in July, from C$4.1 billion the previous month, This may make Trump even more determined to reach a new North American trade deal, as NAFTA talks restart in Washington. Bloomberg says: The figures released Wednesday in Ottawa are likely to play into the resumption of bilateral talks in Washington over the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump has signed a new deal with Mexico and has threatened to leave Canada out and impose stiff auto tariffs if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make concessions. Even the metal products targeted by U.S. tariffs showed some resilience in the latest figures. Canadian shipments of steel climbed 16 percent in July after a 36 percent drop in June, while a 2 percent fall in aluminum still left those exports 8.1 percent higher than they were a year prior. Newsflash: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit has widened to a five-month high, in a blow to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to cut it. US imports jumped by $2.2bn to $261bn in July, according to the latest trade data from the Census Bureau. Exports shrank by $2.1bn, though, to around $211bn, due to lower sales of aircraft and soybeans (which now face tariffs when sold to China). This drove America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall trade deficit up to over $50bn. The White House won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be pleased to see that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goods trade deficit with China surged 10% to a record $36.8 billion. So what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening? The Wall Street Journal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theory is that tax cuts and higher federal spending \u00e2\u20ac\u0153goosed up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd domestic demand, while a cooling economy overseas hampered exports. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, blames trade war anxiety and the strengthening US dollar for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Global stock markets continue to be volatile as the trade dispute between the United States and China continues to escalate. Slowing Chinese growth has unsettled investors as the impact of the ongoing trade dispute continues to impact the Chinese economy. Asian stocks are currently lower with all major markets recording losses. The Shanghai Composite index, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei and South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s KOSPI all made losses in light on going spat between the two largest economies. The Indonesian Index is down 3.7% as downward pressure on EMs continues. European markets have also opened lower, due to the same concerns. Emerging markets are also continuing to suffer as the likes of Turkish inflation are causing concern amongst investors. Most EM currencies are under pressure with today concerns being focused on Indonesia, Argentina and South Africa. As a result of these risky economies and markets, the dollar has become a safe haven for many, allowing it to surge to its latest high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It feels as if the dollar and Amazon stock price is the only asset going up! Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dean Popplewell of City firm OANDA on the losses across emerging markets today: Soured sentiment has left several Asian stock markets with their biggest declines in a fortnight, at least since the bout of EM worries that were fuelled by the TRY\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plunge. In Japan, equities held up better than most, perhaps helped by the overnight yen softness (\u00c2\u00a5111.47). Nevertheless, investors remain worried that Sino-U.S tariff war could escalate weighed on sentiment. The Nikkei share average dropped -0.51% for a fourth consecutive session while the broader Topix fell -0.77%. Down-under, Aussie shares extended their losses for a fifth consecutive session overnight, closing down -1%, brushing aside a robust economic growth report (Q2 GDP +0.9% vs. +0.7%) as materials stocks slid on weaker commodity prices. In S. Korea, the Kospi plunged -1.03% as trade war fears intensify. In Hong Kong, stocks posted their biggest loss in 11-weeks on growth and trade war fears. Overnight, investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dumped property, energy and tech stocks amid worries about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and the Sino-U.S trade war. The Hang Seng index fell -2.6%, while the China Enterprises Index lost -2.3%. Emerging market currencies are also having a bad day, with most falling against the US dollar today: Back in the financial world, the rout in emerging markets is gathering pace. Emerging stock markets across the globe are in the red, as a nasty cocktail of threats hit equities. The selloff in Asia overnight has now spread to the Middle East. Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is the worst performer, plunging more than 4% at the last count. Indonesia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market has slumped by 3.7%, and there are losses from Shanghai and Hong Kong to Mumbai, Cairo and Johannesburg. Shares are being hit by several factors, including: The slowdown in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector last month The global impact of the US-China trade war, and the prospect that America implements tariffs on an extra $200bn of Chinese imports later this week The strengthening US dollar, which is sucking capital out of emerging markets and pushing up the cost of repaying debts taken out in dollars There are also isolated individual factors. South Africa fell into recession yesterday, while Argentina is pushing the IMF for a larger bailout to support its economy. So investors are fretting that the global economy may slow, especially if more emerging markets follow Argentina and Turkey into financial crisis. As Christoph Barraud, an economist at Paris-based brokerage Market Securities, put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Until last month people were focusing on U.S. company earnings but now they are looking closely at what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening in emerging markets, at the trade war and the fact that the United States is likely to implement another wave of tariffs against China. If you look at global growth, more and more signs are that it will slow in coming months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cambridge, Oxford, Warrington, Reading and Swindon are all feeling the brunt of the worker shortage, apparently. Jobs site Adzuna says each of these cities have more than 15 vacancies for every jobseeker, putting labour in a strong position (theoretically, anyway). Despite the hiring struggle, the UK economy is on track to grow by 0.4% in the current quarter, Markit estimates. That would match the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate in April-June, and beat some City forecasts. But still, it would be fairly modest growth compared to the years before the EU referendum.... Morgan Stanley say they \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continue to anticipate weakness in the economy going forward, as we enter the final stretch of Brexit negotiations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, is concerned that UK firms can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find the staff they need. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on the PMI report: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The services sector was a little more upbeat than the other sectors this month maintaining a steady level of activity growth, and the number of new orders ticked higher. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite this, optimism was more subdued and lower than the survey average. With the weakest business optimism since March, uncertainty around the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave the EU continued to dampen client operations. Struggles around securing talent and the right skills were also a drag on a sector highly-dependent on trained staff even though job creation rose to its highest levels for half a year. UK firms are also suffering from uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. Business confidence about future prospects hit the lowest level since March, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI report shows. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153political uncertainty and the unpredictable impact of Brexit on clients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 business operations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chris Williamson of Markit adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business expectations for the year ahead meanwhile sank markedly lower, down across all three sectors to one of the lowest levels seen since the EU referendum, largely reflecting increased anxiety over Brexit negotiations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given the increasingly unbalanced nature of growth and the darkening business mood, risks to the immediate outlook seem tilted to the downside.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good news for UK workers -- the staff shortage is forcing some services firms to pay them more. Markit says: Difficulties recruiting suitably skilled staff contributed to higher salary payments in August. Breaking: Growth in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector rose last month...but firms are finding it harder to recruit the workers they need. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly survey of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services companies. Purchasing managers from large and small UK service firms reported that business activity rose at a faster rate in August, partly thanks to a boost in new work. However, many also said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a lack of suitably skilled candidates to fill vacancies had held back staff hiring\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That staff shortage held some firms back. Markit explains: Backlogs of work increased for the fourth month running in August, which pointed to sustained pressure on operating capacity at service sector companies. A number of firms linked rising volumes of unfinished business to difficulties replacing departing staff. This may be a sign that EU workers are heading home ahead of Brexit, or that potential migrants aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t coming over the UK at all. Last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment figures showed a record annual decline in migrants from the European Union to the UK. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate is also at a 43-year low, so firms may simply be suffering from a tight labour market. Overall, Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK service PMI jumped to 54.3 in August, up from 53.5 in July -- the second highest level since February. That shows faster growth. More to follow.... Just in: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car sales rose by almost a quarter in August. Just over 94 thousand new cars were registered in the UK last month, a jump of 23.1% compared to August 2017. That sounds impressive... until you remember that August is typically a quiet month for car sales (drivers who wait until September will get the new year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number plate). Despite this jump, registrations in 2018 are still 4.2% lower than this stage last year, according to the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders. But still, demand for hybrid and plug-in cars surged by 88.7%. One in 12 buyers chose an electric car - a new record. The SMMT adds: Demand was up across the board, with consumers and fleets boosting year-on-year registrations by 23.3% and 19.7% respectively, while the smaller business sector rose 166.4%, equivalent to an uplift of around 1,500 units against August last year. Superminis remained the most popular buy, followed by small family and dual purpose cars, with the luxury saloon and city car segments recording the most notable growth, up 120.8% and 39.6%. European companies are also worried about trade wars. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new survey of eurozone purchasing managers, just released, show that business expectations in the service sector hit a 21-month low in August. It blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153geo-political trade tensions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More encouragingly, the euro-area private sector kept growing last month. But as this chart shows, Italy moved worryingly close to stagnation (which would be a PMI of 50). Commodity prices are also being hit by the drop in Chinese company growth. The price of copper in Shanghai has hit a 14-month low, while prices in London are down 2.6%. This is dragging down the share prices of mining giants, and thus pulling Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 down by 0.4% in early trading. Global stock markets are in the red this morning, as the slowdown across China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies worries investors. The Shanghai Composite Index has dropped by 1.7%, while Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng index has shed 2.7%. Most European markets have opened lower too, with the Stoxx 600 index of major EU companies down almost 0.5%. Investors are fretting about trade, as Donald Trump could sign off an extra $200bn of tariffs on Chinese goods in the coming days. US officials are also due to resume trade talks with Canada later today, as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: The main preoccupation for investors continues to be on whether the US is serious about arriving at some form of deal with Canada over NAFTA in the wake of President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweets at the weekend, that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t and isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a political necessity to get a deal In addition to that anxiety levels are growing ahead of the weekend and the possible imposition of another $200bn worth of tariffs on Chinese goods later this week. Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies are also feeling a chill from the US-China trade wars. Growth across Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector declined in August, data firm Markit says. Output and new orders both shrank, forcing job cuts. It adds: Notably, export sales to China fell again amid escalating trade tensions. Companies remained pessimistic about future output, which was also accompanied by another drop in purchasing activity and input inventories. Consequently, firms reduced selling prices to support sales despite a further rise in input costs. Both employment and backlogs continued to decline. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business Trade war anxiety is growing this morning, after China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies posted disappointing growth. Business activity growth across China hit a five-month low in August, a new survey from data firm Caixin shows. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector led the slowdown, with growth hitting a 10-month low. Companies reported that new business growth was weak, forcing factory bosses to cut jobs. Business confidence was also subdued. Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, says China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth is on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153downward trajectory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: Inflationary pressures were pronounced as increases in both input prices and output prices accelerated. The future output sub-index went up after falling in August, which was likely boosted by the fine-tuning of macro policies. The employment sub-index was unchanged from July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading and remained in contraction territory. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI readings indicated that the effects of expansionary credit policy and active fiscal policy are yet to kick in. Signs of stagnation emerged as upward pressure on prices remained even though demand weakened at a faster rate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The report suggests that the trade dispute with America is hitting demand and confidence. The US has already imposed tariffs on $50bn of Chinese imports, with president Donald Trump threatening more. Caixin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Composite Output Index, which measures growth across Chinese companies, fell to a five- month low of 52.0 in August, with the services PMI hitting just 51.5 - the lowest since October 2017 (50 = stagnation). Here are the key points from the report: Services activity growth edges down to ten-month low, while manufacturing output increases at faster pace Composite new work expands at weakest pace for over two years Steeper rises in input costs across both the manufacturing and service sectors Reaction to follow.... Later today we discover how Britain, and the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, service sector firms fared in August -- as company bosses watched the clock tick towards Brexit in March 2019. Also coming up today... Ten years after the financial crisis, a UK thinktank is proposing some radical changes to fix the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems. The IPPR is calling for higher wages, more government spending on infrastructure, extra wealth taxes and more power for workers, to tackle growing inequality. The report comes out later today.

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest piece on the US-China trade dispute: The ISM report also shows that the US-China trade spat is pushing up costs for companies. One executive at a construction firm warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tariff-related cost increases are beginning to accelerate, whether tariffs have been put into effect or not.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Another business leader, though, is expecting a record-breaking month: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Based on current trends on customer quote requests and conversions to orders, we are trending for this month to be the best August in the history of our company.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector grew strongly last month, according to the latest PMI report from the Institute of Supply Management. The ISM Services index jumped to 58.5 for August, up from 55.7 in July, signalling faster growth. Companies reported a pick-up in new orders (including exports) and overall activity, suggesting the US economy remains in decent fettle. Wall Street has opened cautiously, with the Dow Jones gaining 72 points or 0.3%. Facebook and Twitter are lagging, though, as the fallout from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Congress investigation into social media, and foreign interference in elections. Trade war and emerging market jitters are weighing on the City today. The FTSE 100 is down 10 points, or 0.1%, having closed at a four-month low yesterday. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s despite energy firms rallying. Centrica is up 5.3%, after the government outlined plans to cap bills. The plan will save households around \u00c2\u00a375 each -- good news, but not as much as PM Theresa May had promised... Some better jobs news just arrived: the number of Americans signing on for unemployment benefit hit its lowest level in almost 50 years! Initial claims for jobless benefits dropped by 10,000 last week to 203,000, the smallest number since December 1969. It extends a long run of decent US employment data, which hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been derailed by the trade wars (yet, anyway). Newsflash: American companies created fewer jobs in August than in July, and less than expected. US payroll operator ADP has reported that 163,000 private sector jobs were created last month, down from 217,000 in July. Economists had expected a figure close to 190,000. It may be a sign that Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs report (the non-farm payroll) will miss expectations. Some lunchtime reading: Joseph Stiglitz on how policymakers have failed to make the right decisions since the financial crisis a decade ago: China has warned that it will retaliate if America imposes fresh tariffs on its goods. Economic ministry spokesman Gao Feng told reporters in Beijing today that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the United States, regardless of opposition, adopts any new tariff measures, China will be forced to roll out necessary retaliatory measures.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in July, the US outlined plans for tariffs on $200bn of Chinese exports (on top of the existing $50bn of tariffs). That includes literally thousands of products; machinery, IT, aerospace parts, paper, leather, chemicals, furniture, meat and fish are all on the list. The consultation period on that plan ends today, meaning Donald Trump could sign them off imminently. In August, China outlined plans for retaliatory tariffs on $60bn of goods if Trump does indeed press the button. This would see levies imposed on over 5,000 items imported from the US, including aircraft, soya bean oil, smoked beef, coffee and flour. China only imported around $129bn of goods from America last year, while exporting around $500bn. That means Beijing can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t match Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $200bn threat in full. The Economist Intelligence Unit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global economist, John Ferguson, believes emerging market tensions will continue to build over the next couple of years. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on the EM situation: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most emerging-market economies should be able to weather this pace of economic tightening, provided that their trading conditions remain favourable. However, investors are on the alert for financial, economic or political weaknesses.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The turbulence experienced by Argentina and Turkey in mid-2018 is a reminder of how difficult it can be for policymakers to regain market confidence where external imbalances are large and macroeconomic policy frameworks are fragile.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For now, a full-blown emerging-market crisis should be averted, but we expect the number of countries seeing their currencies come under pressure to rise over the next two years. It is likely that we will see periods of volatility as the global trade dispute interacts with the shift away from easy money.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After days of losses, some emerging economy currencies are struggling off the mat. The Argentina peso has gained 1.2% today, having hit a record low earlier this week. The South African rand has gained almost 0.5%, and the Mexican peso is 0.35% higher. Some relief, and perhaps a sign that the recent selloff is bottoming out? Kathleen Brooks of Capital Index argues that the recent rout has been \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcindiscriminate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. She thinks traders have been too quick to ditch emerging market assets. After all, EM isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only part of the economy with economic and political problems. The fundamentals didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t add up: we would firstly like to add a caveat that some EM assets are at risk from political and economic pressures (read Turkey), however justifying the ZAR [South African rand] sell off when SA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit is lower than the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right now isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a good investment decision. Also, political risk is not just the preserve of the emerging market space, take a read of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s New York Times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 anonymous op-ed from a Trump cabinet member and you will see how close the US is to a constitutional crisis. The EM selloff has pulled world stock markets down for the fifth day in a row. The losses in Asia overnight, followed by the early dip in Europe, pulled the MSCI All-Country World Index down by another 0.2%. The drop in German factory orders added to concerns that trade war rhetoric, and tariffs, is causing economic harm. Economists are also concerned that the problems in certain emerging market economies are now spreading across the sector, and beyond. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says: As global monetary conditions slowly tighten, the global economic cycle rolls over and the US President disturbs the global trade cycle, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely more to the emerging markets sell-off than a few unrelated spots of weakness. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, agrees that contagion risks can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be ignored. Crashes in the Argentine Peso and Turkish Lira were first believed to be idiosyncratic risks that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lead to any spillover. But now it looks like the concern over contagion risks are spreading to all asset classes. EM equities entered into a bear market, falling 20% from their January peak. The Indonesian Rupee, Indian Rupee, South African Rand, and several other EM currencies are either trading at record or multi-year lows. Investors who have been on the sidelines may think of the selloff as a good opportunity to start accumulating some oversold EM assets. However, the prospects of more U.S. interest rate hikes, and continuing global trade tensions make it difficult to jump in. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial belt has taken another hit from the US-China trade war: German industrial orders shank by 0.9% in July, new figures show, driven by a drop in overseas demand. Economists had expected a rise of 1.8%, following a 3.9% slump in June. But instead, manufacturers reported another decline: Although domestic orders rose, German factories suffered from weaker business overseas, as Destatis explains: Domestic orders increased by 2.4% and foreign orders decreased by 3.4% in July 2018 on the previous month. New orders from the euro area were down 2.7%, new orders from other countries decreased 4.0% compared to June 2018. European stock markets have hit a five-month low this morning. The emerging markets rout, and fears of an escalating trade war, drove the Stoxx 600 index down to its lowest since early April. In London the FTSE 100 dipped to a new four-month low in early trading, at 7,357. Newsflash: The Indian rupee has dropped to an all-time low, as the emerging market currency selloff continues. The rupee fell to 72.095 against the US dollar, breaching the 72-mark for the first time. Last night, the Financial Times calculated that emerging markets are now officially in a bear market -- defined as falling 20% from their recent high. Capital Economics fears that the emerging market rout has further to run: We think that the US Federal Reserve will press ahead with its tightening cycle, and worries about contagion from the crisis in Turkey may linger. At the same time, we expect China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy to slow further, and are not anticipating a ceasefire in the US-China trade war any time soon. This snapshot of the markets, from Bloomberg TV, shows how stock markets have lost ground (first column). The second column shows currencies dropping against the US dollar. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff has wiped more than 1% off the main Chinese stock index, the CSI 300. Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng is down almost 1.5%. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market has lost 1.1%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest one-day loss since March, taking the index to a two-month low. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a worrying time in the financial markets, as emerging economies across the globe come under pressure. Emerging market stocks have fallen steadily for several days, hit by worries over global growth prospects, the strength of the US dollar, and the various trade disputes being driven by the White House this year. Markets were a sea of red yesterday, with notable losses in China, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, as traders scurried for safer assets. There are fresh losses in Asia today, dragging stocks in the region towards a one-year low (more on that shortly). The dollar is currently at its highest level in over a year against a basket of emerging markets currencies, with some at a record lows. That makes it tougher to service foreign debts, and drives up inflation. This forces policymakers to consider steep interest rate rises that will throttle growth. With Argentina signing up for an IMF bailout, Turkey fighting a currency crisis, and Brazil gripped by a corruption scandal, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty to worry the City right now. Another concern: Donald Trump could deepen the trade war with China, by signing off tariffs on an extra $200bn of imports. An announcement could come today. Such an escalation could cause further harm to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, with ripple effects hurting other companies in the global supply chain too. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another reason emerging markets are feeling the strain today. As Christophe Barraud, an economist at the Paris-based brokerage Market Securities, put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are looking closely at what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening in emerging markets, at the trade war and the fact that the United States is likely to implement another wave of tariffs against China. If you look at global growth, more and more signs are that it will slow in coming months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European markets are expected to dip this morning, after the FTSE 100 hit a four-month low yesterday. This follows losses on Wall Street last night, led by the technology sector, after Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jack Dorsey were grilled at Congress. The session has raised speculation that social media could face tougher regulation, to crack down on fake news, harassment and interference by rogue states. As Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: Calls for a negative open come courtesy of downbeat trading on Wall Street, with the Tech sector sharply lower following testimony from Twitter and Facebook to US Congress. The turmoil within emerging markets also continues, widening from Argentina and Turkey, dampening global sentiment even further all the while we await the US decision on additional China import tariffs.

                "bodyText":"The pound hit its highest level since early August this morning, at $1.3087, on hopes that a Brexit deal can be struck by November. It has since given up those gains and is now trading 0.3% lower on the day, but remains close to five-week highs. Against the euro, sterling is up 0.2% at 89.16 pence.

The extension is shorter than some expected. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also had strong UK labour market data today. Regular pay growth in July picked up to the fastest rate in three years, while job vacancies hit a record high and the unemployment rate remained at 4%, the lowest since 1975. Despite the pick-up in pay growth, average weekly wages are still lower than before the financial crisis in 2008, remaining \u00c2\u00a331 below the pre-crisis average. Following a positive open, European stocks took a tumble after it emerged that China plans to ask the World Trade Organisation next week for permission to impose sanctions on the US, for Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-compliance with a ruling in a dispute over US dumping duties. With this, we are closing the blog for the day. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Good-bye! FTSE 100 in London down 0.6% Dax in Frankfurt down 0.6% CAC in Paris down 0.4% FTSE MiB in Milan down 0.9% Ibex in Madrid down 0.5% The unreliable boyfriend commits, says Anna Stupnytska, global economist at fund manager Fidelity International. Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s re-appointment brings continuity to BoE policy. Compared to almost any potential successor, Carney will exert a more firmly dovish influence on UK monetary decision-making, as he has done consistently since he took the helm in 2013. While Carney expects a gradual pace of rate hikes from here, perhaps little more than one per year, as he sees out the rest of his tenure, in reality he will be driven by how smooth or disruptive Brexit turns out to be. Indeed, it is perhaps with regards to Brexit where Carney-continuity is more important, and why Theresa May was so keen to keep him on board. In addition to setting interest rates, the Bank of England also supervises and regulates British banks through \u00e2\u20ac\u0153macro-prudential\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd policy. As such, investors can take some comfort that Carney is as well-placed as anyone to navigate any choppy waters that Brexit will bring to threaten Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall financial system. Regarding the process for the appointment of Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successor, the chancellor wrote to the Bank of England governor: An extension of your term would ensure there is continuity at the Bank during this exceptional period and would also allow for a new governor to be appointed during the autumn next year after the terms of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal and the framework for the future partnership have been finalised. The seven-month extension of Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s term as Bank of England governor is shorter than some expected. He will stay on until the end of January 2020, which means he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be at the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s helm during the withdrawal period (the UK is due to exit the EU at 11pm UK time on Friday 29 March, 2019). But he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be there for the entire transition period, which ends on 31 December 2020. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, welcomed the news, our political correspondent Peter Walker reports. He told reporters after Treasury questions in the Commons: I have a good working relationship with Mark Carney. We meet on a regular basis, and I have a lot of confidence in him. So I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pleased \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this will give us a bit of stability. I wish we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have heard a bit sooner, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good. While refusing to say who he would prefer as a successor, McDonnell said he would like the new governor to be a woman: It would be useful if it was, actually. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice to get a better gender balance in these things. Nigel Farage, vice chairman of the pro-Brexit group Leave Means Leave, has a different response. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the influential Treasury select committee, is pleased. This announcement provides much-needed stability and clarity during this important period. The government should now use the extra seven months to continue its succession planning. It should identify a candidate in good time for the Treasury committee to scrutinise the appointment. The announcement comes after weeks of speculation as to whether Carney, the former governor of Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, who took the Bank of England job in 2013, would agree to an extension of his term given the economic uncertainty over Brexit. You can read our full story here You can read the exchange of letters between Carney and Hammond here. In his letter, the chancellor said: Further to our discussions and those that I have had with the Prime Minister, I am writing to ask whether you would be able to extend your term as Governor of the Bank of England to January 2020 to support a smooth exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union and an effective transition to the next Governor.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In his reply, the Bank of England governor said: I recognise that during this critical period, it is important that everyone does everything they can to support a smooth and successful Brexit. Accordingly, I am willing to do whatever I can in order to promote both a successful Brexit and an effective transition at the Bank of England and I can confirm that I would be honoured to extend my term to January 2020.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd HM Treasury has also announced that Jon Cunliffe has been reappointed as Deputy Governor for Financial Stability for a second five-year term. Bradley Fried, Chair of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Court of Directors, said The Bank and its Court of Directors are delighted that Mark and Jon have agreed to stay on. Continuity in the outstanding leadership they provide will help the Bank succeed in our crucial work. News flash: Bank of England governor Mark Carney has agreed to stay until January 2020, the chancellor Philip Hammond has confirmed. The 10-year anniversary of the Lehman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse has prompted photographer Andy Hall to take to the streets of the City of London to see what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s changed. The City from the street, a decade after the crash \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in pictures Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take another look at the markets. The pound has shed its initial gains and is now flat against the dollar and the euro, despite strong UK labour market data. Regular pay growth in July picked up to the fastest rate in three years, while job vacancies hit a record high and the unemployment rate remained at 4%, the lowest since 1975. Even so, average weekly wages are still lower than the levels achieved before the financial crisis in 2008, remaining \u00c2\u00a331 below the pre-crisis average. European stocks are back in the red, after it emerged that China plans to ask the World Trade Organisation next week for permission to impose sanctions on the US, for Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-compliance with a ruling in a dispute over US dumping duties. Reuters reported this, citing a meeting agenda. The request is likely to lead to years of legal wrangling over the case for sanctions and the amount. China initiated the dispute in 2013, complaining about U.S. dumping duties on several industries including machinery and electronics, light industry, metals and minerals, with an annual export value of up to $8.4bn. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says: This news immediately sparked fears that the next round of trade war-escalation isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t far off, sending the FTSE and DAX down 0.6% apiece. The Dow Jones is set to join them in the red once the bell rings on Wall Street, with the futures pointing to a 70-ish point drop. That would leave the Dow the wrong side of 25,800 for the first time since the end of August, and in danger of falling further if Trump decides to announce his next set of tariffs on Chinese imports.

A decade on, where are the key players in the financial crisis?

JPMorgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vice chair said his forecast of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153modest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd job losses of 150 to 200 between now and Brexit Day was not inconsistent with comments by the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman Jamie Dimon that Brexit could impact 4,000 jobs. The numbers I mentioned are to do with the short term horizon to get us through to March and then what we call Day 2. We just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what is going to happen in the future. The evolution of our staff count will be very much a function of the ultimate deal that can be secured by the UK. There is clearly a scenario in which one does envisage that sort of outcome [4,000 job moves]. The German ZEW economic sentiment survey, also out this morning, improved moderately. The main index rose to -10.6 in September from -13.7 in August, but stayed at its third-lowest level since 2012. Professor Achim Wambach, president of the Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) in Mannheim, said: During the survey period, the currency crises in Turkey and Argentina intensified, while German industrial production and incoming orders were surprisingly low in July. Despite these unfavourable circumstances, economic expectations for Germany improved slightly. The considerable fears displayed by the survey participants regarding the economic development have diminished somewhat, which may in part be attributable to the new trade agreement between the USA and Mexico. Oliver Rakau, chief German economist at Oxford Economics, said: This tells the ECB that eurozone growth is stabilising, but not accelerating back to last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s buoyant levels. However, the updated eurozone labour market data shows that wage growth is accelerating strongly, giving the green light to end QE at the end of 2018. Eurozone economic expectations in the ZEW survey rose to -7.2 from -11.1, while the assessment of the current business situation improved in Germany as well as the wider eurozone. Rakau said: That indicates that financial market participants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economic expectations continued to be bolstered by the preliminary EU-US trade deal, that took US car tariffs off the table for now. The latest news from on-going EU-US trade talks may already have help in that regard as well with the survey ending yesterday. Talks were described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153constructive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forward-looking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, that may still change at the hand of one tweet, while US-China trade relations don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show similar encouraging tendencies. Meanwhile, emerging markets remain under pressure and global trade is slowing underlining why confidence levels remain well below last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s levels. Back to the UK labour market data. Alok Sharma, the employment minister, highlighted that the unemployment rate is the lowest since the mid-1970s while employment rate (which dipped today) remains near a record high, and that 1.45 million more children are living in a home with all adults in work. Sharma said: With unemployment rate still at its lowest level in 43 years, it is good to see that for the sixth month in a row wages have grown faster than inflation helping to put more money in people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pockets. In the last quarter regular pay is up by 2.9%, 0.5% above inflation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Households across the country are benefiting from the security of being in work, and with increasing wages and GDP growth of 0.6% last quarter we are delivering an economy that supports working people. Knight Frank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest global house price index shows that the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top hotspot is Malta. The Mediterranean island is leading the index for the first time with 17% annual house price growth, moving ahead of Hong Kong (16% growth). The report said a shortage of supply, combined with a robust economy (6.6% GDP growth in 2017) and a buoyant technology industry were pushing up demand. Only seven of the 57 countries tracked registered falling prices over the 12 months to June, namely Ukraine, Peru, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Italy, Finland and Israel. The UK is in 36th place, with 3% house price growth. The report says about Turkey: Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s travails mean that although prices are rising at an annual rate of 11%, according to the latest data from the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, when inflation of 16%+ is factored in, prices in real terms are now falling. More from Lisa O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Carroll. JP Morgan vice chairman Mark Garvin brushed off Brexit staff disruption, saying the firm has seen more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tumult\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in banking in his career. He told the Treasury select committee, chaired by Nicky Morgan, when being quizzed about cost of staff moves in Brexit contingency planning: We have been through far more tumult than this. This is an event we can very well manage. Staff know they live in a changing organisation. Compared to digitisation and other kinds of disruption this is not a massive challenge. Our Brexit correspondent Lisa O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Carroll has been watching the Treasury select committee this morning, where senior bankers have told MPs that they are moving \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hundreds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rather than thousands of staff out of London because of Brexit. She writes: But they have warned this is only the start of a process that could see more staff sucked out of the capital. Kevin Wall, the chief executive of Barclays Ireland said it was moving around 150 staff from London to Europe, most of these to Dublin. These are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153small numbers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the context of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tens of thousands\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the banks employs in europe. James Bardrick, the head of Citi UK and CEO of Citigroup Global Markets, told the committee that it was also looking at moving around 150 staff, but that its planning for Brexit was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more about putting the right people in the right roles\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in various centres around Europe. Mark Garvin, vice chair of JP Morgan, said it was also moving jobs \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the hundreds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but told the committee that Brexit was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not a one-off big bang event\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scale and scope of these operations is going to be greatly increased as a result of transfer of operations to EU. The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chequers plan focused on an enhanced equivalence model for financial services rather than passporting or mutual recognition, the preferred option for many City firms. The EU has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153equivalence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd regimes which provide limited access for some non-EU countries to some areas of EU financial services markets. At present, banks and other financial firms based in London rely on an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EU passport\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to operate freely across the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce also highlighted some areas of concern, in particular the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153alarmingly high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd number of job vacancies in Britain. The robust headline data masks several areas of concern. While there was a welcome increase in earnings growth, the gap between pay and price growth remains insufficient to convert into an appreciable pick-up in consumer spending. Sustaining meaningful real wage growth is likely to remain challenging amid subdued productivity and the escalating burden of upfront costs on businesses. The number of job vacancies in the UK remains at an alarmingly high level, further evidence of persistent skills shortages. While the number of people in work stands close to historic highs, firms continue to report that attempting to recruit staff with the right skills is an increasingly uphill struggle, which is stifling their ability to grow and boost productivity. It is vital that more is done to support those businesses looking to recruit and train staff, including delivering an open and flexible immigration system to help firms attract and retain the people they need to compete on the global stage. However, Julian Jessop, chief economist at the Institute of Economic Affairs, tweeted: UK employment rose just 3,000 in the three months to July, taking the number of people in work to 32.397 million. Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, was quick to respond to the labour market data. He says they suggest that competition for workers is finally starting to provide greater support to wages. The slowdown in total pay growth in May and June was reversed in July... Looking ahead, there is little sign that the recent slowdown in employment will prove permanent. Even the most pessimistic leading indicators point to employment growth of 1% y/y. Meanwhile, surveys of wage growth suggest that it will sustain a pace of about 3% y/y over the remainder of the year. Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increase in wage growth, we still think that the MPC will hold off raising interest rates again until the near-term uncertainty due to the Brexit negotiations is resolved. You can see what wage growth has done over the past few years in this graph: So wage growth is faster than inflation, which is currently at 2.5%. Pay growth has picked up from the three months to June, when average earnings excluding bonuses grew 2.7% but rose just 2.4% when bonuses were included. Unemployment fell by 55,000 to 1.36 million in the three months to July from the previous three months. However, the employment rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the proportion of people aged 16 to 64 years who were in work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c edged down to 75.5% from 75.6%. The ONS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of labour market statistics David Freeman said: With the number of people in work little changed, employment growth has weakened. However, the labour market remains robust, with the number of people working still at historically high levels, unemployment down on the year and a record number of vacancies. Meanwhile, earnings have grown faster than prices for several months, especially looking at pay excluding bonuses. News flash: UK pay growth has (finally) picked up, according to the Office for National Statistics, apparently as hiring tailed off. Average weekly earnings excluding bonuses rose 2.9% year-on-year in the three months to July, the fastest growth since March. In July alone, earnings were up 3.1%, the biggest increase since July 2015. Including bonuses, pay growth accelerated to 2.6% in the three months to July. The figures were stronger than City economists had expected. Job vacancies reached 833,000 in the three months to August, the highest number since records began in 2001. The unemployment rate stayed at 4%, as expected. Sterling rose as much as 0.4% to $1.3072 against the dollar in London trading this morning. Against the euro, it was more or less flat at 89.02 pence. EU leaders are expected to hold a special Brexit summit in mid-November where they hope to sign off a divorce deal. Back to the sterling rally, which was triggered by yet another hint from the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief negotiator Michel Barnier yesterday that a Brexit deal was possible (similar to last week). Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, has this pithy comment: It may be a little undignified to have sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value depend on the lightest word of a French politician. He adds: In the interminably tedious process of extricating the EU from the UK single market, something stirs. The historian Rees-Mogg completely failed to come up with an alternative to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic plan. This might strengthen Prime Minister May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position. And on the mooted second meeting between the US president and North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader, Donovan says: US President Trump is keen to meet North Korean leader Kim. This does not matter much. Markets worried about risks ahead of the last meeting. These risks have largely gone. Markets might possibly read Trump overlooking the apparent continuation of North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear program as a signal of disinterest that could be applied to the trade negotiation details. In corporate news, JD Sports Fashion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rapidly-growing international business has helped it ride out Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highstreet malaise. The sportswear chain posted pretax profits of \u00c2\u00a3122m for the six months to 4 August, up 19%. JD, which has shops in countries from Finland to Malaysia, said like-for-like sales rose more than 3% despite \u00e2\u20ac\u0153widely reported retail challenges in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However this was due to strong online sales \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like-for-like sales in stores were flat. Profits in JD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK &amp; Ireland stores have improved, though, following investments made in linking its online operations and highstreet shops. Sterling has just hit a fresh five-week high of $1.3060, up 0.3%, following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments from the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michel Barnier that a Brexit deal was possible by November. The FTSE 100 index in London has slipped 0.2% on the firmer pound, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC are up 0.2% and 0.3% respectively. The pound is up 0.2% against the dollar so far today. The EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief negotiator in the Brexit talks, Michel Barnier, is in Strasbourg today, briefing MEPs. A growing number of companies are preparing for a no-deal outcome, just in case \u00e2\u20ac\u201c several pharmaceutical firms including AstraZeneca, Sanofi and Merck are stockpiling medicines in the event of a hard Brexit. The Times reports that Mondelez, the owner of Cadbury, is stockpiling ingredients, chocolates and biscuits in case no deal is struck. Hubert Weber, president of Mondelez Europe, said: Like the whole of the food and drink industry in the UK, we would prefer a good deal that allows the free flow of products as that would have less of an impact to the UK consumer. However, we are also preparing for a hard Brexit and, from a buffering perspective for Mondelez, we are stocking higher levels of ingredients and finished products, although you can only do so much because of the shelf life of our products. We have a continency plan in place to manage [a hard Brexit], as the UK is not self-sufficient in terms of food ingredients, so that could be a challenge. He said he wished that Britain was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at a different stage [in negotiations with the European Union] at this stage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and hoped that a deal could be agreed by next year, otherwise British shoppers could face higher prices and fewer choices. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets in Asia have been boosted by news that Donald Trump wants to hold another summit with Kim Jong-un, North Korean leader, raising hopes of greater political stability in the region. In the UK, sterling hit a 5-week high yesterday after the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said a Brexit deal was possible \u00e2\u20ac\u0153within six or eight weeks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if negotiators were realistic in their demands. The pound rose more than 1% to $1.3052 and later settled at $1.3021, up 0.8% on the day. It also hit a one-month high against the euro at 88.96 pence. It was the second time in less than a week that Barnier signalled he wanted to push ahead on the Brexit negotiations. He told a forum in Slovenia: If we are realistic, we are able to reach an agreement on the first stage of the negotiation, which is the Brexit treaty, within six or eight weeks. European stock markets are expected to extend yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, when market relief over the Italian budget offset worries over trade tensions between the US and China. Trump could escalate the dispute if he acts on his threat to impose tariffs on a further $467bn of Chinese goods \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which would cover all Chinese imports into the US. Beijing has said it would retaliate with duties on $60bn of US goods.

In a statement tonight, SPD says: Further to recent press speculation in relation to Debenhams plc, Sports Direct confirms that it does not intend to make an offer to acquire the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Debenhams plc. Elsewhere in the markets, the oil price rose after the latest US crude inventory figures showed a 5.3 million barrel drop last week. CNBC has the details: Brent crude futures were last up 58 cents on the day at $79.64 a barrel and briefly broke above $80. U.S. crude futures rose $1.15, or 1.7 percent, to $70.40 a barrel. The Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that U.S. crude oil inventories dropped by 5.3 million barrels last week. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think oil market fundamentals are increasingly supportive of crude prices, at least at current levels,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Gordon Gray, HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global head of oil and gas equity research.

These children received recreation and medical treatment at the centre, to help them recover and recuperate from their ordeal.Xi visited the center in 2010 when he was vice-president. They have also visited the local university, to underline the economic ties between the two countries. UK retailer Sports Direct has been making plenty of headlines today, as it holds its AGM. The first: chairman Keith Hellawell has stepped down, following scathing criticism of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate government in recent years. This move spares Hellawell another shareholder protest -- last year, barely half of investors supported his re-election. Secondly, senior non-executive Simon Bentley told the meeting that SPD had discussed merging its new acquisition, House of Fraser, with struggling retailer Debenhams. Bentley insisted, though, that no move was imminent as the group might \u00e2\u20ac\u0153have its hands full\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with House of Fraser, which it rescued from administration last month. Intriguingly, SPD boss Mike Ashley showed up at the AGM, having previously indicated he was too busy. So he may have heard from fans of Newcastle United, Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s football club, who turned up to protest against him. Despite Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strident criticism of China, could the US president end up striking one of his famous deals with Beijing? Ursula Johnston, head of customs at law firm Gowling WLG, thinks multinational firms must prepare for a full-blown trade war, by working out how their supply chains will be hit by higher tariffs. But in the end, perhaps peace will break out? An exercise to identify the most cost sensitive supply chains can be undertaken by utilising existing company trade data which can be readily sourced from a variety of internal and external sources including government border authorities and customs brokers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However in the long-term, given that both the US and China are starting to realise the realities of an aggressive, closed approach to trade in recent months, one wonders if the more open and collaborative trading relationship with Mexico that has been recently implemented is more typical of what will end up happening in reality.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Associated Press is reporting that China is putting off accepting license applications from American companies. It suggests that Beijing is widening its retaliation against the US trade tariffs -- moving simply beyond slapping tariffs on imports. AP explains: The license delay applies to industries Beijing has promised to open to foreign competitors, according to Jacob Parker, vice president for China operations of the U.S.-China Business Council. The group represents some 200 American companies that do business with China. In meetings over the past three weeks, Cabinet-level officials told USCBC representatives they are putting off accepting applications \u00e2\u20ac\u0153until the trajectory of the U.S.-China relationship improves and stabilizes,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Parker said. Chinese authorities have promised to increase foreign access to areas including banking, securities, insurance and asset management. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There seem to be domestic political pressures that are working against the perception of U.S. companies receiving benefits\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd during the dispute, Parker said. China and Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns about protectionism may be well-merited, but neither country has a clean slate on the issue. China has long been criticised for protecting its own companies at the expense of foreign rivals. It uses the power of the state to support domestic firms in a way that EU and US rivals can only dream of. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcforced technology transfers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is particularly controversial -- it makes foreign firms share technology if they want to do business in China. A chance to steal US secrets? Russia has also been accused of protectionism. Critics cite cuts in foreign worker quotas, and state support for the rare earth metals industry, agriculture and aircraft makers. Back in June, the European Union warned that China and Russia are actually the most trade protectionist countries. China set up 10 new trade barriers in 2017, according to the EU, followed by Russia with 6. That meant Russia now imposes 36 barriers to free trade with the EU, followed by China with 25 and Indonesia with 23, hindering EU export and investment opportunities. Newsflash: The chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland has warned that taxpayer can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to recoup the money spent rescuing the bank. Speaking on the 10th anniversary of the financial crisis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst moments, Howard Davies said RBS had been focused on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsurvival\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ever since its \u00c2\u00a345bn rescue in autumn 2008. He cautioned that the government is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unlikely to recoup its investment in full\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The focus on survival over a decade has had a cost. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The bank has lost almost 130 billion during the period. That amounts to around four-and-a-half times the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current market capitalisation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd RBS shares are currently trading at 245p, less than half the 502p at which the bank was rescued. The UK government began cutting its majority stake in the bank in June by selling some shares, at a paper loss of \u00c2\u00a32bn. RBS management have spent the last decade cutting the size of the bank, and resolving legal challenges from regulators over misconduct before the financial crisis. The scale of that task, Davies says, helps explain why RBS isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth more today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It seems clear that, in aggregate, the cost of these remedies to the bank and its shareholders was very much greater than could reasonably have been forecast at the time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is another important reason why the book value of the bank is not greater than it is today.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ouch! Factory output across the eurozone fell unexpectedly in July. Industrial production fell by 0.8% during the month, compared with June. Durable consumer goods production shrank by 1.9%, while non-durable consumer goods fell by 1.3%. On an annual basis, production was 0.1% lower than in July 2017 - the first annual decline since 2016 - led by sharp falls in Italy. This may be a sign that trade war angst is hurting the global economy, and hurting demand for goods. Trade war angst has pulled emerging market stocks down to their lowest level since May 2017 today. Some traders are pointing to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision, yesterday, to ask the World Trade Organisation for permission to impose $7bn a year in sanctions on the United States. The move is retaliation on Washington for not complying with an earlier WTO ruling. It all centres on the duties which America imposes on China for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdumping\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 goods on the US market at artificially low prices. That process, The U.S. calculation method, known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153zeroing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, has been ruled illegal in a series of trade disputes brought to the WTO. China says America hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t obeyed these previous rulings, so now wants authorisation to impose $7bn of tariffs in response. More details here. There are also signs in Vladivostok that relations between China and Japan are warming up. Japanese PM Shinzo Abe told the economic forum that he hopes to visit China soon, and to welcome Xi to Japan in the future too. Abe said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In response to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gracious invitation, I intend to visit China this year, the year in which we commemorate the 40th anniversary of the conclusion of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and China,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After that, I very much wish to invite President Xi to Japan. Through this exchange of visits at the leaders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 level, I hope to raise Japan-China relations to a new stage.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That may just sound like warm words (the diplomatic equivalent of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153darling, you really must come round for supper!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget, Tokyo and Beijing were recently at odds over a group of islands in the East China sea (known as the Senkaku islands in Japan and the Diaoyu islands in China). Those clashes raised fears of a military clash between the two Asian powerhouses - so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s friendly noises are significant. As a teetotaler, Donald Trump wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have appreciated the vodka being quaffed in Vladivostok. But the US president should still note the warmth between Xi and Putin this week. Such clear chumminess suggests that the White House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s belligerence over trade is encouraging friendships and alliances elsewhere. Naeem Aslam, analyst at Think Markets, believes America could lose out, if its rivals band together: President Xi Jinping, already said during his speech at Eastern Economic Forum in Russia that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with Russia is at all-time high. His message was clear that his country is ready to study other relationship and work on different projects with them. Putin just added more fuel on the fire during the conference and criticised those countries who favour protectionism- a direct hint to US. Trump needs to change his attitude or the US will become the biggest loser of this trade war... In fact, we think that we are moving fast toward a moment when the US will lose all of its control because other countries will have much stronger position because working together. President Vladimir Putin has now echoed Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack on US trade policies. He told the Eastern Economic Forum (EEF) in Vladivostok that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new forms of protectionism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are on the rise, threatening the Asia-Pacific region. Putin said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Basic principles of trade \u00e2\u20ac\u201d competition and mutual economic benefit \u00e2\u20ac\u201d are depreciated and unfortunately undermined, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re becoming hostages of ideological and fleeting political situations, in that we see a serious challenge for all of the global economy, especially for the dynamically-growing Asia-Pacific and its leadership,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. Other Asian stock market also fell today, dragging shares across the region to their lowest levels in 14 months. Japanese stocks fell by around 0.5%, while the Hong Kong Hang Seng shed another 0.3%. While Xi was speaking in Vladivostok, the Chinese stock market was heading into the red again. The Shanghai Composite index fell by 0.3% to close at its lowest level since late January 2016, as traders continued to be dogged by trade war worries. Indeed, it came within a whisker of hitting its lowest since 2015. Stocks in China have suffered badly from the impact of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs, as they will hurt demand for Chinese goods in America. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tit-for-tat retaliation is also dragging on the market, as it makes US goods pricier in China. Yesterday Russian president Vladimir Putin treated Xi Jinping to pancakes with caviar, washed down with best vodka, on the sidelines of the Vladivostok economic forum. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that the leaders are committed to their alliance against America powerful position. As the San Francisco Chronicle puts it: Beijing and Moscow have developed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strategic partnership\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd reflecting their shared opposition to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unipolar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd world, the term they use to describe perceived U.S. global domination. The rapprochement has been driven by a strong personal relationship between Putin and Xi, seen as the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. The two have met nearly 30 times, and Putin said that the Chinese president is the only world leader whom he once invited to celebrate his birthday. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Trade wars are on investor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minds again today, as the president of China launches a coded attack on Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policies. Chinese President Xi Jinping warned this morning that the political landscape was becoming increasingly dominated by protectionism and unilateralism. Speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum in Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vladivostok, Xi warned that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are deep and complex changes underway in the international situation, the politics of force, unilateral approaches and protectionism are rearing their head.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments come a few days after Trump threatened China with a further $267bn in tariffs, on top of the $50bn already implemented and $200bn under consideration. Faced with such firepower from Washington, the Chinese leader is now pushing for closer ties to Moscow. He told an audience in Vladivostok that China is keen to participate in development projects in Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eastern flank, arguing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have unique geographic benefits. China and Russia are the biggest neighbours, we have solid political ties. Chinese and Russian relationships are at all times high level.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That last line may raise eyebrows in London, as the UK pushes for an international response to the Salisbury Novichok poisoning..... Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments suggest Beijing is rather concerned by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enthusiasm for imposing tariffs to get America \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfair trade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not alone. Yesterday, IMF chief Christine Lagarde warned that the US-China trade war could deliver a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to emerging markets, which are already suffering from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fragmented vulnerabilities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She told the FT that a new wave of tariffs could cause economic disruption and hurt poorer consumers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trade is a positive, trade is a plus, trade needs fixing certainly but it is a tool and an engine for growth that should not be under threat, particularly at the moment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Later today, new output data may show whether the trade dispute is hurting eurozone factories. Traders will also be watching the oil price, as hurricane Florence approaches the US coast.

While that weakness may reflect the early consequences of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, other factors seem more likely to be at play. In the years following the global financial crisis, the aftereffects of that shock and the subsequent euro-area crisis exerted a drag on business investment.</p> <p>More recently, uncertainty around Brexit has had an additional dampening effect. As has been the case for some time, developments regarding the United Kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the European Union are the most significant influences on the economic outlook.

                "bodyText":"And finally, Bloomberg has punctured the earlier optimism on Wall Street. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re reporting that Donald Trump wants to press on with an extra $200bn of tariffs on China. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing official yet, but it suggests the trade war could soon enter a new phase. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour of the story: President Donald Trump instructed aides on Thursday to proceed with tariffs on about $200 billion more in Chinese products despite his Treasury secretary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to restart talks with Beijing to resolve the trade war, according to four people familiar with the matter. But an announcement of the new round of tariffs has been delayed as the administration considers revisions based on concerns raised in public comments, the people said. Trump may be running low on products he can target without significant backlash from major U.S. companies and consumers, two of the people said. So the Dow is now in the red, down 32 points at 26,113. The FTSE 100 had earlier closed 22 points higher at 7,304. And on that note, goodnight. GW Exactly ten years ago, some of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top bankers, politicians and officials were engaged in desperate, unsuccceessful, last-ditch discussions on whether, and how, to bail out Lehman Brothers. So here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some weekend reading on what we have, and haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, learned in the decade since: Just in: US consumers are more optimistic, as they shrug off worries about trade wars. The University of Michigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer morale index has jumped to 100.8 this month, rather stronger than August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading of 96.2. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest reading since March. Financial markets are ending the week on a bright note, despite trade war worries and fresh developments in the Mueller investigation. European equities are all up today, with the FTSE 100 some 25 points higher at 7307, up 0.3% today. Wall Street has opened higher too, with the Dow Jones industrial average 50 points higher at 26,194. Court filings show that Paul Manafort, Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former campaign chief, faces two new charges - one count of conspiracy against the United States, one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice. Legal experts believe Manafort has reached a plea deal with special council Robert Mueller, who is leading the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election. Last month, Manafort was convicted of 8 counts of fraud. This might take Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind off trade war issues. Alternatively, the president may feel forced to respond to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surrender to Washington. Ursula Johnston, head of customs at law firm Gowling WLG, says it would be better if both sides could ditch the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bravado\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and simply negotiate: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was potential for this bravado to die down, which would have better allowed for real, practical dialogue that benefits the undeniably interlinked trading relationship the US and China historically have. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But with an intense war of words continuing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and likely to for some time to come, given Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tendency to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpost from the hip\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ability to salvage traditional links without fundamentally changing the world trade order will decrease. China is showing all the signs that it will not concede to the US, even if that comes with a big cost \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and indeed, will see that it is an important principle not to allow the US to impose on it trade terms. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The China/US spat could become a global issue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy slows down then that heavily impacts many countries that supply it with the raw materials \u00e2\u20ac\u201c typically emerging economies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The slowdown in American retail sales is a surprise, say Capital Economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Andrew Hunter, but it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deter the US Federal Reserve from raising interest rates again soon. Hunter writes: As the boost from the tax cuts starts to fade, spending growth is likely to continue slowing gradually over the coming months. For now, however, with the labour market continuing to tighten and inflationary pressures building, the strength of consumer spending growth keeps the Fed on course to continue raising interest rates once a quarter, with the next hike coming at the FOMC meeting later this month. Just in: US shops have posted their smallest sales increase in six months. U.S. retail sales only rose by 0.1% in August, new data shows, as consumers cut back on purchases of motor vehicles, electrical goods and clothing. But more encouragingly, July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increase has been revised up to 0.7%, from 0.5%. Gill Furniss, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow Steel Minister, has blamed the UK government for the looming job cuts at British Steel: She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is extremely worrying news. Workers at British Steel fought against the odds to defend the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future, even though the Government has refused to properly support the steel industry. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Workers will see this as another blow to an already fragile situation and will worry it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a prelude to further job losses. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government has failed to support steel. They have failed to stand up to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aggressive policies, which threaten our industry and they have failed to produce a steel sector deal or address the vital issues facing steel companies, such as the disproportionately high electricity prices that hamper growth and investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mike Ashley, the founder of Sports Direct, has gone nuclear. SPD has just released an astonishing statement to the City, in which Ashley accuses shareholders of stabbing him and the company in the back. Ashley is furious that investors didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide more support to ex-chairman Keith Hellawell, who quit this week after repeated criticism over SPD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate governance. After stewing on the issue for 48 hours, Ashley has now let rip, saying investors have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153failed to support Sports Direct, Keith and myself\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In a blistering statement, Ashley says: It is blatantly apparent that true entrepreneurs will never be accepted in the public arena. The media circus surrounding Sports Direct, including but not restricted to matters connected to our AGM, only proves that whatever progress Sports Direct makes, it will always be subject to disproportionate scrutiny and misrepresentation. In light of the above, and despite the substantial progress made over the last few years, the shareholders have now made it extremely challenging for future engagement to take place. On the one hand they are delighted with our performance and progress, yet with the other hand they have stabbed Sports Direct and myself in the back by repeatedly hounding Keith Hellawell. Hellawell has been expected to face a shareholder revolt at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM, before his resignation removed the need to vote on his re-election. Instead, nearly 10% of shareholders voted against Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reappointment to the board instead. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chunky revolt, given Ashley owns 61% of the company (and presumably didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vote against himself). This attack might ignite speculation that Ashley could take the company private. Back in Dublin, Mark Carney has downplayed those reports that the Bank of England was predicting a house price crash if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. Reuters has the details: Carney did not directly address the media reports in a question and answer session after a speech at the Irish central bank, but said bank \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstress test\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scenarios in which house prices fell sharply did not amount to a prediction from the BoE. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a prediction of what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to happen, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we need to do in order to make sure that ... the system is very clearly and transparently ... able to continue to lend,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the steel job cuts: The Financial Times says most of British Steel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned job cuts will hit its Scunthorpe site, adding: Under Indian steelmaker Tata the business was on the verge of collapse in 2016 but workers agreed to pension reductions and pay restraint to allow a sale. Greybull, a family investment firm, bought the business and said it had invested \u00c2\u00a3170m since. Scunthorpe is one of the only two UK locations where steel is made in a blast furnace. British Steel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main products are rails, wire rod, and steel for the construction industry. Newsflash: Bank of England governor Mark Carney is warning that the uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dampened\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd economic growth. Carney is giving the 2018 Whitaker Lecture, at the Central Bank of Ireland. The speech is mostly about the 4th Industrial Revolution (the rise of automation and robotics). But the governor has shoe-horned a Brexit angle onto the end of the speech, warning that has already hurt pay growth...and explaining how the Bank might be forced to raise interest rates if a disorderly Brexit hurts the pound. Carney says: Although current rates of pay growth in the UK are below pre-crisis averages, this largely reflects continued weakness in productivity growth. While that weakness may reflect the early consequences of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, other factors seem more likely to be at play. In the years following the global financial crisis, the aftereffects of that shock and the subsequent euro-area crisis exerted a drag on business investment. More recently, uncertainty around Brexit has had an additional dampening effect. As has been the case for some time, developments regarding the United Kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the European Union are the most significant influences on the economic outlook. And while the impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution may be felt over the coming decades, some of the Brexit effects on supply may be much more immediate. The Bank of England is well-prepared for whatever path the economy takes, including a wide range of potential Brexit outcomes. We have used our stress test to ensure that the largest UK banks can continue to meet the needs of UK households and businesses even through a disorderly Brexit, however unlikely that may be. Our job, after all, is not to hope for the best but to plan for the worst. The MPC will respond to any persistent change in the outlook to bring inflation sustainably back to 2% target while doing what it can to support jobs and activity. The appropriate policy response is not automatic and will depend on the balance of the effects on demand, supply, and the exchange rate. British Steel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning about the weak pound highlights an important point: a lower currency doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t automatically help exporters. Instead, a weak currency can be expensive for any firm that buys raw materials and energy from abroad. But shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a cheap pound make exports more competitive in America? Yes, but.... this advantage has been destroyed by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs. They make European steel imports 25% pricier, eroding the competitive advantage from a cheap pound. Nic Dakin, Labour MP for Scunthorpe, has issued a statement on the job cuts: The news that British Steel is to shed 400 jobs is devastating news to a workforce that have done everything asked of them over the last two years. They have taken a pay cut, seen their pensions change and worked hard to get British Steel on its way. Three years on from the height of the steel crisis the Conservative Government hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken any steps to level the playing field for the UK steel industry. Despite massive goodwill from the steel sector there is still no sector deal for steel in place. And the Government is dragging its feet on improving public procurement, tackling unequal energy costs, tackling high business taxes and supporting capital investment. As we leave the EU the Government is not giving steel the priority it needs to be confident of a fair deal post Brexit. So today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news is a wake-up call to Government to get its act together and get behind our steelworkers and steelmakers. I am talking to British Steel. the steel unions and the Government, doing all I can to stand up for local steelworkers and their families at this difficult time. Roland Junck, British Steel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive chairman, says the job cuts will create a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sustainable future\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the company. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll further discuss our proposals, which would consider applications for voluntary redundancy, with senior union representatives. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll ensure this process is handled in a sensitive manner. We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t set any deadlines but aim to keep the period of uncertainty for our people as short as we can. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know this will be a worrying time for many and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do everything possible to ensure our people continue to get the support they deserve, now and in the future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Unions says British Steel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed job cuts are a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153body blow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to its workforce, especially as the company actually made a profit last year: A spokesperson for the National Trade Union Steel Coordinating Committee said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This announcement will come as a body blow to the workforce who have already made huge sacrifices to make the business sustainable. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We recognise these are challenging times for UK steelmakers, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high time the government stepped up and delivered for us by supporting investment in strategic steel assets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However it is particularly disappointing the company has chosen to cut jobs so soon after celebrating a second successful year and first quarter profits of \u00c2\u00a321m. Newsflash: British Steel is cutting up to 400 jobs -- and blamed the weakness of the UK pound over the last couple of years. The company, which runs the Scunthorpe Steelworks, says it is streamlining its operations. The plans include cutting up to 400 managerial, professional and administrative roles at its operations throughout the UK, Ireland, France and the Netherlands. British Steel was created in 2016, with assets spun out from Tata Steel. It employs 5,000 across its operations. It also runs rolling facilities at Skinningrove (UK), Teesside (UK), and Hayange (France), alongside the Scunthorpe plant. Gerald Reichmann, British Steel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief financial officer, says sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness against the US dollar since 2016 is one factor behind today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job cuts: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made a strong start to life as British Steel but our external environment is constantly changing. For example, raw materials are all traded in US dollars, so the weakening of the pound and euro have implications for us. Like any business we need to be able to flex and adapt to these changes. Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery, the pound is still worth 10% less than before the EU referendum (when it was worth around $1.47, vs $1.31 today). More to follow... On Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no-deal warning to the cabinet.... it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doomsday scenario of soaring unemployment and tumbling house prices is exactly what the BoE models in its annual bank stress tests. The theory is that a whopping \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK-specific risk premium shock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will send the pound tumbling, driving up inflation and forcing interest rates to be hiked. That would hurt economic growth, and also trigger a house price crash. You can see the details here. So in one sense, the governor is right to make such a warning -- a no-deal Brexit is exactly the kind of shock that would cause heavy losses for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks. But on the upside, the UK financial system passed last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress tests. They proved that the banks could ride out the storm of a disorderly Brexit. Ed Conway of Sky News suggests that such scenarios should be treated cautiously, not as gospel.... Sterling has now gained two cents against the US dollar since Monday morning, putting it on track for its second-best week this year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly because the dollar has been weakening this week, but also shows that the City isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t - yet - in full-blown Brexit panic. Boom! The pound has hit its highest level against the US dollar since the start of August. Sterling strengthened by 0.2% to nudge $1.3138 in morning trading, as investors refused to be panicked by the BoE governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dire predictions to the cabinet yesterday. Carlo Alberto De Casa of ActivTrades says the City is optimistic that a no-deal Brexit can be avoided. Markets at this point seem quite confident that a deal can be reached, and the pound is firming. Cable [the \u00c2\u00a3/$ rate] in particular is continuing its rise, even if this appears mostly due to the temporary weakness of the US dollar, as the recovery of euro against the greenback illustrates. In the City, housebuilders shares have dipped following Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that a no-deal Brexit could cause a housing crash. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly modest reaction really; Barratt Development and Taylor Wimpey are down around 1%. That shows some nervousness, but not a panic. Chinese statistics bureau spokesman Mao Shengyong has told reporters in Beijing that investment growth should stabilize in the months ahead, as the government expands its efforts to kick-start large projects. Shuang Ding, an economist at Standard Chartered, is concerned that investment in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories and railways has slowed sharply this year. Ding warns: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If investment, especially infrastructure investment, fails to recover in September, the risk on economic growth would be very large.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Overnight, new official data has suggested that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is feeling a chill from the dispute with the US. Fixed-asset investment growth slowed to just 5.3% in the first eight months of the year, weaker than expected, and the lowest on record. That shows that companies are cutting back on new plants and machinery, as they fret about the prospect of a major trade war. Tariffs are already making it more expensive to import US goods into China, and making Chinese products less competitive in American shops. More encouragingly, retail sales in China rose by 9% year-on-year in August (up fro 8.8%), and industrial growth picked up to 6.1% (from 6%). Trade war news: China has fired another warning shot at America as the two countries ongoing dispute rattles on. The state-run China Daily newspaper -- usually a firm guide to Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking -- has published an editorial today insisting that Chinese officials won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t roll over. It says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Trump administration should not be mistaken that China will surrender to the U.S. demands. It has enough fuel to drive its economy even if a trade war is prolonged.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd China Daily also warns that Beijing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will not hesitate to take countermeasures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, if Donald Trump decides to unleash fresh tariffs. Currently, Trump is weighing up whether to impose $200bn of tariffs on Chinese goods, on top of the existing $50bn. The president is trying to push Beijing to reduce trade barriers facing US companies looking to trade in China, and to lower the huge trade gap between the two nations. Yesterday, he denied feeling pressure to reach a deal: But investors are hoping that a deeper trade war can be avoided. Earlier this week, it emerged that US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin had reached out to Beijing to re-open negotiations over trade, in an attempt to avoid a second round of tit-for-tat tariffs that could hurt the world economy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. City traders and cabinet ministers are digesting a stern warning from the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governor this morning. Yesterday, Mark Carney dropped into the cabinet room to warn Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ministers that a no-deal Brexit could be catastrophic for the economy. In a chilling assessment, Carney explained how a no-deal Brexit could cause as much damage as the financial crisis that crippled the UK economy a decade ago. The governor explained that unemployment could surge into double-digits (from just 4%) today, and that house prices could plunge by up to a third. Carney also outlined how transport links would be badly hit, also hurting economic growth. My colleagues Pippa Crerar and Dan Sabbagh explains: Several sources said Carney compared the outcome of a no-deal Brexit with the fallout from the 2008 financial crash. One cabinet minister told the Guardian: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just stand by. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in 2008. He wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t saying it was all going to happen but I think there is a recognition that you do have to contemplate the worst-case scenario.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Having given the cabinet the goosebumps, Carney has jetted off to Dublin to give a lecture to the Central Bank of Ireland. It commemorates former CBI governor Ken Whitaker - but the City will be listening for any more dire predictions from the BoE. Traders will also be keeping an eye out for new eurozone trade data, plus US retail sales figures, which may show if economic growth is being hit by trade disputes. The agenda: 10am BST: Eurozone trade balance for July 11am BST: Mark Carney gives the Whitaker Lecture in Dublin 1.30pm BST: US retail sales for August 3pm BST: University of Michigan sentiment data",

As we noted last year, <strong>Brexit-related effects are the driving factor for the slowdown </strong>in growth since the referendum. This has occurred despite strong policy frameworks and implementation. Uncertainty about the future economic environment has weighed on investment, despite still robust global growth and easy financing conditions, while the post-referendum depreciation of sterling has depressed real income growth and consumption. While exports have picked up thanks to the weaker currency, they have not done so by enough to prevent an overall slowing of growth. Despite the more modest growth, however, employment continues to reach record levels, and the unemployment rate is near historic lows.</p> \n   <p>Our projections assume a timely agreement with the EU on a broad free trade pact and a relatively smooth Brexit process after that. A more disruptive departure will have a much worse outcome. Let me be clear: <strong>compared with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s smooth single market, all the likely Brexit scenarios will have costs for the UK economy </strong>, and to a lesser extent for the EU, as well. The larger the impediments to trade in the new relationship, the costlier it will be. This should be obvious, but it seems that sometimes it is not.</p> \n   <p><strong>We should not understate the progress that has been achieved in the Brexit negotiations </strong>, most notably the tentative agreement on an implementation period. But many critical issues remain unresolved, most significantly a political agreement on the future economic relationship between the UK and the EU and the status of the Irish land border. We encourage both the UK and the EU to work diligently to reach agreement on these open issues to avoid a very costly cliff edge Brexit.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IMFNews/status/1041663699377897473\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Managing Director Christine Lagarde\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening remarks at the press conference for the UK Article 4 consultation in London today <a href=\"https://t.co/w4Li068xLb\">https://t.co/w4Li068xLb</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/3Z7jC6atCU\">pic.twitter.com/3Z7jC6atCU</a></p>\u00e2\u20ac\u201d IMF (@IMFNews) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IMFNews/status/1041663699377897473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 17, 2018</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5b9f9746e4b0f675819f2a70\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-17T12:02:03.321Z\">1.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Video: IMF chief Lagarde today</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The BBC have helpfully tweeted two video clips of Christine Lagarde speaking this morning.</strong></p> \n  <p>Here she is, explaining how all the possible Brexit scenarios have a cost for the UK economy, and Europe too.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/1041625398386188288\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Christine Lagarde: \"All the likely Brexit scenarios will have costs for the UK economy, and to a lesser extent the EU\"<br><br>IMF chief warns no-deal <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Brexit</a> carries greatest risk to UK economy <a href=\"https://t.co/qoZfwsMeLJ\">https://t.co/qoZfwsMeLJ</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/1EJW7Ju581\">pic.twitter.com/1EJW7Ju581</a></p>\u00e2\u20ac\u201d BBC News (UK) (@BBCNews) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/1041625398386188288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 17, 2018</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lagarde on the specific negative consequences of a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/1041634622239592448\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Christine Lagarde: No-deal <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Brexit</a> would lead to \"reduced growth, increased deficit, depreciation of the currency\"<br><br>IMF chief warns of grave consequences if Britain leaves EU without a deal <a href=\"https://t.co/HKfrsQyRrF\">https://t.co/HKfrsQyRrF</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/sWWd3Y8RHq\">pic.twitter.com/sWWd3Y8RHq</a></p>\u00e2\u20ac\u201d BBC News (UK) (@BBCNews) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/1041634622239592448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 17, 2018</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-09-17T12:02:23.411Z\">at 1.02pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5b9f947de4b0f675819f2a4c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-17T12:00:03.328Z\">1.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official spokesman has played down<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/sep/17/markets-trump-tariffs-china-imf-lagarde-uk-business-live?page=with:block-5b9f65b5e4b02292746e6067#block-5b9f65b5e4b02292746e6067\"> the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim</a> that a no-deal Brexit would be very costly for Britain.</strong></p> \n  <p>The Press Association has the details:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Chancellor Hammond said the report underlined the need for a Brexit deal to ensure the economic gains of the past decade were not lost. </p> \n   <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are at a critical juncture for the UK economy.

This means that the UK has underperformed major rivals.</p> \n  <p>The IMF says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Uncertainty over the terms of the EU withdrawal has weighed on private sector activity. Above-target inflation following the sharp post-referendum sterling depreciation has slowed real income and consumption growth.</p> \n   <p>Business investment has been lower than would be expected in the context of robust global growth and favorable financing conditions. The softening of domestic demand was partially offset by a higher contribution from net exports, supported by weaker sterling and strong external demand. Overall, growth fell to about 1\u00c2\u00be percent in 2016-17, moving the United Kingdom from the top to near the bottom of the G7 growth tables. The employment rate, however, continues to reach record highs.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The IMF estimates that the UK will probably grow by around 1.5% this year, and in 2019 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d below its long-run average.</p> \n  <p>That projection assumes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153timely agreement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of a Brexit trade deal, and a smooth transition.

In addition, the government will need to renegotiate the hundreds of bilateral and multilateral international agreements to which it is now party via its EU membership. Many of the required tasks cannot be initiated until there is greater clarity on the future trade relationship with the EU or even until Brexit occurs.</p> \n   <p>The massive scope of work that remains and the limited time before the UK exits the EU would likely leave preparations incomplete on departure day despite even the most determined efforts. This risks serious disruptions without an implementation period in place.

                "bodyText":"And finally, a quiet day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has ended. The FTSE 100 index closed just two points lower at 7,302 (or down a barely noticeable 0.03%). Fiona Cincotta of City Index says the US-China trade dispute kept a lid on shares today. The FTSE had a slightly choppy day, with a mid-morning recovery cut short by the US markets starting to slide as US-China tensions escalated again. A set of different media reports is coming from the US, most of them still unconfirmed, saying that the US might tone down its initial plans to introduce a 25% tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and instead bring in tariffs of only 10%. Other news reports are more prominently carrying President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about how the tariffs have put the US in a good negotiating position. Amidst all of this China is saying that it will respond in kind to any US move but more worryingly is threatening to walk away from near term negotiations altogether, which would cement the tariff system for the time being. The trade tit-for-tat is keeping the markets in Europe, Asia and the US on their toes over the possible escalation of the conflict and is deflecting focus from any other underlying regional drivers, such as the fundamentally fairly strong state of the US economy. The dollar is weaker against the pound, the euro and the yen and is just holding the line against the Canadian dollar. And on that note, goodnight! GW The Labour Party has now weighed in, urging chancellor Philip Hammond to hammer home the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning to his cabinet colleagues. John McDonnell MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chancellor, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today the IMF has underlined the warnings that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already heard from trade unions and business organisations about the damage that a cliff edge Brexit would do to our economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Once again I call on the Chancellor to show some leadership and make it clear to his colleagues that he will not accept a no deal Brexit and the damage it risks doing to jobs, wages and living standards in this country\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Time for a recap: The International Monetary Fund has warned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy will be hit hard if the country leaves the EU without a deal. In its latest assessment of the UK economy, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said a no-deal Brexit would hit growth and weaken the pound. She told a press conference in London that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If that happened there would be dire consequences. It would inevitably have consequences in terms of reduced growth, an increase in the [budget] deficit and a depreciation of the currency. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In relatively short order it would mean a reduction in the size of the economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The IMF warned that the UK economy will be permanently smaller after Brexit, regardless of the flavour, compared to staying in the EU and enjoying frictionless trade. The Fund also warned that Britain faces a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153daunting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd list of tasks to clear before Brexit in March 2019, adding: The massive scope of work that remains and the limited time before the UK exits the EU would likely leave preparations incomplete on departure day despite even the most determined efforts. In a pointed nod to some of his own colleagues, chancellor Philip Hammond said the UK must heed Lagarde\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning and ensure a close relationship with the EU for the future. Otherwise, Hammond claims, the UK could lose the progress made since the financial crsisis. Stock markets in Asia have fallen, following reports that America could impose tariffs on an extra $200bn of Chinese imports this week. The Shanghai stock exchange has hit its lowest level since 2014, as trade war fears swept local exchanges. Donald Trump has ratcheted up the pressure, warning that countries who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t play fair will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tariffed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... In a worrying sign for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auto industry, 3,000 staff at Jaguar Land Rover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plant at Castle Bromwich are moving to a three-day week. My colleague Rob Davies reports: The news came hours after the carmaker was accused of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scaremongering\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdabout the impact of Brexit by a Conservative MP. JLR, owned by the Indian conglomerate Tata, said it had made the decision to reduce production in the light of difficult conditions in the automotive industry, amid sluggish demand. A spokesperson said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In light of the continuing headwinds impacting the car industry, we are making some temporary adjustments to our production schedules at Castle Bromwich. Just in, growth in New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector has slowed this month. The Empire manufacturing index of business conditions has dropped to 19 this month, sharply down on August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 25.6. Firms reported a slowdown in new orders, and a rise in costs -- perhaps a sign that the trade war is hurting. The IMF have now uploaded Christine Lagarde\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening statement at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Article Four press conference on the UK economy. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key section, on Brexit: For the UK, we are projecting growth of about 1\u00c2\u00bd percent this year and next , down from about 1\u00c2\u00be percent in 2016 and 2017. As we noted last year, Brexit-related effects are the driving factor for the slowdown in growth since the referendum. This has occurred despite strong policy frameworks and implementation. Uncertainty about the future economic environment has weighed on investment, despite still robust global growth and easy financing conditions, while the post-referendum depreciation of sterling has depressed real income growth and consumption. While exports have picked up thanks to the weaker currency, they have not done so by enough to prevent an overall slowing of growth. Despite the more modest growth, however, employment continues to reach record levels, and the unemployment rate is near historic lows. Our projections assume a timely agreement with the EU on a broad free trade pact and a relatively smooth Brexit process after that. A more disruptive departure will have a much worse outcome. Let me be clear: compared with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s smooth single market, all the likely Brexit scenarios will have costs for the UK economy , and to a lesser extent for the EU, as well. The larger the impediments to trade in the new relationship, the costlier it will be. This should be obvious, but it seems that sometimes it is not. We should not understate the progress that has been achieved in the Brexit negotiations , most notably the tentative agreement on an implementation period. But many critical issues remain unresolved, most significantly a political agreement on the future economic relationship between the UK and the EU and the status of the Irish land border. We encourage both the UK and the EU to work diligently to reach agreement on these open issues to avoid a very costly cliff edge Brexit. The BBC have helpfully tweeted two video clips of Christine Lagarde speaking this morning. Here she is, explaining how all the possible Brexit scenarios have a cost for the UK economy, and Europe too. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lagarde on the specific negative consequences of a no-deal Brexit. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official spokesman has played down the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that a no-deal Brexit would be very costly for Britain. The Press Association has the details: Chancellor Hammond said the report underlined the need for a Brexit deal to ensure the economic gains of the past decade were not lost. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are at a critical juncture for the UK economy. Despite the contingency actions we are taking, leaving without a deal would put at risk the substantial progress the British people have made over the last 10 years,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Downing Street stopped short of an explicit endorsement of Mr Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning. When asked whether the Prime Minister backed her Chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment, Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official spokesman told reporters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The PM said very clearly that she believes our best days are ahead of us and we will have plans in place to allow us to succeed in all scenarios.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Geraint Johnes, Professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School, has warned that the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new forecasts could be too optimistic. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The IMF forecast of 1.5% growth for UK GDP both this year and next comes on the same day as some even more pessimistic forecasts from the British Chambers of Commerce (who are now forecasting 1.1% and 1.3% growth in 2018 and 2019 respectively). In both cases, risks posed by Brexit are to the fore. Professor Johnes is also concerned that Brexit is distracting minister other issues (such as fixing productivity, as Lagarde pointed out this morning) The IMF emphasises actions which the UK needs to take, specifically in the arenas of productivity and regional development, to stimulate improved growth. While, in the Industrial Strategy and the Northern Powerhouse, the government has measures in place, these have necessarily taken a back seat over the last two years, and renewed efforts are needed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meanwhile in America, Donald Trump is awake...and threatening that countries who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trade fairly will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tariffed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: (Mr Morici was speaking on Fox and Friends, one of the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favourite shows) Labour MP David Lammy MP says the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy forecasts prove that the UK should hold a second referendum on Brexit. Lammy, who supports the Best for Britain campaign, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The IMF report proves beyond doubt that the Tories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 plans would act as a sledgehammer to the UK economy. The substantial costs would weigh disproportionately on those with the least. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not fair on the most vulnerable in this country. The Prime Minister might try to trumpet this report as a victory for her Chequers plan, but doing so would be to deceive the British people. She and the Brexit extremists who have held a gun to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head should take responsibility for this entire mess. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No deal would be a nightmare - that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for certain. We need a people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote with the option to stay in the EU.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more snap reaction to the IMF press conference. Reuters has focused on Christine Lagarde\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that a no-deal Brexit would be bad for growth: Shehab Khan of the Independent fears the impact of Brexit on the UK people: The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Katie Hile points out that Lagarde hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given up hope that a Brexit deal will be reached: I missed this point earlier, but the IMF may also be preparing to cut its global growth forecasts: Q: You says Britain faces \u00e2\u20ac\u0153daunting\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit challenges, so would a 21-month transition period actually be long enough? Christine Lagarde replies that any extension to the proposed transition arrangement would be welcomed by those officials charged with negotiating new deals. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the press conference. Q: Does the IMF believe there will actually be a Brexit dividend, or not? Christine Lagarde says Britain faces a short-term cost from Brexit, and a separate long-term dividend, which arrives gradually over time. But these two may not be the same size, she warns. Philip Gerson, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK mission chief, weighs in too, warning: The UK will be permanently smaller [after Brexit], and that means permanently lower revenues. Q: What should policymakers do, if Britain leaves the EU without a deal? Lagarde reiterates that a a No deal Brexit would be a severe supply shock to UK economy. And in that case, she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think a fiscal response would address the roots of the problem. In other words, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the government to boost spending. On the workload issue, Lagarde says Britain needs to negotiate 63 trade deals in case there is a no-deal Brexit. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153heck of a lot of work\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she says dryly. Christine Lagarde says she \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hopes and prays\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that there will be a deal between the UK and the EU (on her last visit, she said a no-deal Brexit was unimaginable). Q: Would a no-deal Brexit push the UK into recession? Christine Lagarde says the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economists are working on its forecasts for different Brexit scenarios, and will present them to its Board in November. Q: Could Britain could use a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit dividend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to provide extra funding for the National Health Service (the Brexit bus pledge)? Lagarde warns that any Brexit dividend won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come into the UK purse instantly, it will come over a period instead. So, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think you can actually front-load what is due to come later to address a financing that is needed now. Q: Is the Brexit debate distracting politicians from tackling other economic problems? Lagarde replies icily that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity would certainly improve if the same level of passion directed at Brexit was put into tackling the productivity crisis. Christine Lagarde is now taking questions. She declines to answer a question about a possible second referendum Q: Why would a no-deal Brexit be so bad? If that was to happen, it would have severe economic consequences, Lagarde predicts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would be a shock to supply, and would result in reduced growth, increased deficit, depreciation of the currency...and in reasonable short order, it would mean a reduction in the size of the UK economy. Lagarde also warns that the UK economy will be weaker after Brexit, whatever deal is reached. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any deal would not be as good as the smooth process under which goods, services, people and capital move between the EU and the UK without barriers, without impediments and obstacles. Whatever the deal is will not be as good as it is at the moment. Christine Lagarde says that Brexit isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only challenge facing the UK. Productivity is another bugbear. By the average Thursday afternoon, the average US or German worker has produced as much as a UK worker manages by Friday afternoon, she points out. But there are reasons for hope too. Lagarde says Britain can take comfort from its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153long and glorious history\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the strength of its people. [given today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy warnings, we may need it....] IMF chief Christine Lagarde is now speaking. She warns that a no-deal Breixt would impose very large costs on the UK economy. Leaving the EU without an agreement is the most significant near-term risk to the UK economy, she continues. Lagarde confirms that the IMF expects the UK will only grow by 1.5% this year and next year. Brexit effects are the main reason for this slowdown, she says. Those forecasts are based on the assumption that the UK and EU reach a deal, Lagarde reminds her audience. A No-deal Brexit would have more disruptive effects on growth. Turning to trade, Lagarde warns that all the likely Brexit scenarios will have costs for the UK economy, and to a lesser extent for the EU as well. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This should be fairly obvious, but it seems that sometimes it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she adds with a shrug. The IMF and the Treasury are holding a press conference in London now to discuss today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Article IV\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd report. Uk chancellor Philip Hammond speaks first, saying the UK economy is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fundamentally strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He points out that that unemployment is at a 43-year low. But we have reached a critical juncture for the UK economy, Hammond continues. He says Britain must reach a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153close and enduring partnership\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with its EU partners, and not put the achievements of recent years at risk. Hammond adds that we must heed the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant cost\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that not reaching a deal will have on British jobs and British prosperity. Some instant reaction to the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new healthcheck on the UK economy, and its Brexit warning: The IMF also warns that a no-deal Brexit would be much worse for the UK than the negotiated exit which Theresa May is pushing for. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report says: Brexit negotiations have yielded agreement in principle on a 21-month implementation period. If ratified, this would allow important additional time to prepare for the new relationship between the UK and EU. However, fundamental questions\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsuch as the future economic relationship between the two and the closely-related question of the status of the land border with Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u201dremain unanswered. Resolving these issues is critical to avoid a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit on WTO terms that would entail substantial costs for the UK economy\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand to a lesser extent the EU economies\u00e2\u20ac\u201dparticularly if it were to occur in a disorderly fashion. While all likely Brexit outcomes will entail costs for the UK economy by departing from the frictionless single market that now prevails, an agreement that minimizes the introduction of new tariff and nontariff barriers would best protect growth and incomes in the UK and EU. Over time, new trade agreements with countries outside the EU could eventually pare some of these losses for the UK. However, such agreements are unlikely to bring sufficient benefits to offset the costs imposed by leaving the EU. Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund is warning that Britain faces a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153daunting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd list of challenges ahead of Brexit next spring. In its latest healthcheck on the UK economy, just released, the Fund points out that growth has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moderated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd since the EU referendum of 2016. This means that the UK has underperformed major rivals. The IMF says: Uncertainty over the terms of the EU withdrawal has weighed on private sector activity. Above-target inflation following the sharp post-referendum sterling depreciation has slowed real income and consumption growth. Business investment has been lower than would be expected in the context of robust global growth and favorable financing conditions. The softening of domestic demand was partially offset by a higher contribution from net exports, supported by weaker sterling and strong external demand. Overall, growth fell to about 1\u00c2\u00be percent in 2016-17, moving the United Kingdom from the top to near the bottom of the G7 growth tables. The employment rate, however, continues to reach record highs. The IMF estimates that the UK will probably grow by around 1.5% this year, and in 2019 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d below its long-run average. That projection assumes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153timely agreement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of a Brexit trade deal, and a smooth transition. However.... A more disruptive departure from the EU could lead to a significantly worse outcome, especially if it were to occur without an implementation period. By contrast, an agreement featuring fewer impediments to trade than currently expected could buoy business and consumer confidence, leading to faster growth. And even if a transition deal is agreed, many challenges lie ahead. Indeed, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmassive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 workload can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be cleared by March 2019, the IMF believes, even if both sides work constructively at top speed. As today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Article IV Mission, puts it: The range of remaining issues to prepare for Brexit is daunting, underscoring the importance of securing an implementation period. The UK will have to bolster human, physical, and IT resources in customs and other services, and establish domestic agencies to replace EU ones. In addition, the government will need to renegotiate the hundreds of bilateral and multilateral international agreements to which it is now party via its EU membership. Many of the required tasks cannot be initiated until there is greater clarity on the future trade relationship with the EU or even until Brexit occurs. The massive scope of work that remains and the limited time before the UK exits the EU would likely leave preparations incomplete on departure day despite even the most determined efforts. This risks serious disruptions without an implementation period in place. Co-ordination and co-operation between the EU and UK on priority issues, such as ensuring air traffic continues to flow, would be to the benefit of both parties. Joint technical discussions between UK and EU experts could facilitate this process. Jameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy and market research at FXTM, says the US-China trade dispute is worrying investors as they returned to their desks today. There is no disputing that one of the main contributors to the uncertain external environment is mixed messages when it comes to the status of trade talks between the United States and China. Conflicting reports remained a theme over the weekend when indications circulated that on one hand President Trump has provided the green light for additional Chinese tariffs being met, with other reports that Beijing was considering rejecting the offer from Washington to resume trade talks. This ultimately suggests to investors that we are no closer to an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd door when it comes to prolonged trade uncertainty. As such, it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a major surprise if investors remain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153risk off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as trading for the week gets underway Boom! China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has closed at its lowest level since 2014, as traders brace for fresh US tariffs. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.1% slide takes the Shanghai Composite Index down to 2,651 points, the weakest point since late November 2014. Every sector on the index lost ground, following those reports that president Trump could sign off $200bn of new tariffs this week. European stock markets have opened cautiously, as trade worries weigh on investors. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has dropped by half a percent, while the FTSE 100 has dipped a toe into the red. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, Head of Investment at interactive investor, says: European equity markets have started the week lower, following Asian markets down, as President Trump mulls new tariffs against China. President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s style is to escalate the pressure to try and generate as much leverage as he can in any potential negotiation, but China may not play his game, with reports that they are considering pulling out of any trade talks, making it difficult to see a resolution to the tensions in the short term. The Global Times newspaper, published by the Chinese Communist Party, has vowed to launch a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbeautiful\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 counterattack if the US imposes more tariffs. Reuters has the details: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is nothing new for the U.S. to try to escalate tensions so as to exploit more gains at the negotiating table,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Global Times, which is published by the ruling Communist Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daily, wrote in an editorial on Monday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are looking forward to a more beautiful counter-attack and will keep increasing the pain felt by the U.S.,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Chinese-language column said. Paul Donovan of UBS isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by the prospect of America slapping fresh tariffs on Chinese goods: It is all change in the flip-flop world of US trade policy. Media reports suggest US President Trump will impose yet more taxes on Americans who dare to buy things partially made in China. There are also reports China will refuse to attend trade talks with the US. This is not official \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are no tweets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but Asian markets reacted. Trade issues and their impact on the global economy are likely to dominate investor focus this week, says Stephen Innes of foreign exchange group OANDA. Innes says Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s push for fresh tariffs on Chinese goods could undermine Treasury Secretary Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to broker a trade deal with China. China officials will continue to be frustrated. This good cop / bad cop routine continues to undermine Mr Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still not clear if anyone other the Trump himself is commissioned to cut a deal. And not too unexpectedly and quite ominously China could cancel the meeting. But assuming the Tariff go through Tuesday, given that this is not so unexpected I guess the big question is 10 % or 25%, and I suspect this is where the event tail risk lies. If Trump comes out with 25 %, we could get an outsized market reaction. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new week, but investors are fretting about a familiar fear - Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade wars. Over the weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported that the US president is poised to impose a fresh round of tariffs targeting about $200 billion in Chinese goods, from consumer products to machinery and chemicals. According to the Journal, the tariffs are expected to be set at around 10%, rather than the 25% which Trump recently floated. It reported that: President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision..is designed to give the US more leverage in discussions with China over allegations that Beijing coerces American firms into handing over valuable technology to Chinese peers. Even so, such a move would escalate the trade dispute with China and doubtless provoke a retaliation. As one senior Chinese official put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China is not going to negotiate with a gun pointed to its head.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The US first floated these tariffs in July, putting the idea out to consultation. That process ended last week, and the WSJ believes an announcement could come today or tomorrow. This has disappointed the markets. Last week, shares rose after it emerged that Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin was trying to organise fresh talks with Chinese officials over trade. Those negotiations now look fragile. So Asian indices are falling back into the red. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite has shed 1%, while Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng index is down 1.2%. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says investors are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly concerned\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upcoming decision. The president of the United States, Donald Trump is determined to put another $200 billion of tariffs on Chinese goods. There was some hope last week that the White House may be able to resolve this matter with Beijing in a more peaceful fashion. China has made one thing clear for Trump that threats and such behaviour aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to work with the country. Under the current circumstances, there are real chances that the new set of negotiations may never begin. So far, the Chinese government has declined to resume the trade talks because Trump is telling his aid to prepare for the next round of trade tariffs. This is the prime reason that we have seen the stocks tumbled over in Asia and the same momentum is highly likely to continue over in the Europe. Also coming up today The International Monetary Fund is releasing its latest assessment of the UK economy. IMF chief Christine Lagarde will speak in London this morning. New inflation figures are expected to confirm that prices in the eurozone rose by 2% in August. Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy minister is to present details of a new austerity budget to parliament. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an attempt to shore up its IMF rescue package, and resist another plunge in the value of the peso.

The latest moves represent a new step towards a full-scale trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two biggest economies. Further escalation is deemed likely because Trump is facing low approval ratings ahead of the US midterm elections while China will not want to be seen to back down. Trump announced his latest escalation of the bitter trade standoff between the two countries late on Monday, promising to introduce the additional border taxes of 10% on Chinese goods from next week. The tariffs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c designed to make US domestic products more competitive against foreign imports \u00e2\u20ac\u201c apply to almost 6,000 items, including consumer goods such as luggage and electronics, housewares and foods. The US president threatened further tariffs on an additional $276bn of goods if Beijing unveils retaliatory measures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a step that would mean tariffs on all Chinese imports to the US and equate to 4% of world trade. The trade war was already unpopular with some US citizens, even before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s escalation. CNBC explains: A quarter of registered voters nationally think raising tariffs will do more to protect American jobs and help the U.S. economy, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll in July. Meanwhile, about half of registered voters said duties will do more to raise the costs of goods or hurt the economy. Sixteen percent responded that levies will not have much of an effect. More here. President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack on China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged electoral interference may be an attempt to rally public support for the plan. My colleague Simon Tisdall fears that the trade war could spark a deeper dispute between the US and China. He points out that president Xi is under growing pressure to respond to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions, and fault lines are building... Stepped-up efforts by Chinese air and naval forces to intercept or prevent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153freedom of navigation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd patrols by American (and British) warships in the South China Sea could be another unintended consequence of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war. Until now, the two issues have been kept separate. But what if a frustrated Xi, who has been attacked at home for being both too hardline and too soft over tariffs, decided to conflate them? Likewise, the Trump administration last week criticised China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s repression of the Muslim Uighur minority in Xinjiang. That unexpected intervention, though backed by the UN and human rights organisations, was seen in Beijing as another gratuitously provocative (and ill-timed) assault on its sovereignty and national interests. Growing US-China strategic rivalry is a fact of 21st century life. Yet at present, Trump is relying on Chinese restraint in a wide range of problem areas as he focuses obsessively on his trade vendetta. It cannot be assumed Xi will be content indefinitely to play the role of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adult in the room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. His patience could snap. Few people predict a new cold war, just yet. But the warning signs are there for all to see. Reuters has analysed China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs on US goods, and found that they are less severe than Beijing proposed last month. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: China will levy tariffs on a total of 5,207 U.S. products, at 5% and 10%, instead of the previously proposed rates of 5%, 10%, 20% and 25%, even as the products remain unchanged from the previous plan, the finance ministry said. China will impose a 10% tariff on U.S. products it previously designated for a rate of 20% and 25%, and 5% tariffs on goods previously under the 5% and 10% rates. Items previously designated to be hit by 20% or 25% tariffs included products ranging from liquefied natural gas and mineral ores to coffee and various types of edible oil. Those goods will now be taxed 10%. Goods previously marked under the 10% category included products such as frozen vegetables, cocoa powder and chemical products. Those products will now be taxed 5%. That all adds up to less of an impact on US exporters, and also less pain for Chinese customers (because tariffs are paid by domestic consumers). The boss of Apple, Tim Cook, says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s optimistic that the US and China will reach a ceasefire in the trade war. Reuters has the details: Apple Inc chief executive Tim Cook, whose products have been spared from new U.S. tariffs imposed on Chinese goods, said on Tuesday he was optimistic that the United States and China will eventually work through their trade differences. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m optimistic because trade is one of those things where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a zero-sum game,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cook told ABC News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Good Morning America\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd program on Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can trade something and we can both win. So I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m optimistic that the two countries will sort this out and life will go on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fawad Razaqzada of Forex.com says global investors are relieved that China hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t unleashed a more severe reaction against Donald Trump today. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest move is measured and not over-aggressive as it now plans to impose 10% tariffs on US goods that it had previously listed for a 20-25% tariff rate. Likewise, the items that were listed for 10% will now only face a 5% tariff. So it looks like China has blinked first, and this puts the US government in a great position to agree on a new trade deal. Over in New York, investors are shrugging off these latest blows in the trade war. Wall Street has opened higher, sending the Dow Jones industrial average up 85 points or 0.33%. China adds that it will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153respond accordingly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in future, if the US insists in raising tariff rates. So it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree that it is out of bullets, as commerce secretary Wilbur Ross claims. The Chinese government says it hopes America stops creating \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trade frictions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and instead maintains a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mutually beneficial trade relationship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Boom! China has announced retaliatory action against America, as the trade war intensifies further. Beijing says it will impose tariffs of up to 10% on $60bn of US imports, starting on 24 September. These new levies will cover around 5,000 American products, including aircraft, soya bean oil, smoked beef, coffee and flour (according to a provisional list released last month) In a statement, the Chinese government says this is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forced response\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs on $200bn of its goods overnight. More to follow! Boom: Donald Trump has promised to impose further economic retaliations against China, if it tries to hurt his patriotic supporters. The US president has tweeted that China is trying to interfere in US elections (it makes a change from Russia....), and pledged to retaliate: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clip from Wilber Ross\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interview, arguing that American families won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really notice the impact of 10% tariffs on $200bn of good from China. By my reckoning, it works out as an extra $160 for every family in the US ($20bn of levies / 126m US households). Of course, some retailers might swallow the tariff themselves, or simply refuse to pay it and buy goods from elsewhere instead. Wilbur Ross also claims that the trade war has strengthened the bonds between the US, the European Union and Japan: The US and the EU didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look particularly close this summer, when president Trump imposed tariffs on steel imports, and Europe retaliated with levies on orange juice, motorbikes and cranberries from America..... Is Wilbur Ross correct to claim that China is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of bullets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to fight a trade war? By one measure, yes. The US only exported $130bn to China last year. Beijing already imposes tariffs on $50bn worth, so it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t match America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $200bn move. But such a narrow view ignores the full interconnected nature of the global economy. China can use other tools if it really wants to make things hot for America. For example it could: Launch a currency war by letting the yuan tumble against the US dollar. That would counter the impact of higher tariffs. Limit US firms from accessing China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market. That would hurt manufacturers who hope to profit from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic revolution, and the sharp increase in middle-class consumers Stop buying US government debt, or even dump its huge stock of Treasury bills onto the market. That would force up America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of borrowing, and potentially rock the markets (currently, China recycles some of the dollars it receives from trade back into US bonds, helping America to service its huge national debt). President Xi might have other ideas to thwart America in the international sphere, of course (last week he was making a big show of friendship with Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Putin). US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is up early, appearing on CNBC to discuss the new tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports announced by Donald Trump last night. Ross declared it is up to Beijing to decide whether to address America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns over free trade and intellectual property rights. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our purpose is to have constructive negotiations with the Chinese to resolve the fundamental issues. So the question about whether or when to have a discussion is very importantly in their ballpark.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ross also argued that the tariffs (on everything from frozen turbot to bicycle speedometers) had been carefully chosen to create the smallest disruption to consumers. Ross also dipped into the firearms metaphor bucket, denying that America was shooting from the him and claiming that Beijing was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of bullets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (because it imports so little, relatively, from America). Larry Hatheway, chief economist at asset manager GAM, believes investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taking the trade war seriously enough. Having seen markets rise in Asia and Europe today, Hatheway warns that the situation could deteriorate sharply, hurting the global economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Without question, tariffs are economically counterproductive and create inefficiencies in supply chains, location of production and add costs to firms and consumers. Criticism of the new tariffs from key US business and consumer groups was immediate. Investors may also be hoping that the US mid-term election outcome might temper the Trump Administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s willingness to escalate trade tensions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But risks remain. One is the unclear rhetoric from the US Trump Administration, which has put forward a variety of explanations for tariffs (elimination of bilateral trade deficits, measures to counter intellectual property right infringement, objections to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment in new technologies, etc). That makes it difficult to know what the basis for an agreement to diffuse the situation might look like. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In light of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market reaction, investors risk being overly complacent about the eventual outcome, which could still escalate with potentially very adverse spill over effects on broader economic activity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m, has criticised Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs, telling reporters (in Brussels, I think) that they are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very unfortunate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She also disputed Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim earlier this year that trade wars are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood and easy to win\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re running a big trade deficit) The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jim Brunsden has the details: This escalation is very unfortunate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Cecilia Malmstrom, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade commissioner, told reporters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trade wars are not good and they are not easy to win\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We agree with some of the criticism the US has advanced vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis China\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Ms Malmstrom said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we disagree with the methods the US is using\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Companies are starting to scramble to protect themselves from trade war damage, says Chris Towner, director at JCRA, a financial risk management consultancy. He reports: We are certainly seeing an increase in firms looking to review their foreign exchange exposures and put together hedging strategies to help them cope with the volatility. In reaction to the trade disputes and follow-up actions, we have seen the Chinese yuan weaken by almost 10% against the US dollar, since the outset of this year. This will act as a buffer for Chinese exporters dealing in the international markets. In other words, a weaker yuan makes Chinese imports more competitive in US markets. Not what Donald Trump is aiming for.... Asian stock markets ended the day on a strong note, despite the latest trade war escalation. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market gained almost 2%, Japan rose by 1.8%, and Hong Kong shrugged off its earlier losses to close 0.5% higher. Shares have also risen in Europe with morning, with the FTSE 100 gaining 0.2% and Germany up 0.3%. Arnaud Masset of Swissquote bank says traders have shrugged off trade tensions: The renewed appetite for risky assets suggests that investors are getting tired of this situation and are paying less and less attention to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweets and public comments. Analyst at ABN Amro suggest that a 10% tariff might not chuck too much sand in the wheels of global trade: Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war has already impacted on 2.5% of world trade, says Timme Spakman, economist at Dutch bank ING. And it could get worse, if the White House follows through on its threats to impose even more tariffs on China. Spakman predicts that the trade war will intensify, writing: As President Trump pulled the trigger on 10% additional tariffs on imports from China last night, the percentage of world trade affected by it all just went up to 2.5%. If the US acts on further tariff threats, this could go up to 4% The new measures will cover USD 200bn worth of US imports from China, including jet engines, electronics, and fish. These tariffs, which were announced in June, are a reaction to the tariffs imposed by China in August, which in themselves were retaliatory measures. Given that, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ministry of commerce has already pledged it will \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcguard its interests\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and has announced retaliatory tariffs earlier in the year, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a deal anytime soon and instead expect further elevation in 2019. We expect the US to impose further tariffs on the remaining imports from China (worth $267bn) and China to retaliate further. Newsflash: Jack Ma, the founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, has warned that the US-China trade war could rumble on for decades. Speaking at a conference for Alibaba investors in Shanghai, Ma warned that the dispute would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a mess\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for all parties, and could last for 20 years. The full list of Chinese products that will hit with an extra 10% tariff next week (rising to 25% eventually) is online here. Nearly 200 pages long, the list covers almost 6,000 individual items. Some are quite dull, such as coal, printing ink, pneumatic tires and spark plugs. Others are more exotic, from live eels and frogs legs to rail locomotives and chandeliers. But some products have been removed, following public consultation, including devices that receive and transmit voice data. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for Apple, as CNBC explains: Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s smart watch, wireless headphones, and smart speaker will not be affected by the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest tariffs on Chinese imports, according to a list of affected products listed on Monday. Some Apple products, including its MacMini, will still be affected. Reuters points out that some consumer safety products made in China, such as bicycle helmets sold by Vista Outdoor and baby car seats and playpens from Graco Inc also were taken off the list. Importantly, rare earth minerals have also been dropped from the provisional list. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re used in a wide range of consumer electronics products, so an extra tariff could have hurt US manufacturers. More here. Bloomberg has estimated that the trade war will knock around half a percentage point off China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate this year. The impact could rise to almost one percentage point, though, once these latest tariffs rise from 10% to 25% in 2019. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is growing at around 6.5% per year, so it could absorb such a hit. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management has a good take on the US tariffs: US President Trump announced a staggered increase in US consumer taxes. A 10% tax on goods partially made in China now, a 25% tax after the year-end orgy of consumer spending. It will take some months for the tax to work down supply chains. The burden of this tax will likely hit lower income US consumers. Trump threatened to tax all imports partially made in China if China retaliates. China will probably retaliate. The nuclear option of China selling US Treasuries is not likely at this stage. However, China might fail to appear at a US bond auction or two, to remind the US that the balance of payments is a two-way flow. The tax will slow US growth. Raising taxes normally does slow growth. How soon growth is hit will depend on inventory levels, and the speed with which the tax is passed down supply chains. There may be a fear about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153who is next?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Once additional tariffs against China are imposed, there is nothing else about China to tweet. Something else will have to fill the Trump Twitter Feed. Reminder: China can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply retaliate by slapping a 10% tariff on $200bn of US goods, because it only buys around $130bn of stuff from America each year. And it already has new tariffs on \u00c2\u00a350bn-worth of those imports, meaning Beijing only has $80bn of firepower left. Beijing isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t out of options, though. It could impose a higher tariff on US goods. Or it could announce curbs on US companies operating in China. But either step risks provoking another response from the White House. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flurry of activity in Beijing right now. The foreign ministry is giving a briefing on trade, and accusing the US of not being sincere. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang is telling reporters that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunilateral\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 trade actions can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be accepted. The only solution is to hold talks on an equal footing, Geng says. Geng also confirms that China will respond, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t outline what these countermeasures might be. Newsflash: China has announced it will retaliate against America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs....without saying how. The Chinese commerce ministry says it has no choice but to respond to the new 10% tariff on thousands of goods entering the US. And more in sorrow than in anger, the ministry adds that it hopes the US realises the negative consequences of its actions, and corrects its behaviour. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), which represents major tech firms, was quick to criticise these new tariffs. ITI president Dean Garfield said Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reckless\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd , and would hurt US communities: China must change, but this is not the way to achieve the needed market access in China. More tariffs not only punish American consumers, manufacturers, and businesses of all sizes, they will also diminish the opportunity to negotiate with the Chinese and address longstanding trade issues. If implemented, these tariffs will have both short- and long-term effects on the United States \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from increased prices at the checkout counter to decreased leadership on the emerging technologies that will shape our future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The US Retail Industry Leaders Association also gave the tariffs the thumbs down. It warned they would dive up the cost of more than $1bn worth of gas grills from China, $843m worth of luggage and travel bags, $825m worth of mattresses, and $1.9bn of vacuum cleaners. Elsa Lignos of RBC Capital Markets believes Americans will soon feel the impact of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs in the shops: Market reaction was muted as the tariffs had been widely telegraphed (and some cling to hope that the delay of 25% tariffs until January will mean more time for negotiation and reconciliation post midterms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an idea we think is unlikely). We have now reached a level of affected imports where it will necessarily start to impact consumer prices. The oil price, which is often a good barometer for growth prospects, has dipped since the US tariffs were announced. Brent crude has fallen to $77.78 per barrel, down 0.35% today. Wang Xiao, head of crude research at Guotai Junan Futures, blamed the US-China trade war: The growing trade dispute has hurt trading sentiment. The impact on economic growth is slowly dripping in, which again hurts oil prices,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Somewhat surprisingly, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has actually risen since Donald Trump escalated the trade war. The benchmark Shanghai composite index has jumped by 1.7% today, having slumped to a four-year low on Monday. There is speculation that Beijing could boost its stimulus programme to support the economy through the trade war, which could boost corporate profits. Traders are also relieved that these new tariffs will start at 10%, not at the 25% level floated by Trump recently. And frankly, they may simply be pleased that the uncertainty is over; these tariffs were first floated in July..... A senior Chinese regulator has accused Donald Trump of creating a toxic atmosphere that could undermine efforts to reach a trade pact. Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s securities regulator, also claimed that China wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cave in to these latest tariffs. Speaking at the port city of Tianjin, Fang criticised Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiating strategy, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153President Trump is a hard-hitting businessman, and he tries to put pressure on China so he can get concessions from our negotiations. I think that kind of tactic is not going to work with China.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fang added he hopes the two sides can sit down and talk, but warned that the latest U.S. move has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153poisoned\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the atmosphere, Reuters reports. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The trade war between America and China has escalated, fuelling fears that the global economy could be dragged down. Overnight, president Donald Trump announced a new 10% tariff of $200bn on Chinese goods arriving in the US from next week. It will rise to 25% at the end of the year. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest move in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s push against \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unfair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trade policies, which economists fear will prove counterproductive. Trump hit out at China last night as he announced the move, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For months, we have urged China to change these unfair practices, and give fair and reciprocal treatment to American companies. We have been very clear about the type of changes that need to be made, and we have given China every opportunity to treat us more fairly. But, so far, China has been unwilling to change its practices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And in a typical Trumpian flourish, he added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I urge China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaders to take swift action to end their country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unfair trade practices. Hopefully, this trade situation will be resolved, in the end, by myself and President Xi of China, for whom I have great respect and affection.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thousands of Chinese products will now be more expensive in America, from fish, meat and vegetables to chemicals, furniture, metals and electric goods. This will cut demand for these products (hurting the Chinese economy), and also probably drive up prices in US shops (hurting Americans). The move will disappoint the City, where traders had been clinging to hopes of a peace deal. Instead, we are now awaiting China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move means that America will now have tariffs on roughly half of its imports from China (which totalled over $500bn last year). China only imports around $130bn from America, meaning it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply announce a tit-for-tat retaliation. According to Bloomberg, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will hold a meeting in Beijing on Tuesday morning to discuss the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response. China could decide to pull out of planned trade talks in Washington next week, if it feels Trump isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t showing sufficient goodwill.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap: British workers are facing a renewed wage squeeze after inflation jumped unexpectedly to a six-month high. The Consumer Prices Index rose by 2.7% year-on-year in August, up from 2.5% in July. The City had expected a drop to 2.4%. Higher clothing prices, transport bills and recreation costs all combined to push the cost of living up at a faster pace. It means inflation is now rising faster than total pay again, meaning the spectre of a cost of living squeeze still looms over the UK economy. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady has called on ministers to do more, including boosting pay for the poorest: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The pay squeeze is tightening again, but the government is doing nothing to get wages rising faster. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The minimum wage should be put up to \u00c2\u00a310 an hour as quickly as possible. And we need a National Investment Bank to target communities that are most in need of new industry and better jobs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unions are fighting hard to get workers better pay, but we need new rights to enter workplaces and negotiate with employers for fair pay rises.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Economists called the news a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbody-blow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for families, warning that inflation could continue to spike if Brexit uncertainty weakens the pound. Thomas Wells, manager of the Smith &amp; Williamson Global Inflation-Linked Bond Fund, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was a nasty inflation shock and, as we have said before, shows that a gentle glide back to the 2% target cannot be taken for granted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking at the components of RPI (up 3.5%), which is the underlying index for linkers, it appears that housing, leisure and travel costs have driven the stronger than expected inflation print. Indeed, the motorist continues to be clobbered by high petrol prices, which are up nearly 12% year-on-year. We would not read too much into the uptick in clothing and footwear, as this is a volatile component, and the trend here is not far from the four-month average. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The medium-term outlook for inflation remains unclear due to Brexit risks and potential supply disruptions. Moreover, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshrinkflation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has been very much in evidence in Europe, for example, the size of fries in Belgium has contracted due to the very poor potato crop owing to the very dry weather over the summer. The UK will not be immune from similar pressures. In other news: China has appealed for free trade and multilateralism to be protected, after Donald Trump triggered another round of tariffs between the two economic powerhouses. Premier Xi also promised that China would not launch a currency war by weakening the yuan, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One-way devaluation will do more harm than good to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. China will by no means stimulate exports by devaluing the yuan.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stock markets are mostly higher, on optimism that the trade dispute can be resolved. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei hit an eight-month high, while Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index is up 42 points at 0.6%. The CEO of Danske Bank has resigned over a huge money-laundering scandal. UK supermarket chain Tesco has launched its new discount chain, Jack\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, in an attempt to push back against budget groups Aldi and Lidl. Exactly ten years ago, Wall Street was suffering a dramatic plunge. Major bank share were slumping through the floor as the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse ripped through the markets. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a gentler picture today. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 107 points in early trading, or 0.4%, to 26,354. Investors in New York are taking yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tit-for-tat tariffs between the US and China in their stride, hoping that negotiations might deliver a breakthrough. But if you want to relive events a decade ago, here you are.... Far be it from me to point the finger when it comes to spelling mistakes, but this is quite impressive: In other news, the CEO of Denmark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Danske Bank quit today over a massive money-laundering scandal. Thomas Borgen quit as Danske reported that some \u00e2\u201a\u00ac200bn in questionable money flowed through its Estonian branch, a jaw-dropping amount. Danske\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small but highly profitable Estonian operation had 15,000 non-resident clients, including people based in the UK, Russia and the British Virgin Islands. Analysis of 6,200 of the riskiest customers showed that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vast majority have been found to be suspicious\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Borgen said he was stepping down because Danske had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153failed to live up to its responsibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Anti-corruption campaigner Bill Browder, a critic of the Russian government, says managers, regulators and the police all dropped the ball: NIESR, the economic think tank, report that inflationary pressures were strongest in London last month, and weakest in Yorkshire. It says: At the regional level, underlying inflation was highest in London at 1.4 per cent and lowest in Yorkshire and the Humber at 0.5 per cent in the year to August 2018 Ouch! The pound has just shed all its earlier gains and slumped into the red. Sterling has dropped back to $1.312, from the eight-week high of $1.32 after this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation shock. Why? Because Brexit negotiations have apparently hit another roadblock. According to The Times, the UK has decided to reject Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest offer to fix the Irish Border puzzle. The Times says: Theresa May will today reject Michel Barnier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153improved\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd offer to solve the Irish border issue, warning that it still violates Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s red lines. The EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief negotiator said yesterday that the EU was preparing to table a new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153backstop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd proposal that he hoped the government would be able to support. He said the new plan would not involve customs checks in the Irish Sea and would respect the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153territorial integrity of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But a senior government source said that Mr Barnier had still not dropped his insistence that Northern Ireland be treated as a separate customs jurisdiction from the rest of the United Kingdom..... Theresa May will meet with EU leaders in Salzburg later today for an informal summit, so we could hear more on Brexit soon. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also ruled out another referendum (again)... Back on UK inflation...and Capital Economics reckon the cost of living squeeze might ease by next summer: That all depends on how Brexit plays out, I suggest, as a disorderly end to negotiations would surely weaken the pound and drive up import costs. In other retail news, shares in DIY chain Kingfisher have slumped by 4% to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard after posting its latest financial results. Kingfisher, which runs B&amp;Q, reported an 18% slump in adjusted pre-tax profits in the six months to 31 July. CEO V\u00c3\u00a9ronique Laury, Chief Executive Officer, blamed difficulties in France for holding back her transformation plan: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Transformation on this scale is tough, and there are challenges that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working through. There is still much to do to improve our performance in France and to remove inefficiencies within the business as we continue to transform at pace. I am confident that we have the right plan and the opportunity for Kingfisher is significant. Kingfisher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s French profits plunged by almost 30%, taking the shine off a 1.3% rise in UK profits. Callum Stayton, retail sector specialist at management consultancy Vendigital, reckons Tesco could make a success of its new discount arm: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The timing is right for Jack\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as market share at the discount end of the market is still growing at a rate of 10 percent per year, so there is still a lot to play for. Set up costs will also be quite low as Tesco plans to scoop up sites that have been vacant for a long time or redevelop some of its less-successful Metro stores. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Following its takeover of Booker, Tesco has first-hand experience of sourcing and supplying large volumes of goods and this will stand it in good stead when rolling out Jack\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, which is expected to stock higher volumes of fewer goods than its mainstream stores.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With inflation rearing up, more UK consumers might be interested in Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new discount supermarket chain. Tesco has been unveiling \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jack\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to a group of journalists in Chatteris this morning. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aimed firmly at German discounters Aldi and Lidl, with fewer items than a traditional Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and a firm focus on British products. My colleague Sarah Butler explains: The first store has been unveiled by the Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis, in the small Cambridgeshire town of Chatteris. The public will get their first chance to shop at Jack\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on Thursday morning when the store opens, along with a second outlet in Immingham, Lincolnshire. The new chain is named after Jack Cohen, who founded Tesco 99 years ago, earning the nickname \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Slasher Jack\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pile-it-high, sell-it-cheap\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd approach to retailing. Lewis said the group planned to open 10 to 15 Jack\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stores over the next six months, about half of which will be converted Tesco outlets while others will be next to existing Tesco stores and some on new sites. Some price are certainly cheap; bread, for example, is on the shelf at 45p per loaf. Chicken is on offer at \u00c2\u00a31.60 / kg (corrected), compared to \u00c2\u00a32.75 / kg for a Waitrose Essential bird. Other prices look less sensational, as Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beancounters try to pitch their new offering correctly: Jack\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also makes it easier to hand over your hard-earned cash, with a mobile app as an alternative to its traditional checkouts and self-service tills. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full story: Three factors drove UK inflation higher last month. In Transport, the cost of travelling by air or sea rose in August. Petrol prices rose by 1.4p per litre, while diesel rose by 1.2p per litre. Clothing and footwear also become more expensive, with prices rising by 3.1% between July and August. Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothing rose particularly sharply, the ONS says. Recreation and culture costs rose by 0.6% between July and August. The ONS blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pricier theatre tickets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to believe this had a huge impact on the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wallets) and another rise in computer game prices. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), also fears that a no-deal Brexit could shove inflation higher. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation surprisingly rose for the second successive month in August, largely wiping out the recent recovery in real wage growth and emphasising the continued squeeze on consumers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The strong growth in producer prices indicates that inflationary pressures further down the supply chain remain significant and could lift inflation higher in the coming months. However, the upward pressure on prices remains transitory, and inflation should resume its ease back towards target once the impact of the recent increase in oil prices drops out of the calculation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The possibility of a disorderly Brexit is the key risk to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outlook for inflation as it could result in a substantial decline in sterling, which could significantly increase inflation and exacerbate the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses. More bad news for households: inflation could keep rising in the months ahead, especially if Brexit talks flounder (weakening the pound). If so, that could mean inflation keeps rising faster than total pay. Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures are a body blow to UK households after the latest CPI figures showed that price rises jumped 2.7% in August, driven largely by increased costs for recreational and cultural goods and services, transport services and clothing. The latest figures mean that wage growth including bonuses (2.6%) has once again fallen behind inflation and means that we are all getting progressively poorer again. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To rub salt in the wounds there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a distinct possibility that inflation could continue to climb as the oil price has recently crept up to over $80 a barrel, meaning we are likely to see prices at the petrol pumps start ticking up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And on top of this there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the ongoing uncertainty around the Brexit negotiations which could put an end to sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent good run. If recent sterling strength is reversed then the cost of imported goods will start going up again and UK businesses reliant on these goods will need to start hiking prices in order to protect their margins. City economist Simon French of Panmure Gordon says the slump in the pound in August (it hit a 14-month low) drove inflation up: Economist Ulrik Bie says rising inflation is pushing more UK people into debt, because wages aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rising fast enough. The jump in UK inflation to 2.7% is bad news for households. Average basic pay is only rising by 2.9% per year at present, meaning pay rises are only just keeping ahead of the cost of living. Total pay, including bonuses, is rising by 2.6% - meaning no real wage growth at all. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s particularly disappointing as unemployment is at a 43-year low, which ought to give workers the upper hand in wage negotiations. The Office for National Statistics, Head of Inflation Mike Hardie, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumers paid more for theatre shows, sea fares and new season autumn clothing last month. However, mobile phone charges, and furniture and household goods had a downward effect on inflation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK house prices continued to grow but at their lowest annual rate for five years, driven again by a fall in London. The housing market saw strong growth in the North West, South West and West Midlands.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Although prices are rising faster in the shops, UK house price inflation has fallen. Average house prices in the UK rose by 3.1% in the year to July 2018, the Office for National Statistics reports, down from 3.2% in June. This is the lowest UK annual rate since August 2013 when it was 3.0%. And in London, prices have now shrank by 0.7% over the last year. At 2.7%, UK inflation is now at its highest level in six months. Rising transport, clothing and recreational goods prices drove the cost of living higher in August, the Office for National Statistics reports. Food and alcohol prices also drove inflation up: Sterling has jumped to an eight-week high against the US dollar. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading over $1.32 for the first time since late-July. Traders are calculating that higher inflation makes an early interest rate rise more likely. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has jumped to 2.7% in August, putting a squeeze on households again. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 2.5% in July, and dashes expectations that the consumer prices index would drop to 2.4%. More to follow.... Over in Tallinn, Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane is giving a speech to mark the 100th Anniversary of the Bank of Estonia. Rather than bringing a telegram from the Queen, Haldane has turned up with a speech on central bank communication through the ages (\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoooh, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just what I always wanted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122). In it, he points out that central bankers were notoriously secretive once: It was only a generation ago that, when asked by Mervyn King for a one-word piece of advice, Paul Volcker replied \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mystique\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. To that point, opacity rather than transparency coursed through central bankers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 veins. That bloodline ran from Montagu Norman a century ago (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153never explain, never apologise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) through to Alan Greenspan a generation ago (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned to mumble with great incoherence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). Today, though, we have forward guidance on interest rates and regular press conferences to help get the message out. Education is another key part of the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy, Haldane says. Through its econoME project, it provides classroom materials on the economy and financial system for use in schools. Secondary schools at present, but Haldane has ambitious plans to spread the word: As the name suggests, and like our recent public communications efforts, these materials describe the economy and finance in terms which are personal and relatable to young people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lives. Why does the economy and finance matter to me? And how do my decisions in turn affect the economy? We set ourselves a target of reaching 400 state schools with econoME during the course of this year. So far since launch in April, over 1,000 schools have downloaded the materials, conceivably covering around 90,000 pupils. 52 This demonstrates the potential pent-up demand for school materials on economic and financial issues. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aim is to reach close to 1,500 schools by mid-2020. We are currently considering where next to take our education initiatives. A promising avenue would be a younger age range, say 7-11 year olds. This will require different materials and possibly a different approach. A more challenging market still would be adults, perhaps linked to existing initiatives to boost economic and financial literacy in the public at large. China is often accused of discriminating against foreign companies on its turf, in favour of local (sometime state-controlled) firms instead. Chinese premier Li Keqiang, though, is promising to give foreign investors equal treatment. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lucy Hornby has the details: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chinese and foreign companies can compete on a level playing field in this big market. That gives better vitality to the Chinese economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mr Li said at the World Economic Forum, triggering prolonged applause from an audience that included high-tech manufacturers from overseas and small businesses from provincial cities. China, he said, would cut taxes and unlock financing for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private businesses. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The pool is full of water, the challenge is to unblock the channels,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, adding that Beijing would not devalue the renminbi but keep its currency \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at an adaptive and equilibrium level\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. European stock markets have hit a two-week high in early trading. In London, the FTSE 100 is 17 points higher at 7317 (+0.25%). Mining stocks are leading the way, as traders express optimism that China and the US might cool their trade dispute. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Though China announcing tariffs on $60 billion in US imports isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great news, it is not as bad as it could have been. The response was also tempered by the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy leader Li Keqiang urging that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbasic principles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of free trade are held up, while promising that China won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t weaponise its currency (something it has already been accused of doing by Trump). Premier Li\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for a multilateral solution to the trade dispute is going down well in the markets. In Tokyo, the Nikkei index has hit its highest level in eight months. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite jumped by 1%, amid relief that Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest tariffs on the US are lower than feared. Investors are heartened by Li\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge not to launch a currency war, as Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: The Chinese yuan has been under the hammer due to two reasons; sluggish domestic growth and impending trade war. China has been blamed by the U.S. for devaluing its currency to gain a competitive edge. Over in Asia, we have seen that traders have felt more comfortable about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent comments on currency devaluation and this has bolstered the Asian equity market. Importantly, premier Li has also pledged that China won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t weaponise its currency in its tussle with Donald Trump. In his keynote speech in Tianjin, Li promise that Beijing hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been deliberately weakening the yuan - and wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do so, either. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recent fluctuations in the renminbi exchange rate have been seen as an intentional measure, but that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t true,. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One-way devaluation will do more harm than good to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. China will by no means stimulate exports by devaluing the yuan.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The threat of a global trade war looms over the financial world today, after the US and China hit each other with sweeping tariffs. Beijing hit back at Washington yesterday, with new levies on $60bn of US goods, just hours after Donald Trump signed off tariffs on $200bn of Chinese products. This latest tit-for-tat action dragged the world economy a little closer to full-blown protectionism. But...there is also optimism, as China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation is less severe than it had laid out last month. And over in Beijing today, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy leader has called for more support for free trade. Premier Li Keqiang told a World Economic Forum conference, in the eastern city of Tianjin, that such disputes must be resolved through consultation. It is essential that we uphold the basic principles of multilateralism and free trade.... No unilateralism will offer a viable solution.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Li also warned that the world economy now stands at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a crossroads facing a choice between globalization or deglobalization.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd China, he pledged, will do its bit by opening up \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at a faster pace\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That will have gone down well with WEF at its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Summer Davos\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Tianjin. More cynical voices might point out that China does operate plenty of roadblocks to free trade today - second behind Russia, according to one EU report this year. But still, Li\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words may reassure investors that the two economic powers will reach an agreement on trade policies, rather than descend deeper into a swamp of tariffs, trade barriers and bad-mouthing. Also coming up today UK inflation data is out this morning. Economists predict that price rose by 2.4% year-on-year in August, down from July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.5%. That would give workers a small but much-needed real wage boost. Supermarket chain Tesco is launching its new discount store format, Jack\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, to compete with the success of Lidl and Aldi. It could be a game-changer, if Tesco can get it right...

                "bodyText":"And finally, European stock markets have also racked up gains today, as trade war fears faded. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index gained 36 points to close at 7367, up 0.5%. There were bigger gains in France and Germany, as traders watched Wall Street soar to record levels. Over in New York, the Dow continues to rally. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently up 257 points or 1% at 26,662, on track for a record close. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: With investors choosing to view the current state of play between the US and China as a smidge better than initially feared, the Dow Jones led a substantial charge higher on Thursday. Despite the recent tit-for-tat tariff attacks between Beijing and Washington, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accusations that China is trying to undermine US democracy, AND the rather high likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise rates next Wednesday, the Dow Jones managed to hit an all-time peak after the bell rang on Wall Street. The oil price continues to slide, following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for Opec to take action this weekend. Brent crude is down almost 1% at $78.75 per barrel, while US crude has dipped by 0.3% to $70.92. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record highs on Wall Street suggest investors are less worried about a US-China trade war. Chemicals company DowDuPont is leading the way, up 2.2%, followed by chipmaker Intel (+2%), software giant Microsoft (+1.7%) and construction machinery maker Caterpillar (+1.5%). David Madden of CMC Markets says traders are relieved that the US and China didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take more punitive measures this week: The rally has returned as the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 have set fresh record highs. The latest round of tariffs that were announced during the week weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as severe has some traders were anticipating, and the market has breathed a sigh of relief. The fear of new tariffs proved to be worse than the tariffs themselves, and even though the US and China now have a worse trading relationship, dealers are still optimistic as there is no sign of additional tariffs in sight. Brexit continues to loom over the City, after European council president Donald Tusk warned that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chequers deal won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. The lack of a breakthrough at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 summit in Salzburg may increase the risk that Britain leaves the EU without a deal. How bad would that be? Oxford Economics warn it would create a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant slowdown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with the pound tumbling and trade hit by new barriers. They reckon 2% would be knocked off the UK economy by 2020: Deutsche Bank are even more gloomy. They believe the UK would be tipped into a two-year recession, wiping 4% off GDP, as household consumption and business spending both shrink. President Trump has moved on from rebuking Opec, to welcome today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market rally: Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dislike of higher oil prices is well known -- he fears they will hurt US consumers by driving up the cost of gasoline. But Charles Bond, natural resources partner at law firm Gowling WLG, suggests the president should see the bigger picture, rather than fire tweets at Opec. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s motive here is clearly to bring the price of oil down but that may have a wider effect in transactional terms. The recent return to higher oil prices has meant that companies in the sector globally can start to benefit from capital investment again and the benefits that come with it, such as business expansion and increased economic activity. Any artificial attempt to stem this would need to be balanced very carefully given the likely consequences for the wider industry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest take on the Danske Bank money-laundering scandal: Donald Trump has also channeled his inner Norman Tebbit today, by telling Americans to take advantage of the strong labor market and look for a better job. The S&amp;P 500, which covers a wider range of companies than the Dow, has also hit a record high in early trading. Boom! America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones industrial average has hit a new all-time high. Shares have jumped at the start of trading in New York, sending the Dow up by over 230 points to 26,643 points. That takes the index over its previous record, set in January this year (just as Donald Trump was speaking at Davos). Technology stocks are driving the index higher. There is also optimism that the US-China trade war could be resolved -- earlier today, Beijing argued that talks, not tariffs, were the solution. Shares are also benefitting from the recent weakness of the US dollar, which has dropped to its lowest level since July today. Dean Popplewell, vice president of Market Analysis at OANDA, points out that oil stockpiles have been falling recently, helping to underpin prices. EIA data Wednesday showed that U.S crude oil stockpiles fell for a fifth consecutive week to a three-year low in the week to Sept. 14, while gas stocks also showed a larger than expected draw on unseasonably strong demand. Crude inventories fell by -2.1m barrels, compared with expectations for a decrease of -2.7m. OPEC and other producers, including Russia, meet on Sunday in Algeria to discuss how to allocate supply increases to offset the loss of Iranian barrels. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that Opec is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmonopoly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really stand up to scrutiny. The countries which make up Opec produce around 40% of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crude oil, and around 60% of the total petroleum traded internationally. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big enough to influence the market, but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t control the whole thing. The president would have been on stronger ground if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d called Opec a cartel -- there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no argument that it agrees production levels in an attempt to influence the oil price. But... the more Opec pushes the oil price up, the more profitable America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shale oil industry becomes.... What a difference a tweet makes. Brent crude has fallen by one dollar per barrel since Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweet, from almost $79.75 per barrel to below $79. Some traders may have concluded that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention raises the chances that Saudi Arabia pushes for an increase in output at this weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meeting. Donald Trump appears to be trying to prevent the oil price rising over $80 per barrel. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s James Herron explains: Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fresh intervention in the oil market comes before a meeting of ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies in Algeria on Sunday. His complaint follows signals from Saudi Arabia that it was content to see prices climb above $80 a barrel. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a red line for the White House in the past, provoking the president to direct his first social-media barb against the cartel since July 4. Boom! The US president has demanded that the OPEC oil cartel take action to bring the oil price down. Donald Trump has tweeted that Middle Eastern countries aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t showing sufficient gratitude for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s military support, by pushing crude prices to their current levels. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clear nudge to Opec members, such as Saudi Arabia, to agree a production boost when they meet this weekend. Brent crude is currently trading near to $80 per barrel, close to its highest level since November 2014. Oil prices have been climbing sharply since Opec agreed a historic deal to curb production in late 2016. That output freeze has helped to remove over-capacity from the market, meaning producers benefit from higher prices. Opec members will meet with non-Opec countries, such as Russia, over the weekend to examine their production quotas. Oil analysts believe they are unlikely to lift production limits, despite pressure from America. Iran, for example, has indicated it is happy with oil at $80 per barrel, so would presumably oppose a production increase. Tehran also doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enjoy military protection from the US, of course, so Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat may not carry much weight. Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil production is likely to drop as US sanctions kick in. That creates a new dilemma for Opec, as one source told Reuters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complicated. Saudi Arabia has to balance oil supply and demand, and it has to balance oil prices so they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise too much before the U.S. elections,. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also political because the Saudis don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to pump too much oil then the Iranians complain to OPEC that it (Saudi Arabia) is taking (Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) market share. They also don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want oil prices to fall too much.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Uh oh. Sky News are reporting that high street bicycle chain Evans Cycles is looking for a new buyer, as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153toxic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd retail environment threatens to claim another victim. Clearly the upturn in retail spending last month hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given Evans much of a boost. More here. Ryanair investors are calling on the budget airline to heed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revolt at its AGM. Campaign group ShareAction says the fact that nearly one in three shareholders fail to back chairman David Bonderman is proof that change is needed, following a year marked by pilot strikes. Mara Lilley, senior campaigns officer at ShareAction, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It might not sound like it, but 30% of Ryanair shareholders wanting to oust Bonderman \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up from 11% last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is a clear signal that business cannot and must not continue as usual. His cosy relationship with O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary has allowed the chief executive to get away with tantrums in the face of serious workforce issues and poor industrial relations which will end up hitting profits. We predict next year Bonderman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-haul tenure will finally come to a well-deserved end.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Alison Kennedy of Aberdeen Standard Investments made a similar point at the AGM. Although ASI backed Bonderman, and independent director Kyran McLaughlin today, their patience is running thin. Kennedy warned: Given the challenges the company faces, for example in union and labour relations, it is clear that governance needs to evolve. Strong, independent and visible board leadership is more important than ever. So, we expect that there will be clear progress on succession for these two key board positions by the time of the AGM next year. If not, others things being equal, we will vote against the re-election of Mr Bonderman, Mr McLaughlin and the other members of the Nominations Committee. Drinks giant Diageo, whose tipples include Johnnie Walker, Baileys and Smirnoff, says today that it has been hit by the recent turmoil in emerging market currencies. This is expected to reduce sales by \u00c2\u00a3175m and cut operating profits by \u00c2\u00a345m in the year to 30 June, the company reported today. Money laundering at Denmark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the biggest scandal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Europe and could prompt action from regulators in Brussels, the European commission has said. V\u00c4\u203ara Jourov\u00c3\u00a1, the European commissioner for justice, said she wanted to know if a failure of banking supervision led to lapses that allowed \u00e2\u201a\u00ac200bn (\u00c2\u00a3178bn) of illegally-laundered funds to flow through Danske Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Estonian branch. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Thomas Borgen, resigned on Wednesday, after admitting the bank had failed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to live up to its responsibilities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, allowing dirty money to flow out of Russia, the UK and the British Virgin Islands, through its Estonian branch. The commissioner will meet ministers from Denmark, Estonia and Finland on 2 October to investigate what went wrong. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I want to understand better where the main errors happened, whether it was purely a fault of the due diligence done by the bank itself, or whether there was some mistake of the supervisory authority,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jourov\u00c3\u00a1 told reporters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is the biggest scandal, which we have now in Europe, which is also a very unpleasant lesson, which shows the need to be much more vigilant and much more prudent in checking.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If there had been a mistake in supervision, she said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we will have to act\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The European Banking Authority, an EU agency based in London, tightened controls on Malta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pilatus Bank, after its Iranian owner was charged by US authorities with evading sanctions and money laundering. The commissioner said action by the EBA had led to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153precise results\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on Pilatus bank. But EU authorities want more powers for the agency: last week the commission called for the EBA to be able to order national authorities to tackle suspected money laundering. In a rather unusual move, the long-running battle to take control of UK broadcaster Sky will go to an auction this weekend. The Takeover Panel has decided that Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox, and rival bidder Comcast, should each make new bids in a three-round contest. Each can choose to raise their offers (currently \u00c2\u00a314 and \u00c2\u00a314.75 respectively). This will resolve the uncertainty that has been swirling over Sky since December, when Fox attempted to buy the 61% of Sky which it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already own. With neither side making a final offer, this auction should resolve Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fate. This rise in UK retail spending is a little hard to square with the gloomy picture on UK high streets. Last week, for example, John Lewis reported that its profits had been virtually wiped out in the last six months. House of Fraser fell into administration in August, while Debenhams warned that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153underlying trends deteriorated through the summer months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hardly a rosy picture...but yet the ONS believes consumers are still spending. Given that inflation is rising, and wage growth has been modest, some consumers may be falling into deeper debt to sustain this spending. Josie Dent, Economist at the CEBR think tank, believes a squeeze is coming: While today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headline figure paints a rosy picture for retail, more timely indicators show that the high street is struggling this month. John Lewis Partnership figures for last week show that the total value of sales was 2.2% lower than the same week a year ago, while for their financial year-to-date, sales are down 0.5% on the same time period last year. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also confirms that the unusually warm weather - and unusually successful England football team - boosted spending. The ONS says: Household goods stores also reported strong growth during the summer of 5.8% compared with a fall in the previous year, with anecdotal evidence from retailers suggesting that the FIFA World Cup had boosted sales of televisions alongside the positive impact of the warm weather. Food sales also did well with the good weather when compared with the previous summer, with a growth of 3.2% in comparison with a fall of 0.7% in summer 2017. August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales are a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mixed bag\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, argues Tom Stevenson, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International. He points to the drop in clothing and food sales, as a sign that consumers are feeling the pinch: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The headline level of retail sales data was unexpectedly strong for August, although buoyant household goods volumes were offset by declines in food, clothing and petrol. Food and clothing retreated after benefiting from the unusually warm weather in July. The rising cost of fuel is also starting to bite. So this is a mixed bag, which paints an unconvincing picture of recovery on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling high streets. Strong online sales suggest that far-reaching structural changes in UK retail continue apace. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economists reckons this spending splurge won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast-beating retail sales figures suggest the UK economy grew robustly in the last quarter, says economist Howard Archer of the EY Item Club: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details: The surprise rise in UK retail sales last month has pushed the pound back to $1.32, a gain of half a cent. Newsflash: UK shoppers kept spending in August despite rising inflation and worries over Brexit. Retail sales volumes (the amount of stuff people bought) rose by 0.3% in August compared with July, the Office for National Statistics says. That beats forecasts of a 0.2% decline. The ONS says that household goods sales jumped by 4.5%, while other non-food stores enjoyed a 2.8% rise. However, food sales dropped by 0.6% and clothing fell by 1.9%. Yesterday we learned that UK inflation jumped to 2.7% in August, from 2.5% in July, partly due to a jump in clothing and transport costs. This doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to have dampened demand for goods, though. On an annual basis, sales in June-August were 3.4% up than a year earlier - partly thanks to the summer heatwave. Office for National Statistics senior statistician, Rhian Murphy, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Retail sales remained strong in the three months to August, with continued growth across all sectors. Food and household goods stores particularly benefitted from the warm weather when compared with last summer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The figures for the month of August were a little more mixed, with food sales falling after strong sales earlier in the summer and clothing sales declining following a strong July, as suggested by clothing retailers. On the other hand, household goods grew strongly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back to the US-China trade war, and billionaire Jack Ma has ditched his goal of creating a million new jobs for Americans. Ma blamed the rising protectionist conflict between Beijing and Washington, saying the lack of friendly relations make the pledge unviable. CNBC has the details: Jack Ma, founder and chairman of Chinese retail giant Alibaba, says the company no longer plans to create 1 million jobs in the United States in the wake of the ongoing trade conflict between the U.S. and China. Ma made his original job creation pronouncement during a high-profile meeting with Donald Trump in January 2017 before Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inauguration as president. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The promise was made on the premise of friendly US-China partnership and rational trade relations,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ma told Chinese news site Xinhua on Wednesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That premise no longer exists today, so our promise cannot be fulfilled.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM is underway. In a surprise twist, the airline lifted its ban on journalists attending (just as well, as hacks were congregating outside anyway). Ryanair is now revealing the results of the shareholder votes. Founder Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary is re-elected with 98.5% support from proxy votes (votes made in advance by investors). But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a rebellion against the chairman; only 70.5% of votes are cast in favour of David Bonderman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s re-election. Independent director Kyran McLaughlin received just 66.8pc of votes in favour of his reappointment. Major investor Aberdeen Standard is now warning that Ryanair needs a proper succession plan, or it will rebel next year too. Back in the UK, luxury carmaker Aston Martin has unveiled plans to float on the stock market. The company, famous for its links to the James Bond franchise, reckons it could be worth over \u00c2\u00a35bn. But will investors agree, given the uncertainty over how Brexit will affect the UK car industry?.... Newsflash: Switzerland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has warned that trade disputes and the emerging markets crisis are threatening economic growth. Following its latest monetary policy meeting, the SNB said the economic outlook remains favourable - but protectionism could change that. It warns: To date, the crises of confidence in Turkey and Argentina have not materially impacted the global economic outlook. The risks to this positive baseline scenario are more to the downside. Chief among them are political uncertainties in some countries as well as potential international tensions and protectionist tendencies. The SNB has left interest rates on hold at their current record low of minus 0.75%. China has also hit back at Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that it is trying to undermine US democracy. Commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng insists that the new tariffs on $60bn of US goods, which kick in next week, had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nothing to do\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with US politics. Gao was responding to the US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that China is targeting voters such as farmers, ranchers and factory workers. These tweets from Tuesday, for example, show that Trump believes Beijing is trying to hurt his supporters, by putting tariffs on US agricultural products and machinery. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commerce ministry has vowed not to launch a currency war with America. Speaking to journalists, spokesman Gao Feng says that it will not use the yuan as a tool to resolve its trade dispute, and will maintain it at a reasonable level. Gao points out that a depreciating yuan is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more detrimental than beneficial\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war with China remains the biggest story in the markets today (although Brexit is doing its best to share the spotlight). After the flurry of tit-for-tat tariffs earlier this week, global investors are watching nervously to see whether the conflict escalates further, or if officials can negotiate a truce. In the last few minutes, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government has launched a stinging attack on Washington, saying America hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been sincere over trade. Clearly Beijing isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy that Donald Trump signed off 10% tariffs on $200bn of their goods, at the same time as the White House was pushing for new talks. Reuters has the details: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that talks on an equal footing are the only correct way to resolve trade issues with the United States, after U.S.President Donald Trump imposed 10% tariffs on about $200bn worth of Chinese imports. The United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 current unilateral trade actions cannot be accepted by China, and the United States has not been sincere, ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing. The commerce ministry also said it is studying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153targeted measures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to help foreign firms in its economy. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that Beijing is taking steps to protect itself from the impact of the trade war. Bloomberg is reporting that China is planning to cut the average tariff rates on imports from the majority of its trading partners as soon as next month. That would help Chinese consumers, who face paying more for US imports. Also coming up today The Office for National Statistics publishes Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales figures for August this morning. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expected to show a 0.2% decline, following a 0.7% jump in July, as household spending power remains squeezed. David Madden of CMC Markets says: Traders will be watching this report closely as consumer appetite needs to be healthy to drive the economy along. There could be turbulence (sorry) at Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual general meeting today. One investors, Royal London Asset Management, has vowed to vote against the airline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman and two other board members.

                "bodyText":"Sentiment among European investors has improved, with most major markets reversing earlier losses and following Wall Street higher. The FTSE 100 is up 0.3% or 20 points at 7,531. In Italy, the FTSE MIB is still down 0.8% on those budget concerns, but losses have been trimmed. Aside from the tensions in Italy over budget deficit targets, investors have been focused on events in the US, where the Federal Reserve raised rates for the third time this year on Thursday, citing confidence in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. There was respite for Argentina, after the IMF agreed to a loan of $57bn over the three years - the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest ever loan. In the UK, car manufacturing fell by 13% in August, marking the third monthly drop in a row. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for all your comments and please join us again tomorrow. The opening bell has rung and US markets have opened higher, helped by the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confidence in the strength of the economy: Dow Jones: +0.2% at 26,448 S&amp;P 500: +0.2% at 2,912 Nasdaq: +0.4% at 8,022 Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda could be made to offload hundreds of stores if they are to win approval for their planned merger from the UK competition watchdog. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had found a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153realistic prospect of a significant lessening of competition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in 463 places in the UK where local supermarkets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 catchment areas overlapped. The finding is part of the CMA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in-depth investigation into the planned merger of two of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big four\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd supermarkets (the other two being Tesco and Morrisons). Full story here: Anthony Kurukgy, a trader at currency firm Foenix Partners, says the US GDP figures show the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jerome Powell was justified in his positive view of the economy: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US GDP print remaining at 4.2% reaffirms the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bullish assessment of its economy in the latest FOMC meeting. Having raised short term interest rates for the third time in 2018 this week, the Fed remain on course for further monetary tightening before the year is out, with the futures market heavily speculating a December rate increase. With unemployment at multi-year lows and wage inflation accelerating to its quickest pace in 9-years, the Fed may have no other alternative. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week, at a time when some workers were likely to have been displaced by Hurricane Florence. Initial jobless claims rose by 12,000 in the week ending 22 September, to 214,000. The Labor Department also revised up the figure for the week before, by 1,000 to 202,000. The four-week moving average was 206,250, an increase of 250 from the previous week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revised average. The US economy grew at an annualised rate of 4.2% in the second quarter, data just out confirmed. It was the Commerce Department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third estimate, unchanged from the second quarter. It was the fastest rate of growth since the third quarter of 2014, and up from 2.2% in the first quarter. The FTSE 100 is up 0.3% or 22 points, bucking the trend across Europe where the main markets are down. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index is being boosted by a weaker pound, which is struggling against the dollar after last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US rate hike by the Federal Reserve.

Launching its Marcus savings account today, the Wall Street bank is hoping to appeal to UK savers who have suffered dwindling returns over the past decade as the Bank of England left interest rates at record lows below 1%. At 1.5%, Goldman is offering the highest rate on the market, although it includes a bonus of 0.15% for the first 12 months. An account can be opened with as little as \u00c2\u00a31. Des McDaid, Marcus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director and formerly the head of savings at TSB, said: Over the last decade savers have been on the wrong end of low interest rates. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve spoken in depth to people across the country and there is a real disillusionment about savings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while most UK adults are diligently trying to save every month, some do not even have a savings account, with low interest rates and complexity being put to blame. Read our full story here: Over in Rome, Guardian correspondent Angela Giuffrida reports on the latest developments on budget talks: Tensions are rife in Italy as reports emerged that the presentation of the populist coalition government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget targets for 2019 could be delayed. By law, the targets must be presented by midnight. For weeks, the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two deputy prime ministers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Luigi Di Maio, leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, and Matteo Salvini, who heads up the far-right League \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have been engaged in a bitter standoff with Giovanni Tria, the economy minister, who is trying to resist pressure to put together a budget that will see Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit increase in order to pay for election campaign promises such as a basic income and flat tax. Specifically, Di Maio is pushing hard for a 2.4% deficit target, while Salvini is also unwilling to soften the line on that either. They could well compromise on 2%, but anything beyond that would make it very difficult for Tria to stay. A failure to agree to increase the deficit could see Tria out of a job. If the targets are not presented today then the only other option would be to resort to the fiscal goals, including a budget deficit target of 0.8%, outlined by the previous administration in the Economic and Financial Document (DEF) in April. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The problem [with the DEF] is that the fiscal targets are much more aggressive than what the government wants, so politically it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not an option, but legally it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the only other option [if the budget gets delayed],\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wolfango Piccoli, the co-president of Teneo Intelligence, a research firm in London, told the Guardian. Piccoli added that although \u00e2\u20ac\u0153by law\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the targets should be presented by midnight, this could well be ignored! US futures are roughly flat ahead of the bell on Wall Street, as the Federal Reserve avoided rocking the boat on Thursday when it announced a 0.25 point rise in interest rates to 2.25%. Not everybody was pleased with the decision, however, including Donald Trump who has said before he does not approve of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hikes. Speaking at a press conference in New York, the US President said: Unfortunately they just raised interest rates a little bit because we are doing so well. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not happy about that. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather pay down debt or do other things, create more jobs. Optimism about prospects for the eurozone economy fell among industry and consumers for the ninth month in a row in September, according to a regular survey by the European Commission. The economic sentiment indicator slipped to 110.9 from 111.6 in August, weaker than economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts of 111.2 and the lowest level in 15 months. Jack Allen, senior European economist at Capital Economics, says the survey is the latest evidence that economic growth in the single currency bloc is slowing gradually. Consistent with the message from the hard data and the PMI surveys, the EC survey showed that the slowdown has been driven by the industrial sector, presumably reflecting the impact of a stronger currency and weaker growth in the currency union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major trading partners. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data are not weak enough to deter the European Central Bank from ending its asset purchases this year. But they support the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious approach to interest rate hikes. Brent crude oil prices are hovering just below the $82 barrel mark this morning, up 0.8% at $81.98, just off the near four-year highs achieved on Tuesday. Prices are rising over fears of a supply shortage as Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 prepares to reimpose sanctions on Iran from 4 November. The number of calls rolling of UK production lines fell for the third month in a row, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The trade body said a total of 89,254 cars were built in UK factories last month, down 13% compared with the same month last year. It was a weak picture all round, with cars built for the domestic market down 39% at 16,271, and those destined for overseas markets down 4% at 72,983. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said: The quieter summer months are often subject to fluctuations due to the variable timing and duration of annual maintenance and re-tooling shutdowns. This instability was exacerbated in August, with the industry racing to re-certify entire model ranges to meet tougher testing standards in force on September 1. With exports, the majority to the EU, continuing to drive demand, it underscores the importance of a Brexit agreement to safeguard this trade; for our sector, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is not an option. In the first eight months of 2018, a total of 1.04m cars were built in the UK, down 5% compared with the same period last year. The euro is down 0.3% at $1.1703, with traders unsettled by reports of a row in Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new government, ahead of a deadline to present its first budget. Earlier it hit a one-week low of $1.1690 following a report in Italian newspaper, the Corriere della Sera that this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget meeting was likely to be delayed. Investors are also concerned that the government will seek to increase next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit, potentially putting Italy on a collision course with the European Commission and investors who would like to see a cut. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main markets have opened down, following in the wake of losses on Wall Street last night. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is down 1.8% as investor nerves rise about how budget talks will play out as the deadline looms. FTSE 100: -0.1% at 7,505 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.5% at 12,329 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.2% at 5,501 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -1.8% at 21,268 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.6% at 9,469 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.3% at 384 Argentina was offered respite overnight after securing a $57bn loan from the International Monetary Fund. The loan - which will be handed to Argentina in tranches over the next three years - is aimed at supporting the economy after a currency crisis which has seen a run on the peso, and double-digit inflation. Rubber-stamping the loan, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director, Christine Lagarde, said it was dependent on Argentina eliminating its deficit by 2019, but that the most vulnerable in society must be protected from further cuts. She said: Argentina has developed a strengthened economic plan that is aimed at bolstering confidence and stabilising the economy. At the core of the new plan is a fiscal policy aimed at strengthening its fiscal position and having a sustainable, appropriately financed budget, a strong monetary policy focused on reducing inflation, a floating exchange rate policy without intervention. A central element of the authorities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 plan will be to reach budgetary balance by 2019, one year earlier than previously intended, and to move to a 1% primary surplus in 2020. These decisive steps will reduce the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financing needs and bring down public debt. Congressional approval of the 2019 budget will be an essential next step. From the beginning, the Argentine authorities have made protecting the most vulnerable people in society a top priority in their economic reform plan. This remains a crucial component of this revised plan and is fully supported by the IMF. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Wall Street closed lower last night after the Federal Reserve delivered the widely expected 0.25 point rise in interest rates, to 2.25%. European markets are expected to follow when markets open shortly: While the rate decision itself surprised precisely nobody, investors paid closed attention to the wording of the accompanying statement for the Fed, and to comments made by chairman Jerome Powell at the press conference. Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message appeared to be slightly more dovish, painting a picture of a strong US economy, while also saying he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect inflation to surprise on the upside. He was also asked about the risks of the trade war with China, which he suggested could start to come through over the longer term. Michael Hewson, from CMC Markets, says the message from Powell was one of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153constructive ambiguity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Fed chair Jay Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments that there was no evidence whatsoever of inflationary pressure knocked US yields which had been climbing in the lead up to this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, down quite sharply, and also saw both the S&amp;P500 and Dow finish the day lower. That, combined with a slight nudge higher in the unemployment forecast gave the impression that US policymakers were slightly less optimistic about the long term future outlook than they were a few weeks ago, and this saw US yields slip back, as investors indulged in a spot of profit taking. In some ways this is a welcome respite for emerging markets, where concern about rising US rates has been at its highest, while the US dollar was only slightly firmer, in the aftermath of the decision. The Fed appears to have done it again in offering something for the doves as well as the hawks, while at the same time keeping borrowing costs on a fairly even keel. This constructive ambiguity keeps the optionality of another potential four rate rises on the table by the end of 2019, while at the same time hinting that a slowing economy might cause them to reassess that outlook over the next 12 months. Also overnight, the IMF agreed its biggest ever bailout, loaning Argentina $57bn. More on that soon.

                "bodyText":"Investors have struck a gloomy note on the final trading day of the third quarter. Markets are sharply lower across Europe, as investors do not share the Italian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enthusiasm for a higher deficit target. The spending plans - with a 2.4% of GDP deficit target for 2019 - have raised tensions with Brussels, which has argued for debt reduction in Italy, and prompted fears of a fresh debt crisis. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking index was down 6 % and set for its biggest one-day loss since June 2016, with shares in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest banks, Intesa Sanpaolo and UniCredit, also falling by 6%. The euro has also been hit, and is currently down 0.5% against the dollar at $1.1582. It is roughly flat against the pound at 88.98p. In the UK, second-quarter economic growth was confirmed at 0.4%, but the detail showed firms cut their investments in Britain over the period. On that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll close up for the day. Thank you for all the comments, and please join us again on Monday. US markets have opened lower on the last day of trading in the third quarter. Sentiment is being dragged lower by Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget decisions, which have raised fears of a fresh debt crisis, and concerns over trade tensions continues to weigh. Opening scores: Dow Jones: -0.2% at 26,397 S&amp;P 500: -0.2% at 2,909 Nasdaq: -0.2% at 8,025 US consumer spending ticked up 0.3% in August, following a 0.4% rise in July. Wall Street is expected to open lower: Time for a market re-cap. Shares across Europe are sharply down after Italy defied EU wishes and set a deficit target of 2.4% of GDP, signalling higher spending and triggering fears of a potential debt crisis. Here are the current scores: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -4.3% at 20,585 FTSE 100: -0.5% at 7,505 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -1.8% at 12,214 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -1.3% at 5,468 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -1.8% at 9,356 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -1% at 383 Richard Flax at Moneyfarm says Italian bondholders could face further price falls when the European Central Bank winds down its bond-buying programme by the end of the year: Italian bondholders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hopes were raised by signs of greater pragmatism from the coalition government, once they were in office. However, tensions in the government seemed to have spilled over with an agreement to run a budget deficit of 2.4% for the next three years and committing to greater government spending. As we begin to see signs of fiscal slippage, and a larger deficit, bond markets will continue to react negatively, perhaps even raising concerns about Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term debt sustainability. This could be compounded when you consider that the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in Eurozone bond markets is likely to reduce as the end of the year approaches. Luigi Di Maio, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy prime minister, says he is proud of the work the government is doing. He tweets: With the #ManovraDelPopolo we are keeping the promises made! Yesterday they said it was impossible. Today they say it was not to be done. Tomorrow they will remain silent. Proud of the work we are doing for the Italian \u011f\u0178\u2019\u00aa\u011f\u0178\u2021\u00ae\u011f\u0178\u2021\u00b9\u011f\u0178\u02dc\u20ac people The euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses are widening as investors become increasingly fretful about Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rising debts and the impact the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking system. The single currency is down 0.6% against the dollar, at $1.1572. It is also down -0.2% against the pound, at 88.79p Professor Costas Milas at Liverpool University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Management School says the issues facing Italian banks have the potential to spread to other countries: The Italian \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvirus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has the potential to spread rapidly in other EU countries and in particular to France and Portugal because of bank exposure to Italian debt. Bank of International Settlements (BIS) data suggests that French banks have quite a high exposure to Italian public and private debt, accounting for as much as 10.25% of their exposure around the world, followed by Portuguese banks with a 7.81% exposure to Italian debt. Spanish banks have a much lower exposure of 4.65%, while British and Irish banks are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfairly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 immune: Irish banks have a much lower exposure of 1.28% and British banks an even lower exposure of 0.82% to Italian debt. Angela Giuffrida reports from Rome: Luigi Di Maio, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy prime minister and leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, is feeling particularly victorious as the budget included the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10bn required to bring about the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key election campaign promise of a universal basic income. Di Maio says it will finally lift 6.5 million people, long ignored by previous administrations, out of poverty. But it is yet to be made clear who will benefit from the means-tested system. It could be that the income, which starts at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac780 for a single person, will only go to those who do not own a property. Some 80% of Italians own their homes. The Italian government is targeting a budget deficit of 2.4% of GDP for 2019, compared with a target of 0.8% set by the previous government. At 2.4%, the budget target is safely within the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general rule that a country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit must not exceed 3% of GDP. But Italy is a special case, because national debt stands at a whopping 131% of GDP, second only to Greece. The previous government had pledged to cut its debt, and had been aiming for a 0.8% deficit in 2019, before balancing the books and eliminating the deficit by 2020. Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, gave a stark warning to Italians on Friday morning: If Italians continue to get into debt, what happens? The interest rate increases and the cost of servicing debt becomes greater. Italians must not be mistaken: every euro more of debt is one euro less for the highways, for schools, for social justice. Moscovici told France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BFM TV it was not in the interests of the EU to have a row with Italy over its budget plans: We have no interest in a crisis between the (European) Commission and Italy, nobody has an interest because Italy is an important eurozone country. But we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any interest either that Italy does not respect the rules and does not reduce its debt, which remains explosive. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sea of red across European markets this morning, with Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB leading other major indices lower: David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, gives his take: A rise in Italian bond yields has put major pressure on the FTSE MIB, and other European markets are feeling the pain too. The coalition government has agreed to run a budget deficit of 2.4%, and the two parties in power are keen to boost public spending in a bid to stimulate the economy. Brussels will not be happy with the announcement as they would like to see the budget deficit being capped at 2%. The Italian government is sitting on a mountain of debt, and the boosting in public spending is likely to make them more indebted, which could trigger another debt crisis in the currency bloc. Back to Italy now, where the sell-off of shares and bonds continues after the government announced it would increase public spending despite a massive debt pile. The benchmark equities index, the FTSE MIB, is now down 2.7% at 20,930. Banking shares have been hardest hit, with shares in the sector down 6% and on course for the biggest one-day loss since June 2016. Annual inflation in the eurozone increased to 2.1% in September, from 2% in August, according to the latest \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash estimate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from Eurostat, the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics office. Energy prices were the biggest driver, rising by 9.5% this month, compared with 9.2% in August. Food, alcohol and tobacco prices were another driver, up 2.7% from 2.4% in August. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, says the detail behind the headline growth figures is disappointing, and likely to make the Bank of England more cautious about raising interest rates. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-quarter GDP figures left the economy looking a little weaker than before. [The ONS] confirmed that GDP rose by 0.4% on the first quarter, but growth in Q1 was revised down from 0.2% to 0.1%. Meanwhile, the composition of growth revealed a rather less healthy picture. Admittedly, quarterly growth in household spending revised up a notch from 0.3% to 0.4%. But net trade exerted a large drag of 0.6 points on GDP growth. And both government consumption and business investment were revised sharply lower. Looking ahead, though, there have been encouraging signs that activity has strengthened at the start of Q3, with three-month GDP growth rising from 0.4% in Q2 to 0.6% in July \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a little above the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.5% growth projection for Q3 as a whole. So despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures, we remain cautiously upbeat about the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near-term prospects. But with the possibility of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit still hanging over the economy, we doubt that the Monetary Policy Committee will be in any hurry to hike interest rates again soon. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the Committee to move again until May 2019. The British economy grew by 0.4% in the second quarter, according to the second estimate from the Office for National Statistics - unchanged from the first estimate. Growth was driven by the services sector, which increased by 0.6%. Rob Kent-Smith, head of national accounts at the ONS, said the economy was weaker compared with historical averages: Although it has picked up a little from a slow start to the year, underlying economic growth remains persistently below the long-term average. The latest business investment data shows growth weakening for the fourth quarter in a row while households have spent more than they earned for seven consecutive quarters. Meanwhile our deficit with the rest of the world has grown, with goods imports increasing and overseas income falling. Angela Giuffrida, the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s correspondent in Rome, says there is a mixed mood in Italy. Shortly before midnight on Thursday, a jubilant Luigi Di Maio, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy prime minister and leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, posted a photo of himself doing an air punch on the terrace of the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office in Rome, alongside the caption: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Goodnight everyone, tomorrow we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll wake up in a new Italy!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meanwhile, politicians from the opposition Democratic Party said setting a deficit target at 2.4% of GDP was an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153irresponsible gesture\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. An Italian debt crisis is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an accident waiting to happen\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to economists at the Berenberg. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at the German bank, says: Since mid-2016, Italy has topped our list of home-grown risks in the Eurozone. With the fiscal plans on which the left-wing 5Stars and the right-wing Lega agreed last night, they have missed an opportunity to defuse the risk, to put it mildly. Instead, Italy is bringing itself into a precarious position. In the long run, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s structurally weak economy cannot afford the reversal of the 2011 pension reform and 2015 Matteo Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market reform. Because Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s underlying fundamentals are shaky, it may not take much to trigger a major selloff in Italian bond markets that would weaken banks, tighten financing conditions and dampen economic growth further. The increase in social spending might also lead to credit rating downgrades (Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and S&amp;P will update their ratings in October) increasing pressure on the sovereign bond yields. An Italian debt crisis remains an accident waiting to happen. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget plans are weighing on the euro this morning, but it could be worse. The euro is down just 0.1% against the dollar, at $1.1626, suggesting that currency traders are not overly concerned that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt issues will weigh on the wider eurozone. The Italian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to target a budget deficit of 2.4% in 2019 - despite heavy debts and opposition from the EU \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is weighing on bonds as well as equities this morning. The yields on two-year, five-year and 10-year Italian are all higher, where a higher yield reflects a lower price. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark index, the FTSE MIB, is down more than 2% in early trading at 21,038. The sharp fall reflects investor fears over the budget agreement reached by the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government last night. Under the terms of the agreement, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit in 2019 will be 2.4% of GDP, as leaders seek to increase public spending and deliver on election promises. However, the pledge puts the heavily indebted country on a collision course with the European Union, as well as its own economy minister, Giovanni Tria, who were pushing for a lower deficit. Michael Hewson from CMC Markets explains: A greement on the Italian budget was eventually reached on a budget for 2019 of 2.4% of GDP, a move that could see the Italians censured by Brussels who wanted the budget to come in under 2% of GDP, and finance minister Giovanni Tria who was looking for the number to come in somewhere between the two. The pound is not suffering too badly this morning despite those gloomy surveys on Brexit - and another intervention from Boris Johnson - which reflect a subdued mood among firms and consumers alike. Sterling is up 0.1% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1244, and down 0.1% against the dollar at $1.3067. Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group, says: After two straight sessions of declines, the pound was also showing signs of resilience this morning. Despite UK consumer confidence dropping by more than forecast the pound lifted in early trade. GFK consumer confidence figures declined to -9, below the -7 forecast. Unsurprisingly Brexit remains the key culprit. The lack of clarity on Brexit is leaving consumer concerned over the health of the economy. Although, so far confidence towards personal finance is still healthy. Consumers are still happy to spend, and recent solid retail figures support the survey evidence. This goes some way to explaining why the pound was able to shrug off the disappointing figure. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Surveys published this morning reflect a gloomy mood among UK businesses and consumers as the Brexit deadline draws closer. With six months to go until the UK leaves the EU, nearly two thirds of UK firms have yet to prepare for a no-deal scenario according to the British Chambers of Commerce. The BCC says many companies are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153either awaiting more clarity before they act or are suffering from Brexit fatigue and have switched off from the process because they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe they will be affected\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Meanwhile consumer confidence fell two points in September, to -9, as the deadline nears, according to GfK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long running index. GfK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Joe Staton: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are fewer than 200 days until Brexit arrangements in some shape or fashion take effect. The clock is ticking down and in September the consumer mood dropped a couple of notches. When respondents talk about their personal finances, the scores are still positive. But for the general economy, they can only reflect on the obvious uncertainty surrounding Brexit.
