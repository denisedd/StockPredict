                "bodyText":"A late PS: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market did indeed end the day at fresh record levels. Having burst through 25,000 at the open, the Dow Jones industrial average finished at 25,075, up 152 points. Now, as James Mackintosh of the Wall Street Journal points out, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a number... He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right about the Dow being imperfectly designed too -- it only contains 30 companies, so can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t properly represent the US economy. Right, time for a recap. Global stock markets have romped to fresh all-time highs today as 2018 begins where 2017 left off - with shares rising across the world. A renewed burst of investor confidence swept America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones industrial average over the 25,000 point mark for the first time - meaning it has gained around 25% in the last 12 months. Traders drove the Dow up after payroll figures showed that American companies hired 250,000 workers last month - the best reading since March. It suggests that tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs report (the non-farm payroll) figures could be better than expected. Jacob Deppe, Head of Trading at online trading platform, Infinox, reckons the Dow could hit 26,000 points soon: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the Dow Jones hitting 25,000 for the first time there seems no end in sight to a stock market rally spurred on by much stronger than expected jobs data for December, offering yet further evidence of the strength of the US economy. Most analysts had expected 190,000 jobs to have been created in the month but 250,000 jobs blew that number apart. Little wonder the Dow Jones soared to a new all time record high soon after. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets will expect a big number from official Non-Farm Payrolls data tomorrow, anything much less than 250,000 will be considered a disappointment. The rally gave president Trump an excuse not to think about Michael Wolff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new book; he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just claimed that the Dow could go a lot higher yet.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 also scaled new peaks, closing at a new all-time high. Other European stock markets also had a strong day, with the Stoxx 600 index up almost 1%. Shares jumped as new data showed that eurozone companies were growing at the fastest rate since 2011. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector also beat expectations, although there are still signs that Brexit uncertainty is hitting investment. The rally began in Japan, where stocks jumped to their highest levels in 26 years as trading resumed after the New Year break. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today (although I may pop back later with the close of Wall Street....) According to US reporters, Donald Trump has set the Dow Jones a new target - 30,000 points. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 250 index has hit a new closing high (again) too. The index, which contains smaller companies than the FTSE 100, gained 0.37% today to close at 20,820 points. Shares in Debenhams ended the day down almost 15%, at 30.34p. That lowers its market capitalisation to just \u00c2\u00a3370m, from \u00c2\u00a3435m yesterday (according to my calculations anyway). The news that sales since Christmas had been disappointing obviously worried the City. Healthcare chain NMC Health was the best-performing member of the FTSE 100 today, helping to push it to new heights. But Marks &amp; Spencer dragged the index back, and was the worst-performing member (blame Debenham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning). Boom! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has hit a new record closing high, at 7,695.88 points. The blue-chip index gained 24 points today, sending it over the previous record close - set on the final day of trading last year. At one stage, the Footsie poked its nose over over 7,700 points. The rally was led by energy stocks, miners, technology stocks and financial firms. Consumer companies lagged behind, though, following Debenham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpected profit warning this morning. There are just 10 minutes of the trading day left in Europe, and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is on track to hit a new closing high..... US president Donald Trump has welcomed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market rally - along with a non-too subtle attempt to take some of the credit: Chipmaker Intel is bucking the trend, though, plunging by over 4.5% this morning. That follows the discovery of a very serious security vulnerability in its processors, which could expose many millions of people to cybercriminals. My colleague Sam Gibbs explains: The flaws, named Meltdown and Spectre, were discovered by security researchers at Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Project Zero in conjunction with academic and industry researchersfrom several countries. Combined they affect virtually every modern computer, including smartphones, tablets and PCs from all vendors and running almost any operating system. Meltdown is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153probably one of the worst CPU bugs ever found\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said Daniel Gruss, one of the researchers at Graz University of Technology who discovered the flaw. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest story: The Dow is continuing to hit new heights, and is now up 173 points or 0.7% at 25,097. Wall Street titans Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are the biggest risers, both up around 2%, followed by American Express and IBM. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Associated Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wall Street action: The Dow Jones industrial average traded above 25,000 points for the first time, blasting through another 1,000-point milestone. The Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest breakthrough came in early trading Thursday and just five weeks after closing above 24,000 points for the first time. Technology companies and banks had some of the biggest gains in early trading. Wells Fargo rose 1.9 percent and Microsoft rose 0.7 percent. The Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 500 index rose 9 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,722. The Dow Jones industrials increased 118 points, or 0.5 percent, to 25,037. The Nasdaq climbed 16 points, or 0.2 percent, to 7,081. Update: Get out the Dow 25k hats! The Dow Jones industrial average has just risen through the 25,000 point mark for the first time ever, as it keeps hitting new highs. The bull market has swept shares upwards in the last year or so - 12 months ago, the Dow was below 20k. Boom! America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has hit a new alltime high at the start of trading. Although the weather is pretty awful in New York, with temperatures below freezing, the mood on Wall Street is positively fizzling. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 67 points at the open, a gain of 0.27%, to 24,990 points for the first time ever. Traders are impressed by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ADP jobs report, showing the strongest employment growth since March. Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics is also impressed by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs report. He writes: That 250,000 ADP gain, up from 185,000 in November, was probably skewed upwards by the recent strength of the official non-farm payrolls figures, however, which are used as one of the inputs. Nevertheless, after the earlier disruption caused by the hurricanes, the labour market clearly ended 2017 with some considerable momentum. Looking at the ADP details, the gains were broad-based, with the manufacturing sector adding 9,000 jobs and construction adding 16,000. Within the services sector, the 72,000 gain in professional &amp; business services was particularly encouraging, since jobs in that sector tend to be relatively well paid. Job creation is great, but where is the wage growth, analysts at Danske Bank wonder..... America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labor market got a pre-Christmas boost, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Analytics, (which helps produce the ADP jobs report). Zandi says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The job market ended the year strongly,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Robust Christmas sales prompted retailers and delivery services to add to their payrolls. The tight labor market will get even tighter, raising the specter that it will overheat.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd NEWSFLASH: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector created many more jobs than expected last month, in the latest sign that the US economy is robust. US companies hired 250,000 new workers in December, according to payroll firm ADP. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest monthly increase since March, Economists had only expected an increase of 190,000; this suggests that tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll report (the main US employment gauge) could be strong. Service sector companies provided the bulk of the new jobs; including 72,000 new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprofessional and business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 roles. Cyprus has begun the year on an optimistic note, reports my colleague Helena Smith. Cyprus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 statistics service announced that unemployment dropped by an unprecedented 15% last month reinforcing evidence that the euro zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most easterly member state is en route to making a remarkable economic recovery following the island\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near financial meltdown in 2013. 35,771 people were registered as unemployed in December, the lowest rates since December 2011, according to Cystat. The drop was attributed squarely to the construction sector which is rebounding with the recovery. Unemployment in the midst of crisis reached an all-time high of 53,204 in February 2014. In his New Year address, president Nicos Anastasiades described 2017 as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a year of stability and development\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd saying\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have no doubt that each and every one of us reasonably feel that hope is rising in our country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The leader, who is currently making the first ever visit to Saudi Arabia by a Cypriot head of state, has pledged to make sound fiscal policy a priority if he is re-elected in upcoming presidential elections. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lunchtime! Now, for the average worker this means a quick scamper to the canteen, sandwich shop or supermarket (unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re organised enough to bring your own provisions). But for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top bosses, it means something quite different. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve now earned the average UK annual wage since the start of 201 -- ie, in just two and a half working days. My colleague Rupert Neate explains: The chief executives of FTSE 100 companies are paid a median average of \u00c2\u00a33.45m a year, which works out at 120 times the \u00c2\u00a328,758 collected by full-time UK workers on average. On an hourly basis the bosses will have earned more in less than three working days than the average employee will pick up this year, leading campaigners to dub the day \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fat Cat Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady, the TUC general secretary, said it was outrageous that bosses were picking up \u00e2\u20ac\u0153salaries that look like telephone numbers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while workers were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153suffering the longest pay squeeze since Napoleonic times\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More here: German supermarket chain Aldi had a rather better Christmas than poor old Debenhams. Strong demand for treats like mince pies, glitzy gammon joints and Irish cream liqueur helped Aldi to grow its total sales by 15% over the Christmas period. This means Aldi probably achieved \u00c2\u00a310bn of sales in the UK last year, for the first time. Martin Lane, Managing Editor of money.co.uk, says Aldi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation for low prices and bargains means it is thriving in the current economic climate: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a nation of shoppers, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking after the pound in our pocket more and more, and with their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153specially selected\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd premium items Aldi is offering the same package as the other big 4 retailers but without the expensive price tag. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aldi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Specialbuys and Super 6 offers continue to make headlines and get customers through their doors and over the festive season their competitive Christmas veg prices made them a huge contender. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aldi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever-increasing popularity suggests there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of a slowdown for the discount giant.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Debenhams shares are still being thumped by investors. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re currently down 16% at just under 30p, down from 35.56p last night. That has knocked Debenham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market capitalisation down from \u00c2\u00a3435m to just \u00c2\u00a3365m - which makes Debs quite a minor player. In comparison, Marks &amp; Spencer is worth \u00c2\u00a35.2bn, and Next is valued at over \u00c2\u00a37bn. WH Smiths, the newsagent, has a market cap of \u00c2\u00a32.5bn while Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is \u00c2\u00a32.1bn. But Debenham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plight is best illustrated with a comparison to Fever-Tree, a company founded less than 14 years ago to produce high-end tonic water and other soft drinks. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now valued at almost \u00c2\u00a32.6bn! David Madden of CMC Markets: Debenhams had a disappointing Christmas period and the retailer has issued a profit warning. The retailer cited a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvolatile and competitive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 market for the drop in sales. Debenhams now predicts that full-year profits will be within the range of \u00c2\u00a355 million to \u00c2\u00a365 million, which is a considerable decline on the previous forecast of \u00c2\u00a383 million. The stock has been in decline for over five years, and if this trend continues it could target 20p. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcStrong growth for its digital offering has failed to save Debenhams from a miserable end to the year. Customers turned out for Christmas, but refused to put their hands in their pockets in the lead up to the festive period, or indeed the Boxing Day sales. Debenhams has been forced to cut prices to persuade shoppers to part with their cash, and as a result margins have been squeezed, profits have been significantly downgraded, and the share price has taken a massive hit. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor: Turns out Next may have given retail sector investors a false sense of security yesterday. Debenhams brought things down to earth with a bump, warning that the fourth quarter of 2017 was bookended by weak trade and that heavy discounting has damaged margins. Getting back to Debenhams.... CEO Sergio Bucher has been speaking to reporters following this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning. Bucher says that Debenhams will speed up its cost-cutting plans - although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not planning to close stores (on top of the 10 already earmarked for closure) Bucher says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There will be some jobs that will go - we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be creating jobs as well. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what happens when you reorganise teams.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In other news, consumer credit growth in the UK has slowed - perhaps a sign that people are cutting back their spending. Annual credit growth slowed to 8.5% in the three months to November, new Bank of England figures show, down from 9.3% in the quarter to October. The pick-up in service sector growth in December suggests that Britain has shrugged off its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft patch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 early last year, says Kallum Pickering of Berenberg bank. But, he still thinks it would have done better without the looming exit from the EU: The UK economy probably expanded by 1.8% yoy in 2017. While this is below the 2% annual average for the post-Lehman period, it is probably at, or even a little above, what the UK can manage on trend outside of the EU. To be fair, relative to the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very depressed growth expectations for 2017 following the Brexit vote in 2016, the UK did much better than expected last year. That is, however, not to say that Brexit did not hurt. Growth in the US and the Eurozone, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major trading partners, accelerated to well above the average of recent years. The uncertainty from Brexit prevented the UK from fully enjoying the tailwind from the synchronised global upswing. Without Brexit, the UK economy would have expanded by at least 2.5% last year. Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector picked up pace in December, suggesting the economy is holding up well. The UK services PMI, produced by data firm Markit, has jumped to 54.2 for last month, from 53.8 in November. Any reading over 50 shows growth, and this is the second-highest score since last April. Companies reported that business activity growth picked up last month; however, new work and employment numbers rose at a slower pace. Overall, the PMI survey indicates that the UK grew at a pretty steady pace at the end of last year.... However, there are also signs that Brexit uncertainty is deterring some clients from spending money, undermining Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longer-term prospects, Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Williamson explains: Digging into the details behind the resilient strength signalled by the headline numbers, the survey data reveal an economy that is beset with uncertainty about the outlook, which is in turn dampening business spending and investment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trends in hiring and business investment in fixed assets such as offices are showing signs of deteriorating, as is expenditure on IT, computing and other business services as worries about Brexit result in delayed spending decisions. Rising price pressures are meanwhile also hurting consumer- facing companies in particular. Nearly time to discover how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector fared last month... Breaking: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies have posted their strongest growth since 2011. The eurozone composite PMI, which measures activity across the region, jumped to 58.1 in December, up from November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 57.5. The service sector PMI rose to 56.6, up from 56.2 a month earlier. Companies reported that new orders strengthened last month, with manufacturers seeing the steepest increase in new business since 2000. This encouraged them to keep hiring more staff. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit says the eurozone gathered momentum at the end of last year: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A stellar end to 2017 for the eurozone rounded off the best year for over a decade, continuing to confound widely-held fears that rising political uncertainty would curb economic growth. At 56.4, the average PMI reading for 2017 was the highest annual trend since 2006. Manufacturing is enjoying its best growth spell since data were first collected over two decades ago while the service sector closed off its best year since 2007. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The survey data are consistent with the quarterly rate of GDP growth accelerating to an impressive 0.8% in Q4, with no sign of momentum being lost as we move into 2018. New work is flowing to companies at a rate not seen for a decade and backlogs of uncompleted work are rising sharply. Hiring is consequently at a 17-year high as firms look to boost capacity to meet rising workloads. Optimism about the outlook also turned higher in December. Debenhams\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 profit warning has spooked other UK retailers too. Marks &amp; Spencer are down 2.7%, the worst performer on the FTSE 100, on fears that its Christmas may have been less sparkling than hoped. Dixons Carphone have dipped too. Connor Campbell of Spreadex says Debenham is in a tough fight: After Wednesday saw Next provide its retail peers with some post-Christmas optimism, Debenhams gave the sector a reality check this Thursday as it became the first casualty of 2018. A 2.6% drop in like-for-like sales following a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvolatile and competitive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 festive period forced the firm to issue a profit warning, with the ailing high street staple forecasting its full year figures to come in somewhere between of \u00c2\u00a355m to \u00c2\u00a365m, way off the \u00c2\u00a383m expected by analysts. Inevitably this caused a wave of investors to jump ship, the stock plunging 20% to sub-28p \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Debenhams now faces an uphill battle to avoid becoming the next BHS. Retail analyst Steve Dresser reckons Debenhams has only itself to blame, for overpricing its Christmas gift offerings... OUCH! Shares in Debenhams have plunged by 20% at the start of trading, following its shock profits warning. They tumbled from 35.6p to as low as 28p, as traders punish the company for slashing its profit forecasts this morning. Debenhams is the first UK retailer to suffer the ignominy of a post-Christmas profits warning this year, as retail analyst Nick Bubb explains: We said yesterday that there was no sign so far of anybody having to bring forward their scheduled Christmas trading announcements from next week\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but poor old Debenhams has stepped up to the plate today, to warn that weak gross margins (-150 bps) and a poor Sale last week have hit the bottom-line. Full-year profits (to end August) are likely to be down to \u00c2\u00a355m-65m, versus a modest consensus forecast of about \u00c2\u00a383m, despite finding an extra \u00c2\u00a310m of cost savings... Sergio Bucher, the new CEO of Debenhams, wails: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market has been challenging and particularly promotional in some of our key seasonal categories and we have responded in order to remain competitive for our customers, which has impacted our profit performance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has hit a fresh record high at the start of trading. The blue-chip index rose by 27 points to 7,698 points, just over the previous record set on the final trading session of 2017. That follows the rally in Japan this morning, and last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close on Wall Street. High street retailer Debenhams has sent a shiver through the City this morning, reports my colleague Angela Monaghan: Debenhams has issued a surprise profits warning after a disappointing festive season and a failure to entice shoppers despite heavy discounting in the post- Christmas sales period. The department store chain struck a gloomy tone as it brought forward by a week its Christmas trading update to warn the current UK trading environment was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153volatile and highly competitive with weaker demand in some more discretionary areas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Debenhams said profits for the full year were now likely to be in the range of \u00c2\u00a355m to \u00c2\u00a365m, sharply below the \u00c2\u00a383m expected by the City. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We took tactical promotional action to improve our performance which resulted in a stronger 6 week Christmas period against tough comparatives... However, the first week of post-Christmas sale was below expectations despite further markdown investment, particularly in the highly seasonal gift category,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the retailer said. Like-for-like sales in the UK - which strip out the impact of sales at stores open for less than a year - fell 2.6% in the 17 weeks to 30 December. Like-for-like sales overall were down 1.8%. Sergio Bucher, chief executive of the retailer, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market has been challenging and particularly promotional in some of our key seasonal categories and we have responded in order to remain competitive for our customers, which has impacted our profit performance. Just in: London was the worst-performing part of the UK property sector last year, according to the Nationwide building society. The average house price in the capital fell by 0.5% during 2017, Nationwide reports, while the UK average rose by 2.6%. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Economist, says mounting pressure on household incomes held house price growth back (good news if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re tying to get onto the housing ladder). Gardner adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The significant disparity in house prices across the UK has been a recurring theme in recent years. In this respect, 2017 saw the beginnings of a shift, as rates of house price growth in the south of England moderated towards those prevailing in the rest of the country. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153London saw a particularly marked slowdown, with prices falling in annual terms for the first time in eight years, albeit by a modest 0.5%. London ended the year the weakest performing region for the first time since 2004. But despite this slowdown, the average London house still costs over \u00c2\u00a3470k -- or more than double the national average.... Investors \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflocked\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the Japanese stock market today to buy shares, says Japan Today, driven by expectations that the markets will rally in 2018. It reports: The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average ended up 741.39 points, or 3.26%, from Friday at 23,506.33, its highest close since Jan 7, 1992. The broader Topix index of all First Section issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange finished 46.26 points, or 2.55%, higher at 1,863.82. Tokyo markets were closed from Monday to Wednesday for the New Year holidays. The Nikkei posted the largest daily gain since November 2016 as every industry category on the main section gained ground, led by oil and coal product, securities and electric appliance issues. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets have started the new year in good heart, on hopes that economic growth will be robust this year. Over in Tokyo, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has surged by over 3% to close at its highest level in 26 years, on the first trading day of the year. Energy and financials stocks led the rally. Traders were in good spirits after the US stock markets closed at (yet another) record high last night, showing that the bull market still has legs. Optimism was also boosted by new data showing that Japan and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sectors both performed well in December, with growth accelerating. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Japanese stocks returned from holiday trading with a bang. The Topix index struck a 26 year, tracking the optimism that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seen Wall Street close at record highs in the past two trading sessions. The energy sector was leading the charge in Asia after oil prices climbed again. At the same time activity in Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector rose to a 4 year high according to survey data. Later this morning we get service sector reports from the UK and the eurozone, which will probably confirm that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy ended 2017 strongly. We also get a fresh healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property market, with new house price figures from Nationwide and the latest mortgage approvals numbers. Plus, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking the UK retail sector, as high street retailer Debenhams has just released a profits warning! That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a blow, a day after Next surprised the City with decent-looking results yesterday. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 7am GMT: Nationwide house price survey for December 9am GMT: Eurozone service sector PMI for December 9.30am GMT: UK service sector PMI for December 9.30am GMT: UK mortgage approvals and consumer credit data 1.30pm GMT: US initial jobless figures",

                "bodyText":"And finally.... the Dow Jones has continued to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmelt-up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with aplomb. The benchmark US stock index gained another 220 points, or 0.88%, to finish the day at 25,295, which is obviously a new all-time high. The S&amp;P 500 also hit a new closing high, as Wall Street celebrated its best start to a new year since 2006. Economic optimism, and predictions that US interest rates won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be hiked too quickly, helped to push shares higher. Can the bull market continue next week? Come back on Monday to find out :) Until then, goodnight! GW Hello again. Marketwatch has an interesting explanation for the market rally: Investors are feeling good about the U.S. stock market. In fact, they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t felt this good in years. The latest AAII investor sentiment survey, conducted on Jan. 3., indicates that 59.8% of polled investors are bullish on the market, meaning they expect prices will be higher in six months. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level in about seven years, since a reading of 63.3% on Dec. 23, 2010, and it is significantly above the 38.5% historical average. The number of bullish investors has gone up by 7.1 percentage points in the past week alone. There has been a corresponding drop in both bearish and neutral investors. The percentage of market pessimists has dropped to 15.6%, down 5.1 percentage points over the last week, while neutral investors have slid by 2 percentage points to 24.7%. Both are below their historical averages, which is 30.5% for bears and 31% for neutral investors. More here: Bullish sentiment for U.S. stocks is at a seven-year high OK, time for a recap. The global stock market rally has driven Britain and America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets to fresh highs today, despite an underwhelming employment report from the US. The Dow Jones index has pushed further over the 25,000 mark, while in London the FTSE 100 has closed at a new peak over 7,700. Shares jumped despite the news that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t create as many jobs in December as expected. The closely-watched Non-Farm Payroll only rose by 148,000, missing forecasts of a 190,000 gain, while wage growth was unexceptional at 2.5% over the last year. My colleague Dominic Rushe explains: The headline numbers suggest that the jobs market remains strong. The labor department announced that the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1% in December, close to a 17-year low. The US economy has now added more than 2m jobs a year for seven straight years, a run last seen in the 1990s. But the pace of hiring has slowed, the recovery remains uneven, and wages continue to lag behind growth. Analysts voiced concerns that US retailers cut jobs in December - despite the festive shopping season. In the UK, car sales fell in December for the first time since 2011 - and by the biggest amount since 2009. Further falls are expected in 2018, as consumers continue to shun diesel cars -- with some switching to electric cars instead. The automobile industry is now urging the government to agree a Brexit transition deal by March, at the latest, otherwise manufacturers will be forced to trigger contingency plans. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back later with the close of Wall Street.... Boom! The FTSE 100 has ended the week at a new all-time high. The blue-chip index of the biggest companies listed in London has closed at 7724 - the first time it has finished over the 7700 mark. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a gain of 28 points, or 0.37%. Energy provider Centrica and water group United Utilities were the biggest risers, up around 3% after an analyst upgrade. But insurance group Admiral led the fallers, down 3% after figures showed UK car sales fell last year - and may keep falling in 2018. Fewer new cars means less insurance business. Other European markets also had a strong day, as the first week of 2018 gets off to a strong start. No wonder analysts are talking about a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmelt-up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.... I missed this detail earlier, but the opening bell of the New York stock exchange was rung by a professional bull rider - J.B. Mauney. This honour was to mark the 25 anniversary of Professional Bull Riders (an enterprise devoted to the noble art of not falling off a 2000 pound bull with a temper). You know you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a bull market when you see stetsons on a trading floor.... With 30 minutes to go, London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market could end the week at a new record high. The FTSE has dropped back from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intraday peaks, but is still 11 points higher than yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close, at 7707 points. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice summary of the US jobs report: Just in: German lender Deutsche Bank says Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reform package will cost it \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.5bn. This makes Deutsche Bank the latest in a string of major companies to announce that their deferred tax assets are less valuable, now that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporation tax rate is being cut from 35% to 21%. Deutsche also says that weak markets have hit its revenues, meaning it will post a small loss for the fourth quarter of the financial year. This has sent Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares sliding almost 5%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slightly ironic, as Deutsche Bank has been a major lender to Donald Trump over the years (a relationship that has come under increasing scrutiny). MSNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Steve Benen have calculated that US job creation slowed last year - the first 12 months of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency. Benen writes: Now that we have data for all of the previous calendar year, we can note that the U.S. added 1.84 million jobs in 2011, 2.19 million jobs in 2012, 2.33 million in 2013, 3.11 million in 2014, 2.74 million in 2015, 2.24 million in 2016, and 2.05 million in 2017. Or put another way, while Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first year as president has been pretty good overall for job creation, Americans nevertheless saw the slowest job growth in six years. Newsflash: US factory orders rose by 1.3% in November, beating the consensus forecast of 1.1% growth. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 0.4% in October, and the fourth monthly rise in a row. American factories reported rising demand for transportation and electrical equipment. However.... the latest survey of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector is less impressive. Growth slowed to a four-month low in December, according to ISM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-manufacturing index which has dipped to 55.9 from 57.6. Boom! The US stock market has hit fresh record highs (yet again) at the start of trading in New York. Traders are shrugging off the news that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job creation slowed last month. The Dow Jones continued its march upwards, gaining 70 points to 25,145. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are also pushing higher, as the bull market shows no inclination to fizzle out. But while shares rise, the US dollar has dropped. Jacob Deppe, Head of Trading at online trading platform, Infinox, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Surprisingly, Wall Street shook off the lower than expected jobs data and rose still higher, although the Dollar fell 0.3% versus the Euro and 0.26% versus the Pound on the news. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payrolls data does not fit the current narrative of booming US growth. The initial reaction from the market is to ignore. That could be perilous. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also possible markets have decided the recent harsh weather contributed to the slowdown in jobs The good news is that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has now created jobs for 87 months in a row - dating back to early in Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first term as president. That has helped to pull the jobless rate down to its lowest since the end of 2000, at just 4.1%. Bart Hordijk, Market Analyst at Monex Europe, says the US may be approaching full employment: \u00e2\u20ac\u01532017 has been an extraordinary year for the US labour market, with around 200K jobs added every month, leading the Unemployment Rate to its lowest point in 16 years. The fact that we now see a slowdown can be more of a sign of employers not being able to find qualified personnel, than it is an indicator of weakness in the US economy. Despite the fact that the Hourly Earnings Growth remains soft, this can report can still be a nudge for the Federal Reserve in the direction of hiking the rates. The 148,000 increase in the US non-farm payroll last month was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slightly disappointing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, says Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics. He also singles out the drop in retail employment: Looking at the December gain in detail, manufacturing had a strong month, adding 25,000 jobs. Given the strength of the global economy, the decline in the dollar and the recent strength evident in the surveys, we can expect further factory job gains in the next few months. The obvious weakness was in retail, which shed 20,300 jobs. That could be just noise or a consequence of the shift from bricks and mortar stores to online. As a comparison, couriers &amp; messengers added only 2,100 jobs, so in net terms the structural shift is hardly positive for employmen Kully Samra, UK Managing Director at Charles Schwab, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US economy ended on a mixed note in 2017. However, despite disappointing job numbers, over the year average hourly earnings have risen by 2.5%. In addition, we have seen the economy grow quarter on quarter, manufacturing and services indices rise and other factors such as business confidence and housing are also picking up. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was something for everyone in the latest US Labour Market Report. On the one hand, employment growth slipped below 200,000 after a couple of strong months, while on the other, the headline rate of unemployment remained very low at just 4.1%, on an unchanged participation rate. Wage growth ticked higher to 2.5%, still a very modest rate despite the sharp fall in unemployment over the past few years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Federal Reserve puts much more weight on labour market data than on any other information, including the volatile and often misleading early estimates for GDP. Most survey based indicators of economic growth are strong in the US, and while the current severe weather is bound to impact economic activity in Q1, the Fed tend to look through these events, and are still on track to raise interest rates once again in March.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jobs site Indeed.com have made a handy charts showing where jobs were created, or destroyed, last month across the US economy: Ben Casselman of the New York Times is also worried by the fall in retail jobs Seth Harris, who was deputy US labor secretary under president Obama, is concerned by the rise in under-employment (the U-6 rate). He tweets: Yikes! America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sector cut around 20,000 jobs last month, according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll. That could be proof that the rise of internet shopping is forcing Main Street stores to cut back. The NFP report also shows a 55,000 increase in goods-producing jobs, a 30,000 increase in construction, and a 91,000 increase in service-sector roles. Worryingly, the US under-employment rate rose to 8.1% in December, from 8.0% in October. That means more Americans wanted to work more hours than they were able. In better news, November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll has been revised up to show 252,000 new jobs were created (up from 228,000). But what the revisions give with one hand, they take with the other. October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s NFP has been revised down to 211,000, from 244,000. Instant reaction - this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a great jobs report. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a disaster either. On wages..... earnings rose by 2.5% per year in December, as expected. But November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage data has been revised down, to 2.4% (from 2.5%). Breaking! The US economy created 148,000 new jobs in December. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather less than the 190,000 which economists had predicted. The unemployment rate has come in at 4.1% - unchanged on last month. More to follow..... No argument.... Just five minutes to go, and the excitement is building.... The US jobs report is notoriously hard to predict, and invariably revised sometime in the future. But the Non-Farm Payroll is still one of the most eagerly awaited pieces of economic data in the calendar, as it gives an insight into how the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest labo(u)r market is performing. As Naeem Aslam of Think Markets puts it: Today is the day- the most important economic data, the US Non-Farm Payroll number, on the face of the earth will reveal its colour. This number sets the trading tone and the trend for the rest of the month for traders. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number would provide us significant clues if the moderate growth in the US economy has left any impact on the jobs market, most importantly on the wage growth. Since the financial recession, the jobs market has been strengthening and this momentum was set by former President Barak Obama and Mr Trump is reaping the rewards. World stock markets are at record levels today, partly thanks to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 hitting new heights this morning. And Wall Street is likely to push the bull market even higher when trading begins -- unless the US jobs report is a shock. Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM says: Another day, another record high for world stocks, as a growing sense of optimism over the global economy boosts risk sentiment. Asian shares ventured higher during early trading on Friday, while European markets opened on a positive note amid the risk-on environment. With the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 25,000 for the first time ever on Thursday, U.S equity bulls are clearly back in town and as such, we could see further gains on Wall Street this afternoon. Investors on both side of the Atlantic are bracing for the latest US jobs report to hit the wires, in 35 minutes time. December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll is expected to show that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy created around 190,000 new jobs last month, leaving the unemployment rate at just 4.1%. However, there is talk that the NFP could be better, after another survey yesterday suggested that US firms hired 250,000 people in December. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a round-up of the latest Wall Street forecasts: Economists will also be looking closely at the wage growth figures, for signs that the US economic recovery is reaching workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pockets. Average earnings are expected to have risen by 2.5% per year, the same as a month ago, and by 0.3% in December alone. Craig Erlam of City firm Oanda says: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been promised higher inflation and wage growth for some time and investors are increasingly not buying it. Even some policy makers are starting to question why nothing has not materialised and should that continue, rate hike forecasts will start to slip, especially with interest rates now already elevated. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report should offer some insight on this, with average earnings having arguably become the most important component of it. Still earnings are only expected to have risen by 2.5% compared to a year ago, below last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peak and well below where they need to be for inflation to sustainably return to target. Whatever happens, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably hear Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views through the usual channel.... The Labour Party is also voicing concerns about the drop in UK car sales last year. Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Business Secretary, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mismanagement of the economy and mishandling of the Brexit negotiations has shaken consumer and business confidence and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerning that the sales of new cars are falling. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The industry has been warning the Government time and time again and, as has become typical with the Tories, they have failed to listen or take action. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The British car industry is a vital part of our economy, directly employing up to 170,000 people. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Industrial Strategy will set out a radical programme of investment and genuine partnership between industry and government, to protect vital jobs and build an economy that works for the many, not the few.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our financial editor, Nils Pratley, on the idea that markets are in a melt-up phase: Over in the City, the FTSE 100 index has climbed to new heights. It just hit 7727 points for the first time, up 0.4% or 31 points today, as the global stock market rally continues to bubble away. Markets have been surging in recent weeks, and there is plenty of talk that shares will keep rising as markets \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmelt-up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Rupert Harrison of asset manager BlackRock (and former top official in the UK Treasury), told Bloomberg TV that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there are very good reasons to be positive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Harrisons says: Since coming back from New Year, the phrase I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard most is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmelt up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a strong start to the year, and there are good reasons for that - the data is staying barn-stormingly strong. There doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be any sign of the reversion to the mean that people had been looking out for. On top of that, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got tax cuts in the US juicing the prospects for earnings and also potentially boosting the Capex cycle we are in. But, Harrison also cautions that there are some potential risks, including: Everyone is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbought in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the idea that global growth will continue, so any slowdown could alarm investors.. Trade policy: Donald Trump must soon decide whether to take action against China over the alleged dumping of cheap metals and solar panels. The US president is up early, and wasted no time in tweeting about the bull market: But as one City expert has already pointed out, each 1,000 point gain is less impressive than the last one..... While diesel sales slumped by 17% last year, sales of alternatively-fuelled vehicles jumped by almost 35% as more people bought electric cars. This shows that consumers are keen to drive less polluting vehicles, argues Greenpeace UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clean air campaigner Paul Morozzo. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sales of diesel cars are falling but sales of EVs and hybrids are growing at double-digit rates. Consumers are sending a clear message to the car industry that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to move on from polluting diesel and the industry should listen to it. Diesel cars have been fuelling a major air pollution crisis that has made our cities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 air toxic and harmful to breathe. EVs and hybrids are better for both air quality and the climate. If the UK car industry fails to invest in the technologies that consumers want then they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be left behind in the race for this trillion-dollar market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This charts hows how the market changed last year: Back to cars, and Ana Nicholls of the Economist Intelligence Unit, has identified several reasons for the drop in sales last year: Most people who can afford a new car have bought one recently, and pent-up demand from the auto market crash during the financial crisis is now completely sated. The average age of cars on the road is now less than eight years, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little replacement demand. Consumer confidence is faltering: with incomes nearly stagnant and the outlook uncertain because of Brexit people are becoming less keen to take out credit. November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise in interest rates didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help, raising many people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mortgage payments and making the financing deals from dealers less attractive A drop in PPI claims has also cut the number of people with one-off lump sums to spend. The sharp slump in diesel sales, after the VW scandal exposed concerns about NOx emissions. With the London congestion charge now higher, and the vehicle excise duty due to rise for the most polluting diesels, buyers are edging away rapidly. In the longer term there will be a shift towards electric cars, but at the moment sales (though fast-growing) are too low to make up the difference. The latest inflation figures from the eurozone are out -- and they show that prices are rising more slowly than expected. Despite the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge money-printing operation, eurozone inflation probably only rose by 1.4% per year in December, down from 1.5% in November. Energy prices were up 3% year-on-year, down from 4.7% in November, while food, alcohol and tobacco inflation dipped to 2.1% from 2.2%. This seems to vindicate the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to press on with its monetary stimulus -- which has been a factor behind the rise in stock markets recently. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Breaking away from the car sales figures.... we have good news for the UK economy. UK productivity (basically how much each worker actually produces) jumped by 0.9% in the third quarter of last year, new figures show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the largest increase in productivity since April-June 2011, and may show that future growth will stronger than previously expected. Labour productivity grew in both the services and manufacturing industries, according to the Office for National Statistics. This looks like good news for the UK government. Last autumn, the independent Office for National Statistics slashed its forecast for productivity growth, having concluded that it would not recover to its levels before the financial crisis. Weak productivity leads to slower economy growth, smaller tax receipts and higher government borrowing. But.... UK productivity has still taken a severe knock over the last decade, and basically flat-lined since the financial crisis. Unions fear that British car workers could be laid off this year, if sales don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recover. Tony Burke, assistant general secretary of Unite, says the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153world class car workers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will be looking to the year ahead with trepidation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government has caused confusion and damage with its policy on diesel cars and needs to start listening to the industry and workforce. Diesel engines produced by Unite members in the UK are the cleanest in the world. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ministers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 botched and badly thought through announcements are causing major damage to the industry. Combined with economic and Brexit uncertainty this risks taking the sheen off the jewel in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing crown and the 800,000 high skilled jobs it sustains. 2018 could be another bad year for the motor industry, if consumer confidence remains subdued. Richard Jones, managing director of motor finance group Black Horse, says the next few months will be crucial \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I believe we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see new car sales continue to decline in the first quarter of 2018 given that this period in 2017 was so strong. This should help dampen fears of oversupply having a negative impact on used car prices and is positive in the long term by ensuring the new car market is operating from a sustainable position. I would also expect the used car market to continue to perform well. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With uncertainties facing the UK economy it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to make a confident forecast for 2018 as a whole. I believe a big test for the industry will come after quarter one when we will see how the underlying UK economy and consumer confidence is influencing car demand.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit is the biggest threat to the UK automobile industry this year, according to a new survey of car dealers from Close Brothers Motor Finance. More encouragingly, 92% of dealers are confident about business prospects in the market for 2018, up from 63% last year. However, that optimism could wilt if Britain doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree a Brexit transition deal soon.... Worryingly, the drop in diesel car sales seems to have pushed emissions of carbon dioxide up. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a disappointing consequence of consumers shunning diesel motors and buying petrol ones instead, following revelations that diesel cars were pumping more nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere than officially reported. The SMMT explains: Carbon tailpipe emissions have risen for the first time since 1997, with new cars averaging 121.04g/km, up 0.8% on 2016. Last year, UK new car CO2 emissions fell for the 19th consecutive year and this is the first year the figure has risen since records began. The SMMT have just issued a press release, confirming that UK car sales declined in 2017. Here are the key points: Overall annual demand falls -5.7% in 2017 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but new car market still third biggest in a decade at over 2.5 million vehicles. December represents the ninth consecutive month of decline, as registrations for final month of year drop -14.4%. Appetite for electrified cars reaches record high, with almost 120,000 alternatively fuelled vehicles (AFVs) hitting UK roads \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a 34.8% uplift. Diesel demand declines -17.1%, undermining progress on emissions and CO2 as industry body warns consumers could end up paying more in fuel if they travel high mileages. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a couple of handy charts too: In contrast to the UK, car sales in Germany actually rose last year. Auto sales in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy increased by 2.7% during 2017. However - as in Britain - diesel sales tumbled (by 13%). Reuters explains: Pressure is growing on Germany to tackle diesel pollution as dozens of cities including Munich and Stuttgart, where BMW and Daimler are based, could face penalties for allowing nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels in excess of European Union limits introduced in 2010, the DUH environmental lobby has said. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has hit a fresh intraday record high. The index of blue-chip companies gained another 12 points, or 0.15% points, to 7708 points, six points above yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record levels. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, says investor optimism is undimmed, for the moment.... European markets continue to make further gains, with the sheer scale of the global rally demonstrating how investors are embracing all things equity and risk related, basking in the euphoria of synchronous global growth. Equity markets, which were already strengthening well in advance of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $1.5tn tax cut, or indeed a prospective US infrastructure bill that could form the centrepiece of 2018 legislation, show no sign of any stress, with new record highs an almost daily occurrence. With the party in full swing and implied volatility at such low levels, markets are seemingly immune to any possible downside, but the key risk that might ultimately bring markets down is inflation. A material increase in inflationary pressures would potentially force central banks to tighten rates faster than the market is expecting Chris Bosworth, Director of Strategy at Close Brothers Motor Finance, believes Brexit anxiety and opposition to diesel cars are the main reason car sales fell last year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures reflect the impact that anti-diesel messages from the government and ongoing Brexit trade negotiations are having on both business and consumer confidence across the motor industry. December marks the ninth month of consecutive decrease in new car sales as squeezed consumers are reluctant to purchase big ticket items such as cars and motorcycles. Alex Buttle, director of car buying comparison website Motorway.co.uk, says diesel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s days are numbered (after the emissions scandal). He wants the government to offer more incentives to shift to electric. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Quite frankly, 2017 has been a year to forget for the UK car industry. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to dig pretty deep to find anything positive to take from the past 12 months which has seen diesel demonised in the media on a weekly basis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As sales of new diesels continue to fall, 2017 could well mark the end of one era of motoring and the dawn of a new one, as hybrid and electric sales start to take off. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The destiny of diesel may already be set in stone. Now the Government needs to stand by its commitment to the future and put its full backing behind AFVs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Incentives to encourage consumers to switch to hybrid and electric vehicles need to run alongside the billions of pounds of investment being pumped into the supporting infrastructure. Bloomberg blames \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on buyer confidence and lingering skepticism over the emissions performance of diesel cars\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the 5.6% drop in UK car sales last year. The Financial Times agrees that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry needs clarity about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future relationship with the EU, fast: You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait until March 2019,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [SMMT chief Mike Hawes] said, when the UK will leave the EU. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Production is a tap that takes a long time to turn on and off.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The SMMT said contingency plans could include carmakers investing in additional warehouse capacity to guard against delivery disruptions, or deciding to expand production abroad rather than produce new models in the UK. Mr Hawes said that even the more limited changes, such as investing in warehouse capacity, were the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thin end of the wedge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because they would impose additional costs on British car manufacturers, making them less competitive and damaging their ability to attract new investment. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry has suffered its biggest drop in sales since the financial crisis. Sales of new vehicles fell by 5.6% during 2017 - the first annual decline since 2011, and the worst since 2009. Diesel sales were particularly dire, as my colleague Gwyn Topham explains: UK car sales declined in 2017 after five years of rapid growth, with the industry blaming government for a collapse in consumer confidence in diesel vehicles. Total sales for last year were 2.54m new vehicles, a decline of 5.6% on 2016, with diesel sales dropping 17%. Despite the decline, 2017 sales remained near the highest on record. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the UK automotive industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade body, has forecast a further 5% to 7% decline in sales in 2018. Mike Hawes, the SMMT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, said 2017 had been a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very volatile year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. While sales reached a record high in March, by December they were 13.9% down year-on-year, with 152,000 fewer cars sold than in the same month in 2016. Hawes attributed the drop to a decline in business and consumer confidence in the wider economy and uncertainty over the future of diesel. Sales of diesel cars dropped by 31% in December, while petrol car sales dropped by 1.6%, after relatively minor tax changes targeting diesel in the November budget. The SMMT is now urging the UK government to rapidly agree a Brexit transition deal with Brussels. Otherwise, Hawes warns, carmakers will soon be forced to take tough - and potentially irreversible - decisions. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some investment decisions are overdue \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we need clarity [on the terms of a transitional period] by the end of the first quarter.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [Otherwise] They will have to start implementing contingency plans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With stock markets at record levels, investors will be looking to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US unemployment report for reasons to keep optimistic, and keep buying assets. The monthly non-farm payroll report is expected to show that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy continued to create jobs in December. The Wall Street consensus is that around 190,000 new workers were hired across the US last month, down from 228,000 in November. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that the NFP could be stronger. The figures will probably also show that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate remained at just 4.1%. But economists will be hoping to see evidence that employees are being paid more. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: On a month-on-month basis average earnings are tipped to increase by 0.3% and on an annual basis they are forecasted to rise by 2.5%. The US has been steadily creating new jobs over the past few years, but wage growth has been sluggish. If the US economy wants to step up a gear in terms of economic growth, wage growth and in turn the spending levels will need to tick up. Also coming up today. European stock markets are expected to open mixed, after Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong session drove the UK FTSE 100 to a new alltime high. Last night the US Dow Jones closed over 25,000 points for the first time ever, on hopes that the world economy will remain upbeat this year. Traders will also be watching out for the latest eurozone inflation figures, and new UK car sales figures (of which more in a moment....)

                "bodyText":"The government could face a high court showdown with bookmakers over fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), amid industry dismay at suggestions that ministers have decided to cut maximum bets on the machines to \u00c2\u00a32. The stock market value of some of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bookmakers slumped by more than \u00c2\u00a3660m on Monday, following reports that new digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) secretary, Matt Hancock, favours tough curbs on the lucrative but controversial machines. Bookmakers have previously ruled out launching a judicial review of the department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision, regardless of the outcome, due to the difficulty in proving the process was flawed. However, industry figures believe the government may have unwittingly opened the door to a legal challenge by appearing to take a decision before Tuesday, when a 12-week evidence-gathering period is due to end. One senior figure at a major bookmaker said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If it looks like they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ignored a lot of evidence and made up their mind there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a risk [of a judicial review] from someone in the industry. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a disaster-case scenario, there must be someone who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got nothing to lose.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A source at another high-street bookmaker said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It [a judicial review] is always a last resort but a departmental briefing has to be a major concern just days before the consultation closes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A departmental head at a third bookmaker said his firm could not afford to fund a legal challenge, but added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whether in the larger scale of things we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re approached to join an industry group is a different matter.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bookies gained more than half of their revenues from FOBTs last year, pulling in \u00c2\u00a31.8bn from machines that allow gamblers to stake \u00c2\u00a3100 every 20 seconds on digital casino games such as roulette. Campaigners against FOBTs claim they are particularly addictive, clustered in deprived areas, and allow gamblers to rack up huge losses. But in a statement to the stock market, Ladbrokes said a cut to \u00c2\u00a32 would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fail to adequately address any issue of problem gambling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious consequences\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the survival of high-street bookmakers and the horse-racing industry, which is part-funded by a levy on bookies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 profits. The bookmaker is in the midst of a takeover by the online gaming specialist GVC, with the value of the deal directly linked to the outcome of the review. An 8% fall in Ladbrokes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 share price on Monday took its stock market value down \u00c2\u00a3281m to just above \u00c2\u00a33.1bn, indicating investors now think a cut to \u00c2\u00a32 is more likely than it was. GVC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock also declined, falling 4%. William Hill fell nearly 12%, cutting its stock market value by \u00c2\u00a3347m. The DCMS insisted no decision on stakes had yet been taken.

it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a stern warning that capitalism is failing to serve the people.</strong></p> <p>The message is being read by Cardinal Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson.</p> <p>In it, the Pope says there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moral imperative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to create the conditions needed to allow everyone to live in a dignified manner</p> <p>He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s urges delegates at WEF to build a better foundation for a just society, that can restore dignity to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153those who cannot dream of a better world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>Pope Francis warns of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153growing fragmentation between states and institutions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with new actors emerging, and new economic competition and regional trade agreements.</p> <p>In a damning verdict on the world today, the Pope warns that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an ambition for profit at all costs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is driving future fragmentation and individualism, rather than inclusiveness.</p> <p>He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The recurring financial instabilities have brought new problems and serious challenges that governments must confront, such as the growth of unemployment, the increase in various forms of poverty, the widening of the socio-economic gap and new forms of slavery, often rooted in situations of conflict, migration and various social problems.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ordinary people risk being treated as mere cogs in a machine to be exploited, the Pope continues, adding:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whenever a human life no longer proves useful for that machine, it is discarded with few qualms.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also warns that artificial intelligence and robots must be used for the service of humanity, rather than to undermine it.</p> <p>Economic freedom must not prevail over the freedom of men and women, and their rights, the Pope says, declaring:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We cannot remain silent in the face of the suffering of millions of people whose dignity is wounded, nor can we continue to move forward as if the spread of poverty and injustice has no cause.</p> </blockquote> <p>He concludes by wishing WEF his best wishes for a successful meeting, and invokes \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe divine blessings of wisdom and strength\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on those attending. </p>

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I certainly wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have thought the UK economy would be as robust as it currently seems. That is because some parts of the country, led by the North West [of England], are actually doing way better than people seem to realise or appreciate.</p> <p>As well as this crucial fact, the rest of the world is also doing way better than many people would have thought a year ago, so it makes it easier for the UK.</p> </blockquote> <p>A recent assessment suggested growth in the UK could be on average 3% lower by 2030 than it would have been if Britain remained in the single market and customs union. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the worst that Brexit will deliver, then I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry about it.

The dancing is over, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve hotfooted it across from the Congress Centre to hear from Global Himalayan Expedition, an Indian social enterprise. GHE have a good story to tell too - they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve using solar panels and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdecentralized microgrids\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to bring power to remote communities in India.

Now they have an internet connection -- no sooner were they online then they were checking out their own region on Wikipedia. Inspiring stuff. More details here. Elton John\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack on inequality will, rightly, provoke reminders that he is himself fabulously wealthy - with an estimated \u00c2\u00a3290m in the bank. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what happens when you shift a quarter of a billion records over a glittering career. And in his defence, the Elton John AIDS Foundation (EJAF) has raised more than $400 million (according to WEF). From inequality to...ballet! WEF delegates are now enjoying a performance led by La Scala\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s principal dancer \u00c3\u00a9toile Roberto Bolle, which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m told \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fuses the work of Antonio Vivaldi and Astor Piazzolla to explore the fine line between chaos and harmony in our relationship with nature.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Finally, Sir Elton John receives his Crystal Award from the World Economic Foundation, for his philanthropic work. Sir Elton explains that he became a philanthropist because he had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lost who he had become\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wanted to reconnect, i wanted to be a decent person\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Sir Elton talks about the battle against HIV/AIDS - it was a death sentence 25 years ago, he says, but there are now millions of people on life-saving medicine. The musician ends by challenging delegates at Davos to deliver on their mission to improve the state of the world, adding; The world needs to be changed - the inequality in the world is, to be honest, disgraceful. Now, Bollywood star Shar Rukr Khan gives a moving speech about the strength of women, such as those who have suffered acid attacks, and children who are overcoming suffering. Collecting her WEF crystal award, Cate Blanchett tells the audience that we must rebuild the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshared bonds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 between people if we are to tackle the refugee crisis. The Australian actor laments the lack of empathy and compassion. She explains that if we can drop the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcloaded label\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrefugee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 it is earlier to see the person behind it. It is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very very easy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to turn your back on those in need, if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think of them as fellow human being, Blanchett says, adding: Once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve born witness you cannot turn away. Pope Francis has sent a message to the World Economic Forum, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a stern warning that capitalism is failing to serve the people. The message is being read by Cardinal Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson. In it, the Pope says there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moral imperative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to create the conditions needed to allow everyone to live in a dignified manner He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s urges delegates at WEF to build a better foundation for a just society, that can restore dignity to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153those who cannot dream of a better world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Pope Francis warns of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153growing fragmentation between states and institutions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with new actors emerging, and new economic competition and regional trade agreements. In a damning verdict on the world today, the Pope warns that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an ambition for profit at all costs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is driving future fragmentation and individualism, rather than inclusiveness. He says: The recurring financial instabilities have brought new problems and serious challenges that governments must confront, such as the growth of unemployment, the increase in various forms of poverty, the widening of the socio-economic gap and new forms of slavery, often rooted in situations of conflict, migration and various social problems. Ordinary people risk being treated as mere cogs in a machine to be exploited, the Pope continues, adding: Whenever a human life no longer proves useful for that machine, it is discarded with few qualms. He also warns that artificial intelligence and robots must be used for the service of humanity, rather than to undermine it. Economic freedom must not prevail over the freedom of men and women, and their rights, the Pope says, declaring: We cannot remain silent in the face of the suffering of millions of people whose dignity is wounded, nor can we continue to move forward as if the spread of poverty and injustice has no cause. He concludes by wishing WEF his best wishes for a successful meeting, and invokes \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe divine blessings of wisdom and strength\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on those attending. Given the state of the world, I think they may need it.. Klaus Schwab welcomes delegates to the 48th World Economic Forum. He calls WEF the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153foremost multi-stakeholder group in the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delegates include politicians, business leaders, the heads of international organisations, charities and trade unions, plus the new generation of young global leaders. The point behind WEF is is that governments, businesses and civil society cannot solve the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems alone. He reminds us that WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambition is to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Improve the state of the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and urges delegates to follow three rules: respect human dignity and diversity serve the community be a trustee of the next generation Delegates are flooding into the main Congress Hall at the World Economic Forum, as founder Klaus Schwab prepares to open this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s event. Despite the disruption caused by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s snow, the cavernous space is pretty packed. That may be thanks to the lure of celebrity. Schwab is going to hand over three crystal awards: Cate Blanchett, for her leadership in raising awareness of the refugee crisis Sir Elton John, for his leadership in the fight against HIV/AIDS Shah Rukh Khan, for his leadership in championing children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rights in India Just in: Nine out of ten business leaders in Britain are upbeat about the growth prospects for their companies this year despite uncertainty about the impact of Brexit. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to consultancy firm PwC, which has just released its annual survey of chief executives at a press event in Davos. PwC found that optimism about the health of the global economy was boosting confidence; 36% of business leaders expected the global economy to strengthen in 2018, up from 17% in 2017. But, the number of UK business leaders who describe themselves as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery confident\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has dipped to 34% from 41% last year. PwC also uncovered signs that British businesses are reining in their hiring plans. The number of UK business leaders expecting to increase headcount has fallen slightly to 54% from 63% last year, while 15% expect to reduce headcount, compared to 10% in 2017 In a disappointing development, global flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) fell by 16% in 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to a new report from UNCTAD - the United Nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arm for trade, investment and development issues. UNCTAD reports that FDI shank to $1.52 trillion last year, down from $1.81 trillion in 2016. That indicates that companies cut back on spending on new factories and the like. FDI flows into Europe shrank by 27%, while in US it slumped by a third. UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi says FDI spending is on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bumpy road\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While FDI in developing countries remained at a level similar to the previous year, more investment in sectors that can contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals is still badly needed. Promoting FDI for sustainable development remains a challenge.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As a measure of economic success, GDP has plenty of critics. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too blunt, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t distinguish between building atom bombs or orphanages, or take account of environmental damage or economic inequality. So, the World Economic Forum has just launched a new metric of national economic performance as an alternative to GDP. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s called the inclusive development index, and it attempts to do a better job of evaluating countries, by focusing on living standards, and whether policymakers are doing a good job of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfuture-proofing their economies.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 The index is based on growth and development; inclusion; and intergenerational equity, tracking metrics like GDP per capita; labour productivity; employment; and healthy life expectancy. So how does Britain do on this measure? Not very well, basically. The UK comes just 21st, some way behind Germany (12th), Canada (17th) and France (18th). But the other three G7 nations did even worse, with the US coming 23rd, Japan 24th and Italy just 27th. Norway, Iceland, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Denmark filled the first five places. The Treasury have sent a short response to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IMF forecasts: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are building a Britain that is fit for the future by improving skills, backing innovation and investing in infrastructure to deliver a stronger economy and guarantee a better future for the next generation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to the latest IMF forecasts: Although the IMF has raised its forecast for global growth, the UK has missed out. The Fund has cut its forecast for UK growth in 2019 to 1.5%, down from 1.6% previously. Although that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small move, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s notable that other countries have seen their projected growth revised UP. For example, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predicted growth has been raised from 1.5% to 2%, while the US is now on track for 2.5% growth next year. The IMF expects the global economy to expand by 3.9% this year, which highlights how the UK will lag behind. The IMF also expects UK GDP to increase by 1.5% this year, below its long-term trend, and much slower than the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s projected growth of 2.7% in 2018. John McDonnell MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chancellor, pins the blame firmly on the government: McDonnell (who is due in Davos later this week) says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The IMF report out today confirms what others have been saying \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the UK economy is not growing as fast as many other advanced economies. It further exposes the effect of the last seven years of Tory economic failure. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Philip Hammond should drop his plans to continue the austerity policies that have weakened our economy. We urgently need a change of direction from the Chancellor. There is no excuse for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmore of the same\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 approach. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The next Labour government will provide the serious investment our country needs, underpinned by our Fiscal Credibility Rule, to build a high wage, high skill economy for the many not the few.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Outside the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference, the weather at Davos is decidedly wintery. Delegates are stepping off the train into a flurry of monster snowflakes, there are huge snowdrifts everywhere, and the roads are jammed in all directions. As usual, the whole resort has been taken over by the WEF circus, with security guards controlling the traffic and guards on the perimeter of the Congress Hall. On that note, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hand over to Graeme Wearden in Davos. Here is a link to the opening remarks by Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic counsellor, at the World Economic Outlook press conference: Meanwhile US markets have opened lower, as investors concentrate more on the US government shutdown than the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s raised forecasts. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 35 points or 0.13% while the S&amp;P 500 is off 0.06% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.01% lower. Final question: will China continue to play a bigger role [in the global economy]? Obstfeld: There is no question China is a major player. Chinese growth is incredibly important to world growth. It is important for China to support the multilateral system. It will require further steps from China, to open its own economy to imports and work on a range of issues. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role is critical. Question on whether growth is even a worthwhile pursuit if not everyone benefits. Obstfeld says GDP doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t measure the distribution of rewards [from growth]. You could do that but it would be a value judgement, and economists have struggled with this for centuries. How do you measure overall utility? You have to keep GDP as an anchor and where it does not get at all the social or welfare issues you want, you have to supplement it with other data. It will never be possible to have one number to summarise the totality of the happiness of people in the worlkd, but GDP is a key concept and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep looking at it. Question on bitcoin and systemic risk. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like to comment on specific cryptocurrencies. Blockchain technology in general, we see possible advantages. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an interesting development. [But] cryptocurrencies offer risks, regulators need to watch them carefully. Do you expect US growth to become a drag on global growth after 2020? Obstfeld: The tax bill and its impact is complex, lot of uncertainty around our forecast. A lot of the impact is explicitly temporary. Could be a surge of investment in near term, when it stops could be some payback. But some [of the measures] are not temporary. So some potential for payback in US growth [could] result in slower import growth in the US which would affect trading partners. How big those effect would be is hard to predict. What role does China play now compared to ten years ago? How about the Federal Reserve? Obstfeld: China carried out large fiscal stimulus at time of crisis. Even though its growth rate has come down, it is still a major source of growth. there are challenges which the leadership has recognised in terms of strengthening financial regulations... the relationship between local and federal budgets. We see China as a strong driver of global growth going forward. As for the Fed we expect them to make data dependent decisions to achieve full employment and stable prices. Question on the risks facing the global economy. Obstfeld says, It is hard to identify one risk, policymakers need to think broadly and for the long term, not just the next political cycle. The next recession may be closer than we think and the ammunition to combat it will be less than previously, he says. On to the questions. The current upturn was not by chance, says Obstfeld, it owed much to accommodative macro economic polices. Our view is the current upturn is not likely to be a new normal. Advanced economies are leading the upswing, but will return to growth rates below pre-crisis levels. Demographic change and low productivity present challenges. The two biggest national economies driving growth, China and the US, are predicted to see lower growth in future. Easy financial conditions have also left a legacy of debt. There is less good news in Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa (in terms of growth). Voters in many countries have soured on political entities, with a turn to more nationalistic tendencies and this would harm longer term growth prospects. The overarching risk at the moment is complacency. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic counsellor, says countries have to ask themselves three questions: how can we raise our economic efficiencies over the long term; how can we avoid this upturn ending in new slowdown; and how can we be sure we have the tools to counter the next downturn. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde says we should be encouraged by global growth but should not be complacent. There are too many people left out of the economic growth, she says. Also, this is mostly a cyclical recovery. And without continuous reforms, aging populations, low productivity etc will continue to weigh. There are uncertainties ahead. There is a troubling increase in debt across a number of countries. You may say it is for the IMF to see these risks, but what we see in the medium term does give us grounds for worry. She says now is a perfect opportunity for world leaders to repair their roof (as in repair the roof while the sun is shining.) We think policymakers should make the difficult structural and fiscal reforms needed. Boost long term growth, pay down debt where it is too high. Growth needs to be more inclusive, not only across countries but within countries. This requires training for workers at risk of being displaced by new technologies. We need new opportunities for young people, and for women. We need robust global co-operation if we are to tackle shared problems (tax evasion, climate change, corruption etc). The IMF is holding a press conference on the world economic outlook which can be viewed here. The global economy will grow faster than expected this year and next as Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate tax cuts provide a short-term shot in the arm, despite fears over rising inequality and overheating financial markets, the International Monetary Fund has said. Launching its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) report at the annual Davos gathering of the global elite in Switzerland this week, the IMF upgraded its growth forecast for the world economy by 0.2 percentage points to 3.9% for both 2018 and 2019. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic counsellor, said Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts, passed into law at the end of last year, should encourage businesses to invest in additional economic output \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which should provide a positive, albeit short-lived, boost for the US and its trade partners. However, he said there are risks on the horizon from a potential sharp drop in markets after the recent surge in equity valuations. He also warned world leaders gathering at the Swiss ski resort in the Alps that they would need to tackle inequality and boost the resilience of their economies, or face a downturn that will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153come sooner and be harder to fight\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than expected. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Political leaders and policymakers must stay mindful that the present economic momentum reflects a confluence of factors that is unlikely to last for long,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upgrade comes amid a synchronised global upswing, as the economies of the US, eurozone and Asia recover from the depths of the 2008 financial crisis a decade ago. However, the current economic sweet spot has been helped by central banks around the world keeping interest rates low and pumping billions of dollars into their economies through quantitative easing. Our full story is here: The view from the train on the way to the World Economic Forum in Davos, as seen by Graeme Wearden and Larry Elliott: Still with Greece, and ahead of the eurogroup meeting, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s officials are expressing confidence that a new loan disbursement of up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.7bn will be granted. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Greek officials are calling today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup the beginning of the end of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nine-year ordeal under international supervision. Even though some demanded reforms are still pending, insiders are not anticipating especially tough words from euro area finance ministers when they meet under Mario Centeno for the first time this afternoon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am 99 per cent sure they are going to give us the green light for the next [bailout] instalment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd MEP Stelios Koulouglou told the Guardian. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are expecting soft stuff.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Koulouglou, who represents the governing leftwing Syriza party in the European parliament, said disbursement would not only conclude the debt-stricken country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third compliance review but pave the way to the end of international supervision under its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn third bailout programme. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After this there is a fourth, and last, review but it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be at all as gruelling and then we will be at the end.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Briefing reporters at 2 PM local time, the government spokesman, Dimitris Tzannakopoulos, said after today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro group Athens would enter \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the last stretch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before officially exiting the programme in August. The government expected the bailout tranche to be \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.7bn \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on the recommendation of the euro working group\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which advises eurozone finance ministers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of that amount \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.7bn will be given [to Greece] by mid-February upon completion of technical prior actions [reforms] without a new meeting of the eurogroup,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. There was good news for Greece and Spain from a couple of ratings agencies late on Friday, giving a lift to their bond prices today. Reuters reports: Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs fell to six-week lows and short-dated bond yields in Greece tumbled on Monday, after ratings upgrades for the two southern euro zone states provided further evidence of a turnaround for the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peripheral economies. Fitch upgraded Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A-\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with a stable outlook late on Friday, citing a broad-based economic recovery and limited impact on the economy from Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence bid. It was Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rating from one of the top three ratings agencies since the euro zone debt crisis. S&amp;P Global Ratings, releasing its review on Greece after Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market close, lifted Greek long-term, foreign currency ratings for the first time in two years on improvements in the finances and fiscal outlook for the debt-laden nation . \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fact that it is the first ratings upgrade in two years is a political win for government and the euro zone,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Patrick O\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDonnell, an investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management in London, referring to the Greek upgrade. The US government shutdown may be having little impact so far on global equity markets, but it has pushed the already weak dollar even lower. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Sterling heavily flirted with $1.39 as it climbed 0.2%, while the euro crept back across $1.225 after rising by the same amount. Against each other, however, neither currency could gain the upper hand, with the pound effectively flat the wrong side of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.134. Despite cable lurking around its post-Brexit peak, the FTSE managed to overcome its initial wobble this Monday, nudging back above 7730 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c roughly 70 points off its all-time highs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as the day went on. The DAX, meanwhile, remained in the ball-park of its own record intraday high, sitting flat around 30 or so points away from 13500 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the latest news surrounding a possible German coalition between the CDU and SPD could only keep the index from dipping in the red, rather than propel it to fresh highs. Greece is edging closer to an exit from its bailout programme: The world faces a massive and urgent need to reskill millions of workers whose jobs will be eliminated by technological change in the next few years. A new report from the World Economic Forum shows that employees across the economy risk suffer falling incomes or unemployment as the 4th industrial revolution disrupts the workplace. To avoid this fate, millions of people need to be helped into new roles - probably into a whole new career path. Without reskilling, only 2% of workers have an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoptimal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 chance of a rewarding new role, WEF says. But with proper investment in training, they reckon 95% of the most threatened workers could end up in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood-quality, higher-wage work\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in industries that are creating, not slashing, jobs. The report has analysed employment data to find \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood fits\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for staff whose current jobs are at risk. For example, assembly line workers could retrain in construction, and metal fabricators could move into pipelaying. In old media, printers could swap their presses for tractors and become farm or ranch managers. Worrying, women will suffer the most if we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get this right. Female employees currently carry out 57% of the 1.4 million US jobs expected to be disrupted by technology by 2026, such as secretarial and administrative roles. They also have fewer escape routes. Without reskilling, on average, at-risk women have only 12 job transition options, while at-risk men have 22 options. With reskilling, women have 49 options, while men have 80 options. Last year, WEF warned that 5 million jobs across 15 advanced economies would be disrupted by 2020. This new report is based on data from America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Labour market, but its conclusions feel relevant to a wider audience. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advice for those looking nervously at the future of work: For individuals, particularly those under risk of displacement, simply to remain employed will require engaging in lifelong learning and regular reskilling. Additionally, for all workers, continuous learning will not only be key to securing employment but also to building stable, fulfilling careers and seizing rewarding job transition opportunities. For employers, relying solely on new workers entering the labour market with the right ready-made skills will no longer be sufficient. And while predicting the exact nature of the demand for skills is impossible, recent research from the World Economic Forum reveals that across a wide range of scenarios, investment in workforce reskilling and human capital development is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno-regret action\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat is, it will be a beneficial investment even in the absence of skills shortages. For policy-makers, fostering continuous reskilling and lifelong learning across the economy will be critical in order to maintain a labour force with the tools needed to fuel inclusive economic growth and to ensure that companies can find workers with the skills needed to help them succeed and contribute their full potential to the economy and society. Time for a market update. The FTSE 100 has recovered some of its poise after its early dip, and is now up around 0.07%. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is virtually unchanged, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has slipped by a marginal 0.04%. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Stock markets in Europe are a mixed bag this morning as investors access the political landscape. The shutdown of the US government hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spooked investors as there was a similar muted reaction the last time it happened in 2013, but nor has it given traders a reason to buy into the market. In Germany the SPD have agreed to begin formal talks with Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CDU. This is a step in the right direction for German politics and traders will be watching it closely. In the wake of the collapse of Carillion, rival companies have been successful in their contingency plans to keep projects going, says ratings agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. But they could face having to sign new contracts on less favourable terms, it adds in a new report: Project companies are satisfactorily implementing contingency plans to avoid an impact on services or cash flows after the liquidation of British construction and services firm Carillion. However, moderate credit deterioration is possible because some project companies will need to sign new contracts with alternative subcontractors, potentially with less favourable terms or pricing... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Projects continue to provide contracted services despite Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liquidation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Kunal Govindia, a Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Assistant Vice President and co-author of the report. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, if replacement subcontractors are procured it could lead to an increase in operating costs, although there are mitigating factors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Staff wages, supplier invoices and other facilities management (FM) costs are ultimately paid out of the offtaker unitary payment and there is no reliance on Carillion having sufficient cash. Currently, project companies are continuing to observe the contractual payment mechanics. As part of their contingency planning, project companies had engaged with possible replacement subcontractors. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expects that new subcontractors will join the various projects over the coming months. However, there is no guarantee that the new contract will be on the same terms and pricing. Project companies could potentially face increased FM costs without an accompanying increase in revenue. Two factors mitigate this risk. Firstly, soft FM services are benchmarked periodically and cost increases are passed to offtakers. Secondly, projects are resilient to FM cost increases, as demonstrated by generally adequate cost increase sensitivities. Meanwhile Kier has said around 200 Carillion employees working on HS2 and the Highways England smart motorway schemes have been offered the chance to join the company. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a number of companies jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon (step forward Long Island Iced Tea) and seeing their shares soar. And it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t peaked yet, it seems: A rather downbeat survey on UK household finances from IHS Markit: You would imagine stock markets would be rather edgy at the prospect of a US government shutdown. But apparently not. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 53 points on Friday, and the futures are indicating a small decline at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open of around 44 points. And the long term impact on US markets seems limited: A new report on the growing gap between rich and poor is timely in the run up to the Davos meeting. Larry Elliott writes: The development charity Oxfam has called for action to tackle the growing gap between rich and poor as it launched a new report showing that 42 people hold as much wealth as the 3.7 billion who make up the poorest half of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population. In a report published on Monday to coincide with the gathering of some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest people at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Oxfam said billionaires had been created at a record rate of one every two days over the past 12 months, at a time when the bottom 50% of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population had seen no increase in wealth. It added that 82% of the global wealth generated in 2017 went to the most wealthy 1%. The charity said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unacceptable and unsustainable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a tiny minority to accumulate so much wealth while hundreds of millions of people struggled on poverty pay. It called on world leaders to turn rhetoric about inequality into policies to tackle tax evasion and boost the pay of workers. Our full report is here: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Larry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reality check ahead of the meeting: And finally, a rundown of the hot topics in the chilly Alps: Ahead of the latest World Economic Outlook, Lord Jim O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill - the former Conservative treasury minister and remain supporter - is optimistic about the outlook for the UK. In an interview with BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed, Lord O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill said the UK was benefiting from better than expected global growth, and forecasts are likely to be upgraded, dwarfing the more gloomy predictions about the effects of Brexit. But O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill, who is on the board of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said the question was, how much better would Britain be doing without the uncertainty of its future relationship with the EU. He said: I certainly wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have thought the UK economy would be as robust as it currently seems. That is because some parts of the country, led by the North West [of England], are actually doing way better than people seem to realise or appreciate. As well as this crucial fact, the rest of the world is also doing way better than many people would have thought a year ago, so it makes it easier for the UK. A recent assessment suggested growth in the UK could be on average 3% lower by 2030 than it would have been if Britain remained in the single market and customs union. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill said: If that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the worst that Brexit will deliver, then I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry about it. Now, my own view is if we go for a really hard Brexit or a no-deal Brexit, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably suffer more than that 3%. But if it is only 3%, what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on with the rest of the world - helping us - and with productivity improving, that will easily dwarf a 3% hit over 13 years, easily. He admitted the stronger performance could mean he and many economist had been too pessimistic about the effects of the Brexit vote: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m almost embarrassed to accept that it might sound like that. Because of course in principle I share the views of many that Brexit is a really weird thing for the UK to impose on itself from an economic perspective. And maybe this [better global growth] means the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be able to cope with Brexit better than certainly somebody like me might have thought some time ago. But I would quickly add at the same time, I have felt for a good couple of years, as important as Brexit is, it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the most important thing facing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. Brexiteers are going to be like the cat with the cream. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthere you go, told you so\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which of course is ridiculous. He said major sectors of the economy closely linked to the EU, such as car manufacturing and pharmaceuticals, were still facing significant threats if the UK does leave the customs union and the single market. Bookmakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shares are showing losses on reports that the UK government is planning to cut the maximum stake on fixed odds betting terminals from \u00c2\u00a3100 to \u00c2\u00a32. It said in October it would reduce the stake to between \u00c2\u00a350 and \u00c2\u00a32, to tackle the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crack cocaine of high street gambling.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A consultation period ends on Tuesday. William Hill is down 13%, Ladbrokes Coral has lost 12% and Paddy Power Betfair has fallen 2.6%. Analyst Alistair Ross at Investec said: A DCMS official apparently indicated that while no formal decision has been made, \u00c2\u00a32 is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchighly likely\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. However Matthew Hancock, the new Secretary of State, has only just been appointed (9 January), and we think it is unlikely that a final decision on FOBT staking limits has actually been made. We also note that the FOBT consultation only closes tomorrow, and suspect speculation on the final outcome is premature. As expected it has been an uncertain start to the week for European markets. The FTSE 100 has fallen 0.13%, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is down 0.1%, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB has lost 0.33% but Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex is up 0.3%. More on the German coalition talks. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ING economist Carsten Brzeski: Given the very detailed informative talks in January, the official coalition talks should not take too long - if all parties stick to the desired results. However, the SPD delegate pushed the party leaders to renegotiate details of the informative talks regarding the healthcare system, the labour market and immigration, increasing pressure on the SPD to bring some new political achievements from the forthcoming talks. The willingness of the CDU to really re-open some of the most controversial issues seems to be very limited. ... However, once there is an official coalition agreement, all SPD party members, more than 440,000, will get the chance to vote for or against it. Compared with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s party congress, this party members\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vote will be a much tougher nut to crack. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest report on the talks: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly quiet start to the week at the moment but it is the quiet before the storm. Later today the Davos shindig kicks off, with the great and the good putting the world to rights. One highlight, if that is the right word, is Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scheduled appearance on Friday, assuming it goes ahead in the midst of the US government shutdown. Also this week come the latest policy meetings from the Bank of Japan - which surprised the market by announcing an unexpected slowdown in its bond buying programme - and the European Central Bank. UK unemployment figures and UK and US GDP numbers will also be closely watched. But back to today, and ahead of the official start of the Davos meeting (the World Economic Forum to give it the proper name) comes the latest assessment of the global outlook from the IMF. Not everyone is taken with Davos though. UBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul Donovan says: The data calendar is pretty empty today. This leaves markets at the mercy of media coverage of events at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Significant policy announcements are unlikely, but Davos does give journalists an opportunity to pontificate while wearing silly hats. It also gives locals in Davos the opportunity to rent out their premises to attendees and move out for the duration, as Rupert Neate reports: Markets are likely to open in a mixed fashion, as investors take on board not only the US government shutdown, but the news from Germany that it came a step closer over the weekend to ending its political stalement and forming a coalition goverment. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Having seen the US government shutdown confirmed after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US close there might be a case for suggesting that stocks may well be adversely affected. This seems unlikely in the long run given that the shutdown, at least in the short term, is likely to be fairly limited in nature, given that by and large economic data from across the globe continues to show a fairly robust level of economic activity. Furthermore, dysfunctional US politics isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really anything new, in fact dysfunctional politics appears to be becoming the norm, not only in the US, but the world over, even if in Germany we do appear to be starting to make progress on the formation of a new government after the German SPD party membership granted permission for the party leaders to begin new coalition talks with Angela Merkel. Despite this progress, and before we hang out the bunting, there still remains some way to go before any form of agreement starts to evolve into a workable arrangement between the various parties. Here is IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts for the market open: Also on the agenda today, eurozone finance ministers will discuss the improvement in the Greek economy in the first eurogroup meeting hosted by new president Mario Centeno.

The US currency has been under pressure on worries that the Trump tax cuts would increase the already hefty US national debt. And the dollar has become less attractive as other central banks begin edging up interest rates and gradually removing their long standing stimulus programmes.</p> <p>And despite a resolution to the government shutdown, the problem has only been postponed until early next month. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Renewed dollar weakness is the revival of yet another familiar friend from 2017. Post-shutdown euphoria has been replaced by a weary acceptance that we will probably have to do this all over again in just over two weeks.

Uncertainty about possible Eurozone reform, Italian elections and the success of the German coalition negotiations clearly take a backseat to improved economic factors.</p> <p>Over the past few months, consumer confidence improved most notably because of a much more positive view on the general economic situation, modest improvements in assessments of the financial situation and increased amounts of current and expected major purchases. This indicates that optimism and stronger consumption are going hand in hand, spurring the household consumption component of GDP growth.

                "bodyText":"Time for a quick recap of the main events from the first day of Davos: Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has challenged business leaders and politicians to end gender inequality and tackle unacceptable and systemic sexual harassment. You can watch a clip here. Trudeau also announced that the ten members of the trans-pacific partnership have agreed to extend their agreement. Oxfam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Winnie Byanyima has also hailed campaigners against sexual harrassment, saying they have helped people worldwide. Davos also heard that parents need to teach their sons not to hit women, rather than simply how to hit baseballs. India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Narendra Modi has warned that globalisation is under threat, and also cited climate change and terrorism as key threats to the global economy. The mood at Davos has been optimistic, although bank bosses have warned against complacency. An MIT economics professor has predicted that Facebook will barely exist in 20 years. Australian actor Cate Blanchett has criticised politicians for pandering to anti-refugee sentiment, instead of helping the millions of people displaced worldwide. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW A positive start following news that the US government shutdown had been resolved, for the moment at least, soon faded, leaving European markets a mixed bag by the close. Sterling rose above $1.40 to a new post-Brexit vote high, partly due to hopes that a successful trade deal can be negotiated, but also thanks to continuing weakness in the dollar. The US currency has been under pressure on worries that the Trump tax cuts would increase the already hefty US national debt. And the dollar has become less attractive as other central banks begin edging up interest rates and gradually removing their long standing stimulus programmes. And despite a resolution to the government shutdown, the problem has only been postponed until early next month. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Renewed dollar weakness is the revival of yet another familiar friend from 2017. Post-shutdown euphoria has been replaced by a weary acceptance that we will probably have to do this all over again in just over two weeks. Why buy the greenback, when so many other economies can show solid growth without the government disruption so prevalent in the US at the moment? So with the stronger pound, the FTSE 100 came off its best levels. But Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax hovered around record levels, following upbeat consumer confidence figures and signs that a coalition government could be moving closer. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fluctuated between positive and negative, but Nasdaq was lifted by the positive Netflix update. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 16.39 points or 0.21% at 7731.83 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.71% to 13,559.60 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.12% at 5535.26 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.22% to 23,836.60 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.24% at 10,609.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.62% to 872.00 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 28 points or 0.11%. NF Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of Justin Trudeau laying down the law on sexual harassment: Justin Trudeau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech has caused quite a stir, with its trenchant criticism of greedy, uncaring businesses and gender inequality. Adam Parsons of the BBC thinks it was a punchy speech: John Stackhouse of Royal Bank of Canada says Trudeau is shaking up the idea of what \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDavos Man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 acts like: Ian Bremmer says Trudeau showed how gender equality is an important economic issue: But Jamie Drummond of campaigning group One isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced Trudeau will deliver: Justin Trudeau also made an important point about trade. He tells Davos that Canada is trying to convince U.S. President Donald Trump that the NAFTA trade agreement was in the interest of the United States as well as other countries. Trudeau says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working very hard to make sure that our neighbour to the south recognizes how good NAFTA is and that it has benefited not just our economy but his economy and the world economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Justin Trudeau moves onto another vital issue - campaigns such as #MeToo and Time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Up. The Canadian PM declares: These movements show us we must have a critical discussion on women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rights, equality and the power dynamics of gender. Sexual harassment in business and in government is a systemic problem and it is unacceptable. As leaders, we must recognise and act to truly show that time is up. Justin Trudeau now urges business chiefs at Davos to help fight inequality by hiring, promoting and retaining more women. Getting more women into the workforce isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just the right thing to do, or the nice thing to do, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the smart thing to do, he tells the World Economic Forum, Studies show it can provide a significant economic boost. Firms need to address gender pay, and he warns that many firms aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t doing as well as they think. Just paying men and women the same doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go far enough, unless you also tackle the barriers faced by female workers. Women do more part-time work, and more unpaid work than men. Parental leave and childcare policies must be reexamined, Trudeau tells WEF. Firms should implement policies to improve gender balance. He also reminds us that he introduced Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first gender-balanced cabinet, and the performance of those female ministers has proved the naysayers wrong. Justin Trudeau has warned that businesses and politicians are failing to help their workers and citizens in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rapidly changing world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. People have been taken advantage of, losing their jobs, the Canadian PM warns: Governments and corporations, we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t done enough to address this. He also blasts corporate greed, saying: Too many corporations have single-mindedly put the pursuit of profit ahead of the well-being of workers. The gap between the rich and the poor is staggering, Trudeau points out, adding All the while, companies avoid taxes and boast record profits with one hand while slashing benefits with the other. Our priority must be the people who are struggling the most, and who will never get to Davos, Trudeau says. And he warns that if we operate on the basis of business as usual, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the system will break down and we will all fail.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau is now speaking to Davos. He begins by thanking the seven all-female co-chairs for organising this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s WEF. He then makes an important announcement: The 10 remaining members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership have concluded a new agreement that will maintain their alliance. The agreement reached today in Tokyo is the right deal, Trudeau insists. It will create growth, prosperity, and middle class jobs in Canada today and for generations. This is significant, as Donald Trump pulled the US out of the TPP. In an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau will give a special address to the World Economic Forum. As a liberal, feminist leader, Trudeau is a Davos favourite. But that shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean he gets a free pass. Jamie Drummond, executive director of the development group One, says that Trudeau isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually delivering on pledges to make the world a better place. As Drummond puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so exasperating that prime minister Justin Trudeau will make another great speech today while the facts point in a shocking direction. Smart aid rates under Trudeau are lower than under his conservative predecessor Stephen Harper, the money he loudly promised would be new to fight aids, TB and malaria was in fact not new, and his feminist foreign policy is not backed by new funds. This can and must change now. Not in 2020, or some vague theoretical far-off point after the next election. Drummond urges WEF delegates to put Trudeau under pressure to deliver. This week in Davos he must be asked when and by specifically how much he will increase funding for girls education and women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic empowerment; and please, he must do it this year. If we want him be a great leader on these issues, we must withhold praise until we see the quality of his action not just his delightful adverbs. Trust Trudeau - but verify. And if Davos doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pressure leaders like Trudeau to be the best they can be, or hold them accountable, this gathering is a self-defeating backslapping waste of time the world doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As we reported this morning, Drummond is threatening not to come back to Davos unless this annual shindig starts delivering the goods. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is among the world leaders who have lined up to get to Davos, reports Helena Smith from Athens: Tsipras, who arrived only hours after Athens wrapped up a third bailout compliance review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c edging ever closer to ending dependence on international bailout loans when the programme expires this summer - is meeting investors also gathered in Davos. The leftist\u00e2\u20ac\u201cled government, in an about\u00e2\u20ac\u201cturn of its previous antagonism, is now keen to attract foreign capital as it prepares the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s return to capital markets. This afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting is much in the vein of luring investors to fund projects in Greece with an eye to slashing unemployment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at 21% still the highest in the EU and by far the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest social ill. Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup meeting saw euro area finance ministers agreeing to disburse \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.7bn to the debt -stricken nation in two instalments. The first chunk of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.7bn will be released in February, once outstanding reforms are implemented, to cover debt servicing needs, arrears and creation of a cash buffer that will support Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s return to markets. Talks on debt relief are expected to begin soon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c along with a fourth compliance review which included 88 creditor-mandates reforms being taken by June. Sounding a note of optimism, EU Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said the single currency bloc should prepare for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a successful conclusion, which means Greece being back as a normal member of the eurozone and the final signal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the end of the Greek crisis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After the better than expected German consumer confidence figures, there is more positive news from Europe. Eurozone consumer confidence rose from 0.5 points in December to 1.3 points in January, according to the European Commission. This was well above forecasts of a figure of 0.6. In the wide European Union, confidence jumped 1 point to 0.4 points. ING economist Bert Colijn said: With inflation still low, job growth surprising on the upside, house prices increasing and growth forecasts adjusted upwards, there is a lot to like for consumers and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evident. The current mood among consumers is nothing short of ecstatic and current levels of confidence are generally associated with further acceleration in household consumption growth. Uncertainty about possible Eurozone reform, Italian elections and the success of the German coalition negotiations clearly take a backseat to improved economic factors. Over the past few months, consumer confidence improved most notably because of a much more positive view on the general economic situation, modest improvements in assessments of the financial situation and increased amounts of current and expected major purchases. This indicates that optimism and stronger consumption are going hand in hand, spurring the household consumption component of GDP growth. While unemployment expectations have become slightly less favourable over the last months of 2017, this is actually at odds with businesses indicating that hiring expectations remain very high. With such a favourable outlook, it could well be that the record for consumer confidence could be breached a few more times in 2018. This, in turn, confirms the rosy short-term picture for Eurozone growth. NF Dacher Keltner, Professor of Psychology from the University of California, is also on the sexual harassment panel alongside Winnie Byanyima. He says: Men tend to take more risks, they tend to be a lot more aggressive, and they tend to sexualise thing. So if you give a man power, those default tendencies will be expressed. Women tend to be more collaborative, co-operative, empathetic. You give them power, studies show it will amplify those pro-social tendencies. Lisa Sherman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Advertising Council, says parents can do more to help boys treat women with respect. You teach your son how to hit a baseball, how to hit a jump shot, how to hit the net. But we should really be talking to them about who not to hit, and why. Peggy Johnson, executive Vice-President for Business Development at Microsoft, says the younger generation are helping to force change. She explains that her daughter recently started her career, and told her that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhen there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an inappropriate joke at work, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t laugh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. I thought back and thought, when I was her age I always laughed, says Johnson. My daughter said to me that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d learned not to laugh at these jokes from me, but she actually learned it from me in my 50s, not my 20s. Winnie Byanyima, the executive director of Oxfam International, is speaking powerfully about sexual exploitation against women around the globe. All the women in the world should be grateful to American women for taking a stand, and saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Me Too\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Byanyima says, referring to the campaign that spread around the globe after the Harvey Weinstein scandal. It has brought new attention to a problem that is deep. Women in the developing world are at the bottom of the supply chain of big business. Oxfam hears stories of their lives, Byanyima explains, such as hotel housekeepers. All of them told us that they had faced sexual harassment or knew someone who had faced sexual harassment. It goes on with impunity. Domestic workers globally suffer abuse, she continues, and some of them are like slaves in the homes where they work. Only a few countries have ratified a new convention for domestic workers. It is not an accident that women are abused sexually at work or at home. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to the social norms that are there to justify their economic exploitation. That is why it is so important to tackle economic inequality, as this will also help tackle violence against women. Byanyima says there are three ways to tackle this problem: Remove all the laws that discriminate against women in the economy Tackle the social norms that justify sexual exploitation. Businesses have an important role to play here - they can use their factories, supply chains, advertising. Unilever are doing it, so others can too. Bring women into every level of decision-making and leadership, so they can drive change. In the wake of the resolution to the US government shutdown, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was initially expected to open higher. But when trading began the Dow dipped 27 points or 0.1%, with investors moving on to worry about the impact of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move to impose steep import tariffs, including possible retaliation. South Korea and China both protested at the duties on washing machines and solar panels. The S&amp;P 500 however edged up 0.03% and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.23%. The uncertainty has taken some of the shine off European shares, with the FTSE 100 now up just 0.11% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac virtually unchanged. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is now up 0.76%, off its best levels. NF David Autor, Ford Professor of Economics at MIT, has predicted that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s giant tech companies - such as Facebook - will suffer the face of previous dominant companies. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on a panel asking \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccan we live with monopolies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Autor explains that we currently live in an environment of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwinner takes most\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 markets, where having a small edge over your competitor gives you a massive advantage. So firms like Amazon and Facebook are growing organically (people are on Facebook because their friends are on Facebook), but that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that this growth is healthy. Or sustainable, in the long run. We did have these monopolies in the past, Autor points out, citing the US railroads, and AT&amp;T which was broken up by regulators. Also, companies which appear indomitable can fade pretty fast, he says - and then makes a bold prediction: I would guess that Facebook will be almost non-existent 20 years from now. Autor is also critical of the US model where employees are not treated as stakeholders (unlike shareholders). This situation has created a level of inequality that has led to political upheaval, he says. Elsewhere in Davos, the head of the Red Cross has warned that fresh humanitarian crises could break out this year. Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, says there are a lot of fragile situations that could develop into \u00e2\u20ac\u0153full-fledged\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd conflicts (as we saw with the Rohingya crisis in 2017). Maurer says there are plenty of places on the brink of war, violence and disruption. He cites Southern Philippines (which is under martial law), Myanmar, Afghanistan, the Middle East, and large parts of Africa as places where the Red Cross sees fragility - but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know which one will blow up in our face\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So what can Davos do about it? Top business leaders have the skills and resources to help businesses in those fragile areas, and help them tipping into conflict. Maurer also warns that humanitarian organisations need more money: In 2018 we face a big gap between the needs of people and the capacity of the international system as a whole to respond. The gap can only be bridged by more and better finance. Ultimately, Blanchett says, we must remember we are all citizens, and stand up for what we believe in. Cate Blanchett is close to tears, as she talks about one refugee family she met in Jordan. They had fled conflict with five of their children, being shot at by all sides. Eventually, the father had to choose between carrying his suitcases and carrying his children (he chose the children). No-one should be put in that position, she says. Q: Aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t politicians taking a hard line on refugees because they are reacting to the concerns of their populations? Cate Blanchett argues that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re actually reacting to populist media and the news cycle. We are at a fork in the road, she says. We try to teach our children to be compassionate, to be tolerant, to accept diversity, to share. But all the structures that are around them are not doing the same, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a schizophrenic world they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re living in. And taking a swing at populist politicians, she says she don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand how turning people in a boat back became an election winner. Australian actor Cate Blanchett is talking about the refugee crisis now (yesterday she was handed a WEF award for her work on this issue). She explains how she went backpacking through Europe in her youth, which opened her eyes to economic inequality. I was staying in youth hostels that were more like Turkish prisons, She explains, seeing people who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have anywhere else to go Q: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a lot of criticism of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy to refugees.... Blanchett says she was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbewildered\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to see the generous, openhearted, multi-cultural Australia she grew up in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flouting the UN humans rights convention\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I was very distressed that Australia was reverting back to practices that made us a fortress again. This drove Blanchett to become a goodwill ambassador to UNHCR I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shameful. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so much misinformation about refugees. They are forced to flee, and then they are vilified in the media. Blanchett says the misinformation about refugees is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very distressing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t connect with the actual people she has met. There are 65 million displaced people in the world, 22 million are refugees, half are women and children. But just 1% have been resettled in advanced developed economies. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the developing world that is shouldering the deep burden of refugees. She cites the Lebanon, where a quarter of the population are now refugees. Blanchett also criticises the way refugees are reported in the media: People are told this narrative that these people, who have so much to offer, are going to be a burden on us or become a terrorist threat. Q: But have some people in developing economies been encouraged to travel to countries such as Germany, because they hoped to be given asylum? Should we not talk about it, Blanchett replies rhetorically. The problem is not going to go away. These are not terrorists. These are innocent people, who want to return home. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also calling for more burden-sharing between countries, to help address the refugee crisis. The problem with all this optimism at Davos is that business leaders, economists and politicians have a nasty habit of missing impending disaster. WEF veterans point out that the mood is often particularly upbeat shortly before a crisis. Barclays CEO Jes Staley summed it up this morning, on the financial crisis session when he said Davos feels \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a little bit like 2006 when we were all talking whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve solved the riddle of economic crises.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Carlyle Group David Rubenstein agreed, saying: Generally, when people are happy and confident, something wrong happens. Back with the UK public finances, and a Treasury spokesperson said: We have made great progress in reducing the deficit by three quarters since 2010, but government debt is still far too high. Our balanced approach to government spending is getting debt falling, while investing in key public services and keeping taxes low. And the Office for Budget Responsibility said: It appears that the underlying improvement in borrowing so far this year is a little faster than would be consistent with our November forecast. NF Christoph Franz, the chairman of Roche, agrees that spirits are high at Davos this year - and with good reason. Speaking to CNBC, Frans argues that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchealthy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economic growth is boosting optimism among top execs. Basically, I have been here for more than ten years, I share your perspective, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very positive mood right now among business leaders here in Davos, and I think the reason is, we see a growth perspective in, not only some specific countries, but on a global scale, and the growth is achieving numbers which we have seen only before 2007. So, the economy is taking up, and for the time being, it is growth which has been created by a lot of investment. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers continue to be optimistic about business prospects and exports, but are increasingly worried about skills shortages. The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest industrial trends survey for the three months to January showed 27% of firms were more optimistic about the general business situation that three months ago, while 14% were less optimistic. The balance of +13% is up from -11% in the previous quarter. Growth in manufacturing output and domestic and export orders all picked up, compared with the previous three-month period, although the monthly order book figure showed a fall from +17 in December to +14 in January. And the number of firms saying a lack of skilled labour was likely to limit output over the next three months was the highest for more than four decades. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good to see manufacturing going from strength-to-strength with growth up and the buoyant global economy boosting export orders. But the past depreciation in Sterling continues to leave its mark on firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 costs and margins. With expectations for factory gate price inflation at their highest in 30 years, the pressure on consumer prices looks set to persist. Capacity pressures are ramping up and skill shortages are a big concern, underlining the importance of establishing a future immigration system that provides companies with access to talent and labour. The building blocks of a new system that meets economic needs and public concerns must start with scrapping the net migration target, which has never been fit-for-purpose. NF Yup. Modi wraps up his speech by identifying three priorities: The world economy must be more inclusive Policymakers must remain committed to a rules-based world order Reforming the major institutions of the world, connected to politics, the economy and securtry He talks about the Indian soldiers who died in world wars in the 20th century, to help create \u00e2\u20ac\u0153peace and humanity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. India can be a humanising and harmonising force in an uncertain world, Modi promises, citing Indian prayers and poetry which advocates a free and peaceful world. Together we can create a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcheaven of future\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, he promises, in a somewhat gushing conclusion. Alas, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not taking any questions. On climate change, Modi says India is making big progress towards hitting its goals for renewable energy. Modi says India will achieve strong growth over the next few years. Kenneth Roth of Human Rights Watch suggests Modi isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t living up to the glowing ideals he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preaching today: (remember, Modi was once banned from visiting the US following claims he had supported Hindu extremists during Hindu-Muslim riots. He was later cleared by the Indian Supreme Court). Modi is now encouraging businesses to invest in India, citing the hundreds of laws and regulations which have been stripped out to make te economy more competitive. Instead of red tape, we offer you a red carpet, he jokes. Democracy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just a political system, says Modi - it is a life view and a lifestyle. He cites India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proud democracy and diversity, declaring: For a society with diverse religions, cultures, languages, attires and cuisines, democracy is not just a political system but a way of living: Thirdly, the world is threatened by the rising attacks on globalisation, says Modi. We must accept that globalisation is slowly losing its lustre, he says. And he pits some of the blame on the institutions created after world war 2, such as the United Nations. Do the structures and action plans of these organisations match the aspirations and dreams of mankind, Modi asks rhetorically. Then he takes aim at protectionism, saying: Forces of protectionism are raising their heads against globalisation. They want to reverse its flow. The world risks new tariff and non-tariff barriers, he continues, cautioning that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations have come to a kind of standstill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The second major threat is terrorism, Modi continues. He says there is an artificial distinction between \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood and bad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 terrorism, and a worrying radicalism of young people. The world has moved from needs-based to greed-based consumption, says Modi seriously. This does not live up to the ideals of Gandhi, or the teaching of Buddha. Modi cites climate change as a major threat. Glaciers are melting, islands are disappearing under the sea, and in Davos we have the worst snow in 20 years, he says. And he criticises the leaders of advanced economies for not showing more solidarity Everyone talks about reducing climate emissions, but there are very few countries who back their words with their resources to help developing countries to adopt appropriate technology. Very few of them come forward to help. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction to Modi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for co-operation to build a better future, rather than descending into isolationism. Narendra Modi now turns to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fractures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the global economy, citing unemployment, inequality, lack of opportunities. Some important questions come to mind, which require answers, he says. Is our global order widening these fault lines, increasing these differences, and giving preference to isolationism over harmony and conflict over co-operation, he asks, adding: What paths can we follow, to eliminate rifts and differences. How can we realise the dream of a beautiful shared future. Modi is speaking in Hindi, incidentally, so the audience are getting a realtime translation. Today, data is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest asset, Modi declares. We are accumulating mountains and mountains of data, he continues. There is now a race to control data, because it is believes that whoever is able to control the data can dominate the world. Narendra Modi takes the stage, to another round of applause. He begins with a history lesson. The last time an Indian PM was at Davos was in 1997, when H. D. Deve Gowda visited. Back then, India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP was $400bn - it is now six times larger. WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theme in 1997 was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuilding the networked society\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Today, it is not just a networked society. We are living in the world of big data, artificial intelligence and robots. Back in 1997, Modi continues the eurozone didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist, the Asian financial crisis wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected, and there was no sign that Brexit might happen. Very few people had heard of Osama Bin Laden, and Harry Potter was also an unknown name. Back then, Google didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist, a web search for Amazon would bring up a river or jungle, and tweeting was done by birds, Modi declares. Davos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder, Klaus Schwab, is introducing Narendra Modi now. Globally we are moving to a multipolar, and multi-conceptual world, says Schwab. In a seemingly fractured world, India presents a bright image of optimism, he adds. It also presents an investment opportunity (something that business leaders at Davos will be interested in) There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a buzz on the floor of the World Economic Forum as India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister Narendra Modi prepares to give the opening speech. Modi is a big draw - the main hall is filling up fast with delegates keen to hear his words. The speech should be streamed live here: Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit says the mood at Davos is very different this year than in 2017. He tells us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a lot more optimistic and the optimism is broad based. Last year the Americans were upbeat but the Europeans were gloomy. A year ago the feeling was that politics was going to overwhelm economics but the opposite has happened. An improving economy may make populism less compelling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Behravesh says that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival in the White House a year ago led to an increase in business confidence. Corporate America was not keen on Barack Obama, he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business finally got a president it thought was business friendly and the reduction in regulation has been received well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Business also likes the package of tax cuts Trump finally pushed through Congress at the end of 2017 and which are weighted in favour of the well off and corporations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our estimate is that the tax cuts will add 0.3 percentage points to growth in 2018, 2019 and 2020\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Behravesh says. There are two risks, he adds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US and global economy may be running too hot. We think unemployment in the US will go as low as 3.5%, which is well below estimates of full employment. The question is how soon wage inflation and price inflation picks up. If inflation surprises on the upside we could see the Federal Reserve and other central banks step on the brakes a lot harder. The stock market could take a hit and that would be bad.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The other risk is that Trump starts making good on his protectionist threats. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So far his bark has been worse then his bite, Behravesh says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But I think China is going to come under a lot of pressure from the US this year. The US is very unhappy about the China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unwillingness to toe the line on intellectual property.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in Germany, consumer confidence remains strong. The ZEW institute economic sentiment index came in at 20.4 points in January, up from 17.4 the previous month and better than the forecasts of a reading of 17.8. And this came amid uncertainty over the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political future and before the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement to take another step towards a coalition government. The index remains slightly below the long-term average of 23.7 points, but it is still a positive outcome. Meanwhile the current conditions index rose from 89.3 points o 95.2. ZEW president professor Achim Wambach said: The latest survey results reveal an optimistic outlook for the German economy in the first six months of 2018. With 95.2 out of 100 points, this is the most positive assessment of the current economic situation since the introduction of the survey in December 1991. Private consumption, which was the most important driver of economic growth in 2017, is likely to continue to stimulate growth in the coming six months according to the survey participants. The assessment of the global economic environment in Europe and the USA is also much more favourable than it was at the end of 2017. NF Despite the warnings from Davos, investors are pushing markets higher again this morning. There is renewed confidence following the IMF raising its growth forecasts on Monday (albeit not for the UK), as well as relief that the US government shutdown has been resolved, at least for another couple of weeks. Meanwhile there were no surprises from the Bank of Japan, which recently unnerved markets by reducing its monthly bond buying programme by $10bn. This time it left monetary policy unchanged. So the FTSE 100 is up 0.31%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.11% and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 0.86% better and at new highs. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taken a while for the DAX to join in with the all-time high hitting performances of the FTSE and the Dow Jones seen in 2018. However, with German coalition talks steadily moving along, a stop-gap deal to end the US government shutdown, and a subsequent pullback from the euro against the dollar, the bourse seems ready to bulge, shooting up by 130 points to tease a 13600 record peak. In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which jumped 142 points or 0.55% after the news of the impasse over the government shutdown had been resolved, is expected to open 84 points higher. Fiona Cincotta at City Index said: The FTSE bounced on the open this morning, following a record session in the US overnight. The Dow surged over 140 points, whilst the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq tagged on 0.8% and 1% respectively, all hitting unchartered territory. The rally took place after the Democrats and the Republicans passed the funding bill to end the US government shut down, 72 hours after it started. NF Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit came in much better than expected, giving a boost to chancellor Philip Hammond. Thanks to an unusually large credit from the European Union and the strongest VAT receipts on record, public sector net borrowing fell from \u00c2\u00a38.25bn in November to \u00c2\u00a32.6bn last month. This was well below analyst forecasts of a figure of around \u00c2\u00a35bn. There was a \u00c2\u00a31.2bn credit from the EU related to the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s smaller than expected overall budget and improved economic performance. With the UK economy holding up despite Brexit vote fears, VAT receipts rose by an annual 4.8% to a record \u00c2\u00a312.3bn. Total public borrowing since last April is now \u00c2\u00a350bn, 12% less than in the same period in 2016 and leaving Hammond on track to meet his full year target of \u00c2\u00a349.9bn by the end of March. NF More highlights from the Davos talk about financial risks: Anne Richards, chief executive of M&amp;G Investments, fears that a devastating IT crash could cause the next financial crisis. She tells an audience in Davos that policymakers risk ignoring the threat posed by investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reliance on technology, and the damage that could be caused if key systems go down. Richards says she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buy the argument that a geopolitical crisis will bring the bull market crashing down. After all, markets handle geopolitical events all the time. Instead, she fears that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153systemic risk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd posed by new technology, and the cloud, could provoke an event that changes the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153animal spirits\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the markets today. Richards warns: We all have businesses that are absolutely reliant on a very small number of people who provide the pipes that we put our business though. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a technology thing out there that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all somewhat blind to. It would be interesting to think how markets would react if none of us could trade for one, or two or three days\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd David Rubenstein, co-executive chairman of The Carlyle Group, is also on the panel. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more worried about political threats - predicting that if there is a geopolitical crisis, markets will be hurt and firms will pull back from capital investment. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Economic Forum is being led by an all-female group of co-chairs. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re giving a press conference now: Erna Solberg, prime minister of Norway, is speaking now - calling for a new crackdown on illegal finance and corruption. Solberg says this is fuelling terrorism and security threats, and making it harder for emerging economies to develop their economies. She suggests a MeToo campaign to fight corruption is needed: We need to see who is taking money, who is bribing others, and show that this is unacceptable in all our societies. Solberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other priority is gender equality -- she warns that women are still treated unfairly in many economies. The barriers to women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s participation [in the labour market] is still large in many societies - it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make sense economically or politically. Can Emmanuel Macron really succeed where his predecessors failed, and reform the French economy? Tidjane Thiam, the boss of Credit Suisse, says the answer is a resounding yes. Speaking on a panel about \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglobal markets in a fractured world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Thaim says Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s programme of labour market reforms would have led to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certain electoral defeat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 20 years ago - not last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s triumph against Marine Le Pen. As Thiam puts it: Macron only got elected because the French public, the French nation, decided to change. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how it works in a democracy. Political scientist Ian Bremmer agrees that market sentiment and political reality have got out of whack.... The usual high security measures are in place in Davos this morning. Armed guards prevent any non-delegates getting into WEF; even if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re accredited, you have to negotiate airport-style security before you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re actually allowed in. The snowdrifts have also provided a new reason to ban protests in Davos this week. Davos officials say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the extremely tight space situation due to the enormous amount of new snow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave any space for a rally.... UBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, Axel Weber, has warned that sentiment in the market is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too buoyant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Speaking on CNBC this morning, Weber said there was a worrying gap between investor optimism and the actual state of the economy. Investors are taking risks, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting adequate compensation for those risks. At some time, if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got to stop it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got to stop. He added that the markets could be in a more difficult position by the time of Davos 2019.... Justin Trudeau says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be batting for middle-class Canadians in Davos this week. His speech this afternoon is also expected to cover corporate responsibility and the role of women in a changing world. Davos regular Jamie Drummond says he may not come back, unless this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting makes real progress towards tackling inequality. Drummond is the executive director of the development group One, which he co-founded with the rock star Bono. In a blog, Drummond said he had been stung by the accusation that he had spent so long hobnobbing with the 1% that he was becoming a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Davos man.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A feminist activist, and someone I deeply respect, recently commented that I was at risk of becoming that awful thing: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dca Davos Man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Definitions vary but this phrase generally refers to a male who goes to places like Davos and inhabits an elite, unaccountable bubble while determining the fates of those without access to it. The comment cut deep. It forced me to question any complicity I might have in a system I have tried so hard to change. So I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m putting my inner Davos Man on notice, and making this commitment: this will be my last World Economic Forum unless this one helps deliver on three crucial areas in the fight against extreme poverty and gender inequality. Those areas are the global education emergency; women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic empowerment; and ambitious financing to back Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge youth boom.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Philip Jennings, head of the global union UNI, has been one of the strongest voices for labour at Davos for many a year but 2018 will be his last meeting before retiring in the summer. Speaking to the Guardian, Jennings said the current business model built on the principle of shareholder value was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not fit for purpose\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that the opportunity provided by the financial crisis of a decade ago to build a more inclusive economy has been squandered. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald Trump is Mr Shareholder value\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Jennings said, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He is exhibit A of the fractured world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Jennings said a test for the business leaders in Davos talking about the problems of global inequality was whether they recognised trade unions and collective bargaining at their firms. And he predicted a backlash against three of the new titans of the global economy: Amazon, Facebook and Google. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These companies were once seen as angelic, seen as our saviours\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Jennings said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the big three has such market influence and power that the world has to wake up and start thinking about the need for anti-trust action. One of the fractures in the global economy is the power of the new monopolies and the danger it represents\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The huge snowfalls in Davos recently mean the ski resort is now facing a Level 5 avalanche risk - the highest rating. Some homes have reportedly been evacuated, due to fears that the snow is too unstable. There has already been big delays getting up the mountain (someone I met last night spent six hours crawling here from Zurich), leading to plenty of chuntering among delegates. Davos has had an early wake-up call. PR chief Richard Edelman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual trust index shows that Americans have become much less trusting of politicians, business chiefs and the media over the last year. He says: No country saw steeper declines than the United States, with a 37-point aggregate drop in trust across all institutions. At the opposite end of the spectrum, China experienced a 27-point gain, more than any other country. The survey shows that people are more worried about the rise of disinformation -- and finding it hard to separate truth from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 So, genuine voices of expertise are now regaining credibility. Edelman explains: Journalists have risen 12 points, and CEOs recorded a seven-percentage point gain, since 2017. Good morning from Davos! World leaders, business chiefs, trade unions, the heads of charities and NGOs, celebrities and the media are gathering in this small ski resort to discuss the state of the world, and how to improve it. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s WEF is taking place amid the biggest snowfalls in many years. This is already leading to inequality on the streets of Davos: workers are furiously shovelling drifts aside and driving snowploughs as the global elite queue bumper-to-bumper to reach the WEF congress centre and the exclusive hotels and converted shops where events are taking place. Last night, Pope Francis set the mood by issuing a stern warning not to remain silent in the face of economic inequality and injustice. In a message read to the Davos attendees, the Pope warned not to allow people to be used as cogs in a machine and then chucked aside. He declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153New actors are emerging, as well as new economic competition and regional trade agreements. Even the most recent technologies are transforming economic models and the globalized world itself, which, conditioned by private interests and an ambition for profit at all costs, seem to favour further fragmentation and individualism, rather than to facilitate approaches that are more inclusive,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Even Sir Elton John weighed in, describing inequality in the world today as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdisgraceful\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (as we covered in last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blog). Two world leaders will address Davos today, with different priorities. Narendra Modi, who gives the opening speech, is the first Indian prime minister to visit WEF in 20 years. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on a big push to attract more business to his country, billing India as a key growth engine for the global economy. India have sent a large delegation to Davos this year - many of whom found themselves caught up in the transport chaos yesterday. Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Justin Trudeau is expected to pitch at business leaders. But his speech, this afternoon, may also cover weightier issues such as women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s empowerment. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loads of other stuff coming up too, including debates on the financial markets, capitalism, and sexual harassment. The agenda: 9.30am Davos (8.30am GMT): Opening press conference by the Davos co-chairs 9.45am Davos (8.45am GMT): Debate: Are we heading for a new financial crisis? 11.15am Davos (10.15am GMT): Indian PM Narendra Modi gives the opening plenary speech 2pm Davos (1pm GMT): Actor Cate Blanchett speaks about the global refugee crisis 3pm Davos (2pm GMT): Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan talks about women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s empowerment in India. 3.30pm Davos (2.30pm GMT): Debate on gender, power and sexual harassment 5pm Davos (4pm GMT): Debate on capitalism: 5.30pm Davos (4.30pm GMT): Canadian PM Justin Trudeau gives a special address",

Sustainable development, health, human rights - these can never be renounced, and we have to spell them out and regulate them in a common manner.</p> <p>I hope private sector will come to our country to create jobs.. but I have to explain to people [globalisation] is good for them. Otherwise there will be nationalists, extremism. </p> <p>We need to establish a new global contract, unless everyone understands they have a part to play it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work.</p> <p>The new global contract has three duties: the right to invest, share and protect.</p> <p>[On investment} one area we are not doing enough in is education, we have 750m adults who do not have basic literacy skills, we have to invest in education, the education of girls in particular. If we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t invest there will be not equality. It is important all the countries here commit to this [investment in education globally].</p> <p>The duty to share: there is a crisis of contemporary capitalism. It has become a capitalism of superstars, spreading of value added is not equitable. We have to establish mechanisms to share value added more equitably... We also need to speak about gender equality. In France we are launching initiatives [for more visibility], I welcome the commitments from Justin Trudeau.</p> <p>If we want to share value better, we need a more co-ordinated tax approach at a global level. There should not be a race to the bottom. We need a strategy that avoids the maximisation strategies of some companies. It is a moral issue.</p> <p>We need to renounce unbridled tax optimisation. Plus how can you have a tax on digital activities. We all want these big international companies in their country, but there is an unfair model [if they pay low taxes when national companies do].</p> <p>Disruption from digital businesses will destroy millions of jobs, and if those companies do not help finance retraining of people affected, how can I explain that [to those people]</p> <p>I am in favour of IMF being given mandate to survey whole financial system, especially those areas which escape regulation. Cryptocurrencies, shadow banking etc, are not being looked at by IMF, so we have to have a discussion.</p> <p>At what point are we going to stop innovation. To say artificial intelligence, this is a red line. We need to have a framework of international co-operation to promote technology, but also to decide principles which should be decided by government not private companies.</p> <p>Finally, protection, against terrorism, and financial protection. Need government and international co-operation for this. We need to have a discussion in G20, that there must be a monitoring of all those bodies which can promote social cohesion. </p> <p>In terms of climate protection, we have committed to many things but not up to the commitments. China has done an enormous amount of work here. India is also very important.</p> <p>But we now need to follow through and respect Paris agreement. Need a floor price for CO2, if not we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be credible.</p> <p>China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Silk Road has to be a green road.</p> <p>I hope by 2020 we will have an environmental pact which is legally binding.</p> <p>The private sector must also live up to its commitments.</p> <p>Finally it is the financial system which has to accompany this with green financing.

We need less arms and more brains. People have to be trained in an efficient way. We began to reform our education system, we need better access to university.</p> <p>We invest 5% of GDP in education, we will reform apprenticeships. We will invest \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn in education and retraining over five years.</p> <p>We will make innovation the centrepiece of the economy. Reform fiscal mechanisms, create a new \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10bn fund for disruptive technologies.</p> <p>The second pillar of this reform is investment and capital. We need more equity to finance risk and big innovations. We passed reforms to reallocate our savings in this direction. By decreasing corporate taxes, big reform on capital gain.</p> <p>We have reinforced France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attractiveness.</p> <p>The third pillar is acceleration and flexibility. You need more flexible structures and rules to help different companies to change business model and readapt.</p> <p>The idea is to realign France on Germany and northern Europe. Rules much more adapted to business environment, that is a big change and it makes us much more competitive.</p> <p>Fourth pillar - make France a model in fight against climate change. That is a huge advantage in terms of attractiveness and competitiveness. Talent will come where it is good to live. We can create a lot of jobs with such a strategy. We passed reforms for this green strategy. Close coal fired power stations by 2021 (Applause).</p> <p>Fifth pillar of domestic strategy is cultural change. A preference for red tape cuts and cutting complexities. We simplify and streamline processes, and simplify bureaucracy. During last six months we reduced like crazy the number of regulations.</p> <p>We have to guarantee stability for people. We passed all these measures, voted these five year strategy on taxes. Visibility is the strategy and will not change, that is my commitment.</p> <p>It is also about risk. In France it was forbidden to fail, and forbidden to succeed. Now it should be more easy to fail, take risk, but allow people to come back and try something else. When you take risk, you need reward, and you need to reduce the cost of failure.</p> <p>France is a nation of entrepreneures, ao it was a mistake in France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a68b72de4b0473d0bc0fb0a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T16:48:48.361Z\">4.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We have taken action but let us not be naive.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound went on a tear this Wednesday, rocketing higher against the euro and dollar to mark the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best session for more than a month.</p> <p>Cable shot up a remarkable 1.6% as the day progressed, clearing not only $1.41 but $1.42 in one fell swoop. Though the UK jobs report was decent, the highlight being another minor fall in unemployment, the thrust of cable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth is coming from the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bruised and battered start to 2018.</p> <p>Despite ostensibly having the end of the US government shutdown to cheer about the dollar found little room for positivity this Wednesday, almost solely due to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos. At a press conference Mnuchin argued that a weaker dollar was better for the US economy for trade reasons, a comment that was tantamount to kicking an already very sickly dog.</p> <p>Combine that lack of policy support with a weaker than forecast US flash services PMI and a disappointing existing home sales number and the greenback gave up the ghost as the bell rang on Wall Street, plunging to a variety of fresh lows as it matched its sharp decline against the pound with a 0.8% drop against the dollar and a 1% slide against the yen.</p> <p>Of course these currency movements had major ramifications for the global indices. The Dow Jones was overjoyed at the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest defeat, jumping 160 points to soar to a brand spanking new record peak of 26375. The European markets, on the other hand, shrank in the face of the pound and the euro.</p> <p>With sterling not only destroying the dollar but rising 0.8% against the euro the FTSE took the brunt of the blows, falling to a 3 week low after dropping 0.7%. The DAX and CAC, meanwhile, both slipped 0.3%, despite the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3 year high-hitting gains against the dollar being tempered by its losses against sterling.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a68a09de4b01fba01150fac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T15:07:48.477Z\">3.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More US data, and a weak housing market report for December.</p> <p>Existing home sales fell by 3.6% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.57m units, worse than the 2.2% decline which had been expected by analysts. The November figure was revised down from 5.81m to 5.7m units. The December fall came after three months of gains, and the National Association of Realtors attributed the decline to a shortage of houses at the lower end of the market.</p> <p>But for the year as a whole, sales rose 1.1% making it the best performance in eleven years. NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Existing sales concluded the year on a softer note, but they were guided higher these last 12 months by a multi-year streak of exceptional job growth, which ignited buyer demand. At the same time, market conditions were far from perfect. New listings struggled to keep up with what was sold very quickly, and buying became less affordable in a large swath of the country.

Growth should therefore pick up again in coming months. </p> <p>Inflationary pressures meanwhile kicked higher, with January seeing the second-largest monthly increase in input costs since 2015. Higher oil prices were widely reported but, more generally, stronger demand is also helping companies push through price hikes. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LiveSquawk/status/956176213852213248\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"ht\" dir=\"ltr\">US Markit Manufacturing PMI Jan P: 55.5 (est 55; prev 55.1)<br>-Services PMI Jan P: 53.3 (est 54.3; prev 53.7)<br>-Composite PMI Jan P: 53.8 (prev 54.1)<br> <a href=\"https://t.co/dmjPxWFSYy\">https://t.co/dmjPxWFSYy</a></p>&mdash; LiveSquawk (@LiveSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LiveSquawk/status/956176213852213248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 24, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>NF</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T15:08:17.849Z\">at 3.08pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a6899c5e4b01fba01150f2f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T14:40:41.243Z\">2.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets have hit new records in early trading, helped by reasonable results from a number of major companies and the continuing weakness of the dollar.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a high of 26,344, up more than 0.4%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.25% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.19%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/956172883918839809\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dow, S&amp;P and Nasdaq open at record highs <a href=\"https://t.co/ZR7PDycEio\">https://t.co/ZR7PDycEio</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ffDSgpzl1z\">pic.twitter.com/ffDSgpzl1z</a></p>&mdash; CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/956172883918839809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 24, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>NF</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a689514e4b01fba01150edb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T14:40:16.972Z\">2.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A quick look at the pound versus the dollar and the euro since the EU eferendum, courtesy of the Press Association, and it is quite a contrast:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ian_a_jones/status/956166120976928769\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A tale of two pounds.

Apart from the weak dollar, one of the reasons for the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength at the moment is the prospect of further UK interest rate rises, hence a 0.7% gain against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1464. The stronger than expected employment and wage growth numbers only add to that expectation.</p> <p>Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the Bank of England had initially responded to the risks to demand from the Brexit vote by easing its policy in August 2016, it became increasingly data dependent over the course of 2017, eventually hiking its main policy rate by 25bp in November \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first hike in a decade.</p> <p>This came as a bit of a surprise for markets that seemed to be focusing more on downside risks to demand from Brexit than the signs of growing underlying inflationary pressure.</p> <p>According to market pricing, the BoE is set to hike the bank rate once again towards the end of the year. In our view, this seems still seems inconsistent with the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data dependant approach and outlook for GDP and wage growth. Economic growth is likely to remain robust, partly helped by the strong global backdrop. Meanwhile, the BoE expects the unemployment rate to remain below its estimate of full employment (4.5% unemployment) throughout its forecast. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the BoE to justify its ultra-accommodative policy stance.</p> <p>We therefore look for two hikes in the Bank Rate in 2018, one in Q2 and one in Q4, followed by one in Q3 2019. Even with a modest continued tightening in which the Bank Rate increased to 1.25% by the end of 2019, UK monetary policy would remain highly accommodative. We will be paying close attention to the forward guidance at the February Inflation Report for signs the BoE is preparing markets for another rate hike soon.</p> </blockquote> <p>Daniel Vernazza, economist at UniCredit, is less hawkish on rates but admits today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data could make a rise this year more likely:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We continue to expect the MPC will keep the stance of monetary policy on hold this year and only hike again once Brexit-related uncertainty is resolved, probably in 2Q19.</p> <p>However, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market release, together with the likelihood of a robust 4Q17 GDP report due to be published on Friday, stronger global growth, and some resolution of Brexit-related uncertainty, increases the risks that the MPC already delivers another 25bp hike later this year.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full story on the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK data:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/24/uk-employment-level-hits-joint-highest-since-1971\">UK employment level hits joint highest since 1971</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>NF</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T12:20:56.796Z\">at 12.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a687646e4b04cea3dc7ab1b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T12:08:05.318Z\">12.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of the attractions of Davos for the global elite is that they can squeeze in more meetings with fellow leader than in the average month.</p> <p>IMF chief Christine Lagarde has been showing the way; offering support to Lebanon over its refugee crisis and giving Portugal a thumbs-up too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Lagarde/status/956134151454896128\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Very please to meet in Davos with Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prime Minister Antonio Costa and congratulated Finance Minister Mario Centeno on his election as President of Eurogroup.

However, vacancies are also at an all-time high, revealing difficulties for employers in some economic sectors, including those with a high proportion of migrant employees facing the challenges of Brexit.</p> <p>This reflects what employers who have engaged in our Brexit research say they are experiencing on the ground \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that they are losing some EU migrants and finding it more difficult to recruit both British and EU workers. The sectors with high vacancy rates include those with relatively high proportions of migrant employees, including from the EU.

Strong employment numbers were just the nudge the pound needed to get over $1.41, where it is just about holding at present.</p> <p>After showing signs of a slowdown, there was a strong bounce back in employment in December. Wage growth ex-bonuses rose by 2.4% compared to 2.3% in the quarter to October. Although below inflation at the present there are signs that tentatively rising wage growth will converge with falling inflation in the coming months. Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery will only aid that process and is a reason to be more bullish on the UK economy and sterling. Generally speaking we are also seeing less chance of the cliff-edge exit with the tone of Brexit negotiations more constructive since December following the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement to financial terms.</p> <p>But for all the chatter about Brexit and UK unemployment numbers, this is very much a soft dollar story. The dollar index has given up the 90 handle and we have the dollar below 110 against the yen for the first time since September and the euro has broken to a fresh three-year high.</p> <p>The pound is now well bid above its 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages and with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blast above $1.41 seems set to consolidate above $1.40. There is not a huge amount of resistance on the upside for cable. The 50% retracement of the move from $1.71 to $1.19 is at $1.4590. Then we have the $1.4770 May 3rd 2016 high before the all-important $1.5000 level comes back into play. But these seem a long way off and depend entirely on dollar weakness to be sustained.</p> <p>For that we will look to Davos and what president Trump says with regards to trade. Concerns about trade wars \u00e2\u20ac\u201c put on the back burner last year as the administration battled with Obamacare and tax reform \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have resurfaced. Tariffs on washing machines and solar cells may only be the start, while there are ongoing worries about Nafta. Trade concerns are trumping the Trump tax policy as far as the dollar is concerned. And the focus on the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide seems to be dampening the mood generally in equity markets.</p> <p>Nevertheless, dollar softness may well be overdone and shorts could be squeezed when GDP figures for the fourth quarter are released, which are likely to confirm yet more acceleration in growth in the US and could see markets bet on a faster pace of tightening by the Fed than currently priced in.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>NF</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T10:49:29.092Z\">at 10.49am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a685ea7e4b04cea3dc7a9f5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T10:30:30.358Z\">10.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Real wages are still being squeezed in the UK according to the latest data, with pay growth including bonuses steady at 2.5% and despite an increase from 2.3% to 2.4% when bonuses are excluded. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>With pay growing at 2.5% [including bonuses] and inflation running at 3.0%, the squeeze on real wages continues for the ninth consecutive month. But with inflation seemingly set to fall back towards the 2% target, this looks like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll come to an end in the next few months. We should remember, however, that the only true driver of real pay growth and rising living standards is productivity growth.

                "bodyText":"Some late news: Seven Latin American countries are to benefit from a new anti-malaria initiative unveiled in Davos by the philanthropist Bill Gates and the Inter-American development bank. The Regional Malaria Elimination Initiative is expected to deliver more than $180mn to fight the disease in Belize, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. Money from the Gates Foundation, the IDB and the Carlos Slim totalling more than $80bn is expected to leverage in a further $100mn from the countries affected. Gates said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This collaboration will build on each of the partners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 unique capabilities and expertise to cover financial and technical gaps in the region, demonstrating that we can eliminate malaria today using current tools. It will also help strengthen health systems in the region, positioning countries for success against other high-priority vector-borne diseases such as Zika, dengue and Chikungunya.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More Macron reaction: I think the social contract has to involve all the stakeholders. We have to fight against strategy of free riding. A new global and shared framework should be based on co-operation and multilateralism..We have a tremendous responsibility.. The answer is partly here in this room. In a way our new frontier is our commitment. If we commit ourselves to make our current globalisation more fair..so we can converge and build a new globalisation. We have a question. Do we decide to do it or no? And this is now? (Applause as he ends) We are committed to fighting against terrorism. We need to continue to work with our partners at military and diplomatic levels... Sometimes we thought getting rid of a tyrant we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like would get what we wanted... But we have to win the war against terrorism and create conditions for a durable peace...We need to provide a development and education policy. I think we have to reconnect with a framework which provides for the common good. Sustainable development, health, human rights - these can never be renounced, and we have to spell them out and regulate them in a common manner. I hope private sector will come to our country to create jobs.. but I have to explain to people [globalisation] is good for them. Otherwise there will be nationalists, extremism. We need to establish a new global contract, unless everyone understands they have a part to play it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. The new global contract has three duties: the right to invest, share and protect. [On investment} one area we are not doing enough in is education, we have 750m adults who do not have basic literacy skills, we have to invest in education, the education of girls in particular. If we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t invest there will be not equality. It is important all the countries here commit to this [investment in education globally]. The duty to share: there is a crisis of contemporary capitalism. It has become a capitalism of superstars, spreading of value added is not equitable. We have to establish mechanisms to share value added more equitably... We also need to speak about gender equality. In France we are launching initiatives [for more visibility], I welcome the commitments from Justin Trudeau. If we want to share value better, we need a more co-ordinated tax approach at a global level. There should not be a race to the bottom. We need a strategy that avoids the maximisation strategies of some companies. It is a moral issue. We need to renounce unbridled tax optimisation. Plus how can you have a tax on digital activities. We all want these big international companies in their country, but there is an unfair model [if they pay low taxes when national companies do]. Disruption from digital businesses will destroy millions of jobs, and if those companies do not help finance retraining of people affected, how can I explain that [to those people] I am in favour of IMF being given mandate to survey whole financial system, especially those areas which escape regulation. Cryptocurrencies, shadow banking etc, are not being looked at by IMF, so we have to have a discussion. At what point are we going to stop innovation. To say artificial intelligence, this is a red line. We need to have a framework of international co-operation to promote technology, but also to decide principles which should be decided by government not private companies. Finally, protection, against terrorism, and financial protection. Need government and international co-operation for this. We need to have a discussion in G20, that there must be a monitoring of all those bodies which can promote social cohesion. In terms of climate protection, we have committed to many things but not up to the commitments. China has done an enormous amount of work here. India is also very important. But we now need to follow through and respect Paris agreement. Need a floor price for CO2, if not we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be credible. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Silk Road has to be a green road. I hope by 2020 we will have an environmental pact which is legally binding. The private sector must also live up to its commitments. Finally it is the financial system which has to accompany this with green financing. In EU and eurozone we need to have a way of having a green financial sector. Macron, who has been mostly been speaking in English, reverts to French. Europe should find a new ambition. Economic growth is not an end in itself. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made a mistake saying things will get better because we have growth. The search for growth has sometimes made us forget what it takes to achieve it. Some people thought that if we had growth, all problems will be solved. Not the case, because this growth is less equitable. You cannot have a one stop solution. You have to co-ordinate positions. Everything is being fragmented. We have societies made up of nomads. There are more and more people who think getting out of globalisation is the right option. We have a major challenge, not just for governments. A lot of governments think you have to be more nationalist. States have often gone in wrong direction because we undermined internationalism. For many years we have been going in the wrong direction. In terms of trade we are moving back to strategies of non-co-operation, undoing what globalisation has been able to achieve. For climate change we have not be able to achieve what we have said we would achieve. And we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t established an organisation at a world level which looks at artificial intelligence and automation. We allow private companies to control this. We have never had a multilateral approach to this. We are encouraging technological change..and we are in danger of living in a Darwinian world. My message is France is back. We will never have French success without European success. Angela Merkel expressed her vision and we worked very closely in that direction. The core strategy is: we have to fix some short term measures. But we have to also redesign a ten year strategy for Europe. Europe has a role to play vis a vis China and the US. If we want to avoid fragmentation of the world, we need a stronger Europe. We have to have a 10 year strategy to make Europe a green, scientific and political power. We need more ambition to have a more united Europe. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not naive, we will not build something that ambition at 27. But we have to change our methodology, not wait for all the people round the table to go forward, Those who do not want to move forward should not block the most ambitious people in the room. This will make our eurozone much stronger, fairer. At the end of this year, we hope for a common strategy for ten years. First, its about human capital. Our world has changed. We need less arms and more brains. People have to be trained in an efficient way. We began to reform our education system, we need better access to university. We invest 5% of GDP in education, we will reform apprenticeships. We will invest \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn in education and retraining over five years. We will make innovation the centrepiece of the economy. Reform fiscal mechanisms, create a new \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10bn fund for disruptive technologies. The second pillar of this reform is investment and capital. We need more equity to finance risk and big innovations. We passed reforms to reallocate our savings in this direction. By decreasing corporate taxes, big reform on capital gain. We have reinforced France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attractiveness. The third pillar is acceleration and flexibility. You need more flexible structures and rules to help different companies to change business model and readapt. The idea is to realign France on Germany and northern Europe. Rules much more adapted to business environment, that is a big change and it makes us much more competitive. Fourth pillar - make France a model in fight against climate change. That is a huge advantage in terms of attractiveness and competitiveness. Talent will come where it is good to live. We can create a lot of jobs with such a strategy. We passed reforms for this green strategy. Close coal fired power stations by 2021 (Applause). Fifth pillar of domestic strategy is cultural change. A preference for red tape cuts and cutting complexities. We simplify and streamline processes, and simplify bureaucracy. During last six months we reduced like crazy the number of regulations. We have to guarantee stability for people. We passed all these measures, voted these five year strategy on taxes. Visibility is the strategy and will not change, that is my commitment. It is also about risk. In France it was forbidden to fail, and forbidden to succeed. Now it should be more easy to fail, take risk, but allow people to come back and try something else. When you take risk, you need reward, and you need to reduce the cost of failure. France is a nation of entrepreneures, ao it was a mistake in France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history. We have taken action but let us not be naive. Globalisation is going through a challenge. I came here to make a call for action, to all and every one of us. France has been affected by change and globalisation. A few months ago I had to fight with a nationalist party, since there was a lack of understanding about globalisation in my country. Why, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deliver, results were poor. Some people proposed getting out of globalisation as a solution. I have the responsibility to build a France that is prosperous and open, but also standing for those left behind. I have to make France more competitive to finance a fair system. Macron says we are talking about globalisation in a place cut off from the rest of the world by snow. It is hard here to believe in global warming, and you didnt invite anyone sceptical of global warming this year. Applause. A video clip has emerged of David Cameron, former UK PM, describing Brexit as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a mistake, not a disaster\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: French president Emmanuel Macron is next up at Davos. Today is being billed as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moment of truth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by Greek government officials as prime minister Alexis Tsipras meets his Macedonian counterpart in Davos. A solution to the seemingly unsolvable dispute between Greece and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia could be solved in Davos. That, at least, is what both sides are hoping as Tsipras and his Macedonian counterpart Zoran Zaev meet this afternoon. The bilateral meeting takes the quest for a settlement a notch up the diplomatic scale and is being seen as possibly groundbreaking. The two Balkan neighbours have been at odds over the former republic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name for the past 25 years with Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 asserting that exclusive use of the nomenclature \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Macedonia\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd conceals territorial ambitions against its own eponymous region of Macedonia. Around 100,000 demonstrators protested over the issue in the northern Greek capital of Thessaloniki on Sunday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It will be a moment of truth,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a senior Greek official adding that it would allow Athens to see how far Skopje was willing to compromise on the issue. More on the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current buoyancy, and more to the point, the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The pound went on a tear this Wednesday, rocketing higher against the euro and dollar to mark the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best session for more than a month. Cable shot up a remarkable 1.6% as the day progressed, clearing not only $1.41 but $1.42 in one fell swoop. Though the UK jobs report was decent, the highlight being another minor fall in unemployment, the thrust of cable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth is coming from the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bruised and battered start to 2018. Despite ostensibly having the end of the US government shutdown to cheer about the dollar found little room for positivity this Wednesday, almost solely due to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos. At a press conference Mnuchin argued that a weaker dollar was better for the US economy for trade reasons, a comment that was tantamount to kicking an already very sickly dog. Combine that lack of policy support with a weaker than forecast US flash services PMI and a disappointing existing home sales number and the greenback gave up the ghost as the bell rang on Wall Street, plunging to a variety of fresh lows as it matched its sharp decline against the pound with a 0.8% drop against the dollar and a 1% slide against the yen. Of course these currency movements had major ramifications for the global indices. The Dow Jones was overjoyed at the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest defeat, jumping 160 points to soar to a brand spanking new record peak of 26375. The European markets, on the other hand, shrank in the face of the pound and the euro. With sterling not only destroying the dollar but rising 0.8% against the euro the FTSE took the brunt of the blows, falling to a 3 week low after dropping 0.7%. The DAX and CAC, meanwhile, both slipped 0.3%, despite the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3 year high-hitting gains against the dollar being tempered by its losses against sterling. More US data, and a weak housing market report for December. Existing home sales fell by 3.6% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.57m units, worse than the 2.2% decline which had been expected by analysts. The November figure was revised down from 5.81m to 5.7m units. The December fall came after three months of gains, and the National Association of Realtors attributed the decline to a shortage of houses at the lower end of the market. But for the year as a whole, sales rose 1.1% making it the best performance in eleven years. NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said: Existing sales concluded the year on a softer note, but they were guided higher these last 12 months by a multi-year streak of exceptional job growth, which ignited buyer demand. At the same time, market conditions were far from perfect. New listings struggled to keep up with what was sold very quickly, and buying became less affordable in a large swath of the country. These two factors ultimately muted what should have been a stronger sales pace. NF We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had the initial January PMI numbers for January for the US, and unlike Europe it is manufacturing which is outperforming, rather than the service sector. The IHS Markit manufacturing PMI has climbed from 55.1 in December to 55.5, while the services PMI slipped from 53.7 to 53.3. The composite index edged down from 54.1 to 53.8. Despite the dips, all the indices were above 50, showing expansion rather than contraction. IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson, said: January saw an encouraging start to the year for the US economy. Business activity across the manufacturing and service sectors continued to expand, driving further job gains as companies expanded capacity. Manufacturing is faring especially well, in part thanks to the weaker dollar, providing an important spur to the economy at the start of the year. Although the overall pace of economic growth signalled by the surveys waned to an eight-month low, the forward-looking indicators suggest the slowdown will prove transitory. In particular, business optimism about the year ahead improved markedly and inflows of new orders hit a five-month high. Growth should therefore pick up again in coming months. Inflationary pressures meanwhile kicked higher, with January seeing the second-largest monthly increase in input costs since 2015. Higher oil prices were widely reported but, more generally, stronger demand is also helping companies push through price hikes. NF US markets have hit new records in early trading, helped by reasonable results from a number of major companies and the continuing weakness of the dollar. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a high of 26,344, up more than 0.4%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.25% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.19%. NF A quick look at the pound versus the dollar and the euro since the EU eferendum, courtesy of the Press Association, and it is quite a contrast: NF Returning to the dangers of populism, Angela Merkel warns of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpoisonous mix\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 created if people feel they are getting an unfair deal. She warns against descending into stereotypes, saying: When you say Americans are protectionist by nature, Germans are tight-fisted by nature, you are generalising. The next thing is Muslims are like this, Christians are like that. If you not respect each person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s individuality, and already have your pre-conceived notion before you even talk to them, that is the very basis of populism. We want to have a good partnership with Britain in the future, Merkel continues. Access to the single market is contingent on the freedoms, including freedom of movement. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in their hands how close they want the partnership to be. We are prepared to be open-minded about this partnership. Angela Merkel now turns to the digital revolution, warning of the social damage that it could cause. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not enough to just convince 20% or 30% of the population of the benefits of the digital age. Policymakers need to help people who will otherwise be left behind, she says. The chancellor repeats her earlier point that we must avoid making the mistakes of the 20th century again. The new digital economy creates good opportunities, Merkel says, but it also creates \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enormous confusion, and people feel left behind\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We must create a true social market economy as we say in Germany in this digital age. Merkel ends with a request - keep your fingers crossed for us getting into government as soon as possible. Are you listening, Donald? Turning to Brexit, Angela Merkel says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave the European Union is regrettable. But on the upside, it has given Europe \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the courage to move forwards\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She also name checks France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new(ish) leader, Emmanuel Macron, saying his victory last spring has given a new impetus to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reform drive. Merkel is making some important points about Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in the world: Angela Merkel warns that populism is on the rise, with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153polarising state of affairs in many countries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The German chancellor cites the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disruptive changes of technology\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is shaking up society and worrying people. There is also polarisation in Germany for the first time in decades, Merkel continues - following the eurozone crisis, and challenge of migration. Merkel reminds us that she is still holding talks to form a new government (with the social democratic party). But she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certain that Germany wants to make a contribution to solving the problems of the world. Shutting ourselves off from the rest of the world will not help she says, adding: Protectionism is not the proper answer. Next up: German chancellor Angela Merkel take the stage. She reminds delegates that 2018 marks the 100th anniversary of the end of the first world war. The political actors a century ago \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsleepwalked\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 into a crisis, Merkel says. We must ask ourselves...have we learned the lessons of history, Merkel continued. And she suggests we have not, declaring: This generation born after the second world war will have to prove they have learned the lessons of history. That means remaining committed to multilateralism, working together to solve problems, Merkel continues. Taking questions, Italian PM Paulo Gentiloni says that the issue of migration had a big influence on the Brexit vote. Italy is sticking to its principles, though, he says - saving the lives of those who try to get to Europe, and refusing to close its ports to those who cross the sea. Gentiloni says: This is one of the more costly political decisions you can take in these times. but this is the Italian decision, full stop. And finally, Donald Trump speaks to Davos in two days time - what is your message to him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Welcome to Davos\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Gentiloni wisecracks. But he then makes a serious point - that there is a limit to how far any one country can push things within the current framework. Yes you can defend and protect your citizens, your workers, your companies, but we live in a framework of trade agreements, free trade, international rules, multilateral decisions, and we have to keep this system running. Turning to new technology, Gentiloni says that digital innovation is threatening the quantity and quality of available jobs. We must not give in to the idea of a world destined to be split between a cosmopolitan digital elite and an army of precarious and underpaid local workers. And on Europe, the Italian PM says that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perfect storm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd caused by the Brexit vote, the economic crisis and unchecked migration is over. The EU now has an opportunity to relaunch itself. Gentiloni says firmly: These years are now behind our back. Those who have bet on a final crisis of the European Union have clearly lost. Italy is doing its bit to help with the migration crisis, Paulo Gentiloni says, saying that Italian investment is helping the African economy. The Italian PM then reminds his audience that Italy has an election in 40 days - he hopes that populist forces will not prevail [unfortunately for Gentiloni, his Democratic party is lagging in the polls]. Populism, Gentiloni says, frequently gives the wrong answers to the right questions. Politicians must not ignore the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeep causes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of discontent among their citizens, he says There are still unacceptably large parts of our populations who feel unsatisfied with their conditions and worried about the future. The damage caused by the great recession has still not been mended, Gentiloni continues. Economic growth is not reducing inequalities, but in many countries including Italy they are still widening, even if economic growth is there. They are reaching even more intolerable levels. Italian PM Paulo Gentiloni is on his feet - telling Davos that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is improving. Gentiloni says: In the last two years, our economy is back to growth, and now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s picking up speed. One year ago, the IMF forecast that we would only grow by 0.7% in 2017. Actual growth in 2017, according to the IMF, was 1.6%. He adds: Exports rose by 9.7% between November 2016 and 2017. Employment is up by one million units, to a 40-year high. Gentiloni says his government is doing its best to improve the business conditions, reform the labour market, raise skills and cut bureaucracy. This reforming effort must continue, and will continue, while our public debt must decrease at a steady and sustainable pace. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a buzz in the main Davos congress hall, as delegates prepare to hear from Italian prime minister Paulo Gentiloni, and then German chancellor Angela Merkel. Jack Ma has also warned Davos that technology could trigger a third world war, unless leaders work together to mitigate its disruptive effects. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The first technology revolution caused the First World War and the second technology revolution caused the Second World War - and now we have the third. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there is a Third World War I think that should be a war against disease, pollution and poverty, not a war against ourselves. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t align together , human beings are going to fight each other, because each technology revolution makes the world unbalanced.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hopes of a showdown between Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker at Davos tomorrow have been dashed. The EC president has cancelled his visit after contracting stomach flu, so he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be giving his scheduled speech tomorrow. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another quote from Alibaba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jack Ma, urging policymakers not to trigger a trade war: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Globalization is a growing pain. It is so easy to launch a trade war but it is so difficult to stop a trade war and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m scared and concerned.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sterling is climbing higher again, now up more than 1% at $1.4152. Apart from the weak dollar, one of the reasons for the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength at the moment is the prospect of further UK interest rate rises, hence a 0.7% gain against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1464. The stronger than expected employment and wage growth numbers only add to that expectation. Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg, says: While the Bank of England had initially responded to the risks to demand from the Brexit vote by easing its policy in August 2016, it became increasingly data dependent over the course of 2017, eventually hiking its main policy rate by 25bp in November \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first hike in a decade. This came as a bit of a surprise for markets that seemed to be focusing more on downside risks to demand from Brexit than the signs of growing underlying inflationary pressure. According to market pricing, the BoE is set to hike the bank rate once again towards the end of the year. In our view, this seems still seems inconsistent with the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data dependant approach and outlook for GDP and wage growth. Economic growth is likely to remain robust, partly helped by the strong global backdrop. Meanwhile, the BoE expects the unemployment rate to remain below its estimate of full employment (4.5% unemployment) throughout its forecast. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the BoE to justify its ultra-accommodative policy stance. We therefore look for two hikes in the Bank Rate in 2018, one in Q2 and one in Q4, followed by one in Q3 2019. Even with a modest continued tightening in which the Bank Rate increased to 1.25% by the end of 2019, UK monetary policy would remain highly accommodative. We will be paying close attention to the forward guidance at the February Inflation Report for signs the BoE is preparing markets for another rate hike soon. Daniel Vernazza, economist at UniCredit, is less hawkish on rates but admits today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data could make a rise this year more likely: We continue to expect the MPC will keep the stance of monetary policy on hold this year and only hike again once Brexit-related uncertainty is resolved, probably in 2Q19. However, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market release, together with the likelihood of a robust 4Q17 GDP report due to be published on Friday, stronger global growth, and some resolution of Brexit-related uncertainty, increases the risks that the MPC already delivers another 25bp hike later this year. Meanwhile here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full story on the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK data: NF One of the attractions of Davos for the global elite is that they can squeeze in more meetings with fellow leader than in the average month. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has been showing the way; offering support to Lebanon over its refugee crisis and giving Portugal a thumbs-up too. She even squeezed in a chat with cellist Yo-Yo Ma. E-commerce magnate Jack Ma has made a passionate plea to world leaders t Davos not to launch a trade war. Speaking on a panel, the head of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alibaba says trade should be a solution to the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems. If you used it as a weapon, young people and businesses will suffer most. Ma says: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThey will be killed, just like when you bomb somewhere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. An important view, given the tensions between China and the US - and Wilbur Ross\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comment about America \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccoming to the ramparts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Back in Davos, the World Economic Forum have launched a new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Global Centre for Cybersecurity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Based in Geneva, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meant to help build a safe and secure global cyberspace, and protect businesses and governments from online attacks. Interpol and BT are also involved. J\u00c3\u00bcrgen Stock, Secretary General of Interpol, says this partnership will address the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153global threat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of cybercrime. The pound has peaked at $1.4118 against the dollar, for the moment at least. But it is still up 0.7% so far today at $1.4097. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: A green-gilled greenback and a half decent UK jobs report made for a very strong Wednesday for the pound. Kicking the currency while it was down, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin claimed at a press conference in Davos that a weaker dollar is good for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcas it relates to trade and opportunities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This turned an already bad morning worse for the greenback, with the currency falling 0.4% against the euro, where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sunk to a fresh 3 and a bit year nadir, and 0.7% against both the yen and the pound. Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains against the dollar caused cable to flit about the $1.41 mark for the first time since the Brexit referendum result back in June 2016. The pound didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop there, however; it also rose 0.4% against the euro, lifting back to its best price in just shy of 7 weeks. The FTSE wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t best pleased with all this, dipping 0.2% as it continued to shed its early 2018 record-breaking momentum. The pound was aided by a UK jobs report that by and large didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ruffle any feathers. Wage growth came in unchanged at 2.5%, and rose to from 2.3% to 2.4% excluding bonuses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in terms of its relation to inflation, though real wages are still being squeezed there are signs that this should ease in the coming months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while unemployment fell by 3000 to 1.44 million (the unemployment rate didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually change, remaining steady at 4.3%). NF Back with the UK data. From Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon: Earlier, as well as the preliminary PMIs for France and Germany, there were also estimates for the eurozone as a whole. This showed the same pattern, with manufacturing slipping back in January and services rising. The eurozone manufacturing PMI dipped from 60.6 to 59.8 while services climbed from 56.6 to 57.6. The composite index rose from 58.1 to 58.6. Unicredit Bank economist Edoardo Campanella said: The eurozone starts 2018 with a bang, continuing to churn out solid economic figures. January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Composite PMI hit a near 12-year high, rising to 58.6 from 58.1 and pointing to annualized GDP growth of almost 4%. Economic activity further accelerated in the services sector to the fastest pace since August 2007, while it slowed down in the manufacturing industry \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after having recorded an all-time high last December. NF The UK jobs data today shows the difficulties employers are having filling vacancies, especially those companies which use a large number of EU migrant workers, says theNational Institute of Economic and Social Research. Associate research director Dr Heather Rolfe said: UK labour market statistics released today show employment in the 3 months up to November 2017 is at a record high, driven by an increase in full time employment. However, vacancies are also at an all-time high, revealing difficulties for employers in some economic sectors, including those with a high proportion of migrant employees facing the challenges of Brexit. This reflects what employers who have engaged in our Brexit research say they are experiencing on the ground \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that they are losing some EU migrants and finding it more difficult to recruit both British and EU workers. The sectors with high vacancy rates include those with relatively high proportions of migrant employees, including from the EU. Accommodation and food services, where one in six workers are EU migrants is one such sector. The challenges of attracting and retaining workers are likely to increase with prolonged uncertainty about the terms of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the EU. NF Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: Sterling breached $1.41 to record another post-Brexit high as a renewed bout of dollar softness and some better-than-expected employment numbers fuelled bids. Strong employment numbers were just the nudge the pound needed to get over $1.41, where it is just about holding at present. After showing signs of a slowdown, there was a strong bounce back in employment in December. Wage growth ex-bonuses rose by 2.4% compared to 2.3% in the quarter to October. Although below inflation at the present there are signs that tentatively rising wage growth will converge with falling inflation in the coming months. Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery will only aid that process and is a reason to be more bullish on the UK economy and sterling. Generally speaking we are also seeing less chance of the cliff-edge exit with the tone of Brexit negotiations more constructive since December following the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement to financial terms. But for all the chatter about Brexit and UK unemployment numbers, this is very much a soft dollar story. The dollar index has given up the 90 handle and we have the dollar below 110 against the yen for the first time since September and the euro has broken to a fresh three-year high. The pound is now well bid above its 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages and with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blast above $1.41 seems set to consolidate above $1.40. There is not a huge amount of resistance on the upside for cable. The 50% retracement of the move from $1.71 to $1.19 is at $1.4590. Then we have the $1.4770 May 3rd 2016 high before the all-important $1.5000 level comes back into play. But these seem a long way off and depend entirely on dollar weakness to be sustained. For that we will look to Davos and what president Trump says with regards to trade. Concerns about trade wars \u00e2\u20ac\u201c put on the back burner last year as the administration battled with Obamacare and tax reform \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have resurfaced. Tariffs on washing machines and solar cells may only be the start, while there are ongoing worries about Nafta. Trade concerns are trumping the Trump tax policy as far as the dollar is concerned. And the focus on the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide seems to be dampening the mood generally in equity markets. Nevertheless, dollar softness may well be overdone and shorts could be squeezed when GDP figures for the fourth quarter are released, which are likely to confirm yet more acceleration in growth in the US and could see markets bet on a faster pace of tightening by the Fed than currently priced in. NF Real wages are still being squeezed in the UK according to the latest data, with pay growth including bonuses steady at 2.5% and despite an increase from 2.3% to 2.4% when bonuses are excluded. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: With pay growing at 2.5% [including bonuses] and inflation running at 3.0%, the squeeze on real wages continues for the ninth consecutive month. But with inflation seemingly set to fall back towards the 2% target, this looks like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll come to an end in the next few months. We should remember, however, that the only true driver of real pay growth and rising living standards is productivity growth. This is something the UK has struggled with since the financial crisis, and as yet nobody seems to have solved the puzzle. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: While it is encouraging that regular earnings growth picked up slightly, subdued economic conditions are likely to weigh on wage growth over the next year. As a consequence, pay growth is likely to remain stubbornly below price growth over the near term, dampening consumer spending, a key driver of UK GDP growth. NF The president of Brazil, Michael Temer, is speaking now -- encouraging business leaders to provide fresh investment. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: The relentless rise in sterling, which has seen it jump over 3% in the last 10 days is looking durable. The good news for the economy is that more people are working with rising wages despite any uncertainty associated with leaving the European Union. Lord Jim O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neil looks vindicated so far in his belief that strong domestic and global growth will overcome Brexit headwinds. Matthew Brittain, investment analyst at wealth manager Sanlam UK, said: The real worry [for the UK economy] is centred around the consumer where wages have been increasing at a lower rate than inflation (ie falling in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd terms). So another bright spot in this release is that weekly earnings ticked up from 2.3 to 2.4% versus a year ago, which is still lower than inflation (3%) but at least the gap is steadily being closed Since the data makes it slightly more likely that the Bank of England will increase interest rates later on in the year the immediate reaction is a rise in sterling to \u00c2\u00a31.41 with bonds and equities both under a little pressure. NF Sterling has climbed above $1.41 against the dollar after the better than expected UK unemployment and wages data. It is up 0.7%, a new peak since the Brexit vote but still below the $1.4878 level on the day of the referendum itself. Against the euro sterling is up 0.3% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1416. The pound is benefitting from the signs of a stronger economy, and growing hopes that a Brexit deal can be reached. It is also being helped by the weakness of the dollar, which has fallen even more after the comments from US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin at Davos. The US currency has been under pressure since the tax cuts announcement, with fears the reforms would push the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge deficit even higher. News of trade sanctions against South Korea and China have not helped, prompting fears of retaliation. Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com, said: Sterling has bounced back in fine style, particularly against the dollar where it has climbed above $1.40 for the first time since the historic Brexit vote. Unemployment continues to fall, while there are signs that wages are finally growing, with employees willing to take more risks to ask for a pay rise, or even consider moving jobs. Although nothing has been decided yet, the general consensus is that the final version of Brexit could be softer than previously thought, which can only be good for the UK economy as a whole. NF Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details from former UK PM Tony Blair at Davos (speaking on Bloomberg TV) Asked whether there was any other way to avoid Brexit apart from having a second referendum, Blair said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You could have a general election. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we do go through with Brexit - and I hope we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a complete change and we will have to fashion a new future for the country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said that when people have clarity on what the Brexit deal might look like - and he suspects it will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hotch potch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it will be very difficult to persuade people that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than what we have now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Q: What is he expecting from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Friday? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what to expect. For me the issue is not responding to what Donald Trump has just said, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the reasons that brought him to power ... the cultural and economic alienation ... this is the root of the problem that needs to be addressed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd UK employment rose unexpectedly in the three months to November, while wages rose by a higher than forecast 2.4%, excluding bonuses. The number of people in work rose by 102,000 in the quarter, said the Office for National Statistics, the biggest increase since the three months to July. Analysts had expected a fall of 13,000. The unemployment rate was steady at a four decade low of 4.3%. As for wages, the 2.4% figure was up from 2.3% in the three months to October and better than the forecasts of a flat reading. With inflation slipping back from 3.1% to 3% in November, the wage gap has edged lower. Total pay growth including bonuses was steady at 2.5%, as forecast. NF While the German and French leaders are at Davos, there is some reasonable data from both countries. The latest manufacturing PMIs for the two have come in below expectations but the service sector has outperformed. For France the preliminary manufacturing PMI for January came in at 58.1, down from 58.8. The services PMI rose from 59.1 to 59.3, with the composite PMI up from 59.6 to 59.7. In Germany the manufacturing index fell from 63.3 to 61.2, the services rose from 55.8 to 57 but the composite slipped from 58.9 to 58.8 NF The US dollar is sliding like an ill-prepared delegate on the streets of Davos, thanks to Stephen Mnuchin. The Treasury secretary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comment about not being worried about the weak dollar has sparked another wave of selling, sending the greenback to a fresh three-year low. Former chancellor George Osborne says the vote for Brexit was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an alliance of the insulated and the insecure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In a discussion on the causes of Brexit and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory Osborne said the insulated were elderly voters who owned their homes outright but were anxious about the pace of change while the insecure were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on the margins of employment and looking for something to address their grievances.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That was a classic good-cop/bad cop performance from Stephen Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross at Davos this morning. Mnuchin tried to calm concerns ahead of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit, by insisting that America First wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t incompatible with working with other countries. But Ross was more combative, insisting that America had been treated badly by other nations in the past, and that Trump is simply levelling the score. Ross comments about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153US troops coming to the ramparts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and other countries talking about free trade but actually being protectionist, are a hint about how the US will behave behind the scenes at the World Economic Forum this week. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction: Final question -- will the US be reassuring delegates at Davos that it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t creating a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrace to the bottom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on tax? Stephen Mnuchin replies that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always been clear with fellow finance ministers that this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s objective. This was about creating a comparable system for US companies to compete fairly, and we see that working. Q: What retaliations do you think China might take if the US imposes new tariffs? Every time you take a trade action, there is the possibility of the other side taking a trade action in retaliation, Wilbur Ross replies. To the degree that this happens, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a question about what the US would do next, Ross continues. Boom! Asked about the dangers of a trade war, US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross argues that it has been underway for some time. The difference is that the US troops are now coming to the ramparts. Stephen Mnuchin denies that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clash between America being \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcopen for business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic goals. This is about an America First agenda, but America First does mean working with the rest of the world. President Trump is looking out for US workers and US interest, just as he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect other world leaders to do, Mnuchin adds. Q: How concerned are you about the weakness of the US dollar? The dollar is one of the most liquid markets. Where it is in the short term is not a concern at all, says Mnuchin. A weaker US dollar is good for trade, he continues. And in the long term, the strength of the US dollar is a sign of the strength of the US economy. Q: Have you any evidence that your tax reforms are boosting investment? The vote from the market is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpretty positive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Mnuchin replies. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen many companies come out and commit hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars, he says - citing Apple as an example. We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be happier. The response from US businesses has been even better than we expected. Q: How does the America First economic agenda match up to the World Economic Forum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goals? Our objective is to be here to interact with our counterparts. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very important for the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest economy, Mnuchin replies. Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross weighs in too, repeating that some of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading partners are protectionist, even if they talk about free trade. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that adhering to the rules is protectionist. We think in fact it is essential to having markets operate properly, to have people play by the rules. Q: Are you worried that China might cut its holdings of US government debt? Treasury secretary Mnuchin says that some of the reporting of this issue has been inaccurate. The market for US treasuries is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, he adds. Q: Is there a bubble in the United States financial markets? Mnuchin says that forums like Davos are never very good at predicting markets. What we see in the US markets is a reaction to the economic changes we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made, he suggests - but he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to comment on other markets. As we look at US economic growth against the rest of the world, US economic growth looks very good - and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good place to invest, he continues. Q: What do you think about Justin Trudeau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about NAFTA yesterday? We totally believe in full and free trade - anyone who wants to do it on a reciprocal basis are very welcome, Stephen Mnuchin replies. Q: What might you do next against China over protectionism? Wilbur Ross: There are a number of other actions pending. Reports have been drawn up for President Trump to consider (he references the aluminium market) There will be a very busy trade agenda in terms of those actions by the US, and there are the formal actions with relation to NAFTA, Ross adds. Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross speaks next, and rubbishes the idea that the US tax cuts are creating a new trade barrier This is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153funny concept\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Ross says: The US has been on an uncompetitive model before, but it is now on a very competitive one. Ross also touches on free trade -- and insists that any actions taken by America are in response to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inappropriate behaviour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading partners. Many countries are very good at the rhetoric of free trade, but actually practice protectionism. Stephen Mnuchin, the US Treasury secretary, has just arrived at a packed-out press briefing here at Davos. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accompanied by Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. Mnuchin begins by saying he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thrilled to be at Davos, with the largest US delegation to WEF ever. Obviously tax reforms and tax cuts were a major part of what we achieved in Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first year, Mnuchin says - which will bring \u00e2\u20ac\u0153literally trillions of dollars\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd back to the UK. We are committed to achieving a 3% growth target, Mnuchin continued. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just good for the US, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for the world economy too. Mnuchin declares: We are open for business, and we look forward to being here through the week. Former UK prime minister Tony Blair is in town! He just spoke to Bloomberg TV about the need for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153progressive centerism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More on that later... The boss of Lloyds of London has warned that the focus on dry economic measures such as GDP has helped to create the backlash that led to Brexit. Speaking to CNBC at the World Economic Forum, Inga Beale said policymakers need to think differently about how they measure the economy. Beale explained: I do remember, when we were going through the campaigning around Brexit, in the UK, we, as businesses, were talking about GDP. Most of the members of the public don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even know what that means, you know, they-, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t relate to them. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a definite feeling that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not being included, and they want to challenge the, you know, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcas is\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, at the moment. They really want to go out and say, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not happy with this status quo. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not hearing me. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not respecting me. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not included.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 And when we talk about GDP, that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel very inclusive for them. On Monday, the World Economic Forum did launch a new, more inclusive measure of economic performance that also tracked inequality and sustainability. Britain came just 21st. Sounds like Emmanuel Macron is only paying a flying visit.. Last night, around 2000 demonstrators in Zurich marched in protest at Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit to the World Economic Forum. Reuters reports that a small group even managed to demonstrate here in Davos: About 20 demonstrators broke through security to reach the Davos Congress Centre, holding banners and shouting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wipe out WEF\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before they were peacefully disbanded by police. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump is just one of the other people we disagree with. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been protesting every year now against the World Economic Forum and if Trump comes or not we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care. Trump is just, maybe he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just the best symbol of this world,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd protester Alex Hedinger told Reuters TV in Davos. More here. Now this is interesting.... Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin is going to give a briefing at Davos in around 30 minutes. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting is billed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are open for business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - perhaps an attempt to calm worries over President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s America First agenda.... Good morning. The second day of the World Economic is getting underway, with a strong European flavour. German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Emmanuel Macron and Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni are all due on the Davos main stage today - a chance to set the agenda before Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eagerly-awaited speech on Friday. But the Americans are already fighting for the spotlight. US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin is in town, and speaking to the press this morning (we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hopefully have more on that soon). Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s King Filipe, and the presidents of Brazil and Zimbabwe are also making appearances. Plus, Davos delegates will be discussing economic inequality (despite the obvious irony), slavery, and the opportunity and threats posed by technology. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even a footballer in town. Manchester United\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Juan Mata will be pushing his Common Goal charitable fund, which encourages sports stars to donate some of their massive salaries to good causes. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some of the events we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try to cover: 10am Davos (9am GMT): IMF chief Christine Lagarde on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Solving the Economic Generation Gap\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 10.20am Davos (9.20am GMT): Special Address by Michel Temer, President of Brazil 11.15am Davos (10.15am GMT): Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s King Felipe VI speaks 12.30pm Davos (11.30am GMT): Session on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcStabilizing the Mediterranean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with Italian PM Paolo Gentiloni and Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alexis Tsipras 2pm Davos (1pm GMT): Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa speaks 2.20pm Davos (1.20pm GMT): Special Address by Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany 3.30pm Davos (2.30pm GMT): Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai on AI and technology\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on society 4pm Davos (3pm GMT): A session on how to end slavery 5.30pm Davos (4.30pm GMT): Special Address by Emmanuel Macron, President of France 6pm Davos (5pm GMT): Manchester United\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Juan Mata talks about his Common Goal charitable work",

When someone says a good exchange rate is good, that is targeting exchange rate. That goes back to years ago before the [recent] terms of agreement were agreed.</p> \n  <p><em>Q:Why did you chooses September to end QE?

What level of concern was there today about a possible change in US policy [after US dollar comments]</em></p> \n  <p>Yes there was concern. It was broader than simply the exchange rate, but about broader state of international relations right now. If this leads to an unwarranted tightening of monetary policy we would have to think about our monetary policy strategy.</p> \n  <p>On communications, you see same thing in other jurisdictions. All the communiations since Dec have in common three characteristics. All based on commitment to objective of inflation target. None questioned the sequence whereby interest rates will stay at current levels well past end of asset buying programme. Well past was emphasised.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Some commentators factoring in an interest rate rise this year? At its current level does euro reflect fundamentals?</em></p> \n  <p>Based on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data I see very few chances at all that interest rates can be raised this year. On euro, we should ask is it produced by strength of economy, or by statements, or by monetary policy elsewhere. </p> \n  <p><em>Q: Another question on the G30 membership, could it compromise ECB?</em></p> \n  <p>Draghi repeats his previous answer, but adds ombudsman said there was no evidence the meeting influenced ECB, and ECB must have contacts with other financial participants.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Will differences of views within ECB deepen on exit strategy? At March meeting, will you give restatement of forward guidance.</em></p> \n  <p>I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the differences are as substantive as they were on other occasions. Some are a little more confident, if they live where inflation is rising. But there are not deep existential differences.</p> \n  <p>But there may be differences on when to say certain things, when to move forward. Markets have expectations on path, but also on dates, timelines. </p> \n  <p>In March we will assess how things stand at that point in time.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a69d9b0e4b00f225a1c7a86\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T15:06:10.845Z\">3.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">ECB: Draghi press conference</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Away from Davis briefly and back with the ECB, and president Mario Draghi said at his press conference that domestic price pressures remained muted, inflation has yet to show a convincing upward trend.</p> \n  <p>He said the recent foreign exchange volatility is a source of uncertainty. An ample degree of monetary stimulus is necessary.</p> \n  <p>On the economy, he said there could be positive growth surprise in the near term. But there were downside risks remain relating to global factors, forex.</p> \n  <p>More on inflation: he said it was expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our measures, rising wage growth etc</p> \n  <p>He then repeats his usual call to governments to do more: To reap the ull benefits from monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute. Structural reform in euro area countries needs to be stepped up . On fiscal policies, the case is strengthened for rebuilding fiscal buffers, especially in in countries where debt remains high. Strengthening EMU remains a priority.</p> \n  <p>Now for questions:</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What will have to happen for the exchange rate to be a problem for the inflation target? And you said in December you would revisit guidance [on the bond buying programme] early this year?</em></p> \n  <p>Draghi says there is confusion about the guidance comment, there was no difference between what was said at the December meeting and what Draghi said at the press conference. All that was said was there would have to be discussions about the need to have a discussion in the early part of the year. That discussion hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really started. We went through the events since October to now, trying to assess whether something has changed. There was not much of a change except the strengthening of the economy a little more than expected. By and large the risk to growth is balanced.</p> \n  <p>We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t declare victory. Price pressures are muted. Underlying inflation is showing little signs of upward movement. So we simply restated policy.</p> \n  <p>He said the commitment to the inflation target remained firmer than ever. Monetary policy will remain accommodative.</p> \n  <p>On exchange rates he said there were three reasons for volatility. The improvement in the economy, the heightened market sensitivity to perceived changes in our communication. Finally the use of language in discussion exchange rate developments that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed in October in Washington [an agreement between governments on exchange rate policy]</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a263a300171d6e4db1e16a9fb5d2f56b0fed19e9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a263a300171d6e4db1e16a9fb5d2f56b0fed19e9/27_0_750_450/500.jpg\" alt=\"newdraghi25\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Draghi at the press conference</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ECB</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p><em>Q:Dollar weakness is what you were probably referring to. It must not be helpful to hear a lower dollar is something [US officials] like. Are we heading to currency war scenario. Also, could you envisage ending QE programme in September.</em></p> \n  <p>We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t target exchange rates, they are important for growth and price stability. </p> \n  <p>Movements justified by strength of economy are a fact of natiure. Are there other movements caused by use of language, not parts of terms agreed. Whether that has an effect on our inflation path...inflation is our main concern. Too early to assess whether pass through has already taken place, and what will be extent.</p> \n  <p>Some are questioning the extent of pass through, but large exchange rate movements are bound to have an effect. In Washington - ministers and governments recognised excessive volatily or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse effects. [They agreed] we will refrain from competitive devaluations and will not target exchange rates for competitive purposes.</p> \n  <p>On second question, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any discussion today, but we never stop the programme abruptly.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Will you give up you membership of the G30, after ombudsman letter?</em></p> \n  <p>We received the letter from the ombudsman, we will respond in time. There is a procedure. We will assess the letter and the comments and respond.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: German pay negotiations. Could there be broad pay increases across eurozone economy following Germany?</em></p> \n  <p>We observe from a monetary policy angle, where we consider wage growth as a convincing sign of future inflation convergence to our objective. Whether it spreads, depends on conditions of labour market. Tight conditions in Germany, not so in other countries.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Are there financial stability risks from long term accommodative policy? </em></p> \n  <p>Vice president Vitor Constancio answers. No one can talk about asset price bubbles in euro area. We have overstretched valuations in some places for commercial real estate, high yield corporate bonds but nothing else.... We see prices in market are close to fair value. Same is true of housing prices. Fundamental values are in line with fundamental. Prices of houses increasing by 4%, between 2000 and 2006 they were up 7%. So no general situation of overvaluation in residential properties.</p> \n  <p>Some countries have also taken macroprudential policies to combat excesses.</p> \n  <p>The effect on banks of negative rates, taking into account all our policies, they have been favourable to their profitability which is still low but increasing. So negative rates have been absorbed by banking sector.</p> \n  <p>Draghi talks about fiscal buffers. Interest rates will at some point stop being so low. At that point all governments will want to have policy space, so budget consideration now when the time is good is favourable.</p> \n  <p><strong>NF</strong></p> \n  <p><em><br></em></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T15:13:52.990Z\">at 3.13pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a69eea8e4b0473d0bc103bd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T14:55:44.193Z\">2.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump: We love Britain</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve now got video footage of Theresa May and Donald Trump meeting.</strong></p> \n  <p>Trump says he and May have a mutual feeling of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcliking each other a lot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> \n  <p>He says there have been a false rumour out there, which he wants to rebut.</p> \n  <p>He tells May:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have great respect for everything you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing, and we love your country.

In Asia overnight it hit $1.4328, and although it has eased back from that, it is still up 0.11% so far today at $1.4255.</p> \n  <p>It is partly the expectation of an earlier than expected UK rate rise, given the recent strong data including Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment and wages figures. But of course there is also the weak dollar, hit recently by the expectation that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts would raise the already hefty US deficit. More immediately Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin told Davos the US wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worried about a flagging greenback. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Steven Mnuchin (US Treasury Secretary) went to Davos and said that a weaker dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcis good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He also pointed out that that he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t concerned by where it is in the short term and that in the longer term, its strength is a reflection of the strength of the US economy. In other words, he said very little really, but he said it under snow-plastered slopes and he was speaking to a market where dollar bulls have been under the cosh. A few more capitulated.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Against the euro the pound is pretty flat, down just 0.01% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1473 ahead of the latest European Central Bank meeting. But the euro is up against the dollar, 0.11% better at $1.2421.</p> \n  <p>The strength of the euro presents a problem for ECB president Mario Draghi. If he appears too bulllish at hinting at an end to the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE programme, the euro will appreciate even further. And that would keep a lid on inflation which is already below the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target. Equally, he cannot ignore the improving European economy. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets explains:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>With headline inflation remaining well below its 2% target rate at 1.4% and an economy that continues to show decent levels of economic activity the ECB is faced with having to navigate the minefield of guiding markets over the tightrope of communicating a credible timeline for stimulus reduction and interest rate policy, while trying to move CPI back to target against the difficulty of a rising currency. </p> \n   <p>Since the beginning of 2017 the euro has risen 18% against the US dollar and could well rise even further given yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks by US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin.<strong> </strong></p> \n   <p>Last week ECB vice president Vitor Constancio along with Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ewald Nowotny expressed concern about recent exchange rate movements. These concerns are likely to have increased in recent days which will make today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference by ECB President Mario Draghi much more interesting. He can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very well ignore the improving outlook but if he comes across as too bullish the euro could well be well on the way to the 1.3000 level by the end of this quarter.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Draghi would have to adopt a delicate approach and seek a strategy which stops the euro from firming further. The only way out of this situation for him would be to emphasize that the process of the rate hikes is not within sight yet. The market is expecting a rate hike in 2019 from the ECB, Draghi would have to pull a rabbit out of hat in order to convince the market that rate hike isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the agenda and market participants are getting ahead of themselves.</p> \n   <p>We do think that overly dovish statement by the European central bank is priced in the euro to some extent. If Draghi fails to convince the market or if he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound as dovish as the market is expecting, we think that the euro can take off from here. I think the risk to the downside for the euro are limited, it is the upside move which would be more exciting. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>NF</strong></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T09:35:55.305Z\">at 9.35am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a699fbae4b0473d0bc1006d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T09:14:06.963Z\">9.14am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b01f8328d4d3d09f9d57f014effee666cffec85\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b01f8328d4d3d09f9d57f014effee666cffec85/0_0_3500_2518/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swiss police officers on the roof of the Davos Congress Hotel this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"719\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swiss police officers on the roof of the Davos Congress Hotel this morning.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Balibouse/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a699c38e4b00f225a1c77eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T08:59:11.454Z\">8.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conservative Party has confirmed she will hold social media giants to account in Davos:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CCHQPress/status/956450450433339392\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theresa_may?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@theresa_may</a> will put pressure on social media companies to stop providing a platform for terror, extremism and child abuse.

                "bodyText":"A late PS, from the Associated Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pan Pylas on the moment Trump arrived at the World Economic Forum. One way to get President Donald Trump to stop and talk at the World Economic Forum: wield a book about him. On his way into the World Economic Forum, Trump stopped and talked for about ten seconds to one delegate who was brandishing a copy of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153God and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by Stephen E. Strang. He then proceeded to hold the book aloft in his left hand. Trump is the first U.S. president to attend the World Economic Forum since Bill Clinton back in 2000. Trump is holding a series of meetings and is due to deliver a speech on Friday in which he will argue that what is good for the U.S. economy is beneficial for the global economy. And finally, readers will be keen to know that Donald Trump is probably tucked up in bed. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the final dispatch: Motorcade arrived at the Intercontinental at 9:23. Pool did not see POTUS get out. He will sleep here tonight. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all from us until tomorrow! Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some colour from Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dinner with business leaders, from the White House press pack: President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes narrowed, as he looked a bit tired by the jetlag and long trip. But he seemed to enjoy the camaraderie with businessmen, joking with them about their success and lofty responsibilities, and nodding in agreement as they spoke about their large manufacturing capacity and thousands of US-based employees. Among the topics discussed: Kanye West\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in designing Adidas shoes, Mack Trucks made by Volvo, Nestl\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-chocolate business portfolio. Among Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s asides: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When he says he works for Siemens, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the president of Siemens!...Wow, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big!....Good luck with the G.E. purchase.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump spoke about the thriving American economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c crediting his tax policies, deregulation and his role as a cheerleader for American business. Soros then claims the bitcoin price will be propped by up by dictators, who use it to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuild their nest eggs abroad\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Q: As a former currency trader (who beat the Bank of England on Black Wednesday) what do you think of cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin is not a currency, Soros replies. A currency is supposed to be a stable store of value, and a currency that can fluctuate 25% in a day can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be used to pay wages It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a speculation, based on a misunderstanding. Soros suggest the EU should help Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy develop, if it wants to address the migration crisis. Onto questions. Q: What should be done to tackle the technology giants? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very complicated issue, Soros replies. It requires the full-time attention of those who formulate and enforce new laws. I put my faith in them, especially commissioner Vestigar who has done so much to enforce the laws - and made an award against Google. Q: If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like social media companies, why do you buy shares in them? calls out a diner from the back of the room. Soros doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reply (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure he heard). Instead he takes a question about migration, saying he cares about refugees because he was one himself; he came to Britain and was better treated than refugees arriving in Europe today. Another punchy quote from Soros: On Europe, Soros suggests that a multi-speed, multi-track approach would be more successful. This would allow Britain to rejoin the EU in the future without having to commit to joining the euro, explained Soros (who hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given up hope that Brexit won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen). George Soros then turns his guns at the technology sector. In a blistering attack, he accuses social media companies of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deliberately engineering addiction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153particularly harmful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for adolescents. He accuses them of inducing customers to give up their autonomy too. Soros says there are similarities between internet platforms and gambling platforms - pointing out that casinos have developed techniques to hook customers so they keep gambling even when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve run out of money. But... while tech giants may think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re masters of the universe, they are actually just slaves to preserving their dominant position Soros continues. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a matter of time before the monopoly of the US IT giants is broken, he declares: Davos is a good place to announce that their days are numbered. Regulation and taxation will be their undoing. I see Trump as a purely temporary phenomenon which will disappear in 2020, or earlier, Soros says - winning a laugh from his audience as they tuck into their chicken, potatoes and spinach. Soros adds that he expects a Democratic landslide in 2018. America must recognise the reality that North Korea has become a nuclear power, Soros continues. There is no military action that can prevent what has already happened. The only sensible strategy is to accept reality\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.and come to terms with North Koreas as a nuclear power. That means working with China to find a solution. Soros says that the survival of our whole civilisation is at stake, due to the rise of Kim Jong Un in North Korea and Donald Trump in the United States. They both seem to be willing to risk a nuclear war to keep themselves in power. At another dinner in Davos, billionaire businessman-turned-philanthopist George Soros is giving his views on the state of the world. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that open societies are in crisis, with various forms of dictatorship on the rise - such as Vladimir Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Russia. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the United States, President Trump would like to establish a mafia state, but can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Soros continues, because America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s institutions, constitution and its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vibrant civil society\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow it. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the prospect of Donald Trump visiting the UK later this year: UK government officials have been updating the British press about Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Donald Trump this afternoon, shortly after he arrived at WEF (and brought it to a standstill). Mark Knoller, CBS News White House Correspondent, has details of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dinner with European business chiefs: Donald Trump is now sitting down for diner with the bosses of some of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest companies. Mark Tucker, the chairman of HSBC, and Punit Renjen, the chief executive of Deloitte, are flying the flag for Britain - according to this guest list from the White House press pack: President Donald J. Trump Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Department of State Secretary Kirstjen Nielson, Department of Homeland Security General H.R. McMaster, National Security Advisor Gary Cohn, Director of the National Economic Council Kasper Rorsted, Adidas (Apparel)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Joe Kaeser, Siemens AG (Tech)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Heinrich Hiesinger, Thyssenkrupp AG (Industrials)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Eldar Saetre, Statoil ASA (Energy)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dNorway Mark Schneider, Nestle SA (Food and Beverage)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSwitzerland Vas Narasimhan, Novartis AG (Pharmaceutical)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSwitzerland Mark Tucker, HSBC (Financial Services)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dUK Patrick Pouyanne, Total SA (Energy)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dFrance Carlos Brito, Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (Food and Beverage)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dBelgium Rajeev Suri, Nokia Corporation (Technology)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dFinland Punit Renjen, Deloitte (Consulting)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dUK Martian Lundstedt, AB Volvo (Auto)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSweden Werner Baumann, Bayer AG (Pharmaceutical)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Bill McDermott, SAP SE (Technology)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Ulrich Spiesshofer, ABB Ltd (Manufacturing)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSwitzerland \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 This list was amended on 26 January 2018 to correct inaccurate details provided by the White House press office. The spelling of Carlos Brito\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first name was corrected from Carols, and the location of Anheuser-Busch InBev NV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters has been corrected from the Netherlands to Belgium. President Trump is likely to face protests if and when his visit to the UK takes place, even if it is just a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153working visit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. For a start, Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson pulled no punches, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump is a dangerous, misogynistic racist and is deserving of the protests he will undoubtedly face. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If and when he comes to the UK the Liberal Democrats will be at front and centre of the protests.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The White House says Theresa May and Donald Trump discussed plans for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153working visit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to London. That may mean that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a full-blown state visit. A working visit would mean less pomp and ceremony (and probably not a visit to see the Queen). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official statement (which includes that all-important nod to the Special Relationship). President Donald J. Trump met today with Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom. The President and Prime Minister discussed joint efforts to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS and other jihadist terrorist organizations in Syria and Iraq. They discussed the importance of confronting Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s destructive behavior across the Middle East and fundamental flaws in the Iran nuclear deal. The leaders committed to expanded trade between the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as how the two countries can work together to ensure all nations engage in fair and reciprocal trade practices. The two leaders also discussed plans for a working visit to London in the coming months and affirmed the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special relationship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between the two countries is stronger than ever. Donald Trump emerged from his meetings a little while ago, and briefly chatted with delegates who hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been driven away by security. He said his first day at Davos had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153really good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very successful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, before calling it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very great day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key quote (with thanks to the White House press corp) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the real message is we want great prosperity and we want great peace and I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the message. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been going really well. A lot of people are coming back to the United States. We are seeing tremendous investment and today has been a very exciting day. Very great day and great for our country. Thank you very much.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details: Q: Is America great? Trump: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Q: Is everybody else great? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump said, turning his head toward the questioner as he walked through the convention hallway. Donald Trump may be in the spotlight in Davos today, but it was Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments by US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin about the dollar which caused ructions at the European Central Bank. Mnuchin said that a weaker dollar was good for American trade, and ECB president Mario Draghi suggested this was not in the spirit of an agreement between governments made in October in Washington. Draghi said: Ministers and governments recognised excessive volatily or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse effects. [They agreed to] refrain from competitive devaluations and not target exchange rates for competitive purposes. He said the current exchange rate volatility was partly due to\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdthe use of language in discussing exchange rate developments that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments yesterday sent an already weak dollar still lower. Marco Valli, chief European economist at UniCredit Bank, said: [The ECB] remains fairly relaxed about the effects of a stronger euro, but bluntly criticised the recent foreign exchange messages from the US administration, seen as violating the long-standing international commitment to avoid competitive devaluation. And of course Donald Trump has tweeted about his meeting with Theresa May: Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Donald Trump at Davos took place shortly after she gave a special address to the World Economic Forum (highlights start here) May focused on the opportunities and threats of new technology, and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to equip its economy for the challenges ahead. Paul Sheard, chief global economist at S&amp;P Global Ratings, tells us that she missed a trick by not also talking about Brexit, and UK-US relations. Prime Minister May made a strong pitch for the UK to be seen as a global leader in AI and regulation-friendly innovation, but \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdI thought her not spending some time laying out the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest thinking on Brexit - particularly what it aspires for the all-important future relationship - was a bit of a missed opportunity. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what details still need to be finalised, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that officials can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually get Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit nailed down. One possible hitch might be the certainty of large protests against the US president from British citizens appalled by his view on climate change, accusations of sexual harassment, the Muslim ban, his America First policies - to name just four. Trump is reportedly rather worried about facing major protests - something he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been spared in Davos, due to its ultra-tight security net. Bloomberg reported this week that the US president had asked May to make sure he got a good reception. In one phone conversation during 2017, Trump complained to May over the criticism he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been getting in British newspapers. Amid warnings that Trump would face protests in the streets when he arrived, he told the prime minister he would not be coming to the U.K. until she could promise him a warm welcome. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official. Barring a few details, US president Donald Trump will visit the United Kingdom later this year. May and Trump asked their respective officials to work on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfinalising the details\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of a trip, at the end of their bilateral meeting here in the World Economic Forum. A Downing Street spokesman says that: The PM and President concluded by asking officials to work together on finalising the details of a visit by the President to the UK later this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no word on when it might happen, though. Downing Street also say that the two leaders discussed Brexit, Iran, terrorism, and worries that jobs could lost at Bombardier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory in Northern Ireland due to the trade dispute with Boeing. The spokesman says: The two leaders began by discussing Bombardier, with the PM reiterating the importance of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs in Northern Ireland. The PM and the President discussed Iran, and the need to work together to combat the destabilising activity which it is conducting in the region, including ballistic missile development, and continuing efforts to ensure Iran does not develop nuclear weapons. They also agreed on the importance of continuing to stand side-by-side in the fight against Daesh in Syria and elsewhere. The Prime Minister updated the President on the good progress which had been made in the Brexit negotiations so far. The two leaders reiterated their desire for a strong trading relationship post-Brexit, which would be in the interests of both countries. NEWSFLASH: Theresa May and Donald Trump have asked officials to work on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153finalising the details of a visit by the President to the UK later this year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Downing Street said. More to follow. Swiss campaign group CAMPAX have hung a Trump protest banner on a mountain at Sargans - about 50 kilometres from Davos. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a photo of the Davos meeting room which Donald Trump and his delegation swept into, a couple of hours ago: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a huge crowd at the bottom of the stairs; I think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only one way out.... During his meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu, president Trump suggested that aid would be withheld from the Palestinians if they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show respect. He said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they disrespected our great Vice President\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Last November, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t meet Mike Pence during his visit to the Middle East). Trump said (via the White House pool report): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The money is on the table. And the money was never off the table. [Yesterday, it was reported that former US secretary of state John Kerry had advised Abbas not to give in to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demands] Israeli president Benjamin Netanyahu has returned from his meeting with Trump. He says it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excellent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the White House pool report on the Trump-May meeting: President Trump and PM May sat beside one another in a WEF conference room with aides on each side. Among them on US side: Gary Cohn, HR McMaster, Tillerson, Sarah Sanders. Highlights: Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Its a false rumor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that there is tension in the US-UK relationship. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on the same wavelength in I think every respect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The two are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153liking each other a lot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153joined at the hip\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when it comes to the military. He looked at her and said there was nothing that would happen where the US would not be there for Britain. May also reaffirmed the special relationship. When asked about a state visit, May said it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being discussed now. Trump seconded that. No answers to shouted questions about the far right video retweet [back in November, Trump retweeted several anti-Muslim videos] Donald Trump has also talked about the prospect of a trade deal with the UK, but only in very general terms. Trade between the US and the UK is going to increase \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmany times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Trump said during his meeting with May, adding: The discussions...that will be taking place are going to lead to tremendous increase in trade between our countries, which is great for both in terms of jobs. Q: But what about a state visit to Britain? May and Trump say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll talk about that during their meeting at Davos. Several people have come down the stairs where Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meetings are taking place. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve spied IMF chief Christine Lagarde, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, and Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chancellor John McDonnell. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve all been meeting the US president - there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than one room up there. Q: How large an effect does your communication have on exchange rate? When I said communication I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean ECB communication but other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s communication. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t target exchange rate. When someone says a good exchange rate is good, that is targeting exchange rate. That goes back to years ago before the [recent] terms of agreement were agreed. Q:Why did you chooses September to end QE? Commodities are priced in dollars and could effect inflation data. When we recalibrated programme last October we had a discussion whether it should be six or nine months, and how much. So after that we came out with this educated outcome. In defining our objective we have different definitions, including underlying inflation which excludes energy etc. We target headline inflation, but we look at evidence from other definitions. Q: Oil price has risen significantly since December, could that cancel out strong euro. Yes, although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not easy to understand exactly the timing of these compensations. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imply we accept a certain level of exchange rate as a good or bad thing. And with that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over. Q: how do you feel about ECB communications this year including from individual members, could it be improved. What level of concern was there today about a possible change in US policy [after US dollar comments] Yes there was concern. It was broader than simply the exchange rate, but about broader state of international relations right now. If this leads to an unwarranted tightening of monetary policy we would have to think about our monetary policy strategy. On communications, you see same thing in other jurisdictions. All the communiations since Dec have in common three characteristics. All based on commitment to objective of inflation target. None questioned the sequence whereby interest rates will stay at current levels well past end of asset buying programme. Well past was emphasised. Q: Some commentators factoring in an interest rate rise this year? At its current level does euro reflect fundamentals? Based on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data I see very few chances at all that interest rates can be raised this year. On euro, we should ask is it produced by strength of economy, or by statements, or by monetary policy elsewhere. Q: Another question on the G30 membership, could it compromise ECB? Draghi repeats his previous answer, but adds ombudsman said there was no evidence the meeting influenced ECB, and ECB must have contacts with other financial participants. Q: Will differences of views within ECB deepen on exit strategy? At March meeting, will you give restatement of forward guidance. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the differences are as substantive as they were on other occasions. Some are a little more confident, if they live where inflation is rising. But there are not deep existential differences. But there may be differences on when to say certain things, when to move forward. Markets have expectations on path, but also on dates, timelines. In March we will assess how things stand at that point in time. Away from Davis briefly and back with the ECB, and president Mario Draghi said at his press conference that domestic price pressures remained muted, inflation has yet to show a convincing upward trend. He said the recent foreign exchange volatility is a source of uncertainty. An ample degree of monetary stimulus is necessary. On the economy, he said there could be positive growth surprise in the near term. But there were downside risks remain relating to global factors, forex. More on inflation: he said it was expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our measures, rising wage growth etc He then repeats his usual call to governments to do more: To reap the ull benefits from monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute. Structural reform in euro area countries needs to be stepped up . On fiscal policies, the case is strengthened for rebuilding fiscal buffers, especially in in countries where debt remains high. Strengthening EMU remains a priority. Now for questions: Q: What will have to happen for the exchange rate to be a problem for the inflation target? And you said in December you would revisit guidance [on the bond buying programme] early this year? Draghi says there is confusion about the guidance comment, there was no difference between what was said at the December meeting and what Draghi said at the press conference. All that was said was there would have to be discussions about the need to have a discussion in the early part of the year. That discussion hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really started. We went through the events since October to now, trying to assess whether something has changed. There was not much of a change except the strengthening of the economy a little more than expected. By and large the risk to growth is balanced. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t declare victory. Price pressures are muted. Underlying inflation is showing little signs of upward movement. So we simply restated policy. He said the commitment to the inflation target remained firmer than ever. Monetary policy will remain accommodative. On exchange rates he said there were three reasons for volatility. The improvement in the economy, the heightened market sensitivity to perceived changes in our communication. Finally the use of language in discussion exchange rate developments that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed in October in Washington [an agreement between governments on exchange rate policy] Q:Dollar weakness is what you were probably referring to. It must not be helpful to hear a lower dollar is something [US officials] like. Are we heading to currency war scenario. Also, could you envisage ending QE programme in September. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t target exchange rates, they are important for growth and price stability. Movements justified by strength of economy are a fact of natiure. Are there other movements caused by use of language, not parts of terms agreed. Whether that has an effect on our inflation path...inflation is our main concern. Too early to assess whether pass through has already taken place, and what will be extent. Some are questioning the extent of pass through, but large exchange rate movements are bound to have an effect. In Washington - ministers and governments recognised excessive volatily or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse effects. [They agreed] we will refrain from competitive devaluations and will not target exchange rates for competitive purposes. On second question, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any discussion today, but we never stop the programme abruptly. Q: Will you give up you membership of the G30, after ombudsman letter? We received the letter from the ombudsman, we will respond in time. There is a procedure. We will assess the letter and the comments and respond. Q: German pay negotiations. Could there be broad pay increases across eurozone economy following Germany? We observe from a monetary policy angle, where we consider wage growth as a convincing sign of future inflation convergence to our objective. Whether it spreads, depends on conditions of labour market. Tight conditions in Germany, not so in other countries. Q: Are there financial stability risks from long term accommodative policy? Vice president Vitor Constancio answers. No one can talk about asset price bubbles in euro area. We have overstretched valuations in some places for commercial real estate, high yield corporate bonds but nothing else.... We see prices in market are close to fair value. Same is true of housing prices. Fundamental values are in line with fundamental. Prices of houses increasing by 4%, between 2000 and 2006 they were up 7%. So no general situation of overvaluation in residential properties. Some countries have also taken macroprudential policies to combat excesses. The effect on banks of negative rates, taking into account all our policies, they have been favourable to their profitability which is still low but increasing. So negative rates have been absorbed by banking sector. Draghi talks about fiscal buffers. Interest rates will at some point stop being so low. At that point all governments will want to have policy space, so budget consideration now when the time is good is favourable. NF We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve now got video footage of Theresa May and Donald Trump meeting. Trump says he and May have a mutual feeling of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcliking each other a lot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He says there have been a false rumour out there, which he wants to rebut. He tells May: We have great respect for everything you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing, and we love your country. We think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s truly good. Trump says that the US and the UK are working on economic development, trade and military issues. We are very much joined at the hip when it comes to the military Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Trump is over - she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departed the scene without speaking to the press. Next up.... Israel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Benjamin Netanyahu. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gone up the stairs with a small group, presumably to meet Trump. Curiously, Theresa May and a few advisors came down from the Trump meeting.....vanished into another room...reappeared and then went back up again. OK, it looks like Trump and May have been holding their meeting - and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly over.... White House reporters are travelling with Trump - here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the latest pooled reports: Pool arrived at 2:40 at the conference center after brief motorcade through town that includes some small souvenir shops, ski shops, restaurants. There were some JP Morgan flags posted on the route as well. The smattering of onlookers included a few waving American flags and some young kids in ski helmets. A few more photos of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival: I managed a short video clip of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival: President Trump and his entourage then move up the stairs, to a constant clicking of cameras. One delegate welcomes him to Switzerland. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Thank you very much. Great country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump replies. He then continues up another flight of stairs, to an area where most delegates (and journalists) aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allowed. A security guard is now posted there to prevent any intruders. Trump arrives to his audience; reporters shout out a few questions. Asked what his message is to Davos, he replies \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Peace and prosperity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There are a few laughs. Here he comes...... The entire World Economic Forum has gone into a weird semi-lockdown. Half the delegates are crowding around, in a hush, waiting for Trump. The rest are milling around in the corridors and lounges, or getting on with business. Curiously, most delegates are waiting in silence..... President Trump is about to arrive at the World Economic Forum. People are crowding around the security cordon and flocking on the balcony , desperate for a glimpse. Theresa May ends her speech by calling on the World Economic Forum to work together to solve the problems she identified. The UK has a proud history of stepping up and delivering progress that can deliver for all, she says: Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s renew our commitment to collaboration - and set ourselves on a path to benefit all our people. Now, and for generations to come. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it. No questions. Theresa May says technology companies employ some of the brightest minds in the world - they should be able to design a system where unacceptable content is deleted automatically. No-one wants to be known as a a platform for terrorism, or the best place for child pornography, she points out. She says there are three key priorities: Considering whether new regulations are needed for these tech platforms Investors must think about the social impact of the firms they invest in. Working on the ethical implications of Artificial Intelligence Theresa May is now challenging social media companies to do more to protect users - especially children. We want Britain to be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153World leader in innovation-friendly regulation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says (not the catchiest slogan). That means being the safest place in the world to be online, while also being a great place to run a digital business. Technology companies must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153step up to their responsibilities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the PM says sternly. Companies simply cannot stand by while their platforms are used to facilitate child abuse, modern slavery, or the spreading of terrorist and extremist content. Theresa May singles out Uber as an example of the potential,and problems, created by technology. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an innovative company, but it has also got things wrong - with safety issues and concerns about its treatment of workers The solution isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t to shut them down, but to improve the system so companies work better. Employment law must protect workers and give businesses the flexibility it needs, says the PM - it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just be a one-way street. Maybe 2/3 full was an overstatement.... May is pitching to businesses here, saying the government is raising Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s digital skills for the 21st century. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also at the forefront of low-carbon technologies, she declares. And on artificial intelligence, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only at the beginning of what AI can achieve, says May. Those of you up here in Davos mustn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget the plight of those who face losing their job after 20 years, says May. We must channel the power of business and government together to harness technology, and make it a force for good, May continues - to address people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns. I understand the power of business as a force for good. Free markets drive risk-taking that have delivered the great advances of our time. But I also believe in the power of government, she adds. Our new business strategy will make Britain one of the best place in the world to start and run a business, she pledges. Turning to technology, Theresa May says the internet can deliver $2.2 trillion worth of GDP to developing countries. And just last week, a drone saved two boys from drowning off Australia by carrying a float to them. Medical tests show that technology can reduce breast cancer cases by a third. But people are worried about the malevolent impact of technology, she says. Britain will continue to be an advocate of free trade after Brexit, May insists. And she challenges Davos delegates to live up to their commitments, in three ways: The commitments on steel must be implemented. Aid donors must match the UK and help developing countries The World Trade Organisation must do more to keep pace with the global economy - she singles out the service sector, and e-commerce Theresa May begins by saying that last year, she warned that the benefits of free trade weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being shared fairly, and this risked undermining the global world order. One year on, there are grounds for optimism. Global growth is strengthening. The populism of the far left and far right has not made the progress some predicted, and in the UK, unemployment is at a 40-year low and government and business are working together well. Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum, is introducing Theresa May now. The room is roughly two-thirds full - respectable, not as much as for president Macron last night. Schwab says many Davos attendees were impressed last year, by May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s passionate plea to address global slavery. That work continues this year, he says. Cowbells are ringing across the Davos congress centre (yes, really), to tell delegates that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech starts soon. The hall is filling up well, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not packed out yet. One delegate tells me she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hoping to hear some clarity on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future after Brexit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of uncertainty right now\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. At the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lunch in Davos, Philip Hammond insisted that Britain would leave the EU on 31st March 2019. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a statement of political reality, the chancellor insists. Hammond said Britain should go for something more ambitious than previous deals with the EU. An off-the-shelf Norway or Canada agreement won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. Unusually for trade talks, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re starting from a point where we are already deeply interconnected with highly aligned regulatory systems and close co-operation on defence and security. Should go for something much more ambitious than anything that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previously been agreed. Former UK cabinet minister and New Labour architect Peter Mandelson was also at the lunch, and pointed out that French president Emmanuel Macron had hosted 140 CEOs at Versailles the other day. Mandelson warned: For France, Brexit is a gift that keeps on giving. Hammond hit back, though, saying you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get more top CEOs in London on an average day (probably not all meeting a world leader, though!). The European Central Bank has left interest rates unchanged and repeated that its bond buying programme will run until September or beyond if necessary. The ECB added it could increase the programme from its current \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30bn a month if circumstances change: If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the asset purchase programme (APP) in terms of size and/or duration. On rates it said they would be kept at present levels \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Of course the detail will come in president Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference this afternoon, when analysts will be looking for more on the future of the QE programme and when rates might rise. But Draghi must be tempted to keep his cards close to his chest, and avoid anything which could push the euro higher when inflation is still below the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target. NF Donald Trump and his team are staying at the Intercontinental Hotel in Davos. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sensible move from a security point of view; the Intercontinental is at the edge of Davos, rather than slap bang next to the conference centre like the Belvedere (scene of many parties and meeting). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also up a steep hill, so easier to prevent protests . The White House press pack report that they saw onlookers snapping pictures of the Trump convoy, but no demos on the route. Hello... Business Insider\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul Colgan has spotted some anti-Trump protesters outside the conference halls. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very tight security all around the Davos area, making it hard for demonstrators to travel up the mountain and exercise their democratic rights. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d almost think the global elite didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to know what people really think of them.... Chancellor Philip Hammond is cracking some jokes at the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lunch with British business chiefs - including one at Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expense. He reminds his audience that it was a walk in the mountain air that inspired the prime minister to call a general election last year*. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m discouraging her from taking any strolls, Hammond grins. * - (wiping out her majority) Boris Johnson once said that he was put off from visiting parts of New York by the very real risk of meeting Donald Trump. Well in Davos, you also run the very real risk of running into Piers Morgan. The UK journalist and TV personality has done well, though, securing an exclusive sit-down interview with the US president. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to air on Sunday night, with clips released on Friday morning. Davos delegates without a swanky lunch invite (or the time to go) are being fed individual jars of pasta dishes. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great fun to watch the global elite scrambling to over each other whenever the waiting staff emerge with a new tray of goodies. Your humble correspondent finally gets a pot, balances it on his iPad - and is promptly mistaken for a waiter by a fellow delegate who tries to nab it off me. Maybe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for a career change... Trump has touched down in Switzerland, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of him in the Congress Hall yet. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader, Leo Varadkar, is in Davos -- and refusing to accept that Apple got an unfairly good tax deal from the Irish government. In 2016, the EC ruled that Apple had received \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn of state aid. Last November, it referred Ireland to the European Court of Justice because Dublin hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t started reclaiming the cash. According to Varadkar, this process will start soon.....but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not rolling over in the ECJ. Speaking of the CBI, UK retail sales have grown modestly in January so far, according to its latest distributive trades survey, but at a slower pace than anticipated. The survey showed a balance of +12 for January, down from +20 in December. Sales for the time of year were the weakest compared to the norm for more than four years, said the CBI. Orders to suppliers also fell, and looking ahead retailers expect similar growth in sales volumes while orders are forecast to be flat. Anna Leach, CBI head of economic intelligence, said: Retailers have seen fairly modest sales growth this month overall, but it is online retailers who have set the pace during the January sales. Household spending will remain under pressure this year from higher inflation and low wage growth, which will continue to weigh on sales growth in the retail sector. NF British business chiefs and media leaders have headed to a lunchtime event with chancellor Philip Hammond, hosted by the CBI. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a traditional part of the Davos week for the UK delegation, but this year it could be a little frostier than usual. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because CBI chief Caroline Fairbairn declared last week that Britain must remain in the customs union after Brexit. I imagine the Treasury weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t best pleased by this intervention (unless we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve outsourced Brexit negotiations to the CBI...a safer bet than using Carillion, anyway). But we understand that Hammond won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use his speech to rebut Fairbairn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call, and will cover other issues.... My colleague Larry Elliott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s there, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have more details soon.... Theresa May has given an interview to Bloomberg. She spoke about the revelations about sexual harassment at a charity dinner in London, saying: I was frankly appalled when I read the report of this Presidents Club event. I thought that that sort of attitude of the objectification of women was something that was in the past. Sadly, what that event showed is that there is still a lot more work for us to do. That chimes with Malala Yousafzai\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments this morning. Our Politics Live blog has more details: We hear that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Donald Trump will take place shortly after her speech (which starts at 2pm, or 1pm GMT). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to focus on foreign affairs issues like Syria and North Korea. Theresa May has now ended her private meeting (perhaps a roundtable?) and swept the WEF congress hall in a gaggle of aides. Down the stairs at pace, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quickly into another secure section of this rabbit-warren of a building. Disappointingly she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop for questions - a camera had been lined up, just in case. Still, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear from her in a couple of hours. Chancellor Philip Hammond has told the Davos panel on financial risks that Europe will lose out if the City suffers after Brexit. New York and Singapore would benefit from new business, he says, not European cities. The idea that you can recreate London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial centre anywhere else is a fantasy. Hammond also says that financial services are very important to the UK side, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the centre of our negotiating strategy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Those who say the financial sector will not be part of a deal have not been looking at the numbers, he says. We have a trade deficit of \u00c2\u00a3100bn with Europe, and a surplus in services of \u00c2\u00a340bn, Hammond explains, adding: The only deal that can be done is one that can be fair to both parties One that included trade and not services would not be fair to the UK. Theresa May and her entourage have just swept through the Davos congress centre, into a private meeting room. Alas media are certainly not allowed in to listen. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treasury secretary, Stephen Mnuchin is also on the panel on the future of finance. Yesterday, Mnuchin sent the dollar tumbling by saying a weak currency is good for exports. Today, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very relaxed about the whole issue, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the short term where the dollar is is not a concern of mine. It is not something I spend a lot of time thinking about.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mnuchin also denies that America is trying to launch a trade war, insisting that the US doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want less trade it wants \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fair trade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The big debate on financial stability is also underway. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, says trade is one of the factors leading to stronger growth. When asked about the risks of a trade war, she says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Who would want to do anything that would lead to weaker growth? Al Gore, former US vice-president, has suggested that Donald Trump can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disrupt the battle against climate change - especially if he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reelected in 2020. Speaking on a panel here in Davos, Gore says there is strong momentum to fight climate change. Several governors of our largest states, hundreds of cities, and thousands of US businesses are now ensuring that the US will not just meet, but exceed, the commitments it made in the Paris Agreement. Gore explains that America can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t legally leave the Paris Agreement (to act to limit rising global temperatures) until after the next presidential election. And if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new president (at which point Al Gore offers a silent prayer), they could give 30 days notice and America would be back in the agreement. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the good news. The bad news, Gore says, is that the maximum action that is political feasible falls far short of the minimum of what is needed to battle climate change. So, we need to move the boundary of what politicians can do. You can watch the panel live, here. Back in the UK, and mortgage approvals by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks fell to their lowest level since April 2013 in December, according to trade association UK Finance. Banks approved 36,115 mortgages for housebuying, down from 39,007 in November and 19% lower than a year ago. Annual growth in consumer credit slipped from 0.8% to 0.7%. And this could give the Bank of England a problem: NF Newsflash: Theresa May has met with South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa.....and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a fondue dish in sight either. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former press chief has caused a stir this morning, accusing the PM of spending last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Davos \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sitting in a hotel eating fondue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rather than meeting fellow world leaders and business chiefs. Writing in The Times, Katy Perrior claims the PM struggled to schmooze at the 2017 World Economic Forum, and even turned up with the wrong sort of footwear (her new \u00c2\u00a3120 snowboots should work better this time). Perrior claiming business leaders were frozen out by May: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcElsewhere they get personal audiences with President Macron in France and Malcolm Turnbull in Australia but not so much as a digestive biscuit from the PM. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDoes she have any idea how frustrating that is for them? Other world leaders are on a charm offensive, desperate to woo major businesses to their shores. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAs we count down to post-Brexit Britain, she would do well to spend less time enjoying the fondue and more time meeting and greeting.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 More here. Personally, I was disappointed not to see May meeting business chiefs and academics at Oxford University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excellent Davos cheese and port party last night (maybe I left too early #bestbehaviour ) Perrior also claims May turned down the chance to meet Alibaba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jack Ma last year. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still at Davos, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still time to make amends, prime minister... Kristin Lemkau, JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief marketing officer, sums up Davos so far: Sterling continues to go from strength to strength. In Asia overnight it hit $1.4328, and although it has eased back from that, it is still up 0.11% so far today at $1.4255. It is partly the expectation of an earlier than expected UK rate rise, given the recent strong data including Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment and wages figures. But of course there is also the weak dollar, hit recently by the expectation that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts would raise the already hefty US deficit. More immediately Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin told Davos the US wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worried about a flagging greenback. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale said: Steven Mnuchin (US Treasury Secretary) went to Davos and said that a weaker dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcis good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He also pointed out that that he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t concerned by where it is in the short term and that in the longer term, its strength is a reflection of the strength of the US economy. In other words, he said very little really, but he said it under snow-plastered slopes and he was speaking to a market where dollar bulls have been under the cosh. A few more capitulated. Against the euro the pound is pretty flat, down just 0.01% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1473 ahead of the latest European Central Bank meeting. But the euro is up against the dollar, 0.11% better at $1.2421. The strength of the euro presents a problem for ECB president Mario Draghi. If he appears too bulllish at hinting at an end to the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE programme, the euro will appreciate even further. And that would keep a lid on inflation which is already below the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target. Equally, he cannot ignore the improving European economy. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets explains: With headline inflation remaining well below its 2% target rate at 1.4% and an economy that continues to show decent levels of economic activity the ECB is faced with having to navigate the minefield of guiding markets over the tightrope of communicating a credible timeline for stimulus reduction and interest rate policy, while trying to move CPI back to target against the difficulty of a rising currency. Since the beginning of 2017 the euro has risen 18% against the US dollar and could well rise even further given yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks by US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin. Last week ECB vice president Vitor Constancio along with Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ewald Nowotny expressed concern about recent exchange rate movements. These concerns are likely to have increased in recent days which will make today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference by ECB President Mario Draghi much more interesting. He can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very well ignore the improving outlook but if he comes across as too bullish the euro could well be well on the way to the 1.3000 level by the end of this quarter. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said: Draghi would have to adopt a delicate approach and seek a strategy which stops the euro from firming further. The only way out of this situation for him would be to emphasize that the process of the rate hikes is not within sight yet. The market is expecting a rate hike in 2019 from the ECB, Draghi would have to pull a rabbit out of hat in order to convince the market that rate hike isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the agenda and market participants are getting ahead of themselves. We do think that overly dovish statement by the European central bank is priced in the euro to some extent. If Draghi fails to convince the market or if he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound as dovish as the market is expecting, we think that the euro can take off from here. I think the risk to the downside for the euro are limited, it is the upside move which would be more exciting. NF Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conservative Party has confirmed she will hold social media giants to account in Davos: Bruce Carnegie-Brown, chairman of Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, says that companies are taking out more insurance against cyber attacks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is the fastest growing part of our business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Carnegie-Brown says, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Companies are certainly becoming more concerned about the risks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has 30% of the global market, Carnegie-Brown says, with 85% of the business coming from US firms. The insurance market is changing, he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are more concerned about cyber attack than a fire when it comes to the potential impact on their business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carnegie-Brown says he has been floating the idea in Davos that governments might use part of their aid budgets to insure poor developing countries against the cost of natural disasters. Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s will pay out almost $5b to the US states affected by the three hurricanes last year but says the world as a whole is under-insured. Malala also warns that world leaders need to invest more in education, to help future generations. Malala Yousafzai, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s youngest Nobel Prize winner, is speaking at Davos right now, about the importance of giving girls equal rights to education. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s explaining that education can play a key role in improving giving the message of equality. So what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your message to Trump on the issue of gender equality, asks Miriam Elder of Buzzfeed. Yousafzai says: I get so disappointed to see that people in these high positions openly talk against women, do not accept women as equals, they harass woman. It is just shocking to think that is is happening I hope that women stand up and speak out against it. I hope that people who are involved in such shameful things think about their own daughters, their own mothers, their own close female relations, and just imagine for a second, could they let it happen to them? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they would accept that. Malala, who was shot by the Taliban in 2012 after campaigning for girls education, says women must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153raise up their voice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and reach the ears and minds of those who still hold views which we hoped didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist any more Just in: chancellor Philip Hammond says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very happy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the strength of sterling, which has hit its highest level since the Brexit vote. Foreign exchange rates are a big story at Davos, after America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin seemed to hint that Washington liked a weaker dollar Some of President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top officials are briefing the press again this morning. Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross is in combative mood, denying that America is protectionist - even though it just slapped new tariffs on washing machines and solar panels from Asia. Ross also says that America is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more interested\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in bilateral trade deals than multilateral ones - which doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bode very well for the ongoing NAFTA negotiations. John McDonnell, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chancellor, is also in Davos, and bringing a warning for the global elite: McDonnell will be telling top business people and world leaders that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re dangerously insulated from the problems outside WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security cordon and swanky parties: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many of those attending the World Economic Forum have been patting themselves on the back as international growth figures have begun to pick up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But they should be worried. In the real world, outside the Davos bubble of Alpine restaurants and chalets, the global economic system they have built isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working for billions of people. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And just as Davos faces the risk of an avalanche this week, growth for a few risks a political and social avalanche unless there is fundamental change to our rigged economic system. Philip Hammond, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chancellor of the Exchequer, is also at Davos. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been giving his views about artificial intelligence at a Microsoft breakfast, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are at the point where computers move from being dumb and fast to being smart and fast.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hammond says AI is going to be disruptive and managing the process is the key to it being accepted, warning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To many it will seem to be a big threat to their prosperity and livelihoods\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Losers would include members of the middle class but it was important to embrace the new technology rather than resist it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not create a generation of 21st Century Luddites who feel the only chance of survival is to resist change.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hammond said AI would affect the jobs market, would disrupt business models and had ethical dimensions including privacy and the way new technology could be used in wars. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The choice is simple: do we look inward or outward, look to the future or cleave to the past?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here are some photos of Donald Trump setting off to Davos last night: Good morning from Davos. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another big day at the World Economic Forum, with Theresa May giving a keynote speech this afternoon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and meeting Donald Trump on the sidelines. The UK PM is expected to put technology giants under pressure to clean up their act and tackle extreme content. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say: Investors can make a big difference here by ensuring trust and safety issues are being properly considered. And I urge them to do so. These companies simply cannot stand by while their platforms are used to facilitate child abuse, modern slavery or the spreading of terrorist and extremist content.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Her meeting with Trump will be a chance to talk trade after Brexit, discuss terrorism, and perhaps patch up that Special Relationship after the row over the US embassy. As Beth Rigby from Sky News puts it: The two leaders are expected to focus on areas where there is common ground in international affairs: North Korea, as well as eradicating Islamic State in Syria and northern Iraq. They might touch on Iran. But the thornier issue of Russian aggression in Europe is less likely to be raised as the Prime Minister seeks to soothe relations and not stoke further tensions. President Trump set off for Davos last night - part of the biggest US delegation ever. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be hearing more from his team this morning. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also masses of other events, covering gender equality, financial stability, tax avoidance and climate change.

                "bodyText":"The sell-off on Wall Street is getting worse. The Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 368 points or 1.4%, while the S&amp;P 500 is down around 1%. Rising bond yields - and falling prices - ahead of the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest interest rate decision, as well as a slump in healthcare shares, continue to do the damage. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors are getting a bit worried about inflation which has led some people to believe the Fed might be more aggressive when it comes to raising rates,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd SlateStone Wealth strategist Robert Pavlik told Reuters. There is also the excuse of profit taking after the recent record breaking run for US markets, and by recent, I mean a run which was only broken on Friday. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close up for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. With falling bond prices and concerns that shares may be overvalued after their recent record run, stock markets suffered a severe sell-off. Investors have become nervous amid growing signs that central banks - whose supportive monetary policies have helped markets hit new peaks - are beginning to pull the plug on cheap borrowing and hefty bond buying programmes. Add to that a slump in US healthcare shares after Amazon and co decided to enter the market, and it was a bad day all round for equities. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 83.55 points or 1.09% lower at 7587.98 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.95% to 13,197.71 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.87% lower at 5473.78 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.35% to 23,480.92 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 1.21% at 10,428.2 In Greece, the Athens market lost 2.08% to 868.08 There is little sign of a recovery on Wall Street, with falling bond prices and a drop in heathcare stocks pushing markets lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down around 288 points or just over 1%. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says another factor for the US market decline is concern about what the Federal Reserve will say tomorrow at the end of its two day meeting: Profit taking is rife on Wall Street as the hefty declines last night has spooked traders and now the selling has intensified. Investors have been concerned about the US stock market being overbought for some time, and now it seems the jitters are setting in. The chatter is the Federal Reserve will raise growth and inflation expectations, and that is pushing up US government bond yields, which are now at a rate that is attractive to investors. The jump from stocks to bonds could continue until we hear from the US central bank tomorrow. The US dollar index has fallen to a three year low, and that is likely to lead to inflation as imports are tipped to become more expensive. The perception that inflation will rise is fuelling the rise in US government bond yields. Despite Goldman Sachs talking of a possible market correction, not everyone agrees. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s State of the Union address later could give a renewed lift to flagging markets: The global stock selloff has persisted into a second day, with overnight losses in Asia giving way to widespread selling in Europe and the US. Interestingly, with gold and the yen gaining ground over recent weeks, there has clearly been an underlying risk-off move waiting to rear its head. However, with treasuries selling off throughout the beginning of 2018, there is reason to believe that market confidence will not be gone for long, as investors shift away from bonds amid improved economic and corporate performance... The focus is going to shift firmly onto the US from here on, as markets brace themselves for Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s State of the Union address. Despite the pause in the US equity rally, there is reason to believe that Trump could provide enough of a boost to see us back into the highs yet again. Talk of a $1.5 trillion infrastructure package may simply be words for now, but with the tax reforms passed, there is a growing belief that Donald Trump can finally deliver. Away from the markets, and Bank of England governor Mark Carney is appearing in front of the House of Lords economic affairs committee. He is being quizzed on forecasting (timely, given the latest Brexit forecast confusion). My colleague Andrew Sparrow is monitoring Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance in the politics live blog here: As markets continue to wobble, Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell said: The US open was not a welcome sight for the European indices, with an ugly start from the Dow Jones infecting the FTSE et al. The Dow Jones plunged a stomach-churning 300 points after the bell, hitting an 8 day low of just under 26150 as investors stared down the barrel of an incredibly hectic rest of the week. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the unknown of this evening\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s State of the Union address from Donald Trump; the first Fed meeting of the year on Wednesday, with rising bond yields suggesting something hawkish; and a non-farm Friday that may become even more important than normal dependant on what the central bank say mid-week. Interestingly the dollar, which had been mounting something of a comeback as recent as this morning, completely gave up the ghost this Tuesday afternoon. Having at one point fallen below $1.40, cable jumped 0.4% to re-cross $1.41, while against the euro the greenback shed 0.3%, allowing the single currency back above $1.24. All this spelt disaster for the European indices. The FTSE plunged 70 points, falling below 7600 for the first time in more than a month. The DAX and CAC, meanwhile, dropped 0.8% apiece, hitting 13210 and 5475 respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 300 points, which puts it on course for its biggest one day fall since May last year. Added to Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 177 point decline, it would be the biggest two day points fall since June 2016 after Britain voted to leave the EU. US consumer confidence remains strong, according to a new report from the Conference Board. Its confidence index climbed to 125.4 in January from 1 revised figure of 123.1 in the previous month. Analysts had been expecting 123.1. (The survey was taken before this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline on Wall Street of course.) The decline on Wall Street has meant the falls in Europe have accelerated. The FTSE 100 is now down nearly 1%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dropped 0.9% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has fallen 0.8%. Trevor Greetham, head of multi asset at Royal London Asset Management, said: Global stock markets dipped on Tuesday on concerns about rising US interest rates and high equity valuations. This sell-off doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come as a surprise. Investor sentiment has been getting very frothy, with our composite sentiment indicator hitting its highest reading since March 2017 this week. The recent increase in share prices has been powered by the prospect of large corporate tax cuts in America so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s noteworthy that US company directors have started to sell shares in their own companies in large numbers. With expectations running high, we think the sell-off may have further to run and we reduced our exposure to equities in our multi asset funds yesterday, although we still remain overweight stocks. With the world economy strong and interest rates low, we would probably buy a more pronounced dip. The worst performer in the Dow is, unsurprisingly, United Healthcare: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the new healthcare partnership causing all the fuss: US markets have come under renewed pressure, as investors face the prospect of rising interest rates and the withdrawal of central banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bond buying programmes. With bond prices falling ahead of the latest Federal Reserve decision (no move is expected yet but there is a growing expectation of at least three more rises this year) the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 230 points or 0.9% in early trading. After Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 177 point fall, that would mark the first two day decline since December. But bear in mind, US markets had hit new peaks as recently as Friday. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.8% lower and the Nasdaq Composite fell just over 1%. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: The rise in global sovereign bond yields has unsettled investors and hit riskier assets. US 10s are holding above 2.7%, while the 30-year T note is approaching 3%. Certainly the dynamics have shifted in bond markets. Central banks are either out of the market or buying fewer bonds. The Fed is now in the business of selling not buying. The ECB seems to be teeing up a short taper that could see QE end in September, which is a shade earlier than most anticipated back in December. The BoJ is also tilting towards normalisation, albeit much more slowly. Earlier this week Goldman Sachs warned of a possible market correction. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whatever the trigger, a correction of some kind seems a high probability in the coming months,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Peter Oppenheimer, the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief global equity strategist. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[But] the continuation of low core inflation and easy monetary policy suggests that a correction is more likely than a bear market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A sharp decline in healthcare stocks is also hitting the market today, after Amazon, Warren Buffett and JP Morgan teamed up to form their own healthcare partnership. Ahead of Wall Street opening, Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, said: Global equity bulls failed to make an appearance during Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading session as higher U.S. bond yields and caution ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting weighed heavily on sentiment. World shares were under renewed selling pressure today with Asian shares tumbling lower during early trade, following Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steep declines overnight. In Europe, equities tumbled amid the lack of appetite for risk. With Wall Street suffering its largest drop in more than four months on Monday, U.S. stocks could remain pressured by the negative sentiment this afternoon. The eurozone has posted its strongest growth in a decade. The region grew by 2.5% last year, the best performance since the financial crisis. Economists think Europe is going to have another good year. France and Spain led the way. France racked up its fastest growth since 2011, thanks to stronger business spending, while Spain notched up another year of 3%+ growth. But in the UK, new figures show that consumers racked up more credit last month. Mortgage approvals fell to a near three-year low. Over in America, Amazon is piling into the health market in partnership with JP Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway. Shares in healthcare firms are down heavily in pre-market trading. European markets in the red, amid speculation that shares could be heading for a correction. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to get worse when Wall Street opens in half an hour... PwC also made this chart, showing how the eurozone outperformed other major economies last year: Getting back to the eurozone growth figures...Barret Kupelian, senior economist at PwC, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The good news keeps on coming from the Eurozone, which grew at a quarterly rate of 0.6% in the last quarter of 2017. Even though this is slightly slower than the previous quarter, the fuller picture for 2017 is overwhelmingly positive, with growth in the Eurozone ahead of the UK, US and Japan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Taking a more historical look at the growth track record of large advanced economies, the Eurozone can now boast holding the title of the fastest growing large advanced economy four times since the financial crisis compared to three times for the US and the UK and once for Japan. PwC also expect the eurozone to do well in 2018, unless any \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmajor unexpected shocks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hit the global economy. Kupelian says: In our main scenario projection, we expect the Eurozone to grow by at least 2%, marking its strongest two-year streak since the global financial crisis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here. Economists are continuing to welcome today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s French GDP figures, which showed a strong pick-up in business investment. This is from Emily Mansfield of the Economist Intelligence Unit (GFCF = gross fixed capital formation, or the purchase of new assets) Nikolay Markov, senior economist at Pictet Asset Management, hopes this trend will continue: The selloff continues! Wall Street is heading for a second day of losses, as heathcare companies are hit by the surprise arrival of Amazon in their sector... Investors in US healthcare firms may need a lie-down, possibly with a cold flannel.... In other news....retail giant Amazon, Warren Buffett\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Berkshire Hathaway and Wall Street titan JPMorgan have announced a curious tie-up. The three companies are going to create a not-for-profit company to give their own staff high-quality and transparent healthcare. Veteran investor Warren Buffett suggests the trio are keen to shake up the way healthcare is provided in America. Buffett says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy. Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable. Rather, we share the belief that putting our collective resources behind the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best talent can, in time, check the rise in health costs while concurrently enhancing patient satisfaction and outcomes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pan Pylas of Associated Press has a good take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures: The eurozone economy, for so long a source of uncertainty, has enjoyed its best year in a decade, clear evidence it has broken out of its prolonged and acute debt crisis that raised fears about the very survival of the euro currency. In its first estimate for the fourth quarter, Eurostat, the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics agency, said Tuesday that the eurozone expanded by 0.6 percent in the October-December period from the three months before. That more-than-healthy level of growth means that for the whole of 2017, the eurozone economy expanded by 2.5 percent, its best performance since 2007, when it grew 3 percent. The eurozone even grew faster than the U.S., which expanded by 2.3 percent. In the decade since 2007, the eurozone has had to grapple with one crisis after another, starting with the financial crash of 2008 that prompted the deepest worldwide recession since World War II. That exposed the weak underbelly of the eurozone the state of the public finances in a number of member economies. Four countries Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus had to be bailed out by their partners in the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund, and in return they made deep budget cuts to get their public finances into shape, hitting their economies hard. The Greek economy, for example, shed around a quarter of its output, and saw unemployment and poverty levels ratchet higher. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only recently that fears of a eurozone break-up have eased. Greece, notably, is set to emerge from its bailout era this summer, eight years after it first faced potential bankruptcy. Another chart showing how the eurozone outpaced its major rivals last year: ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bert Colijn is also impressed that the eurozone grew by 2.5% during 2017. He writes: Economic growth has shifted to a substantially faster growth path over the course of 2017, and current GDP data confirms that. Eurozone growth for 2017 as a whole was stronger than many advanced markets, like the US and UK for example. While detailed breakdowns have yet to be released, it seems that the Eurozone economy continues to fire on all cylinders. Investment has yet to recover from the crisis fully but has been an essential contributor to growth during the year. However, Colijn is also concerned that the strong euro could hold back growth in 2018 (as exports will be less competitive) Analysts at Ulster Bank are hopeful that the eurozone will continue to grow robustly in 2018. Jacob Deppe, Head of Trading at online trading platform, Infinox, is impressed by Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth last year: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anything the US economy can do the Eurozone economy can do, slightly better it seems. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is the best economic growth the Eurozone has seen since before the Global Financial Crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Where we go from here is anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guess. But with both the US and Eurozone growing in tandem and with Asian economies on a roll, the hope is that 2018 delivers continued growth, further confidence and economic stability for the first time in a decade. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There remain issues on the horizon. Unemployment in the Eurozone, while falling, is still too high, particularly among the young. We now have confirmation that Europe and America both grew much faster than Britain last year. Economists Rupert Seggins has tweeted a handy chart: Aila Mihr of Danske Bank says Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is expanding strongly: NEWSFLASH: The eurozone and the wider EU have both posted their strongest annual growth since the financial crisis. New GDP figures from Eurostat confirm that the European recovery remains on track, with annual growth of 2.5% during 2017 in the EU and the narrower single currency block. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the strongest annual growth in a decade. In comparison, the UK grew by around 1.8% during 2017 (according to figures released last week) Eurostat also reports that the eurozone and the EU both grew by 0.6% in the final three months of 2017, partly thanks to France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.6% growth and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.7%. Compared to Q4 2016, seasonally adjusted GDP rose by 2.7% in the euro area and by 2.6% in the EU28. In another boost, Eurozone and EU growth in the third quarter of last year has been revised up, from +0.6% to +0.7%. There may be some celebrations in Brussels as this data filters through. Three years ago, the eurozone was being rocked by the Greek debt crisis. Now, the region is looking calmer and more secure, despite Brexit. Over in Frankfurt, the European Central Bank might feel vindicated after launching a massive stimulus programme to ward off deflation, drive down unemployment and keep the economy growing. Economists are concerned by the rise in UK consumer borrowing: Breaking; The number of new mortgages approved in Britain has hit its lowest in almost three years. Just 61,039 mortgages were signed off in December, a drop of over 3,000 compared to November. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the smallest number since January 2015. Bank of England figures also show that UK consumers borrowed an extra \u00c2\u00a31.5bn on credit last month. That pushed the annual growth in credit to 9.5%, up from 9.3%. So, people are finding it harder to buy a new house, and borrowing more on credit to make ends meet. Not a good sign for the UK economy in 2018. Poland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy accelerated last year, according to new data. Poland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP expanded by 4.6% in 2017, up from 2.9% in 2016. Mining companies are leading the selloff today: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major stock markets have all fallen this morning, despite the solid growth figures from France and Spain. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100, the German DAX and the French CAC are all in the red, following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses on Wall Street. The selloff in government bonds in recent days is starting to spook the equity markets, encouraging traders to sell shares. Markets have had a strong run, of course, but analysts are wondering whether a selloff is imminent. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts are likely to push US inflation higher, especially if more firms pass savings onto their staff in pay rises. That in turn increases the chance of US interest rates moving up. Yesterday, Goldman Sachs predicted that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a correction of some kind seems a high probability in the coming months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some reaction to the Spanish growth data: Newsflash: Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.7% in the final quarter of 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a slight slowdown, following 0.8% growth in July-September, but still a decent performance. It should make Spain one of the faster-growing European members. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 3.1% during 2017, matching 2016\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance, according to the INE statistics body. The last few months of 2017 were dominated by the Catalonian independence crisis, as the region tried to break away from Madrd. Update: the pound is slipping lower. The most encouraging part of the French growth report is that business investment has risen sharply. This means French firms have boosted their spending on equipment, offices and factories - a sign that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re more confident about their future prospects. Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig story\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Brexit worries are weighing on the pound again this morning. Sterling has shed half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.402, after leaked government papers showed that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy would be worse off under all three likely Brexit scenarios. My colleague Rowena Mason explains: The document suggested that chemicals, clothing, manufacturing, food and drink, and cars and retail would be the hardest hit and every UK region would also be affected negatively in all the modelled scenarios, with the north-east, the West Midlands and Northern Ireland facing the biggest falls in economic performance. France is benefitting from President Emmanuel Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election win and the upturn in the global economy, says Bloomberg. They add: Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is currently working with unions and business lobbies to overhaul France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job training system, and will move on to unemployment insurance in coming months. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire plans a major economy law for the spring that aims to further loosen restrictions on businesses, as well as increase profit-sharing plans for employees. Newsflash: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.6% in the last three months. Strong business investment and rising exports boosted growth, and compensated for a slowdown in household spending. This means France slightly outpaced Britain, which grew by 0.5% in the last quarter. Statistics body INSEE says: Total gross fixed capital formation (business investment) accelerated slightly to +1.1% after +0.9% Household consumption expenditure slowed down (+0.3% after +0.6%). Foreign trade balance contributed positively to GDP growth (+0.6 points after \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.5 points): exports accelerated markedly (+2.6% after +1.1%) while imports slowed down sharply (+0.7% after +2.4%). Inventory changes made a negative contribution (\u00e2\u02c6\u20190.5 points after +0.3 points). The figures also show that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy expanded by 1.9% during 2017 - the strongest annual growth since 2011. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we learn if Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery is on track. New eurozone growth figures, due at 10am GMT, are expected to show that the single currency bloc expanded by 0.6% in October-December. That would be another solid quarter, as the region puts the debt crisis behind it. Individual figures from France (in a moment) and Spain will also give some country-level insights. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be watching the markets closely. Yesterday, government bond prices fell (pushing up bond yields), fuelling fears that the bull market might be over. Wall Street suffered losses last night, and European markets are expected to drop this morning. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains: After such a promising end to last week where the Dow rallied 200 points to a fresh record close, trading on Monday couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been more different. US stocks experienced a spectacular reversal and plummeted overnight, as the US 10 year treasury yield pushed relentlessly higher. Concerns are starting to enter the market that inflation could be catching up and higher interest rates could pour cold water on the bull run. As the US treasury bond sell off depended, US treasury yields shot up to a peak of 2.73%, the highest level since 2014.The Dow dumped 177 points in its worst trading day so far this year and the S&amp;P dived 0.7%. Plus, new UK consumer credit figures will show if Britons melted their credit cards last month, or reined in spending. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 6.30am GMT: French GDP for Q4 2017 (first estimate) 8am GMT: Spanish GDP for Q 2017 (first estimate 9.30am: UK consumer credit and mortgage approval figures for December 2017 10am: Eurozone GDP for Q4 2017 (first estimate)",
