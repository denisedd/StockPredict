But political uncertainty is now priced in for airlines, while Monarch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse has reduced competition. EasyJet, at \u00c2\u00a314.64, had barely relocated operations to Austria to prepare for Brexit before it started intoning, like a Teutonic avenger, that only the strong would survive. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Gwyn Topham</strong><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2><strong>888</strong></h2> <p>After GVC and Ladbrokes revealed they were in merger talks, bets are being placed on the next gambling industry tie-up.

The presence on its share register of several major holders could be a sticking point but it still seems a racing certainty for some kind of value-creating deal in 2018. <br><strong>Rob Davies</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf9297869268a20c36c494da4b0272f8751ce8ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf9297869268a20c36c494da4b0272f8751ce8ec/0_112_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"SSE\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>SSE</strong></h2> <p>With price caps on the horizon and tough competition from new entrants, one of the big six energy firms might seem an odd share tip. But with the price now at a relatively low \u00c2\u00a313.20 after politicians spent a year bashing energy companies and threatening new regulations, things are looking up for SSE. </p> <p>Lately, the company has been winning in the switching wars. The firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s networks and generation arms are reliable cash machines. The cherry is that shareholders will own two-thirds of the (likely) more competitive energy supplier born out of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/07/sse-npower-talks-merged-energy-supplier\">SSE merging its retail business with Npower</a>. <br><strong>Adam Vaughan</strong><br></p> <h2><strong>Prudential</strong></h2> <p>The insurer, 1905.5p, remains a good pick in its sector. It is one of the leading insurers in Asia, where business is booming (the Pru is in the top three in nine of the 12 countries it operates in). </p> <p>With a push across China, the new chief executive of the Pru\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Asian arm believes Asia can double earnings again over the next five to seven years. </p> <p>The roll-out in Africa continues and in the UK, the Pru and M&amp;G insurance and investment arms have merged. In the US, uncertainty around new rules may affect sales of variable annuities but long-term opportunities in the fee-based adviser market look good. <br><strong>Julia Kollewe</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb6bcf1c0449c3ea4b52041b5179f9d423546f45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb6bcf1c0449c3ea4b52041b5179f9d423546f45/56_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Model of single-molecule thick graphene layers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Model of single-molecule thick graphene layers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: inov-8.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Applied Graphene Materials</strong></p> <p>Graphene was punted as the next big thing a few years back. A one-molecule-thick layer of graphite that is 20 times stronger than diamond and conducts electricity 20 times better than copper, graphene was hailed as a revolutionary material which could be used in everything from medicine to manufacturing. </p> <p>So one of the specialist companies in the field, Applied Graphene Materials, saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/20/applied-graphene-materials-agm-shares-market-debut\">its shares soar</a> when it joined AIM at the end of 2013. </p> <p>But turning technology into commercial applications takes time and its shares have since dropped to new lows. The company has now improved its production processes and its building up orders, as well as boosting its balance sheet with a fundraising in October. One to watch at 42p. <br><strong>Nick Fletcher</strong></p> <h2><strong>BP</strong></h2> <p>Buying shares in oil companies isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the best long-term investment, given the damage to the planet from fossil fuels and the gradual shift toward renewable energy and electric cars. </p> <p>But 2018 could be a good time to own a stake in BP, 522.7p, as it recovers from the depths of the 2014 oil price shock and the Deepwater Horizon disaster. </p> <p>The British oil major has lagged its peers, but next year, there are favourable winds as it comes through a rough patch. Demand for oil is strong amid resurgent growth in the eurozone and China, while Opec is keeping a tight lid on production, limiting supply. </p> <p>Be warned though, weaker growth in China or a resurgent US shale industry could have a negative impact, while there are also potential headwinds from rising tensions in the Middle East. <br><strong>Richard Partington</strong><br></p> <h2><strong>Footasylum</strong></h2> <p>In a fortnight we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out how trainers and hoodie retailer Footasylum fared in its first Christmas as a listed company. </p> <p>In October the retailer debuted on Aim at 164p and has so far climbed to 252.5p. With tough times predicted for retailers in 2018 Footasylum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management team has delivered for investors before with founders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/may/12/7\">David Makin and John Wardle also the creators of JD Sports</a>. </p> <p>Footasylum is run by Clare Nesbitt, Makin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 30-year-old daughter, who has worked for the family firm for eight years.

In 2010, when England did (very marginally) better, ITV investors played a blinder, booking profits of 30%. </p> <p>Can the shares, currently changing hands at around 165.5p, go on a run again? Some City pundits seem to think so, with Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley all supporters. <br><strong>Simon Goodley</strong></p> <h2><strong>Allied Minds</strong></h2> <p>It has been a bad year for famed stock picker Neil Woodford, and one of his worst performers has been Allied Minds. </p> <p>The UK-listed but US-focused company invests in trying to convert academic and US government science and technology research into money-making companies. Unfortunately, not one of its investments has hit the big time and the company has raked up huge losses and lost its long-serving chief executive. </p> <p>But Woodford, who owns nearly a third of the shares has always said this was a long-term play, remains committed and with the shares off 80% in less than three years it could be worth a punt at 165p. <br><strong>Rupert Neate</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e7bc4663b8887b6c3feb438bb3d169a45eed140\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e7bc4663b8887b6c3feb438bb3d169a45eed140/0_0_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gym\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>The Gym Group</strong></h2> <p>As much a New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resolution as a share tip, but the Gym Group seems well placed to take advantage if the population sticks to its vows to look after itself in 2018.</p> <p>The business is a low-cost operator with no long-term contracts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which can be a turn-off when considering the bigger operators \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and charges of about \u00c2\u00a320 a month.

                "bodyText":"Wall Street has kicked off 2018 on a strong note, while stock markets in London and continental Europe are in the red on the first trading day of the year, dragged down by the strong pound and euro. Dow Jones up 0.4% at 24,820.65 S&amp;P 500 up 0.4% at 2684.95 Nasdaq 100 up 1% at 6458.65 UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index down 0.6% at 6738.83 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax down 0.6% at 12,840.20 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC down 0.6% at 5280.24 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex up 0.1% at 10,056.70 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB down 0.3% at 21,793.20 Manufacturing surveys for the UK, US and eurozone have been strong, with the eurozone putting in a record performance in December while the US showed the highest factory growth since 2015. Activity at Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories slowed but was described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153solid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Crude oil and gold have also got off to a good start to 2018. Oil prices saw their strongest start to a year since 2014, amid unrest in Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia. Good-bye for today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we will be back tomorrow. The upturn at US factories was underpinned by faster increases in output and new orders, with manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 output growth reaching an 11-month high. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said the combination of strengthening growth, a solid labour market and rising prices will add to expectations that the Fed will hike interest rates again soon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as soon as March. With business optimism about the year ahead running at its highest for two years in the closing months of 2017, companies are clearly expecting to be busier in 2018. The upbeat mood is underscored by an increased appetite to hire new staff, with the survey indicating that factory payroll numbers are rising at a rate not seen for over three years. The last of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing surveys is out, for the US. The IHS Markit purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index strengthened to 55.1 in December from 53.9 in November, signalling the strongest manufacturing growth since March 2015. The highlight this week is the US non-farm payrolls report for December. It is expected to show a 189,000 increase in jobs, compared with 228,000 in November. The unemployment rate is set to have stayed at 4.1%. ING economist James Smith says: After the hurricanes in September, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been hard to make any real sense of the past few jobs reports. But three months later, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re inclined to say December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers should be close to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnormal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That probably means a return to the underlying trend - something in the region of 170,000 - although an over-correction after a couple of bumper readings can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be ruled out. That said, mid-December appears to have been fairly warm and relatively dry, which may have allowed construction projects and other weather-dependent activities to continue for longer than usual. As December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls data is typically one of the most correlated months to weather patterns, this would be a tailwind for overall jobs growth - although admittedly the effect could be somewhat marginal. But whatever happens, with the economy essentially at full employment, the Fed is well aware jobs growth should be slowing - meaning a sub-consensus number shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bat too many eyelids. We are waiting for the US manufacturing survey for December, which will be out in less than 10 minutes. Wall Street has opened higher, as expected. The Dow Jones is up more than 120 points, or 0.5%, at 24,840; the S&amp;P 500 has opened some 11 points higher at 2682, a 0.4% gain; and the Nasdaq is 33 points ahead, or 0.5%, at 6937. We now have a full story on BP, which today admitted that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sweeping changes to US taxes will knock about $1.5bn off its profits for the end of 2017. Barclays, Shell and Goldman Sachs have made similar statements in recent weeks. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly quiet (and grey) day here in London. US stock futures are pointing to a higher opening for Wall Street. The euro is also higher against the yen, rising as high as 135.64 yen \u00e2\u20ac\u201c levels last seen in late 2015. Against the dollar, it had its best year since 2003 last year as European economies strengthened and amid growing expectations that the European Central Bank would wind down its monetary stimulus programme. Today, the euro high a four-month high of $1.2081. A survey of manufacturing in the eurozone and individual country reports painted a strong picture of the industrial sector. The pound is trading around $1.355, its highest price for more than three months, as investors continue to spurn the dollar despite Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent tax reform success. Yet the pound wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the star of 2018\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first day of trading, noted Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex. No, that honour went to the euro, which showed no sign of shedding the barnstorming form that defined the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final fortnight of 2017. With the eurozone manufacturing PMI at a record high of 60.6 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c prompted by country-specific all-time peaks for Austria, Germany and Ireland \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the euro surged half a percent against the dollar, sending it above $1.206, while nabbing 0.2% off sterling to send its rival to a fresh 5 week nadir. The gains in the euro and sterling have put pressure on stock markets, most of which rose in early trading. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is now down 0.5% while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC has lost more than 1%. The FTSE 100 index in London has slipped 0.45% to 7653.62. Looking at the markets, gold has extended its year-end rally (it gained 4.4% in the last three weeks of 2017). A further retreat in the dollar today drove gold prices above $1,310 an ounce. The dollar posted its biggest annual fall since 2003 last year, helped lift gold by more than 13% over 2017. This morning, spot gold traded 0.7% higher at $1311.30 an ounce. Back to the UK manufacturing survey. Analysts Fabrice Montagne and Sreekala Kochuvodindan at Barclays Capital pointed to the growing gap between the UK and the rest of Europe. Despite edging lower from November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high, manufacturing PMIs remain on a solid footing, supported by the intermediate and investment sectors, while the consumer goods sectors remain in the doldrums. December easing was broad based, but new orders dropped the most and employment cooled to its lowest reading in six months. Price indicators eased somewhat but remain elevated. As long as global growth powers ahead, the UK manufacturing sector will be dragged along, but data point to a continued loss of market share as the economy increasingly feels the pinch of business uncertainty and capacity constraints. Particularly telling is the growing gap between manufacturing momentum in the UK and the European Area. Returning to cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is apparently a bit pass\u00c3\u00a9. According to Bloomberg, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best-known digital currency is losing ground to rivals such as monero \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a new favourite with criminals. Bloomberg reported: The European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s law-enforcement agency, Europol, raised alarms three months ago, writing in a report that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153other cryptocurrencies such as monero, ethereum and Zcash are gaining popularity within the digital underground.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Online extortionists, who use ransomware to lock victims\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 computers until they fork over a payment, have begun demanding those currencies instead. On Dec. 18 hackers attacked up to 190,000 WordPress sites per hour to get them to produce monero, according to security company Wordfence. Bitcoin is trading slightly lower today at $13,445, close to a one-month low. Here is our full story on the manufacturing data. ING economist James Smith said this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153buoyant activity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories had taken some time to filter through to the official manufacturing data, although the latest readings had been more encouraging. The manufacturing sector continues to be a clear bright spot, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth remembering that it makes up a relatively small share of the overall economy. Elsewhere, there are few obvious catalysts for a pick-up in consumer spending, particularly with real wages set to be more or less flat this year. This will offset any further manufacturing gains and limit overall growth to around 1.4% in 2018. This will continue to make life difficult for the Bank of England, who we think have a relatively narrow window before the summer if they want to squeeze in another hike. Brexit noise could really ramp up in the autumn, ahead of October when some kind of deal realistically needs to be agreed to allow time for ratification. The question is what the survey data means for UK interest rates. Smith added: Policymakers have signalled they are inclined to increase rates again if the opportunity arises, particularly now that a transition period is likely to be agreed at some point in the first quarter. But a benign outlook for growth and inflation means a rate hike is still far from a done deal. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more detail on the UK factory survey. Survey compiler IHS Markit said demand improved from clients in Europe, the US, China and the Middle East. Nearly 54% of companies were expecting production to rise over the coming year. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, summed up the findings: UK manufacturing ended 2017 on a positive footing. Although growth of output and new orders moderated during December, rates of expansion remained comfortably above long-term trend rates. The sector has therefore broadly maintained its solid boost to broader economic expansion in the fourth quarter. The main growth engines were the intermediate and investment goods sectors during December, suggesting resilient business-to-business demand and capital spending trends, albeit in part due to rising exports. Growth in the consumer goods sector remained weak in comparison and was the only sub-industry to see output expand at a slower pace than November. JPMorgan economist Malcolm Barr noted that last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop in the UK manufacturing PMI reversed the gain that had been recorded in November, but described the output and new orders balances as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153healthy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at 58.9 and 57.2 respectively \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consistent with high frequency measures of growth in manufacturing output running near a 4% pace\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He added: While the easiest story to tell on manufacturing strength is that it is a by-product of exchange rate weakness and the strength of the expansion abroad, it remains the case that this is not obvious from the PMI data itself: the new export orders reading is running slightly below that for new orders as a whole. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to the UK manufacturing PMI, a monthly snapshot of activity at the end of the year. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, says: While weaker than November, the December PMI is still a pretty solid survey which indicates that manufacturing likely posted another strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2017 after being very much the UK economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brightest sector in the third quarter. Manufacturers will be hoping that the UK and EU make rapid progress in 2018 on a transition arrangement after agreeing to move to phase two of Brexit negotiations and that this encourages businesses to be more positive in their investment decisions and purchases of capital goods. European stock markets are now weaker. In London, the FTSE 100 index lost nearly 20 points, or 0.2%, to 7660.60, dragged down by mining stocks and a rising pound. There was also talk of profit taking, after mining stocks had a strong run last week. Dollar-earning exporters were the worst hit while smaller stocks, which are less exposed to the stronger pound, gained 0.1%. The pan-European Stoxx 60 index fell 0.4% while eurozone stocks lost 0.5%. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The DAX and the CAC 40 are in the red as the strength of the euro is holding back the eurozone indices. Shares in BP are down 0.5% after the company stated it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expects to take a hit of $1.5bn due to the changes in US tax changes. The oil titan also stated it would benefit from the new tax regime in the long-run. BP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has been pushing higher since August and the recent surge in the oil market has assisted it too. He is expecting the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 to open higher. The average reading over the final quarter of 2017 (57.0) was the best since the second quarter of 2014, according to IHS Markit, which compiled the survey. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector expanded strongly at the end of last year, although at a slower pace than before. The UK PMI from Markit/CIPS fell to 56.3 in December from November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 51-month high of 58.2. It remained well above the 50 mark which separates expansion from contraction. Output, new orders and employment all rose at solid rates. It is the first data release of 2018. Meanwhile, Russia is looking at ways to create a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cryptorouble\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that could help the country get around western sanctions. The Financial Times reported: Moscow officials say that President Vladimir Putin has commissioned work on establishing a cryptocurrency, as state-run Russian institutions rush to embrace blockchain, the shared ledger technology on which bitcoin and other digital currencies are based. Sergei Glazev, an economic adviser to Mr Putin, told a recent government meeting that a cryptorouble would be a useful tool to get around international sanctions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This instrument suits us very well for sensitive activity on behalf of the state. We can settle accounts with our counterparties all over the world with no regard for sanctions,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mr Glazev said. In the UK, average rail are rising by 3.4% on average from today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the biggest increase since 2013. Labour and trade unions condemned \u00e2\u20ac\u0153staggering\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd annual increases to rail fares, which triggered protests at dozens of stations in England. Season tickets are up by 3.6%, more than the consumer price index inflation rate and well above average increases in people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual earnings. Analysis by the Labour party showed the average season ticket would cost \u00c2\u00a32,888 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a3694 more than in 2010 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a rise of more than 30%. The government and rail operators defended the fare rises, saying they would lead to more investment in services. You can read more here.

For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector as a whole has hit a record high. Strong readings for output, new orders and employment pushed the final IHS Market eurozone manufacturing PMI to 60.6 in December, the highest level since the survey began in mid-1997. It compares with 60.1 in November. Readings for Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Ireland were at or close to record highs. In Germany, the manufacturing PMI hit a record high at the end of 2017. The index cloimbed to 63.3 in December from 62.5 in November. Phil Smith, chief economist at IHS Markit, which compiled the survey, hailed a record-breaking year for the Germany manufacturing sector. The current 37-month sequence of improving business conditions surpassed the previous record set in the run up to the financial crisis. The goods-producing economy carries strong momentum into 2018, with new order growth at its highest for almost eight years and rising backlogs of work pointing to the need for further expansion in capacity. Business confidence rebounded back up to an elevated level by historical standards in December, further adding to the positive outlook. The French survey showed the strongest growth in manufacturing since September 2000. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI rose to 58.8 in December from 57.7 in November, with new orders expanding at the fastest pace since November 2010 and business confidence hitting a 5 1/2 year high. The Italian manufacturing PMI also slipped, to 57.4 in December from November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 58.3, but remained high. November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading was the best in over 6 1/2 years. Paul Smith, director at IHS Markit which compiles the survey, said: Growth of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector was sustained at an impressive pace as 2017 drew to a close, with the latest data confirming that industry remains a key driver of overall economic expansion. With strong demand from abroad \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and widespread expectations amongst manufacturers that this will continue in the months ahead \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the sector has momentum and is well placed to enjoy a strong start to 2018. Although the pipeline of new orders remains extremely positive, there are downside risks to sector expansion coming from the supply side. Vendors are struggling to keep up with surging demand, are running low on stocks and having to raise list prices, all factors that could place constraints on manufacturing growth in the months ahead. The Spanish manufacturing PMI is out, and shows another strong performance by Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial sector in December. Production rose sharply and companies took on more workers after an increase in export orders. The headline index slipped to 55.8 from 56.1 in November but remained well above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. The output sub-index hit a 31-month high. New business continued to increase, albeit at the slowest pace in three months, but export orders were up sharply. Andrew Harker, associate director at IHS Markit said: Spanish manufacturers ended 2017 on a high, the sector registering further strong improvements in December. Although new order growth eased, firms continued to ramp up production and took on extra staff at a near-record pace, reflecting the success they have had in securing new work over recent months. 2017 has been a strong year overall, with the average PMI reading the best since 2006. The sector therefore is in good shape heading into 2018. Turning to stock markets, the French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese markets are all up while the UK and German markets have opened slightly lower. UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 down 0.1% at 7679.57 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax down 0.2% at 12,894.03 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC up 0.03% at 5314.20 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex up 0.3% at 10,071.50 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB up 0.2% at 21,904.35 Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PSI 20 up 0.3% at 5405.83 Oil prices have got off to their strongest start to a year since 2014. Continued supply cuts by the oil cartel OPEC and Russia, along with anti-government protests in Iran, have lifted crude to the highest levels since mid-2015. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, rose as high as $67.29 a barrel while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures hit a peak of $60.74, the highest since June 2015. It is the first time since January 2014 that both crude oil benchmarks started the year above $60 a barrel, according to Reuters. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Caixin manufacturing PMI jumped to 51.5 in December from 50.8 in November, and was stronger than expected. In Japan, the Nikkei manufacturing PMI fell to 49.9 in December from 51.2 in November, with almost all subindices weakening. Analysts at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics were cautious about the Chinese outlook. The input price index continued to fall, despite the rally in China related commodity price in Q4 last year. Industrial profits growth deteriorated sharply in November. Firms could have booked profits earlier in the year, so profits possibly are holding up better than the headline suggests. At this point, we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell. At the same time, the output price index continues to show that businesses are having difficulty in passing on the pipeline pressures, despite buoyant consumer confidence. New orders picked up sharply, implying that officials could be lifting anti-pollution production and construction curbs earlier than planned. Some of the final demand likely is foreign, though, with the new export orders index also moving higher. The index generally isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t useful as a leader of actual export growth, but external demand should hold up or even strengthen in the case of the US. The PMI should tick lower again in January, though, as the jump in December looks erratic. Copper is pushing higher on expectations that demand in China, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest consumer of industrial metals, will rise this year. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose to $7,260 a tonne. The contract ended 2017 with a 31% gain, reaching prices last seen in January 2014, according to Reuters data. Good morning, and Happy New Year! Welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first day of the 2018 trading year, and futures are pointing to a higher open on European stock markets. Global stock markets ended 2017 on record highs: they gained $9tn (\u00c2\u00a36.7tn) in value over the year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c supported by a strong worldwide economy, president Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts and central banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 go-slow approach to easing financial support. The MSCI all-country world index rose 22% to close an all-time high of 514.53. The FTSE 100 in London hit a new peak, ending 2017 at 7687.77 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up 7.6% over the year. It lagged behind other stock markets, though \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei increased 19%; in the US the Nasdaq 100 posted a 32% rise while the Dow Jones gained nearly 26%, and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose almost 13%. Agenda We are expecting a raft of monthly manufacturing reports from the UK, the eurozone and the US today. The Spanish manufacturing PMI is due out at 8:15am GMT, followed by Italy at 8:45am, France at 8:50am, Germany at 8:55am and the eurozone at 9:00am. The UK manufacturing PMI will be released at 9:30am and the equivalent US survey at 2:45pm GMT.",

William Anderson Jones, head of UK corporate dealing at RationalFX, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite forecasts expecting an unchanged figure of 53.1, Construction PMI underwhelmed analysts after falling to 52.2 on the back of weaker housebuilding and a decline in commercial building.

Exactly 37% of the survey panel forecast a rise in construction activity over the course of 2018, while around 11% anticipate a reduction.

                "bodyText":"After Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing UK manufacturing survey, the construction data for December was also underwhelming. The IHS/Markit construction PMI saw a slowdown in growth for the first time since September. All eyes will now be on the UK services figures due out on Thursday to get a clear snapshot of how the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy performed in the final month of 2017. Earlier there was positive news from Germany, with the jobless rate at a record low of 5.5%. Better than expected Christmas trading from Next lifted the retailers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shares and gave investors hope for the whole sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s festive performance. But the rise in Next shares was not enough to lift the UK market out of the post-holiday doldrums, with the FTSE 100 slipping back and forth from postive to negative. The index is currently up 0.13% but European markets have turned in a better performance and Wall Street has opened higher. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The record breaking run on Wall Street continues, at least as far as the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are concerned. The S&amp;P is up 0.11% and Nasdaq 0.15% better at the open, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 0.02% higher in early trading. The pattern of a rise in European markets and a slight dip in the FTSE 100 continues. Markets appear to have shrugged off any worries about the new regulatory regime - Mifid II - which comes into effect today. Mike van Dulken and Henry Croft at Accendo Markets said: Global equities are generally positive as investors calmly digest the impact of the vast MiFID II regulation taking effect across the globe, while trading volumes gradually return following the New Year. German stocks are outperforming as the US dollar rebounds from its lows, denting Euro strength to aid the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exporting names, while the flat FTSE 100 comes as a result of GBP/USD weakness offsetting GBP/EUR strength. Reuters has a report on the new rules: The rollout of new rules on Wednesday that aim to make European Union financial markets safer and more transparent has been glitch-free so far, though disruptions cannot be ruled out, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets watchdog said. The new regime shines a spotlight on the inner workings of stock, bond, commodity and derivatives markets by forcing banks, asset managers and traders to provide detailed information on trillions of euros in transactions. Big banks spent an estimated $2 billion collectively last year to upgrade IT systems to prepare. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we can see for our part, is no glitches so far,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Steven Maijoor, chairman of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), told reporters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It will be the first time we have a complete overview of all financial instruments in the EU.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European stock and bond volumes were light in early trading. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So far [there is] no difference compared to a regular day,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Markus Huber, a trader at City of London Markets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Volume isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected to be massive or back to normal either due to not everybody being back from holidays, and not much going on in regard to major news or economic data.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ...The new rules, known as Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II), were delayed by a year to give banks, asset managers and exchanges more time to get ready... Market nerves were eased by ESMA announcing measures just before Christmas to give companies more time to comply with some key requirements. Oil is edging higher again, helped by the output caps from Opec and Russia and concerns about the protests in Iran. Brent crude is currently up 0.63% to $66.99 a barrel, having earlier climbed as high as $67.08. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the UK construction figures, from Richard Partington: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction industry is its least optimistic for five years amid fears over Brexit and an economic slowdown, according to a survey. Despite some pockets of strength as building firms won the most work for several months in December, the balance of companies expecting a rise in output levels over the next 12 months was the weakest recorded since mid-2013, according to the Markit/Cips UK construction PMI. The gauge of sentiment among executives at 170 construction firms fell to 52.2 in December from 53.1 in November \u00e2\u20ac\u201c worse than forecast by City economists \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although still remained above the 50 level indicating expansion. The dip in the PMI reflected falling volumes of commercial work, offset by growing numbers of housebuilding projects. The prospect of greater workloads led firms to take on staff and buy materials at the fastest pace in two years over December. Strength in the housebuilding sector is likely to please government ministers trying to fix the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing crisis, after the Conservatives pledged to build 300,000 new homes a year in the budget. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, also ploughed an additional \u00c2\u00a310bn into the help-to-buy loan scheme and cut stamp duty for most first-time buyers. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics said support from the government \u00e2\u20ac\u0153should keep housebuilding motoring along\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in 2018, although warned construction output overall was likely to flatline. The full report is here: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more from IHS Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economist on the construction data: Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: A construction sector slip did little for either the FTSE or pound this Wednesday morning. Like Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing figure, the most recent construction PMI fell short of expectations, coming in at 52.2 against the 52.8 forecast and the 53.1 seen in November. While neither of December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMIs have been disastrous, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nevertheless a slight whiff of disappointment that the robust levels seen in November couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last a bit longer. All this helped edge cable into the red, though even with a 0.2% decline the pound is still circling a 3 and a half month high against the dollar; against the euro it fared better, rising 0.1% as its rival gave back some of its recent growth (the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also down 0.3% against the greenback). The FTSE, meanwhile, strained to keep the right side of the red/green divide, the index struggling to shake its sluggish start to 2018 despite the newfound \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if fragile \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sense of optimism in the retail sector following Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprisingly solid Christmas figures. As for the Eurozone indices, with the euro taking a breather from the vertiginous climb seen in the last few weeks the DAX and CAC attempted to right yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrongs. Both the German and French indices rose 0.6%, allowing them to cross 12900 and 5300 respectively. The pound is holding up fairly well despite the weaker than expected UK construction data, with sterling down 0.18% against the dollar at $1.3562. But with underwhelming manufacturing figures on Tuesday following by these construction numbers, all eyes will be on the service sector data on Thursday for more insight into how the UK economy ended the year. William Anderson Jones, head of UK corporate dealing at RationalFX, said: Despite forecasts expecting an unchanged figure of 53.1, Construction PMI underwhelmed analysts after falling to 52.2 on the back of weaker housebuilding and a decline in commercial building. The pound was holding near yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highs against a weak dollar in the early hours of trading this morning as investors awaited the data, but the currency appears to have been able to shrug off the weak figures. Following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpected dip in Manufacturing PMI and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker Construction data, investors will be looking for signs to help strengthen confidence in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic outlook. As one of the strongest indicators of the health of the economy at the end of last year, analysts will be directing their attention to the release of Services PMI later this week. The markets could see a more notable reaction from sterling depending on the strength or weakness of the services sector, and following less than promising signs from data released so far, investors may be bracing themselves for some volatility should figures point to Brexit-based pressure on the economy ahead of a crucial year for negotiations. Back with the construction PMIs, Balraj Sroya, sales trader at Foenix Partners, said: After a subpar PMI figure from the manufacturing industry yesterday that slipped from four-year highs, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI print followed suit, missing forecasts coming out at 52.2. While both sets of PMIs were above the crucial 50 level showing expansion in the sector, there was still doubt that stellar figures would be reached once again. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure is weighed down by the moderate downturn in commercial projects combined with stagnated expansion in the home building sector. However, investors are still forecasting an increase in construction activity throughout 2018, which fuels views that the UK economy saw an unexpected slowdown at the end of 2017 and is expected to get back on track shortly. Tomorrow services PMI is being released, which is the largest sector in the UK and investors along with the Bank of England will be looking closely to see if this is a turning point for the UK economy and whether or not 2018 will be as prosperous as many think. The FTSE 100 has drifted lower after its initial gains thanks to UK retailers, and is now off 0.01%. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: The FTSE has continued to flounder on the second trading day of 2018, even though the US, Asian, and mainland European markets have pushed higher. The disappointing UK construction PMI forms the second disappointing UK PMI survey is as many days, with the pound drifting marginally lower as a result. Unfortunately, the weaker pound has done little to help the FTSE, which has been dragged lower thanks to yet another poor showing from the miners thanks to ripples in the recent gold and copper resurgence story. The UK services PMI reading is due on Thursday morning, and a third disappointing survey would provide yet another reason to sell the pound. More reaction to the UK construction data. Here is Investec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Philip Shaw: Max Jones, Global Corporates relationship director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said: A downbeat PMI in December capped off a difficult year for construction firms. The great unknown is what this year holds and how the economy will react to the next phase of the Brexit negotiations. In the second half of last year, many construction businesses focused on shoring up their balance sheets, putting them in the best possible position to invest and ride out any turbulence. Looking ahead, there are several trends we expect to see play out in 2018, some a continuation of developments in recent years. Some firms will invest in tech and automation, helping a sector that is still quite old-fashioned to transition to a more productive future. Meanwhile, contractors will continue to focus on developing specialisms with an increasing reliance on fewer, bigger-spending clients in key sub-sectors. Another expectation is that we will see businesses make smaller, targeted acquisitions to fill in gaps in their expertise. But it is unlikely that a mega-merger is on the cards because of the inherent risk in combining balance sheets and order books. Tim Moore, associate director at IHS Markit and author of the IHS Markit/CIPS Construction PMI said: The UK construction sector achieved a moderate expansion of business activity at the end of 2017, although the recovery remained uneven and slowed overall since November. Construction companies indicated that another strong contribution from house building helped to offset subdued civil engineering activity and reduced volumes of commercial work. Total new orders picked up at the fastest pace for seven months in December, which provides a positive signal for construction workloads in the short-term. Resilient demand and forthcoming project starts also led to greater job creation and the strongest increase in input buying for two years. However, construction firms indicated that longer- term business confidence is still relatively subdued, largely reflecting concerns about the domestic economic outlook. Exactly 37% of the survey panel forecast a rise in construction activity over the course of 2018, while around 11% anticipate a reduction. As a result, the balance of UK construction companies expecting growth in the year ahead remains among the weakest recorded by the survey since mid-2013. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IHS Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief business economist: Growth in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector slowed down last month after forecasts of an unchanged figure. The December construction PMI came in at 52.2, down from a five month high of 53.1 and the first slowdown since September. Weaker growth in housebuilding and a fall in commercial building combined with slower infrastructure work to bring about the decline. But the new orders index rose from 52.9 in November to 53.1, according to IHS Markit, the highest since May 2017. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment figures have beaten analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts. The seasonally adjusted jobless total fell by 29,000 to 2.44m, compared to estimates of a 12,000 decrease. The jobless rate was unchanged at 5.5% after November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading was revised down from 5.6%. Here is our report on the Next figures. Sarah Butler writes: Next has raised hopes for the retail sector by revealing a better than expected Christmas, with strong online sales offsetting a fall at its high street stores. In a trading statement, the clothing and home chain said sales rose 1.5% in the 54 days to 24 December. A fall of 0.3% had been forecast. Shares in Next, the first major retailer to report on festive trading, jumped almost 10% in early trading. Marks &amp; Spencer and Primark-owner Associated British Foods were also up, rising about 3%, on hopes that they may also have fared better than expected. The retailer upgraded its profit expectations for the year to January by \u00c2\u00a38m, to \u00c2\u00a3725m, after sales benefited from the colder weather in the run up to Christmas. Profit guidance is now between \u00c2\u00a3718m and \u00c2\u00a3732m and performance will depend on the clearance sales in January. Next said that all its growth came online, where sales rose 13.6%. The chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high street stores suffered a 6.1% slump. That pattern is expected to be repeated across the retail sector as companies including Marks &amp; Spencer, Debenhams, John Lewis and House of Fraser next week reveal how they fared over the most important part of the trading year. The full story is here: Now for a quick look at our favourite cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is currently up nearly 3% at $15,083, continuing its New Year rebound. Naeem Aslam at Thinkmarkets said: Bitcoin has bounced back up after a Wall Street Journal report showed that a venture firm (which has a track record on betting on big firms like Airbnb and SpaceX) has been accumulating bitcoin and the fund may be holding approximately $20million worth of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has crossed above the 15K mark, an important resistance level broken, and this opens the floor for Bitcoin to move towards the 20K mark (as long as it stays above 15K). Helped by Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than expected Christmas update, the FTSE 100 has opened higher, while European markets are also making a positive start. Next is up nearly 10%, while Primark owner Associated British Foods and Marks and Spencer are both around 3% better. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.11% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has opened 0.4% higher ahead of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment data and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.2%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alistair Davies of Investec on Next: Expect some share price relief that Christmas wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as bad as expected and no further downgrades. However, we would caution against reading too much across to other retail stocks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the reality is that even though Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christmas numbers are better than expected, the company has still had a tough Christmas. More on Next. The retailer has raised its full year profit forecast for 2018 after better than expected sales in the run-up to Christmas, with cold weather boosting demand for winter clothing. It now expects full year profits of \u00c2\u00a3725m, up from its previous guidance of \u00c2\u00a3717m but below the \u00c2\u00a3790m it made the previous year. And it did warn of continuing challenges, not least from subdued consumer demand thanks to the squeeze on real incomes. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are expected to open higher after the update. But analysts at Beaufort Securities were unimpressed, issuing a sell note following the update and pointing out a profit downgrade for 2019: Next is an interesting beast, very cash generative, decent balance sheet (net debt of circa \u00c2\u00a3950m), growing on line sales but declining sales in its shops. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales news is positive although nothing like a reversal of Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long term high street decline. And the outlook statement is less positive, with FY19 profit guidance of \u00c2\u00a3705m (down 3% on FY18 to Jan) and free cash (for divis and share buybacks) of \u00c2\u00a3525m versus a market cap of \u00c2\u00a36.57bn. Here are the opening calls for European markets from IG: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unspectacular UK manufacturing data - Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories saw a slowdown in December but the performance was described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153solid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - comes the latest snapshot of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction industry. Analysts are expecting an unchanged figure from November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 53.1. Also coming up are German unemployment figures which are forecast to show an improvement from November. Elsewhere the oil price has slipped back after the Iran protests pushed Brent to a peak of $67 a barrel on Tuesday, its highest level since May 2015. And European markets are expected to open higher in the main after Wall Street hit new records, although the FTSE 100 is forecast to be fairly flat. The strength of the pound against the dollar is likely to undermine the leading UK index, packed as it is with overseas earners who benefit from a weaker sterling. There are also some positive trading figures from Next for the Christmas period, the first indicator of how the high street performed over the festive period. The agenda: 8.55 GMT German unemployment 9.30 GMT UK construction PMIs",

                "bodyText":"A late PS: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market did indeed end the day at fresh record levels. Having burst through 25,000 at the open, the Dow Jones industrial average finished at 25,075, up 152 points. Now, as James Mackintosh of the Wall Street Journal points out, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a number... He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right about the Dow being imperfectly designed too -- it only contains 30 companies, so can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t properly represent the US economy. Right, time for a recap. Global stock markets have romped to fresh all-time highs today as 2018 begins where 2017 left off - with shares rising across the world. A renewed burst of investor confidence swept America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones industrial average over the 25,000 point mark for the first time - meaning it has gained around 25% in the last 12 months. Traders drove the Dow up after payroll figures showed that American companies hired 250,000 workers last month - the best reading since March. It suggests that tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs report (the non-farm payroll) figures could be better than expected. Jacob Deppe, Head of Trading at online trading platform, Infinox, reckons the Dow could hit 26,000 points soon: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the Dow Jones hitting 25,000 for the first time there seems no end in sight to a stock market rally spurred on by much stronger than expected jobs data for December, offering yet further evidence of the strength of the US economy. Most analysts had expected 190,000 jobs to have been created in the month but 250,000 jobs blew that number apart. Little wonder the Dow Jones soared to a new all time record high soon after. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets will expect a big number from official Non-Farm Payrolls data tomorrow, anything much less than 250,000 will be considered a disappointment. The rally gave president Trump an excuse not to think about Michael Wolff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new book; he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just claimed that the Dow could go a lot higher yet.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 also scaled new peaks, closing at a new all-time high. Other European stock markets also had a strong day, with the Stoxx 600 index up almost 1%. Shares jumped as new data showed that eurozone companies were growing at the fastest rate since 2011. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector also beat expectations, although there are still signs that Brexit uncertainty is hitting investment. The rally began in Japan, where stocks jumped to their highest levels in 26 years as trading resumed after the New Year break. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today (although I may pop back later with the close of Wall Street....) According to US reporters, Donald Trump has set the Dow Jones a new target - 30,000 points. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 250 index has hit a new closing high (again) too. The index, which contains smaller companies than the FTSE 100, gained 0.37% today to close at 20,820 points. Shares in Debenhams ended the day down almost 15%, at 30.34p. That lowers its market capitalisation to just \u00c2\u00a3370m, from \u00c2\u00a3435m yesterday (according to my calculations anyway). The news that sales since Christmas had been disappointing obviously worried the City. Healthcare chain NMC Health was the best-performing member of the FTSE 100 today, helping to push it to new heights. But Marks &amp; Spencer dragged the index back, and was the worst-performing member (blame Debenham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning). Boom! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has hit a new record closing high, at 7,695.88 points. The blue-chip index gained 24 points today, sending it over the previous record close - set on the final day of trading last year. At one stage, the Footsie poked its nose over over 7,700 points. The rally was led by energy stocks, miners, technology stocks and financial firms. Consumer companies lagged behind, though, following Debenham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpected profit warning this morning. There are just 10 minutes of the trading day left in Europe, and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is on track to hit a new closing high..... US president Donald Trump has welcomed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market rally - along with a non-too subtle attempt to take some of the credit: Chipmaker Intel is bucking the trend, though, plunging by over 4.5% this morning. That follows the discovery of a very serious security vulnerability in its processors, which could expose many millions of people to cybercriminals. My colleague Sam Gibbs explains: The flaws, named Meltdown and Spectre, were discovered by security researchers at Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Project Zero in conjunction with academic and industry researchersfrom several countries. Combined they affect virtually every modern computer, including smartphones, tablets and PCs from all vendors and running almost any operating system. Meltdown is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153probably one of the worst CPU bugs ever found\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said Daniel Gruss, one of the researchers at Graz University of Technology who discovered the flaw. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest story: The Dow is continuing to hit new heights, and is now up 173 points or 0.7% at 25,097. Wall Street titans Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are the biggest risers, both up around 2%, followed by American Express and IBM. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Associated Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wall Street action: The Dow Jones industrial average traded above 25,000 points for the first time, blasting through another 1,000-point milestone. The Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest breakthrough came in early trading Thursday and just five weeks after closing above 24,000 points for the first time. Technology companies and banks had some of the biggest gains in early trading. Wells Fargo rose 1.9 percent and Microsoft rose 0.7 percent. The Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 500 index rose 9 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,722. The Dow Jones industrials increased 118 points, or 0.5 percent, to 25,037. The Nasdaq climbed 16 points, or 0.2 percent, to 7,081. Update: Get out the Dow 25k hats! The Dow Jones industrial average has just risen through the 25,000 point mark for the first time ever, as it keeps hitting new highs. The bull market has swept shares upwards in the last year or so - 12 months ago, the Dow was below 20k. Boom! America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has hit a new alltime high at the start of trading. Although the weather is pretty awful in New York, with temperatures below freezing, the mood on Wall Street is positively fizzling. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 67 points at the open, a gain of 0.27%, to 24,990 points for the first time ever. Traders are impressed by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ADP jobs report, showing the strongest employment growth since March. Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics is also impressed by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs report. He writes: That 250,000 ADP gain, up from 185,000 in November, was probably skewed upwards by the recent strength of the official non-farm payrolls figures, however, which are used as one of the inputs. Nevertheless, after the earlier disruption caused by the hurricanes, the labour market clearly ended 2017 with some considerable momentum. Looking at the ADP details, the gains were broad-based, with the manufacturing sector adding 9,000 jobs and construction adding 16,000. Within the services sector, the 72,000 gain in professional &amp; business services was particularly encouraging, since jobs in that sector tend to be relatively well paid. Job creation is great, but where is the wage growth, analysts at Danske Bank wonder..... America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labor market got a pre-Christmas boost, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Analytics, (which helps produce the ADP jobs report). Zandi says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The job market ended the year strongly,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Robust Christmas sales prompted retailers and delivery services to add to their payrolls. The tight labor market will get even tighter, raising the specter that it will overheat.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd NEWSFLASH: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector created many more jobs than expected last month, in the latest sign that the US economy is robust. US companies hired 250,000 new workers in December, according to payroll firm ADP. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest monthly increase since March, Economists had only expected an increase of 190,000; this suggests that tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll report (the main US employment gauge) could be strong. Service sector companies provided the bulk of the new jobs; including 72,000 new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprofessional and business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 roles. Cyprus has begun the year on an optimistic note, reports my colleague Helena Smith. Cyprus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 statistics service announced that unemployment dropped by an unprecedented 15% last month reinforcing evidence that the euro zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most easterly member state is en route to making a remarkable economic recovery following the island\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near financial meltdown in 2013. 35,771 people were registered as unemployed in December, the lowest rates since December 2011, according to Cystat. The drop was attributed squarely to the construction sector which is rebounding with the recovery. Unemployment in the midst of crisis reached an all-time high of 53,204 in February 2014. In his New Year address, president Nicos Anastasiades described 2017 as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a year of stability and development\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd saying\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have no doubt that each and every one of us reasonably feel that hope is rising in our country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The leader, who is currently making the first ever visit to Saudi Arabia by a Cypriot head of state, has pledged to make sound fiscal policy a priority if he is re-elected in upcoming presidential elections. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lunchtime! Now, for the average worker this means a quick scamper to the canteen, sandwich shop or supermarket (unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re organised enough to bring your own provisions). But for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top bosses, it means something quite different. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve now earned the average UK annual wage since the start of 201 -- ie, in just two and a half working days. My colleague Rupert Neate explains: The chief executives of FTSE 100 companies are paid a median average of \u00c2\u00a33.45m a year, which works out at 120 times the \u00c2\u00a328,758 collected by full-time UK workers on average. On an hourly basis the bosses will have earned more in less than three working days than the average employee will pick up this year, leading campaigners to dub the day \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fat Cat Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady, the TUC general secretary, said it was outrageous that bosses were picking up \u00e2\u20ac\u0153salaries that look like telephone numbers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while workers were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153suffering the longest pay squeeze since Napoleonic times\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More here: German supermarket chain Aldi had a rather better Christmas than poor old Debenhams. Strong demand for treats like mince pies, glitzy gammon joints and Irish cream liqueur helped Aldi to grow its total sales by 15% over the Christmas period. This means Aldi probably achieved \u00c2\u00a310bn of sales in the UK last year, for the first time. Martin Lane, Managing Editor of money.co.uk, says Aldi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation for low prices and bargains means it is thriving in the current economic climate: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a nation of shoppers, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking after the pound in our pocket more and more, and with their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153specially selected\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd premium items Aldi is offering the same package as the other big 4 retailers but without the expensive price tag. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aldi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Specialbuys and Super 6 offers continue to make headlines and get customers through their doors and over the festive season their competitive Christmas veg prices made them a huge contender. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aldi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever-increasing popularity suggests there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of a slowdown for the discount giant.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Debenhams shares are still being thumped by investors. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re currently down 16% at just under 30p, down from 35.56p last night. That has knocked Debenham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market capitalisation down from \u00c2\u00a3435m to just \u00c2\u00a3365m - which makes Debs quite a minor player. In comparison, Marks &amp; Spencer is worth \u00c2\u00a35.2bn, and Next is valued at over \u00c2\u00a37bn. WH Smiths, the newsagent, has a market cap of \u00c2\u00a32.5bn while Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is \u00c2\u00a32.1bn. But Debenham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plight is best illustrated with a comparison to Fever-Tree, a company founded less than 14 years ago to produce high-end tonic water and other soft drinks. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now valued at almost \u00c2\u00a32.6bn! David Madden of CMC Markets: Debenhams had a disappointing Christmas period and the retailer has issued a profit warning. The retailer cited a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvolatile and competitive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 market for the drop in sales. Debenhams now predicts that full-year profits will be within the range of \u00c2\u00a355 million to \u00c2\u00a365 million, which is a considerable decline on the previous forecast of \u00c2\u00a383 million. The stock has been in decline for over five years, and if this trend continues it could target 20p. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcStrong growth for its digital offering has failed to save Debenhams from a miserable end to the year. Customers turned out for Christmas, but refused to put their hands in their pockets in the lead up to the festive period, or indeed the Boxing Day sales. Debenhams has been forced to cut prices to persuade shoppers to part with their cash, and as a result margins have been squeezed, profits have been significantly downgraded, and the share price has taken a massive hit. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor: Turns out Next may have given retail sector investors a false sense of security yesterday. Debenhams brought things down to earth with a bump, warning that the fourth quarter of 2017 was bookended by weak trade and that heavy discounting has damaged margins. Getting back to Debenhams.... CEO Sergio Bucher has been speaking to reporters following this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning. Bucher says that Debenhams will speed up its cost-cutting plans - although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not planning to close stores (on top of the 10 already earmarked for closure) Bucher says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There will be some jobs that will go - we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be creating jobs as well. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what happens when you reorganise teams.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In other news, consumer credit growth in the UK has slowed - perhaps a sign that people are cutting back their spending. Annual credit growth slowed to 8.5% in the three months to November, new Bank of England figures show, down from 9.3% in the quarter to October. The pick-up in service sector growth in December suggests that Britain has shrugged off its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft patch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 early last year, says Kallum Pickering of Berenberg bank. But, he still thinks it would have done better without the looming exit from the EU: The UK economy probably expanded by 1.8% yoy in 2017. While this is below the 2% annual average for the post-Lehman period, it is probably at, or even a little above, what the UK can manage on trend outside of the EU. To be fair, relative to the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very depressed growth expectations for 2017 following the Brexit vote in 2016, the UK did much better than expected last year. That is, however, not to say that Brexit did not hurt. Growth in the US and the Eurozone, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major trading partners, accelerated to well above the average of recent years. The uncertainty from Brexit prevented the UK from fully enjoying the tailwind from the synchronised global upswing. Without Brexit, the UK economy would have expanded by at least 2.5% last year. Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector picked up pace in December, suggesting the economy is holding up well. The UK services PMI, produced by data firm Markit, has jumped to 54.2 for last month, from 53.8 in November. Any reading over 50 shows growth, and this is the second-highest score since last April. Companies reported that business activity growth picked up last month; however, new work and employment numbers rose at a slower pace. Overall, the PMI survey indicates that the UK grew at a pretty steady pace at the end of last year.... However, there are also signs that Brexit uncertainty is deterring some clients from spending money, undermining Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longer-term prospects, Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Williamson explains: Digging into the details behind the resilient strength signalled by the headline numbers, the survey data reveal an economy that is beset with uncertainty about the outlook, which is in turn dampening business spending and investment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trends in hiring and business investment in fixed assets such as offices are showing signs of deteriorating, as is expenditure on IT, computing and other business services as worries about Brexit result in delayed spending decisions. Rising price pressures are meanwhile also hurting consumer- facing companies in particular. Nearly time to discover how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector fared last month... Breaking: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies have posted their strongest growth since 2011. The eurozone composite PMI, which measures activity across the region, jumped to 58.1 in December, up from November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 57.5. The service sector PMI rose to 56.6, up from 56.2 a month earlier. Companies reported that new orders strengthened last month, with manufacturers seeing the steepest increase in new business since 2000. This encouraged them to keep hiring more staff. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit says the eurozone gathered momentum at the end of last year: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A stellar end to 2017 for the eurozone rounded off the best year for over a decade, continuing to confound widely-held fears that rising political uncertainty would curb economic growth. At 56.4, the average PMI reading for 2017 was the highest annual trend since 2006. Manufacturing is enjoying its best growth spell since data were first collected over two decades ago while the service sector closed off its best year since 2007. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The survey data are consistent with the quarterly rate of GDP growth accelerating to an impressive 0.8% in Q4, with no sign of momentum being lost as we move into 2018. New work is flowing to companies at a rate not seen for a decade and backlogs of uncompleted work are rising sharply. Hiring is consequently at a 17-year high as firms look to boost capacity to meet rising workloads. Optimism about the outlook also turned higher in December. Debenhams\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 profit warning has spooked other UK retailers too. Marks &amp; Spencer are down 2.7%, the worst performer on the FTSE 100, on fears that its Christmas may have been less sparkling than hoped. Dixons Carphone have dipped too. Connor Campbell of Spreadex says Debenham is in a tough fight: After Wednesday saw Next provide its retail peers with some post-Christmas optimism, Debenhams gave the sector a reality check this Thursday as it became the first casualty of 2018. A 2.6% drop in like-for-like sales following a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvolatile and competitive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 festive period forced the firm to issue a profit warning, with the ailing high street staple forecasting its full year figures to come in somewhere between of \u00c2\u00a355m to \u00c2\u00a365m, way off the \u00c2\u00a383m expected by analysts. Inevitably this caused a wave of investors to jump ship, the stock plunging 20% to sub-28p \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Debenhams now faces an uphill battle to avoid becoming the next BHS. Retail analyst Steve Dresser reckons Debenhams has only itself to blame, for overpricing its Christmas gift offerings... OUCH! Shares in Debenhams have plunged by 20% at the start of trading, following its shock profits warning. They tumbled from 35.6p to as low as 28p, as traders punish the company for slashing its profit forecasts this morning. Debenhams is the first UK retailer to suffer the ignominy of a post-Christmas profits warning this year, as retail analyst Nick Bubb explains: We said yesterday that there was no sign so far of anybody having to bring forward their scheduled Christmas trading announcements from next week\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but poor old Debenhams has stepped up to the plate today, to warn that weak gross margins (-150 bps) and a poor Sale last week have hit the bottom-line. Full-year profits (to end August) are likely to be down to \u00c2\u00a355m-65m, versus a modest consensus forecast of about \u00c2\u00a383m, despite finding an extra \u00c2\u00a310m of cost savings... Sergio Bucher, the new CEO of Debenhams, wails: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market has been challenging and particularly promotional in some of our key seasonal categories and we have responded in order to remain competitive for our customers, which has impacted our profit performance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has hit a fresh record high at the start of trading. The blue-chip index rose by 27 points to 7,698 points, just over the previous record set on the final trading session of 2017. That follows the rally in Japan this morning, and last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close on Wall Street. High street retailer Debenhams has sent a shiver through the City this morning, reports my colleague Angela Monaghan: Debenhams has issued a surprise profits warning after a disappointing festive season and a failure to entice shoppers despite heavy discounting in the post- Christmas sales period. The department store chain struck a gloomy tone as it brought forward by a week its Christmas trading update to warn the current UK trading environment was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153volatile and highly competitive with weaker demand in some more discretionary areas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Debenhams said profits for the full year were now likely to be in the range of \u00c2\u00a355m to \u00c2\u00a365m, sharply below the \u00c2\u00a383m expected by the City. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We took tactical promotional action to improve our performance which resulted in a stronger 6 week Christmas period against tough comparatives... However, the first week of post-Christmas sale was below expectations despite further markdown investment, particularly in the highly seasonal gift category,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the retailer said. Like-for-like sales in the UK - which strip out the impact of sales at stores open for less than a year - fell 2.6% in the 17 weeks to 30 December. Like-for-like sales overall were down 1.8%. Sergio Bucher, chief executive of the retailer, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market has been challenging and particularly promotional in some of our key seasonal categories and we have responded in order to remain competitive for our customers, which has impacted our profit performance. Just in: London was the worst-performing part of the UK property sector last year, according to the Nationwide building society. The average house price in the capital fell by 0.5% during 2017, Nationwide reports, while the UK average rose by 2.6%. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Economist, says mounting pressure on household incomes held house price growth back (good news if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re tying to get onto the housing ladder). Gardner adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The significant disparity in house prices across the UK has been a recurring theme in recent years. In this respect, 2017 saw the beginnings of a shift, as rates of house price growth in the south of England moderated towards those prevailing in the rest of the country. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153London saw a particularly marked slowdown, with prices falling in annual terms for the first time in eight years, albeit by a modest 0.5%. London ended the year the weakest performing region for the first time since 2004. But despite this slowdown, the average London house still costs over \u00c2\u00a3470k -- or more than double the national average.... Investors \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflocked\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the Japanese stock market today to buy shares, says Japan Today, driven by expectations that the markets will rally in 2018. It reports: The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average ended up 741.39 points, or 3.26%, from Friday at 23,506.33, its highest close since Jan 7, 1992. The broader Topix index of all First Section issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange finished 46.26 points, or 2.55%, higher at 1,863.82. Tokyo markets were closed from Monday to Wednesday for the New Year holidays. The Nikkei posted the largest daily gain since November 2016 as every industry category on the main section gained ground, led by oil and coal product, securities and electric appliance issues. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets have started the new year in good heart, on hopes that economic growth will be robust this year. Over in Tokyo, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has surged by over 3% to close at its highest level in 26 years, on the first trading day of the year. Energy and financials stocks led the rally. Traders were in good spirits after the US stock markets closed at (yet another) record high last night, showing that the bull market still has legs. Optimism was also boosted by new data showing that Japan and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sectors both performed well in December, with growth accelerating. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Japanese stocks returned from holiday trading with a bang. The Topix index struck a 26 year, tracking the optimism that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seen Wall Street close at record highs in the past two trading sessions. The energy sector was leading the charge in Asia after oil prices climbed again. At the same time activity in Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector rose to a 4 year high according to survey data. Later this morning we get service sector reports from the UK and the eurozone, which will probably confirm that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy ended 2017 strongly. We also get a fresh healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property market, with new house price figures from Nationwide and the latest mortgage approvals numbers. Plus, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking the UK retail sector, as high street retailer Debenhams has just released a profits warning! That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a blow, a day after Next surprised the City with decent-looking results yesterday. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 7am GMT: Nationwide house price survey for December 9am GMT: Eurozone service sector PMI for December 9.30am GMT: UK service sector PMI for December 9.30am GMT: UK mortgage approvals and consumer credit data 1.30pm GMT: US initial jobless figures",

Then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fact that the current strength in the stock market is fairly broad-based. In past bubbles, the end was nigh when gains were concentrated in an increasingly small collection of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153winners\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple\">Apple</a> are roaring this time, but the same divergence has not occurred \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yet.</p> <p>For \u00e2\u20ac\u0153touchy-feely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd evidence of excess about to appear, Grantham looks at media coverage.

A year ago, when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/25/dow-jones-industrial-average-breaks-record-20000\">Dow Jones industrial average passed 20,000</a>, few thought it would hit 25,000 within 12 months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it happened on Thursday.

Then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fact that the current strength in the stock market is fairly broad-based. In past bubbles, the end was nigh when gains were concentrated in an increasingly small collection of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153winners\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The likes of Apple are roaring this time, but the same divergence has not occurred \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yet. For \u00e2\u20ac\u0153touchy-feely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd evidence of excess about to appear, Grantham looks at media coverage. US newspapers and TV stations are getting interested in financial markets (with bitcoin, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a true, crazy mini-bubble of its own\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, to the fore) but not yet with the wild obsession of the frenzied dotcom years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Keep an eye on what the TVs at lunchtime eateries are showing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. Grantham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guess is that there is more than a 50% chance of a melt-up, or end-phase of the bubble, within the next six months to two years. If it happens, then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 90% probability of a melt-down, which could mean a halving of share prices from the peak. A credible theory? Well, yes, anything is possible. A year ago, when the Dow Jones industrial average passed 20,000, few thought it would hit 25,000 within 12 months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it happened on Thursday. Is that a case of extreme euphoria, or just early signs of it? Given the impossibility of knowing, Grantham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advice to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brace yourself\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sounds reasonable. Brace, and keep a clear eye on the exit. Debenhams Christmas tidings not as joyful as chief predicted Eight months ago the chief executive of Debenhams, Sergio Bucher was telling investors he would make the tired-looking department store group \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a destination, digital and different\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite disavow discounting, but the tactic would be deployed less often and with more impact. Nice idea, shame about the results. Even before the completion of one lap of a three-year plan, Debenhams has coughed up a horrible profits warning that imperils shareholders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dividends, even if nobody is saying so yet. Profits for the full year will arrive at \u00c2\u00a355m-\u00c2\u00a365m. Call that a plunge of a third from last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a395m. Debenhams\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christmas grumbles sound familiar. The report was a long complaint about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly competitive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153promotion-driven\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd state of the market, especially on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gifts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is shorthand for everything from booze to Christmas crackers. That won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cut much ice with investors. The likes of B&amp;M, with its cheap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122cheerful sheds, aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going away. One can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, of course, judge a three-year revival plan on the basis of one bad Christmas. Equally, however, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame investors for taking a gloomy view \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the shares plunged 15% and Debenhams is now worth just \u00c2\u00a3370m. Five years ago, the business was making \u00c2\u00a3139m of pre-tax profits and the downwards trend has been consistent. Borrowings are lower than they were in the bad old days of private equity ownership, as the company keeps saying, but the current \u00e2\u20ac\u0153medium-term financial leverage target\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is to reduce net debt to 0.5 times top-line operating profits. The new profits forecast may mean no progress whatsoever from last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.3 times. That is why a dividend costing \u00c2\u00a342m a year looks unsustainable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the theoretical (or imaginary) dividend yield of 11% says as much. Bucher came from Amazon, where they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about excess store space, long leaseholds or even shareholders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dividend expectations. Good luck \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this job looks much harder.",

                "bodyText":"Wall Street has shrugged off slowing growth in US jobs, extending a surge in the stock market as the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy comes closer to reaching full employment. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up about 0.2% in New York on Thursday morning, adding more than 50 points to reach 25,123, despite the weaker readings for job creation last month. Figures from the US labor department showed 148,000 new positions were created in December, below the forecasts of economists, as the retail sector shed 20,000 jobs over the holiday season. The headline numbers suggest that the jobs market remains strong. The labor department announced that the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1% in December, close to a 17-year low. Economists expect jobs growth to slow this year as the US labour market comes closer to full employment. The US economy has now added more than 2m jobs annually for seven straight years, a run last seen in the 1990s. But the pace of hiring has slowed, the recovery remains uneven, and wages continue to lag behind growth. Analysts had expected the US to add 180,000 jobs over the month. The labor department also cut its hiring figures for October and November, with a net downward revision of 9,000 jobs. The troubled retail sector lost 20,000 jobs over the month as the shift to online shopping took its toll even over the holiday season. The economy added new jobs in healthcare (up 31,000), construction (up 30,000) and manufacturing (up 25,000). Wages continued their sluggish recovery, rising 2.5% in December from a year earlier, despite expectations that lower unemployment would add to the bargaining power of workers to demand higher wages. Policymakers at the Federal Reserve will have been looking for signs of wage growth as they prepare to nudge interest rates higher. Stronger growth in pay typically leads to inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as companies raise prices offered to consumers to compensate for their higher wage bills \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which can be kept in check using higher interest rates.

                "bodyText":"And finally.... the Dow Jones has continued to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmelt-up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with aplomb. The benchmark US stock index gained another 220 points, or 0.88%, to finish the day at 25,295, which is obviously a new all-time high. The S&amp;P 500 also hit a new closing high, as Wall Street celebrated its best start to a new year since 2006. Economic optimism, and predictions that US interest rates won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be hiked too quickly, helped to push shares higher. Can the bull market continue next week? Come back on Monday to find out :) Until then, goodnight! GW Hello again. Marketwatch has an interesting explanation for the market rally: Investors are feeling good about the U.S. stock market. In fact, they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t felt this good in years. The latest AAII investor sentiment survey, conducted on Jan. 3., indicates that 59.8% of polled investors are bullish on the market, meaning they expect prices will be higher in six months. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level in about seven years, since a reading of 63.3% on Dec. 23, 2010, and it is significantly above the 38.5% historical average. The number of bullish investors has gone up by 7.1 percentage points in the past week alone. There has been a corresponding drop in both bearish and neutral investors. The percentage of market pessimists has dropped to 15.6%, down 5.1 percentage points over the last week, while neutral investors have slid by 2 percentage points to 24.7%. Both are below their historical averages, which is 30.5% for bears and 31% for neutral investors. More here: Bullish sentiment for U.S. stocks is at a seven-year high OK, time for a recap. The global stock market rally has driven Britain and America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets to fresh highs today, despite an underwhelming employment report from the US. The Dow Jones index has pushed further over the 25,000 mark, while in London the FTSE 100 has closed at a new peak over 7,700. Shares jumped despite the news that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t create as many jobs in December as expected. The closely-watched Non-Farm Payroll only rose by 148,000, missing forecasts of a 190,000 gain, while wage growth was unexceptional at 2.5% over the last year. My colleague Dominic Rushe explains: The headline numbers suggest that the jobs market remains strong. The labor department announced that the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1% in December, close to a 17-year low. The US economy has now added more than 2m jobs a year for seven straight years, a run last seen in the 1990s. But the pace of hiring has slowed, the recovery remains uneven, and wages continue to lag behind growth. Analysts voiced concerns that US retailers cut jobs in December - despite the festive shopping season. In the UK, car sales fell in December for the first time since 2011 - and by the biggest amount since 2009. Further falls are expected in 2018, as consumers continue to shun diesel cars -- with some switching to electric cars instead. The automobile industry is now urging the government to agree a Brexit transition deal by March, at the latest, otherwise manufacturers will be forced to trigger contingency plans. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back later with the close of Wall Street.... Boom! The FTSE 100 has ended the week at a new all-time high. The blue-chip index of the biggest companies listed in London has closed at 7724 - the first time it has finished over the 7700 mark. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a gain of 28 points, or 0.37%. Energy provider Centrica and water group United Utilities were the biggest risers, up around 3% after an analyst upgrade. But insurance group Admiral led the fallers, down 3% after figures showed UK car sales fell last year - and may keep falling in 2018. Fewer new cars means less insurance business. Other European markets also had a strong day, as the first week of 2018 gets off to a strong start. No wonder analysts are talking about a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmelt-up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.... I missed this detail earlier, but the opening bell of the New York stock exchange was rung by a professional bull rider - J.B. Mauney. This honour was to mark the 25 anniversary of Professional Bull Riders (an enterprise devoted to the noble art of not falling off a 2000 pound bull with a temper). You know you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a bull market when you see stetsons on a trading floor.... With 30 minutes to go, London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market could end the week at a new record high. The FTSE has dropped back from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intraday peaks, but is still 11 points higher than yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close, at 7707 points. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice summary of the US jobs report: Just in: German lender Deutsche Bank says Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reform package will cost it \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.5bn. This makes Deutsche Bank the latest in a string of major companies to announce that their deferred tax assets are less valuable, now that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporation tax rate is being cut from 35% to 21%. Deutsche also says that weak markets have hit its revenues, meaning it will post a small loss for the fourth quarter of the financial year. This has sent Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares sliding almost 5%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slightly ironic, as Deutsche Bank has been a major lender to Donald Trump over the years (a relationship that has come under increasing scrutiny). MSNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Steve Benen have calculated that US job creation slowed last year - the first 12 months of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency. Benen writes: Now that we have data for all of the previous calendar year, we can note that the U.S. added 1.84 million jobs in 2011, 2.19 million jobs in 2012, 2.33 million in 2013, 3.11 million in 2014, 2.74 million in 2015, 2.24 million in 2016, and 2.05 million in 2017. Or put another way, while Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first year as president has been pretty good overall for job creation, Americans nevertheless saw the slowest job growth in six years. Newsflash: US factory orders rose by 1.3% in November, beating the consensus forecast of 1.1% growth. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 0.4% in October, and the fourth monthly rise in a row. American factories reported rising demand for transportation and electrical equipment. However.... the latest survey of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector is less impressive. Growth slowed to a four-month low in December, according to ISM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-manufacturing index which has dipped to 55.9 from 57.6. Boom! The US stock market has hit fresh record highs (yet again) at the start of trading in New York. Traders are shrugging off the news that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job creation slowed last month. The Dow Jones continued its march upwards, gaining 70 points to 25,145. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are also pushing higher, as the bull market shows no inclination to fizzle out. But while shares rise, the US dollar has dropped. Jacob Deppe, Head of Trading at online trading platform, Infinox, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Surprisingly, Wall Street shook off the lower than expected jobs data and rose still higher, although the Dollar fell 0.3% versus the Euro and 0.26% versus the Pound on the news. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payrolls data does not fit the current narrative of booming US growth. The initial reaction from the market is to ignore. That could be perilous. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also possible markets have decided the recent harsh weather contributed to the slowdown in jobs The good news is that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has now created jobs for 87 months in a row - dating back to early in Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first term as president. That has helped to pull the jobless rate down to its lowest since the end of 2000, at just 4.1%. Bart Hordijk, Market Analyst at Monex Europe, says the US may be approaching full employment: \u00e2\u20ac\u01532017 has been an extraordinary year for the US labour market, with around 200K jobs added every month, leading the Unemployment Rate to its lowest point in 16 years. The fact that we now see a slowdown can be more of a sign of employers not being able to find qualified personnel, than it is an indicator of weakness in the US economy. Despite the fact that the Hourly Earnings Growth remains soft, this can report can still be a nudge for the Federal Reserve in the direction of hiking the rates. The 148,000 increase in the US non-farm payroll last month was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slightly disappointing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, says Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics. He also singles out the drop in retail employment: Looking at the December gain in detail, manufacturing had a strong month, adding 25,000 jobs. Given the strength of the global economy, the decline in the dollar and the recent strength evident in the surveys, we can expect further factory job gains in the next few months. The obvious weakness was in retail, which shed 20,300 jobs. That could be just noise or a consequence of the shift from bricks and mortar stores to online. As a comparison, couriers &amp; messengers added only 2,100 jobs, so in net terms the structural shift is hardly positive for employmen Kully Samra, UK Managing Director at Charles Schwab, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US economy ended on a mixed note in 2017. However, despite disappointing job numbers, over the year average hourly earnings have risen by 2.5%. In addition, we have seen the economy grow quarter on quarter, manufacturing and services indices rise and other factors such as business confidence and housing are also picking up. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was something for everyone in the latest US Labour Market Report. On the one hand, employment growth slipped below 200,000 after a couple of strong months, while on the other, the headline rate of unemployment remained very low at just 4.1%, on an unchanged participation rate. Wage growth ticked higher to 2.5%, still a very modest rate despite the sharp fall in unemployment over the past few years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Federal Reserve puts much more weight on labour market data than on any other information, including the volatile and often misleading early estimates for GDP. Most survey based indicators of economic growth are strong in the US, and while the current severe weather is bound to impact economic activity in Q1, the Fed tend to look through these events, and are still on track to raise interest rates once again in March.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jobs site Indeed.com have made a handy charts showing where jobs were created, or destroyed, last month across the US economy: Ben Casselman of the New York Times is also worried by the fall in retail jobs Seth Harris, who was deputy US labor secretary under president Obama, is concerned by the rise in under-employment (the U-6 rate). He tweets: Yikes! America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sector cut around 20,000 jobs last month, according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll. That could be proof that the rise of internet shopping is forcing Main Street stores to cut back. The NFP report also shows a 55,000 increase in goods-producing jobs, a 30,000 increase in construction, and a 91,000 increase in service-sector roles. Worryingly, the US under-employment rate rose to 8.1% in December, from 8.0% in October. That means more Americans wanted to work more hours than they were able. In better news, November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll has been revised up to show 252,000 new jobs were created (up from 228,000). But what the revisions give with one hand, they take with the other. October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s NFP has been revised down to 211,000, from 244,000. Instant reaction - this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a great jobs report. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a disaster either. On wages..... earnings rose by 2.5% per year in December, as expected. But November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage data has been revised down, to 2.4% (from 2.5%). Breaking! The US economy created 148,000 new jobs in December. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather less than the 190,000 which economists had predicted. The unemployment rate has come in at 4.1% - unchanged on last month. More to follow..... No argument.... Just five minutes to go, and the excitement is building.... The US jobs report is notoriously hard to predict, and invariably revised sometime in the future. But the Non-Farm Payroll is still one of the most eagerly awaited pieces of economic data in the calendar, as it gives an insight into how the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest labo(u)r market is performing. As Naeem Aslam of Think Markets puts it: Today is the day- the most important economic data, the US Non-Farm Payroll number, on the face of the earth will reveal its colour. This number sets the trading tone and the trend for the rest of the month for traders. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number would provide us significant clues if the moderate growth in the US economy has left any impact on the jobs market, most importantly on the wage growth. Since the financial recession, the jobs market has been strengthening and this momentum was set by former President Barak Obama and Mr Trump is reaping the rewards. World stock markets are at record levels today, partly thanks to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 hitting new heights this morning. And Wall Street is likely to push the bull market even higher when trading begins -- unless the US jobs report is a shock. Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM says: Another day, another record high for world stocks, as a growing sense of optimism over the global economy boosts risk sentiment. Asian shares ventured higher during early trading on Friday, while European markets opened on a positive note amid the risk-on environment. With the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 25,000 for the first time ever on Thursday, U.S equity bulls are clearly back in town and as such, we could see further gains on Wall Street this afternoon. Investors on both side of the Atlantic are bracing for the latest US jobs report to hit the wires, in 35 minutes time. December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll is expected to show that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy created around 190,000 new jobs last month, leaving the unemployment rate at just 4.1%. However, there is talk that the NFP could be better, after another survey yesterday suggested that US firms hired 250,000 people in December. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a round-up of the latest Wall Street forecasts: Economists will also be looking closely at the wage growth figures, for signs that the US economic recovery is reaching workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pockets. Average earnings are expected to have risen by 2.5% per year, the same as a month ago, and by 0.3% in December alone. Craig Erlam of City firm Oanda says: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been promised higher inflation and wage growth for some time and investors are increasingly not buying it. Even some policy makers are starting to question why nothing has not materialised and should that continue, rate hike forecasts will start to slip, especially with interest rates now already elevated. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report should offer some insight on this, with average earnings having arguably become the most important component of it. Still earnings are only expected to have risen by 2.5% compared to a year ago, below last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peak and well below where they need to be for inflation to sustainably return to target. Whatever happens, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably hear Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views through the usual channel.... The Labour Party is also voicing concerns about the drop in UK car sales last year. Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Business Secretary, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mismanagement of the economy and mishandling of the Brexit negotiations has shaken consumer and business confidence and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerning that the sales of new cars are falling. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The industry has been warning the Government time and time again and, as has become typical with the Tories, they have failed to listen or take action. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The British car industry is a vital part of our economy, directly employing up to 170,000 people. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Industrial Strategy will set out a radical programme of investment and genuine partnership between industry and government, to protect vital jobs and build an economy that works for the many, not the few.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our financial editor, Nils Pratley, on the idea that markets are in a melt-up phase: Over in the City, the FTSE 100 index has climbed to new heights. It just hit 7727 points for the first time, up 0.4% or 31 points today, as the global stock market rally continues to bubble away. Markets have been surging in recent weeks, and there is plenty of talk that shares will keep rising as markets \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmelt-up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Rupert Harrison of asset manager BlackRock (and former top official in the UK Treasury), told Bloomberg TV that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there are very good reasons to be positive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Harrisons says: Since coming back from New Year, the phrase I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard most is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmelt up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a strong start to the year, and there are good reasons for that - the data is staying barn-stormingly strong. There doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be any sign of the reversion to the mean that people had been looking out for. On top of that, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got tax cuts in the US juicing the prospects for earnings and also potentially boosting the Capex cycle we are in. But, Harrison also cautions that there are some potential risks, including: Everyone is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbought in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the idea that global growth will continue, so any slowdown could alarm investors.. Trade policy: Donald Trump must soon decide whether to take action against China over the alleged dumping of cheap metals and solar panels. The US president is up early, and wasted no time in tweeting about the bull market: But as one City expert has already pointed out, each 1,000 point gain is less impressive than the last one..... While diesel sales slumped by 17% last year, sales of alternatively-fuelled vehicles jumped by almost 35% as more people bought electric cars. This shows that consumers are keen to drive less polluting vehicles, argues Greenpeace UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clean air campaigner Paul Morozzo. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sales of diesel cars are falling but sales of EVs and hybrids are growing at double-digit rates. Consumers are sending a clear message to the car industry that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to move on from polluting diesel and the industry should listen to it. Diesel cars have been fuelling a major air pollution crisis that has made our cities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 air toxic and harmful to breathe. EVs and hybrids are better for both air quality and the climate. If the UK car industry fails to invest in the technologies that consumers want then they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be left behind in the race for this trillion-dollar market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This charts hows how the market changed last year: Back to cars, and Ana Nicholls of the Economist Intelligence Unit, has identified several reasons for the drop in sales last year: Most people who can afford a new car have bought one recently, and pent-up demand from the auto market crash during the financial crisis is now completely sated. The average age of cars on the road is now less than eight years, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little replacement demand. Consumer confidence is faltering: with incomes nearly stagnant and the outlook uncertain because of Brexit people are becoming less keen to take out credit. November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise in interest rates didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help, raising many people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mortgage payments and making the financing deals from dealers less attractive A drop in PPI claims has also cut the number of people with one-off lump sums to spend. The sharp slump in diesel sales, after the VW scandal exposed concerns about NOx emissions. With the London congestion charge now higher, and the vehicle excise duty due to rise for the most polluting diesels, buyers are edging away rapidly. In the longer term there will be a shift towards electric cars, but at the moment sales (though fast-growing) are too low to make up the difference. The latest inflation figures from the eurozone are out -- and they show that prices are rising more slowly than expected. Despite the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge money-printing operation, eurozone inflation probably only rose by 1.4% per year in December, down from 1.5% in November. Energy prices were up 3% year-on-year, down from 4.7% in November, while food, alcohol and tobacco inflation dipped to 2.1% from 2.2%. This seems to vindicate the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to press on with its monetary stimulus -- which has been a factor behind the rise in stock markets recently. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Breaking away from the car sales figures.... we have good news for the UK economy. UK productivity (basically how much each worker actually produces) jumped by 0.9% in the third quarter of last year, new figures show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the largest increase in productivity since April-June 2011, and may show that future growth will stronger than previously expected. Labour productivity grew in both the services and manufacturing industries, according to the Office for National Statistics. This looks like good news for the UK government. Last autumn, the independent Office for National Statistics slashed its forecast for productivity growth, having concluded that it would not recover to its levels before the financial crisis. Weak productivity leads to slower economy growth, smaller tax receipts and higher government borrowing. But.... UK productivity has still taken a severe knock over the last decade, and basically flat-lined since the financial crisis. Unions fear that British car workers could be laid off this year, if sales don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recover. Tony Burke, assistant general secretary of Unite, says the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153world class car workers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will be looking to the year ahead with trepidation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government has caused confusion and damage with its policy on diesel cars and needs to start listening to the industry and workforce. Diesel engines produced by Unite members in the UK are the cleanest in the world. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ministers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 botched and badly thought through announcements are causing major damage to the industry. Combined with economic and Brexit uncertainty this risks taking the sheen off the jewel in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing crown and the 800,000 high skilled jobs it sustains. 2018 could be another bad year for the motor industry, if consumer confidence remains subdued. Richard Jones, managing director of motor finance group Black Horse, says the next few months will be crucial \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I believe we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see new car sales continue to decline in the first quarter of 2018 given that this period in 2017 was so strong. This should help dampen fears of oversupply having a negative impact on used car prices and is positive in the long term by ensuring the new car market is operating from a sustainable position. I would also expect the used car market to continue to perform well. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With uncertainties facing the UK economy it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to make a confident forecast for 2018 as a whole. I believe a big test for the industry will come after quarter one when we will see how the underlying UK economy and consumer confidence is influencing car demand.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit is the biggest threat to the UK automobile industry this year, according to a new survey of car dealers from Close Brothers Motor Finance. More encouragingly, 92% of dealers are confident about business prospects in the market for 2018, up from 63% last year. However, that optimism could wilt if Britain doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree a Brexit transition deal soon.... Worryingly, the drop in diesel car sales seems to have pushed emissions of carbon dioxide up. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a disappointing consequence of consumers shunning diesel motors and buying petrol ones instead, following revelations that diesel cars were pumping more nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere than officially reported. The SMMT explains: Carbon tailpipe emissions have risen for the first time since 1997, with new cars averaging 121.04g/km, up 0.8% on 2016. Last year, UK new car CO2 emissions fell for the 19th consecutive year and this is the first year the figure has risen since records began. The SMMT have just issued a press release, confirming that UK car sales declined in 2017. Here are the key points: Overall annual demand falls -5.7% in 2017 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but new car market still third biggest in a decade at over 2.5 million vehicles. December represents the ninth consecutive month of decline, as registrations for final month of year drop -14.4%. Appetite for electrified cars reaches record high, with almost 120,000 alternatively fuelled vehicles (AFVs) hitting UK roads \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a 34.8% uplift. Diesel demand declines -17.1%, undermining progress on emissions and CO2 as industry body warns consumers could end up paying more in fuel if they travel high mileages. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a couple of handy charts too: In contrast to the UK, car sales in Germany actually rose last year. Auto sales in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy increased by 2.7% during 2017. However - as in Britain - diesel sales tumbled (by 13%). Reuters explains: Pressure is growing on Germany to tackle diesel pollution as dozens of cities including Munich and Stuttgart, where BMW and Daimler are based, could face penalties for allowing nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels in excess of European Union limits introduced in 2010, the DUH environmental lobby has said. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has hit a fresh intraday record high. The index of blue-chip companies gained another 12 points, or 0.15% points, to 7708 points, six points above yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record levels. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, says investor optimism is undimmed, for the moment.... European markets continue to make further gains, with the sheer scale of the global rally demonstrating how investors are embracing all things equity and risk related, basking in the euphoria of synchronous global growth. Equity markets, which were already strengthening well in advance of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $1.5tn tax cut, or indeed a prospective US infrastructure bill that could form the centrepiece of 2018 legislation, show no sign of any stress, with new record highs an almost daily occurrence. With the party in full swing and implied volatility at such low levels, markets are seemingly immune to any possible downside, but the key risk that might ultimately bring markets down is inflation. A material increase in inflationary pressures would potentially force central banks to tighten rates faster than the market is expecting Chris Bosworth, Director of Strategy at Close Brothers Motor Finance, believes Brexit anxiety and opposition to diesel cars are the main reason car sales fell last year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures reflect the impact that anti-diesel messages from the government and ongoing Brexit trade negotiations are having on both business and consumer confidence across the motor industry. December marks the ninth month of consecutive decrease in new car sales as squeezed consumers are reluctant to purchase big ticket items such as cars and motorcycles. Alex Buttle, director of car buying comparison website Motorway.co.uk, says diesel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s days are numbered (after the emissions scandal). He wants the government to offer more incentives to shift to electric. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Quite frankly, 2017 has been a year to forget for the UK car industry. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to dig pretty deep to find anything positive to take from the past 12 months which has seen diesel demonised in the media on a weekly basis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As sales of new diesels continue to fall, 2017 could well mark the end of one era of motoring and the dawn of a new one, as hybrid and electric sales start to take off. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The destiny of diesel may already be set in stone. Now the Government needs to stand by its commitment to the future and put its full backing behind AFVs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Incentives to encourage consumers to switch to hybrid and electric vehicles need to run alongside the billions of pounds of investment being pumped into the supporting infrastructure. Bloomberg blames \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on buyer confidence and lingering skepticism over the emissions performance of diesel cars\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the 5.6% drop in UK car sales last year. The Financial Times agrees that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry needs clarity about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future relationship with the EU, fast: You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait until March 2019,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [SMMT chief Mike Hawes] said, when the UK will leave the EU. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Production is a tap that takes a long time to turn on and off.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The SMMT said contingency plans could include carmakers investing in additional warehouse capacity to guard against delivery disruptions, or deciding to expand production abroad rather than produce new models in the UK. Mr Hawes said that even the more limited changes, such as investing in warehouse capacity, were the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thin end of the wedge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because they would impose additional costs on British car manufacturers, making them less competitive and damaging their ability to attract new investment. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry has suffered its biggest drop in sales since the financial crisis. Sales of new vehicles fell by 5.6% during 2017 - the first annual decline since 2011, and the worst since 2009. Diesel sales were particularly dire, as my colleague Gwyn Topham explains: UK car sales declined in 2017 after five years of rapid growth, with the industry blaming government for a collapse in consumer confidence in diesel vehicles. Total sales for last year were 2.54m new vehicles, a decline of 5.6% on 2016, with diesel sales dropping 17%. Despite the decline, 2017 sales remained near the highest on record. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the UK automotive industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade body, has forecast a further 5% to 7% decline in sales in 2018. Mike Hawes, the SMMT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, said 2017 had been a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very volatile year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. While sales reached a record high in March, by December they were 13.9% down year-on-year, with 152,000 fewer cars sold than in the same month in 2016. Hawes attributed the drop to a decline in business and consumer confidence in the wider economy and uncertainty over the future of diesel. Sales of diesel cars dropped by 31% in December, while petrol car sales dropped by 1.6%, after relatively minor tax changes targeting diesel in the November budget. The SMMT is now urging the UK government to rapidly agree a Brexit transition deal with Brussels. Otherwise, Hawes warns, carmakers will soon be forced to take tough - and potentially irreversible - decisions. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some investment decisions are overdue \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we need clarity [on the terms of a transitional period] by the end of the first quarter.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [Otherwise] They will have to start implementing contingency plans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With stock markets at record levels, investors will be looking to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US unemployment report for reasons to keep optimistic, and keep buying assets. The monthly non-farm payroll report is expected to show that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy continued to create jobs in December. The Wall Street consensus is that around 190,000 new workers were hired across the US last month, down from 228,000 in November. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that the NFP could be stronger. The figures will probably also show that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate remained at just 4.1%. But economists will be hoping to see evidence that employees are being paid more. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: On a month-on-month basis average earnings are tipped to increase by 0.3% and on an annual basis they are forecasted to rise by 2.5%. The US has been steadily creating new jobs over the past few years, but wage growth has been sluggish. If the US economy wants to step up a gear in terms of economic growth, wage growth and in turn the spending levels will need to tick up. Also coming up today. European stock markets are expected to open mixed, after Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong session drove the UK FTSE 100 to a new alltime high. Last night the US Dow Jones closed over 25,000 points for the first time ever, on hopes that the world economy will remain upbeat this year. Traders will also be watching out for the latest eurozone inflation figures, and new UK car sales figures (of which more in a moment....)

In the UK, the FTSE 100 index stands at a record high. Even the Japanese market, for years an international laggard, is back at a 26-year high. Last year the MSCI World index \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a proxy for a global stock market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c delivered a return of 20.1%. Optimists expect more of the same. The other camp warns that a dangerous bubble is about to burst.</p> <p>Both sides could probably agree that the recent run in stock markets has been astonishing. Or, rather, the truly remarkable feature has been the steady and unbroken pace of the march upwards. Stock markets, we used to think, offered thrills, spills and rollercoaster rides. Individual shares still provide such excitement, of course, but the overall market seems bizarrely free of stress.</p> <p>Andrew Lapthorne, who crunches the market numbers for French bank Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale, called 2017 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the year volatility died\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in his end-of-year round-up. He wrote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those of us expecting greater market turbulence in 2017 could not have been more wrong. Not only did global equity markets perform well, but they did so with such low volatility and consistency that, if this were a fund, it would perhaps merit a visit from the authorities to check exactly what you were up to.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>What happened? First, investors seem to have decided that rising interest rates in the US, a big worry a year ago, are not the bogeyman they seemed. The US Federal Reserve has been a protective nurse. Rate rises have been gradual, and ultra-cheap money has been followed by very cheap. A US rate of 1.5% ain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so bad.</p> <p>Second, President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration, amid its chaos and crises, has delivered the policy investors in companies cared about most: corporate tax cuts. Maybe a growth-generating splurge on infrastructure, the second part of his economic agenda, will follow.</p> <p>There are no certainties in investment, but the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nothing to worry about\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd theory is plainly credible. Kenneth Taubes, chief US investment officer at Amundi, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest asset manager, reckons the US reforms are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not fully priced into the market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking into 2018, we believe that the concerns about a bubble for US equities are overdone,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Compared to past crises [2000, 2007], we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see excess in terms of flows. Mergers and acquisitions will likely revive and support the market now that the tax reform has been legislated. Financial conditions are still benign. We expect that the combined impact of an improving US economy, a stronger global economy and lower taxes will support earnings per share growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>That won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t silence those who worry about a bubble. On hard and traditional measures such as dividend yields, the US shares look plain over-valued. Prices have climbed so high that the average yield on stocks in the S&amp;P 500, the broadest US index, has slipped below 2%. That implies huge faith in companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to crank up dividends even further, despite profit margins already being fat.</p> <p>Or take your pick of any number of signs of market madness elsewhere: the Bitcoin craze; or the fact that European junk bonds, which are supposed to be high risk, were yielding less than safe-as-houses US Treasury notes last month. Amid it all, geopolitics seems to have been forgotten. North Korea? Iran? Saudi Arabia? An imploding US presidency? A Chinese slowdown? None has upset financial markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yet.</p> <p>Accurately predicting the timing of the bursting of the bubble, if it exists, is tricky, of course, which is why the forecast of a possible \u00e2\u20ac\u0153melt-up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the normally cautious Jeremy Grantham is so intriguing (see below).</p> <p>Is a melt-up \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a last wild fling for highly valued markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c credible?

By the end of the year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a poor one for his funds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he was convinced an unsustainable investment bubble had formed and was about to burst.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ten years on from the global financial crisis, we are witnessing the product of the biggest monetary policy experiment in history,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he wrote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors have forgotten about risk and this is playing out in inflated asset prices and inflated valuations \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 There are so many lights flashing red that I am losing count.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>One flashing light was the extreme difference between the performance of US \u00e2\u20ac\u0153value\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd stocks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the type of reliable profit and dividend-earners he tends to prefer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd companies. The disparity was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153greater than at any stage in stock market history\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Woodford said \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yes, even including the 1929 Wall Street crash.</p> <p>Woodford, who manages \u00c2\u00a315bn, famously sat out the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s and cleaned up afterwards. He sees echoes of those days but thinks there are more similarities with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nifty Fifty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bubble in US markets in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which was led by companies such as Coca-Cola and IBM.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The few stocks that are perceived to be capable of delivering dependable growth have become very popular, and that popularity has manifested itself in extreme and unsustainable valuations,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he argues.</p> <p>He has sold a few beneficiaries of this trend, such as household and healthcare group Reckitt Benckiser, on the grounds that it is a good but overvalued company. He sees opportunity in domestically focused UK stocks, just as he did in 1992 after the sterling devaluation that followed the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chaotic crash out of European exchange rate mechanism, the forerunner of the euro.</p> <p>In Woodford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view, the UK economy is fundamentally healthy in 2018, with more people in work, more wage growth, less inflation, more investment spending and a continued recovery in manufacturing and exports. He is buying UK housebuilders, construction companies, retailers, leisure stocks and property. As for Brexit worries, he thinks they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re as overdone as the turn-of-the-century hysteria surrounding the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153millennium bug\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, when it was feared that computers couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t handle the transition from 1999 to 2000.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2c9ac05388bf83fe5fea6a62124bc889ac2eff78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c9ac05388bf83fe5fea6a62124bc889ac2eff78/0_263_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Grantham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Grantham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLook out for extremes of euphoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Jeremy Grantham</strong></h2> <p>Brace yourself for a stock market \u00e2\u20ac\u0153melt-up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said Jeremy Grantham this week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a startling prediction from a generally bearish investor, who is regarded as one of most insightful historians of financial bubbles.</p> <p>Grantham is the British-born veteran fund manager who in 1977 co-founded Boston-based GMO, which today manages $75bn (\u00c2\u00a355bn) of assets. The firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fame partly derives from its skill in having identified, and dodged, the last two big market blow-ups \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the dotcom bubble of 1998-2000 and the US housing crisis that preceded the financial crash of 2007-09.</p> <p>His \u00e2\u20ac\u0153melt-up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd theory starts from the premise that, yes, markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or, specifically, the US stock market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are highly priced. The data is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clean and factual\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can be as certain as we ever get in stock market analysis that the current price is exceptionally high.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more to bubbles than just high prices, he argues. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Among other factors, indicators of extremes of euphoria seem much more important than price.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Grantham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s argument, in essence, is that signs of real frenzy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the wild excess that accompanies the late stage of bubbles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are only starting to fall into place now. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not there yet, but we can perhaps see some early movement,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. Bitcoin, for example, is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a true, crazy mini-bubble of its own\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>He defines a bubble as being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excellent fundamentals euphorically extrapolated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In recent years, market fundamentals have been disappointing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c share prices, in the old phrase, were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153climbing the wall of worry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Now, though, the fundamentals are improving, creating conditions for excess. President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate tax cuts are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very likely to further fatten the corporate share of the GDP pie and perhaps provide the oomph to keep stock prices rising\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Grantham says.</p> <p>There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another, more technical, point: the rise in the US market (perhaps unlike the Brexit-influenced UK one) has been broadly based. In classic bubbles, the market tends to be led higher in its last stage by an increasingly small collection of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153winners\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, whose gains outweigh the majority of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153losers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That process hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happened yet in the US.</p> <p>A word of warning. Grantham isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t saying a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153melt-up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd phase is certain; he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s merely saying it is likely within the next six months to two years. And if \u00e2\u20ac\u0153melt-up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd happens, then prepare for meltdown: Grantham thinks there would be a 90% chance that the US market would fall 50% from its peak.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"be66b5fecf7a594f27e50b324e571494904a31d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be66b5fecf7a594f27e50b324e571494904a31d1/378_420_1933_2680/721.jpg\" alt=\"Salvator Mundi\" width=\"721\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>CRAZY TIMES, CRAZY PRICES</h2> <p><strong>Salvator Mundi</strong><br>Leonardo da Vinci\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s painting of Jesus Christ was sold at auction for $450m in November, about three times more than expected and way beyond the previous record.

As for Brexit worries, he thinks they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re as overdone as the turn-of-the-century hysteria surrounding the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153millennium bug\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, when it was feared that computers couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t handle the transition from 1999 to 2000. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLook out for extremes of euphoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Jeremy Grantham Brace yourself for a stock market \u00e2\u20ac\u0153melt-up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said Jeremy Grantham this week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a startling prediction from a generally bearish investor, who is regarded as one of most insightful historians of financial bubbles. Grantham is the British-born veteran fund manager who in 1977 co-founded Boston-based GMO, which today manages $75bn (\u00c2\u00a355bn) of assets. The firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fame partly derives from its skill in having identified, and dodged, the last two big market blow-ups \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the dotcom bubble of 1998-2000 and the US housing crisis that preceded the financial crash of 2007-09. His \u00e2\u20ac\u0153melt-up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd theory starts from the premise that, yes, markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or, specifically, the US stock market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are highly priced. The data is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clean and factual\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can be as certain as we ever get in stock market analysis that the current price is exceptionally high.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more to bubbles than just high prices, he argues. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Among other factors, indicators of extremes of euphoria seem much more important than price.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Grantham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s argument, in essence, is that signs of real frenzy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the wild excess that accompanies the late stage of bubbles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are only starting to fall into place now. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not there yet, but we can perhaps see some early movement,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. Bitcoin, for example, is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a true, crazy mini-bubble of its own\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He defines a bubble as being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excellent fundamentals euphorically extrapolated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In recent years, market fundamentals have been disappointing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c share prices, in the old phrase, were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153climbing the wall of worry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Now, though, the fundamentals are improving, creating conditions for excess. President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate tax cuts are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very likely to further fatten the corporate share of the GDP pie and perhaps provide the oomph to keep stock prices rising\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Grantham says. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another, more technical, point: the rise in the US market (perhaps unlike the Brexit-influenced UK one) has been broadly based. In classic bubbles, the market tends to be led higher in its last stage by an increasingly small collection of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153winners\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, whose gains outweigh the majority of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153losers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That process hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happened yet in the US. A word of warning. Grantham isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t saying a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153melt-up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd phase is certain; he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s merely saying it is likely within the next six months to two years. And if \u00e2\u20ac\u0153melt-up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd happens, then prepare for meltdown: Grantham thinks there would be a 90% chance that the US market would fall 50% from its peak. CRAZY TIMES, CRAZY PRICES Salvator Mundi Leonardo da Vinci\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s painting of Jesus Christ was sold at auction for $450m in November, about three times more than expected and way beyond the previous record. When Picasso\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Les Femmes d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Alger fetched $179m in 2015, the auctioneer who sold the cubist masterpiece predicted the figure would not be exceeded at auction for a decade. Bitcoin The cryptocurrency is a bigger speculative gamble than the Dutch tulip mania of the 1630s and the South Sea bubble of the 1720s, according to calculations by asset manager GMO. The Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman says of Bitcoin: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been no demonstration yet that it actually is helpful in conducting economic transactions. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no anchor for its value.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Just Eat The fast-food delivery company joined the FTSE 100 index at the end of last year. It is worth \u00c2\u00a35.5bn, slightly more than Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, whose profits are about five times as great. Sovereign debt Argentina has defaulted on its debts eight times in the past 200 years, most recently in 2001. So who would want to buy a sovereign-backed bond that matures in 100 years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time? Plenty of people, it seems. Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s issue of $2.75bn of bonds last June was heavily oversubscribed. NP",

                "bodyText":"Vauxhall says it is cutting jobs at Ellesmere Port so it can move to a single daily production shift. This will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153accelerate the recovery of plant productivity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it argues. Unions, though, say the cuts show the importance of a transition deal that shields the industry from Brexit disruption. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight, GW Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Business Secretary, on the loss of a further 250 jobs at Vauxhall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ellesmere Port plant: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122When PSA Group took over Vauxhall last year the Government promised it would do the utmost to protect workers, but since then a third of jobs at Ellesmere Port have been cut. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Tories are failing to give businesses and workers the security they need to navigate Brexit, which has been demonstrated again in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EEF report on manufacturer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations for 2018. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government must set out how it will support the plant and urgently provide certainty for the sector as a whole after Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Hello again. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stock market couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t close at a fresh record high tonight. The blue-chip index ended the day down 27 points at 7696, a drop of around 0.3%. Europe had a better day, though, with the German DAX and Italian FTSE MIB both up 0.38% and the French CAC close behind. Fiona Cincotta, Senior Market Analyst at City Index, says: The FTSE quickly hit a fresh record high in early trade as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153January Effect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd boosted equities. However, the index was unable to maintain the pace and soon drifted into the red, where it spent most of the day. It was a fairly muted start to the trading week; however, volatility is due to pick up given the slew of corporate releases on the calendar going forward. Micro Focus was the standout loser on the FTSE, shedding over 16% after the software maker disappointed investors with the interim update. The shares hit a low of 2116, its lowest level since August last year. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry has just been dealt two pieces of bad news. Firstly, auto group PSA is cutting an extra 250 jobs at its Vauxhall factory at Ellesmere Port, in the North West of England. This takes the total headcount cuts to 750. In a statement, Vauxhall says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At a meeting held on Thursday 4 January 2018 between representatives from Vauxhall Motors and UNITE the Union, the company explained that although the initial voluntary separation programme at its Ellesmere Port plant announced in October (aligned to adjustment of production volumes in order to protect its future) has been successful, it needs to initiate a further voluntary programme for eligible employees of a further 250 heads in the period from April to the end of September 2018.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Ellesmere Port, which produces the Vauxhall Astra, has been hit by falling demand. PSA has also warned that Brexit uncertainty will also affect investment decisions. PSA, which also owns Peugeot, says it remains committed to the Ellesmere Port site - but dropped a heavy hint that future improvements are needed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vauxhall Management affirmed the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continued commitment to the Astra plant at Ellesmere Port. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The company remains confident in the ability of the Ellesmere Port workforce to deliver the necessary improvements in financial performance.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Secondly, rival carmaker Jaguar Landrover has warned that the UK economy is tough. JLR says it achieved record worldwide sales last year, up 7% to 621,109 vehicles, thanks to strong demand in China and the US. Britain, though, is more problematic. Group sales operations director Andy Goss says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have once again delivered year-on-year sales increases thanks to a world-class product range and new models such as the E-PACE and Velar, as well as China-specific models such as the XFL. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we are facing tough times in key markets such as the UK where consumer confidence and diesel taxes will hit us.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Last week, the car industry reported that sales fell by 5.7% last year, with further declines expected in 2018..... Take note, bullish investors. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Luke Kawa has calculated that several major stock market indices have now surged to levels that suggest they are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoverbought\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s often (but not always) a prelude to a correction. Kawa explains: The S&amp;P 500 Index, MSCI Asia Pacific Index, MSCI World Index, Nikkei 225 Index, and MSCI Emerging Markets Index are all in overbought territory, while the Euro Stoxx 600 Index lingers just shy of such a level. The average reading for this collection of gauges soared to a weekly record as of Jan. 5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1988. The relative strength index is a technical indicator that tracks the magnitude and speed of price fluctuations. Typically, a security with an RSI above 70 is considered to be overbought, while those below 30 are viewed as oversold. The New York stock market has opened without major drama. In early trading, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&amp;P 500 indices have both dipped by 0.1%. In other news... the former executive chairman of auto repair and insurance group AA is bringing legal action over his sacking last year, following a bust-up with a colleague. Bob Mackenzie lost his job - and share options worth millions of pounds - after reportedly starting a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcphysical altercation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in a hotel bar, which triggered his dismissal. The Press Association has the story: AA has said it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153astonished\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over news that ousted chairman Bob Mackenzie is pushing for an employment tribunal hearing after being fired over gross misconduct last summer. The breakdown recovery and car insurance firm may now be forced to defend its decision to sack Mr Mackenzie - a move that was formally announced in August. AA said in a statement: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are astonished that Mr Mackenzie is taking this to an employment tribunal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We stand by our decision to dismiss him for gross misconduct following his sustained and violent assault on another employee of the AA, and will robustly defend any action.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reports have linked his dismissal to an attempted spin-off of the AA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insurance arm, which led to a physical altercation between Mr Mackenzie and insurance chief Michael Lloyd, as well as an earlier altercation in a public place with someone not thought to be an employee of the company. AA has since called on Mr Mackenzie to pay back more than \u00c2\u00a31.2m, accounting for annual bonuses stretching from 2016 to 2017. No change at the top of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance ministry: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been another lively day in the world of crypto-currencies. Bitcoin has tumbled by over 9%, taking its value back down to $14,650. Three weeks ago hit an all-time peak of nearly $20,000 before retracing its steps. But other digital currencies are in vogue, including Ether (the coin behind the Ethereum distributed app platform). The crypto boom has also pushed dogecoin to a fresh record high - even though this particular digital coin was created as a spoof. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alice Woodhouse explains: Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency based on an internet meme of a Shiba Inu dog, almost doubled in value over the weekend, bringing its market capitalisation to more than $2bn on Sunday. Launched as a joke digital currency in late 2013 by self-described \u00e2\u20ac\u0153data geek\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jackson Palmer, Dogecoin describes itself as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fun and friendly internet currency\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The digital currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent gains suggest it has been caught up in the recent investor frenzy for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Credit rating agency Fitch has added to the optimistic mood in the markets, by reporting that the outlook for credit is the best in a decade. Fitch reports that the number of likely credit upgrades in 2018 and 2019 outnumbers potential downgrades by the most since 2008. But it also warns that this may be as good as it gets - some companies could find it harder to service their debts once interest rates rise higher. Monica Insoll, a Fitch managing director, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The rating outlook trend is the most upbeat in a decade, with positive outlooks outnumbering negatives. But the net bias is only just over 1% and occurs as the world is about to hit peak growth in the current cycle. The continued tightening of monetary policy, together with significant policy and political uncertainty, is likely to pose increasing challenges to ratings.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The futures market suggests the US stock market will hold onto Friday night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record highs, when trading begins in an hour. Over in Germany, acting chancellor Angela Merkel has entered coalition talks with the left-leaning Social Democrats. It looks like a final attempt to form a new government, following last autumn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inconclusive election. Reaching an agreement could be tough; the SPD are likely to demand concessions on issues like welfare spending, tax, and European integration. But optimism that a deal is possible is helping the market today, says Mike van Dulken, head of Research at Accendo Markets: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Equities are off their best levels but maintain a northerly bearing, buoyed by German coalition talks and fresh highs on Wall St, despite mixed Eurozone macro data and commodities off their best levels. A stronger US dollar helps, pushing the British pound and the euro lower, especially the latter to ensure the German DAX outperforms the UK FTSE. US futures point to another positive opening this afternoon. Over in Athens, prime minister Alexis Tsipras has told his first cabinet meeting of the year that Greece is in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153final stretch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of its third bailout programme. Helena Smith reports from Athens The leftist leader told cabinet members that he expected the debt-stricken country, under international surveillance since 2010, to return to international markets after its current economic adjustment program officially expires in August. Sounding an optimistic note, Tsipras described 2018 as a landmark year that would be replete with challenge, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u01532018 is a milestone year ... a year full of challenges that in order to be met require hard work so that this can also be a year of vindication for the sacrifices of the Greek people.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The third - and penultimate - compliance review of terms agreed in exchange for emergency funding under Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest bailout was reaching conclusion, the prime minister told his cabinet. When Athens enters \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the last chapter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of fiscal adjustment Greece will have closed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153huge circle of supervision which began in May 2010 when the country was excluded from money markets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. A multi-bill outlining almost 100 agreed reforms known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prior actions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will be submitted to parliament tomorrow ahead of a three-day debate. Leading members of Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leftist Syriza party have voiced opposition to some of the more onerous measures, such as electronic auctions of property owners who are indebted to banks. Sterling has made a subdued start to the week, as traders watch Theresa May reshuffle her cabinet. The pound dropped 0.2% to $1.354 against the US dollar, but has risen a little against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.13. The cabinet reshuffle could have implications for Brexit; according to the Daily Telegraph, the PM will appoint \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a cabinet minister for no-deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, who will prepare for a Hard Brexit. Royal Bank of Canada say: The UK papers are full with reports of a pending cabinet reshuffle of May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government. The most interesting development for markets seems the planned creation of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcminister for no-deal Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which should underpin the notion of the UK being in a position to walk away from the negotiations with the EU. The reshuffle is getting up to speed now, with Northern Ireland secretary James Brokenshire resigning on health grounds, and confusion over whether transport secretary Chris Grayling has been moved to become Conservative Party chairman. My colleague Andrew Sparrow has full details in his Politics Live blog: World stock markets are celebrating their best start to a new year since 2010 this morning. European shares are doing their bit, having hit their highest level since August 2015 this morning, after Asia rallied to near-record levels. Traders are encouraged by this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong consumer confidence and investor sentiment survey, which suggests the eurozone economy is continuing to flourish. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, sees no sign of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcJanuary Blues\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the markets today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All the key indicators for December show that confidence amongst investors and consumers is firmly on the rise, which only increases the likelihood of the European Central Bank winding down its quantitative easing programme. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After being in the doldrums for so long, the eurozone has rebounded in spectacular fashion, with investors piling into the euro in their droves. In another piece of encouraging soft data, the European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic confidence index has hit its highest level since 2000. The sentiment index has risen to 116, beating forecasts of 114.8, showing that the pick-up in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has raised morale in the region. Just in: Investor optimism across the eurozone has risen, in the latest sign of confidence in the global economy. The monthly survey of investor morale produced by research group Sentix jumped to 32.9, up from December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 31.1. When asked about the current economic situation, investors were at their most upbeat since 2007. This optimism underlines why stock markets have been rallying recently, as investors react to signs that economic growth is picking. Sentix says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The economy in all regions of the world is looking stable and positive and is showing moderate improvements.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The upturn is therefore broad and synchronous. The likelihood of possible overheating is rising.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jonathan Samuels, CEO of property lender Octane Capital, agrees that UK house prices will be subdued this year. Halifax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s verdict on 2017 is of a flat and uneventful year, restrained by economic uncertainty in the light of Brexit and consumer caution given the high cost of living.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Few would argue with theHalifax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conclusion that UK price growth is likely to remain pedestrian at best during 2018. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Low single digit growth is about as exciting as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to get, but in reality this is a positive for the market given the affordability crisis in many areas of the country. Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent, says UK house-buyers are driving harder bargains - so owners need to be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrealistic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 when setting prices. There is no doubt that prices are softening, particularly in London, but Halifax also confirms what we are seeing on the high street - that a lot of hard bargaining is going on and people are generally trying to get on with their moves. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to see any great change in the next few months but the realistic players will succeed, whereas those wedded to the idea of the housing market we have seen in previous years will simply not sell.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Halifax also reports that house price buyers, and sellers, are in short supply: New buyer enquiries appeared a little more stable over the month having declined sharply in autumn, this measure, however, has now fallen for the last eight months. Turning to supply, new instructions to sell continued to deteriorate at the headline level and has now fallen for 22 consecutive months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the worst sequence for close to eight years. UK house prices fell by 0.6% in December, according to the latest survey from Halifax bank. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first monthly decline since last June, and the latest signal that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property market is weakening. Halifax also reports that prices only rose by 2.7% during 2017, with the quarterly growth rate slowing to 1.3% in October-December. Russell Galley, Managing Director, Halifax Community Bank, blames economic uncertainty and falling real wages. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d anticipated, the housing market in 2017 followed a similar pattern to the previous year. House price growth slowed, whilst building activity, completed sales and mortgage approvals for house purchase all remained flat. This has been driven by a squeeze on real wage growth and continuing uncertainty over the economy. However, nationally house prices in 2018 are likely to be supported by the ongoing shortage of properties for sale, low levels of housebuilding, high employment and a continuation of low interest rates making mortgage servicing affordable in relative terms. Overall we expect annual price growth to continue in the range of 0-3% at the end 2018.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some rapid reaction from property analyst Pete Wargent... ..and economist Shaun Richards Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index has hit a fresh record high today. The blue-chip gauge of the biggest companies listed in London rose to 7733 points, nine points higher than Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close. But the rally didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last long. The Footsie then slipped back, thanks to tech firm Micro Focus which has slumped by 9% after releasing its latest financial results Micro Focus, which merged with Hewlett Packard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enterprise software arm last year, reported a 9.5% drop in earnings per share, despite am 80% jump in revenues thanks to the HP deal. Ouch! Shares in Mothercare have tumbled by a quarter after this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning. Shares slumped to just 42p at the open before stabilising around 47p, down from 62p on Friday. It looks like a record low. Mothercare has shed around 90% of its value since the start of the decade, and is now worth just \u00c2\u00a380m. Neil Wilson fo ETX Capital says the company has suffered from its decision not to cut prices in the run-up to Christmas. We should look to management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision not to discount in the peak trading season as a significant contributing factor. Admirable perhaps but with competitors slashing prices ahead of Christmas amid (justified) fears of a slowdown in consumer spending, it looks as if the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconscious decision\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to remain at full price prior to Christmas but to then discount more heavily in the end of season sale was a mistake. Clearly Mothercare et al are up against it and the update does not bode especially well for the retail sector ahead of an important week of releases. UK mother and baby retailer Mothercare has just become the second high street retailer to hit the City with a profits warning, after a disappointing Christmas. And it looks like a stonker: Mothercare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK like-for-like sales shrank by 7.2% in the last 12 weeks over 2017. It even managed to shrink its online sales, by 6.9%. Profits are now expected to shrink to between \u00c2\u00a31m and \u00c2\u00a35m this financial year; investors had expected more like \u00c2\u00a310m. Mothercare blames: ...lower footfall and spend, both in stores and online, following the continuation of consumer trends flagged in our half year results. And worryingly, Mothercare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO Mark Newton-Jones doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect any improvement in the short-term market conditions for the UK. This follows the profits warning from high-street chain Debenhams last week. Boom! European stocks have opened at their highest level in two and a half years. The Stoxx 600, which tracks the biggest companies in the region, has gained 0.3% in early trading, reaching levels last seen in August 2015. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters take on the stock market rally: Asian shares crept toward all-time peaks on Monday after Wall Street boasted its best start to a year in over a decade, with brisk economic growth and benign inflation proving a potent cocktail for risk appetites. MSCI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.2 percent having climbed 3.1 percent last week, its strongest performance in six months. At 588.55, the index is within spitting distance of its record top of 591.50 hit in November 2007. The Philippines is already at a record, while Australian stocks eked out another decade top. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei was closed for a holiday but last week touched its highest since 1992. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global stock markets remain buoyant this morning, as the bull market shows no signs of running out of steam. Investors remain optimistic about the prospects for growth and corporate earnings this year, putting aside concerns such as Brexit and the Trump presidency. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has risen to its highest levels since the second half of November, amid an optimistic session in Asia. Europe is expected to follow suit today too, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX also tipped to rally. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, says: Shares in Europe look set for a strong open on Monday. The FTSE 100 could buck the trend by opening lower after a record-breaking first week of trading in 2018. Optimism stemming from strength of European and global economy should help the German DAX index open at 7-week highs. The opening strength tracks small gain in Asia, where markets were unperturbed by reports from China that the PBOC think \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there is room for an increase in interest rates in the short term\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s underwhelming US jobs report hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t punctured the rally. So traders - some of whom have driven the euro up in recent weeks - will be looking at new eurozone investor confidence and retail sales figures today. In the UK, the Halifax bank will report new house price figures - at a time when prices seem to be slowing. The agenda: 8.30am GMT: Halifax UK house price index for December 9.30am GMT: The Sentix survey of investor confidence in the eurozone 10am GMT: Eurozone retail sales figures for November",

The intra-day peak of 7733.39 was reached on Monday.

Now this support is being gradually and cautiously withdrawn, but could the process speed up, and what effect will it have on share prices? Chris Beauchamp, chief market Analyst at IG, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Markets continue to make gains even as investors begin to consider the possibilities of more central bank tightening over the coming year and beyond. There are those wondering whether the Bank of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moves overnight to ease back on bond purchases portends a bigger shift in global markets; if the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most assiduous user of quantitative easing is itself easing back on the use of the proverbial punchbowl, will this mean that the others, especially the Fed and the ECB, will start to shift into a higher gear earlier than previously thought?</p> <p>At least it must be for the right reasons \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only signs of real recovery would get the BoJ to move in the direction of tighter policy, and so for now stocks should remain the best way to play the global economic recovery.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a54e315e4b043ead794bd64\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-09T15:45:19.743Z\">3.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile as the UK trading day enters its final straight, the FTSE 100 is tantalisingly near another record closing high.</p> <p>It is currently at 7725 which would not be an intra-day peak but would mark a new record close, just. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the FTSE ummed and ahhed over hitting new highs, the Dow Jones wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as shy, opening at a fresh record peak.</p> <p>The Dow wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t <em>that</em> explosive after the bell rang on Wall Street. Yet, a 70 point rise left it tickling 25350, continuing its remarkable, seemingly unending climb. As for the afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meagre data offerings, just like its non-farm cousin last Friday, the latest JOLTS job openings reading came in below estimates, at 5.88 million compared to the downward revised 5.92 million seen the month previous.</p> <p>The FTSE rose a half a percent throughout the day, fuelled by the Morrisons-led gains in the supermarket sector, sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.4% and 0.1% declines against the dollar and euro respectively, and a healthy set of commodity stocks. This once again leaves the UK index around the 7720 to 7730 mark, tantalisingly close to another record high \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hopefully Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christmas update tomorrow will help the FTSE maintain the momentum it seems to have found today.</p> <p>Over in the Eurozone the DAX and CAC varied in their enthusiasm. The former nudged just 0.1% higher despite a far better than forecast German industrial production figure; the latter, meanwhile, found itself trading at a 2 month peak after jumping half a percent.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a54df85e4b043ead794bd3d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-09T15:32:18.623Z\">3.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bitcoin is on the slide despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jan/09/german-industrial-output-exports-eurozone-unemployment-morrisons-majestic-business-live?page=with:block-5a54ab6ee4b043ead794bad6#block-5a54ab6ee4b043ead794bad6\">the earlier comments </a>from JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon that he regrets calling the cryptocurrency a fraud last September.</p> <p>Bitcoin is currently down nearly 2% at $14,708.

But the rally in oil prices to their highest level since May 2015 might fizzle out before too long, says Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at Forex.com:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Overnight saw the price of WTI crude hit its best level since May 2015, before falling back a little. Oil prices have hit the ground running at the start of this year, continuing their recovery from the middle of 2017, as global crude stockpiles fell from record high levels and due to good compliance with the production cuts by OPEC and Russia. Given that the production agreement has been extended to the end of 2018 at OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last meeting<strong>, </strong>the market clearly expects crude inventory levels to drop further.</p> <p>But with OPEC set to review the duration of oil output cuts based on fundamentals at its next meeting in June, there is a possibility they could end the agreement sooner than expected. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, oil prices are now at levels many regard as being high enough for US shale producers to accelerate drilling and production in the coming months. This could discourage OPEC and Russia to maintain their oil supply collusion until the end of the year, as many producers within OPEC itself won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be happy to lose further market share to the US. Thus, there is a risk that the agreement could end prematurely, potentially resulting in another supply war. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-09T14:39:50.029Z\">at 2.39pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a54cb1de4b006063846c1d9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-09T14:04:40.811Z\">2.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Leading UK shares are edging to within a hair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breadth of a new intra-day peak, with the FTSE 100 up 0.47% at 7733.12.</p> <p>That would beat the record of 7733.39 set as long ago as .... yesterday.

It then sets out these rules in its handbook.</p> <p>This is how what should have been a BYOD rule affecting only part of the market has been turned into a blanket ruling on BYOD affecting everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201c right down to self-employed advisers.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>But before you chuck your phone in the bin, the FCA has since clarified that individuals can bring their own devices to work after all.</strong> However, bosses must take all reasonable steps to prevent them using them to send or receive unrecorded messages or calls. </p> <p>Another headache for the IT manager.....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GazTheJourno/status/950307088928051200\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Financial Conduct Authority &#39;gold-plates&#39; EU <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MIFID?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MIFID</a> II rule, bans BYOD across entire UK finance sector &lt;- exclusive by me <a href=\"https://t.co/9iHT4O6UFC\">https://t.co/9iHT4O6UFC</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/kUnTnaxVCz\">pic.twitter.com/kUnTnaxVCz</a></p>&mdash; Gareth Corfield (@GazTheJourno) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GazTheJourno/status/950307088928051200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 8, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-09T11:46:56.752Z\">at 11.46am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a54a14ee4b006063846c014\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-09T11:03:16.957Z\">11.03am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is optimistic about growth prospects in 2018:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HandelsblattGE/status/950683947142348805\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government expects the economy to grow this year at around the same rate as last year, when it expanded by 2.2%. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/newsdesk?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#newsdesk</a></p>&mdash; Handelsblatt Global (@HandelsblattGE) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HandelsblattGE/status/950683947142348805?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 9, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a549bd1e4b034b6630d1e76\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-09T11:01:33.251Z\">11.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jan/09/german-industrial-output-exports-eurozone-unemployment-morrisons-majestic-business-live?page=with:block-5a5492e7e4b034b6630d1e18#block-5a5492e7e4b034b6630d1e18\">The decline in eurozone unemployment</a> will please the European Central Bank.</strong></p> <p>ECB president Mario Draghi has often cited falling joblessness as a defence of his stimulus policies, which cut interest rates to record lows and pumped trillions of euros into the economy.</p> <p><strong>Dennis de Jong</strong>, managing director at<strong> <a href=\"http://www.ufx.com/\">UFX.com</a>,</strong> reckons Draghi can feel vindicated, in the face of criticism from some politicians (particularly in Germany).

                "bodyText":"With Wall Street roaring ahead again, European markets have ended the trading day on a positive note. The positive German economic data has helped sentiment in the eurozone, while the FTSE 100 has hit a new closing high thanks in no small part to a rise in retail shares. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 34.51 points or 0.45% at 7731.02 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.13% to 13,385.59 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.67% at 5523.94 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was 0.7% better at 23,004.98 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.27% at 10,426.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.5% to 841.28 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 122 points or 0.49% higher. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Healthcare and banking stocks are leading the way on Wall Street ahead of what is expected to be a strong reporting season. JP Morgan is the first big bank to report later this week. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index has made it, closing at a new record high if not quite reaching an intra-day peak. The FTSE 100 finished up 34.51 points or 0.45% at 7731.02, beating last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close of 7724.22. The intra-day peak of 7733.39 was reached on Monday. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The London market has been helped along by the supermarkets as Marks and Spencer, Sainsburys and Morrisons are in demand on the back of the report from Nielsen which stated all of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig four\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 had a positive Christmas period. One of the main reasons for stock markets recovering so well since the financial crisis, of course, is the massive support provided by central banks in the form of low interest rates and quantitative easing. Now this support is being gradually and cautiously withdrawn, but could the process speed up, and what effect will it have on share prices? Chris Beauchamp, chief market Analyst at IG, says: Markets continue to make gains even as investors begin to consider the possibilities of more central bank tightening over the coming year and beyond. There are those wondering whether the Bank of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moves overnight to ease back on bond purchases portends a bigger shift in global markets; if the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most assiduous user of quantitative easing is itself easing back on the use of the proverbial punchbowl, will this mean that the others, especially the Fed and the ECB, will start to shift into a higher gear earlier than previously thought? At least it must be for the right reasons \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only signs of real recovery would get the BoJ to move in the direction of tighter policy, and so for now stocks should remain the best way to play the global economic recovery. Meanwhile as the UK trading day enters its final straight, the FTSE 100 is tantalisingly near another record closing high. It is currently at 7725 which would not be an intra-day peak but would mark a new record close, just. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: While the FTSE ummed and ahhed over hitting new highs, the Dow Jones wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as shy, opening at a fresh record peak. The Dow wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that explosive after the bell rang on Wall Street. Yet, a 70 point rise left it tickling 25350, continuing its remarkable, seemingly unending climb. As for the afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meagre data offerings, just like its non-farm cousin last Friday, the latest JOLTS job openings reading came in below estimates, at 5.88 million compared to the downward revised 5.92 million seen the month previous. The FTSE rose a half a percent throughout the day, fuelled by the Morrisons-led gains in the supermarket sector, sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.4% and 0.1% declines against the dollar and euro respectively, and a healthy set of commodity stocks. This once again leaves the UK index around the 7720 to 7730 mark, tantalisingly close to another record high \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hopefully Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christmas update tomorrow will help the FTSE maintain the momentum it seems to have found today. Over in the Eurozone the DAX and CAC varied in their enthusiasm. The former nudged just 0.1% higher despite a far better than forecast German industrial production figure; the latter, meanwhile, found itself trading at a 2 month peak after jumping half a percent. Bitcoin is on the slide despite the earlier comments from JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon that he regrets calling the cryptocurrency a fraud last September. Bitcoin is currently down nearly 2% at $14,708. On Monday two US companies withdrew proposals to launch bitcoin exchange-traded funds, citing concerns by the Securities and Exchange Commission. If the FTSE 100 is not quite there, US markets have opened at new high. Bolstered by hopes of strong economic growth, the Trump tax reforms and the expectation of a positive reporting season which starts this week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 0.26% to 25,345. The S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.13% at a record 2751 while the Nasdaq Composite is 0.24% better at a new peak of 7174. Oil prices continue to move higher, shrugging off reports that Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister had said that Opec did not want to see crude much above $60 a barrel. At the moment, Brent crude is up 0.43% at $68.07 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is up 0.68% at $62.15. But the rally in oil prices to their highest level since May 2015 might fizzle out before too long, says Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at Forex.com: Overnight saw the price of WTI crude hit its best level since May 2015, before falling back a little. Oil prices have hit the ground running at the start of this year, continuing their recovery from the middle of 2017, as global crude stockpiles fell from record high levels and due to good compliance with the production cuts by OPEC and Russia. Given that the production agreement has been extended to the end of 2018 at OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last meeting, the market clearly expects crude inventory levels to drop further. But with OPEC set to review the duration of oil output cuts based on fundamentals at its next meeting in June, there is a possibility they could end the agreement sooner than expected. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, oil prices are now at levels many regard as being high enough for US shale producers to accelerate drilling and production in the coming months. This could discourage OPEC and Russia to maintain their oil supply collusion until the end of the year, as many producers within OPEC itself won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be happy to lose further market share to the US. Thus, there is a risk that the agreement could end prematurely, potentially resulting in another supply war. Leading UK shares are edging to within a hair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breadth of a new intra-day peak, with the FTSE 100 up 0.47% at 7733.12. That would beat the record of 7733.39 set as long ago as .... yesterday. Retailers are leading the way after the better than expected Christmas trading update from Morrison while technology group Micro Focus has recovered some of the ground lost following disappointment with Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s half year results. If it stays at this level it will manage a new closing high. The previous level is 7724.22, set last Friday. More retail news: troubled burger chain Byron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is reportedly planning to shut stores in a bid to cut its rental bill and keep operating. Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Kleinman reports: Sky News has learnt that the company will launch a so-called company voluntary arrangement (CVA) on Wednesday that will require the approval of creditors including landlords. The CVA is critical to Byron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future because a new injection of cash into the business, agreed last month, will only take place if the restructuring of its property interests is voted through. Sources close to the deal, which is being handled by KPMG, said the proposals were likely to involve the closure of around 15 poorly performing restaurants and a reduction of rental payments at approximately 20 others. CVA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are a popular way for struggling companies to ditch their worst-performing outlets and trim costs, making them financially viable. But if Byron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s landlords reject the plan, the burger vendor could soon be out of the grill and into the fire.... Aid and development charity Oxfam has also had a good Christmas - and people in the poorest parts of the world should benefit My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: Oxfam proved a Christmas hit with UK shoppers as vintage designer party clothing and first-edition books helped drive a sharp rise in online sales over the festive season. The charity said Burberry, Barbour, Gucci, Whistles and Boden were among the most popular clothing brands searched for on its online shop, where sales jumped by a third in the eight weeks to 23 December. Cameras, blankets and throws were also sought-after items. Oxfam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total sales over the period were \u00c2\u00a316.9m, up 1.2% on the same period in 2016. The charity said the extra money raised was enough to provide clean, safe water for almost 200,000 people in an emergency. More here: JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, Jamie Dimon, seems to have eaten some bitcoin humble pie. Dimon has told Fox News that he \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcregretted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 labelling bitcoin as a fraud last September - a comment that enraged (or amused) cyber-currency supporters. But while he acknowledges that the blockchain that underpins bitcoin has real uses, he insists he still isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very interested in the whole issue of digital currencies. As Dimon put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The blockchain is real. You can have crypto yen and dollars and stuff like that. ICO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s [initial coin offerings - or new digital coins] you have to look at individually. The bitcoin to me was always what the governments are gonna feel about bitcoin as it gets really big, and I just have a different opinion than other people. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not interested that much in the subject at all.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dimon also backed Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tax reforms -- arguing that the president was right to almost halve US corporation tax to 21%. The old 40% tax rate was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153huge disadvantage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to America, Dimon argued, driving capital and skilled labour overseas. In the long run, the cut will help firms to grow their businesses and invest in research and development, Dimon insists. Critics of the tax reforms, though, argue that they will mainly benefit high-earners, and end up costing middle-class Americans in the long term. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of how bitcoin shrugged off Dimon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning: Technology site The Register has a good scoop -- apparently Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s City watchdog has (perhaps accidentally) banned workers across the financial services industry from using their own phones and computers for work. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all to do with the new MIFID II directive; designed to prevent market abuse which came into force this week. The FCA seems to have enforced the new rules with excessive zeal. The Reg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gareth Corfield explains: The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Conduct Authority has quietly transposed an EU rule without including a crucial bit of detail, thus effectively banning BYOD [bring your own device] policies in all financial services organisations across Blighty. The UK version of the rule, which came into force on January 1, prohibits any business regulated by the FCA from letting its employees communicate with each other or the outside world \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on privately owned equipment which the firm is unable to record or copy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, the original version of the rule, contained in the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Market In Financial Instruments Directive (MIFID II), restricted this only to investment firms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not applying it to the entire financial sector. The FCA regulates financial services firms ranging in size from behemoths such as Goldman Sachs right down to independent financial advisers who tell ordinary folk where best to put their savings and investments. The body uses powers contained in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) to implement conduct and prudential rules, among these directives received from EU. It then sets out these rules in its handbook. This is how what should have been a BYOD rule affecting only part of the market has been turned into a blanket ruling on BYOD affecting everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201c right down to self-employed advisers. But before you chuck your phone in the bin, the FCA has since clarified that individuals can bring their own devices to work after all. However, bosses must take all reasonable steps to prevent them using them to send or receive unrecorded messages or calls. Another headache for the IT manager..... Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is optimistic about growth prospects in 2018: The decline in eurozone unemployment will please the European Central Bank. ECB president Mario Draghi has often cited falling joblessness as a defence of his stimulus policies, which cut interest rates to record lows and pumped trillions of euros into the economy. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, reckons Draghi can feel vindicated, in the face of criticism from some politicians (particularly in Germany). But there could be more challenges ahead.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lower unemployment sets the field for wage growth and ultimately higher inflation, so the euro should be in demand with traders today. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Draghi has successfully navigated the eurozone through a particularly tricky period, and its economic prospects look strong. However, with further political instability brewing in both Spain and Germany, not to mention uncertainty surrounding Brexit, some continue to ask what lies beneath this millpond?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is an significant moment: Unemployment among young people across the eurozone has also fallen, but the job isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t finished yet. The euro-area jobless rate dropped to 18.2% in November, down from 20.5% a year ago. But again, some countries are in much better shape than others: In November 2017, the lowest rates were observed in the Czech Republic (5.0%) and Germany (6.6%), while the highest were recorded in Greece (39.5% in September 2017), Spain (37.9%) and Italy (32.7%). The unemployment rate across the wider European Union has fallen to a nine-year low of 7.3%, down from 7.4%. Over the last 12 months, unemployment in the EU has dropped by 2.133 million people, and by 1.561 million in the euro area. But before anyone gets carried away, there are still 18.116 million men and women unemployed in the EU, including 14.263 million in the eurozone. Newsflash: Unemployment across the eurozone has hit its lowest rate on almost nine years. The euro-area jobless rate fell to 8.7% in November, down from 8.8% in October. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best reading since January 2009, when the global economy was crashing into recession. But... there are still sharp differences between euro-area members. The lowest unemployment rates were recorded in the Czech Republic (2.5%), and Malta and Germany (both 3.6%). While in Greece, more than one in five people (20.5%) are out of work, followed by Spain with a 16.7% jobless rate. More to follow.... City analysts are welcoming today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong German economic data, particularly the 3.4% jump in industrial production in November. Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics says German seems to be ending 2017 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with a bang\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surge in German industrial production is a welcome confirmation that the economy approached the end of 2017 in very good health and the surveys point to further strength to come. Mark Ostwald of ADM Investor Services agrees, saying: Better than expected German Trade and Production data affirmed what is already well known, i.e. that the German economy is in rude health. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great to see Majestic Wine and Morrison\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bosses praising their hard-working employees this morning. But a cynic might wonder whether they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re partly motivated by a fear of losing them. Recruitment firms say that UK companies are finding it harder and harder to find skilled staff - putting a real premium on retaining workers. Kevin Green, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the worst situation in at least a decade. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have lists where recruiters cite the jobs they are currently finding it hard to fill, in permanent jobs there used to be six or seven areas. Now there are 50 or 60. It goes on and on and on. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is comprehensive, you would have to say the skill and talent shortages are pervasive across the economy at the moment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This tightening labour market is good news for employees, as they should be able to negotiate significant pay rise. Warm words in the Christmas trading updates won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be enough! The Telegraph has the details: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is on the brink of a new all-time high. The blue-chip index has gained 33 points to 7,729 points, just 4 point shy of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intraday peak. Majestic Wine is also highlighting its staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheerful nature in the face of customers seeking the perfect Pinot Grigio or Pomerol for the Christmas festivities. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest wine retailer grew its like-for-like sales by 4.1% over the 10-week Christmas period, including a 1.3% rise at its retail outlets. CEO Rowan Gormley says Majestic, which also owns online retailer Naked Wines, is on track to hit City forecasts: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The team performed brilliantly. The fact that we have been able to grow sales and maintain margins shows that our winning formula of fabulous customer service from delightful people and delicious wines at fair prices works even when times are tough. 15 months ago, Majestic Wine hit its shareholders with a profits warning, so Gormley hopefully enjoyed a better Christmas this time around. Christmas can be a stressful time for shoppers and shop-workers alike. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interesting that Morrisons reckons its staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheery demeanour boosted its sales over the festive period. It says: Customer satisfaction again improved year-on-year \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 we had more tills open, shorter queues, and customers noticed our colleagues\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 friendliness even at the busiest times. The Evening Standard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alex Lawson doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound convinced: Neil Wilson of ETX Capital is impressed by Morrisons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sales growth over Christmas. He suspects that investors who bet against Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth-largest supermarket will soon have burned fingers, following this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial results. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market has not really been buying into Morrisons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 recent run of form, but yet another very impressive trading statement that has beaten expectations comfortably could turn the tide of opinion. Eight straight quarters of sales growth, yet shares were last trading c8% off the highs last February. That may change now and the shorts could face a big squeeze this morning. Short interest is quite high so this share could pop if they throw in the towel and finally buy into David Potts and co\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy, which is clearly paying off. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says Morrisons has a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mega\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Christmas: For the 10 weeks to 7th January the smallest of the Big Four supermarkets smashed expectations, posting a 2.8% surge in like-for-like sales (excluding fuel) against the 1.7% rise forecast Breaking down the figures further and Morrisons had plenty to smile about; its Best premium range jumped 25%, suggesting savvy branding on the supermarket\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behalf, while online sales, which include those made through Amazon Fresh, were up 10%. These figures sent the Northern favourite nearly 4.5% higher to a 3 month peak, and set a high bar to clear for Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer, all of whom report this week. Supermarket chain Morrisons has smashed City forecasts for the crucial Christmas period, sending its shares jumping. Morrisons grew its like-for-like sales by 2.8% over the last 10 weeks, beating expectations of 1.7% growth. The Christmas and New Year period was particularly strong, with sales surging by 3.7% CEO David Potts says his turnaround plan is bearing fruits: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153More and more customers found more things they wanted to buy at competitive prices at Morrisons this Christmas. The hard work and friendliness of our colleagues continues to be key in delivering our strengthening performance, and I would like to thank them for everything they do for our customers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares have jumped by 4% in early trading, as Morrison\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cements its place as a Christmas winner. More reaction to follow.... European stock markets have opened higher, with the jump in German industrial production cheering traders. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: European markets are trading higher as investors have reacted to positive German industrial data. The number was simply astonishing, and it printed the reading of 3.4% when the market was expecting a number of 1.8%. But Maxime Sbaihi of Bloomberg is a little more cautious: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector has staged a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong comeback\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says analyst Carsten Brzeski of ING. He points out that these industrial production figures have been volatile - but the trend is positive, suggesting Germany isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being held back by pick-up in the euro exchange rate. Brzeski writes: German industry has gone through a small rollercoaster ride since the start of the summer. Disappointing numbers were followed by impressive rebounds. Behind the vacation and weather driven white noise of monthly data, however, there is a clear upward trend. Up to now, 2017 industrial production has had its best year since 2011. Contrary to earlier cycles, industrial production has been a lagging, rather than a leading indicator for the German recovery. The strengthening of the euro exchange rate since April 2017 has left the German export sector unharmed. The geographic diversity of German exports once again seems to be the key to success. Particularly, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close and distant neighbours in the East have safeguarded this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s export revival. Germany currently exports as much to Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic as it does to the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. Exports to China have also rebounded this year. At the same time, the US remains the single most important export destination, while exports to the UK are becoming less important. More here: We also have new German trade figures - and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also stronger than expected. German companies grew their exports by a sparkling 4.1% in November, well ahead of forecast of a 1.2% gain. Imports also rose too, by 2.3%, ahead of forecasts of a 0.8% rise. The seasonally adjusted data suggests that German manufacturers and service companies benefitted from the growing global economy, and that domestic demand was also solid. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign trade balance swelled to a surplus of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac23.7bn in November 2017, up from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac22.0bn a year earlier. It ran a surplus with its fellow EU members, and with the rest of the world. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: In November 2017, Germany exported goods to the value of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac67.9bn to the Member States of the European Union (up 8%), while it imported goods to the value of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac62.1bn from those countries (up 9.5%) Exports of goods to countries outside the European Union (third countries) amounted to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac48.5bn in November 2017 (up 8.4%), while imports from those countries totalled \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30.7bn euros (up 5.9%). On an annual basis, German industrial output growth hit a six-year high. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has smashed forecasts this morning, with a big jump in factory output. German industrial production rose by 3.4% in November, new figures from statistics body Destatis show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest monthly rise since September 2009, suggesting Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy picked up pace late last year. Factories reported a surge in demand for heavy-duty machinery, vehicles and other equipment (capital goods), with consumer products also in demand. Destatis explains: Within industry, the production of capital goods increased by 5.7% and the production of consumer goods by 3.6%. The production of intermediate goods showed an increase by 3.0%. Energy production was down by 3.1% in November 2017 and the production in construction increased by 1.5%. Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics is impressed: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out if supermarket chain Morrisons, drinks business Majestic Wine and floorings business Topps Tiles were festive winners and losers, as they report their Christmas trading figures. Housebuilder Persimmon is also updating the City. New eurozone jobless figures are due this morning, which may show that unemployment in Europe has hit a new eight-year low of 8.7%. Otherwise there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much on the economic calendar. Stock markets remain at record levels again this morning, as the global rally in shares continues. City investors will also be digesting yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cabinet reshuffle, which frankly looks like a mess after health secretary Jeremy Hunt dug his heels in and refused to move, and education secretary Justine Greening quit rather than take a new role. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly an exhibition of prime ministerial authority from Theresa May, says Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit.

Among the most contentious is the demand that Greece pare back the right of unionists to press ahead with industrial action - in a country where strikes are regarded as a hallowed right won with sweat and blood. Demonstrators also converged on courts in angry scenes protesting against electronic auctions of properties belonging to indebted bank depositors.

Read our full story here: Superdry is the biggest faller in the FTSE 250, with shares down 8%, after the clothing retailer announced a fall in profits despite a positive Christmas performance: The RAC says the recent rise in oil prices to just below $70 could be bad news for UK motorists without a significant strengthening of the pound. The breakdown recovery firm warns the rise could potentially put further pressure on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cash-strapped consumers if they have to pay more at the pump. Simon Williams, fuel spokesman at the RAC, comments: Oil hitting $70 a barrel is potentially very bad for motorists who are already having to get used to paying 7p a litre more for petrol and 9p more for diesel than they did last July. If oil stays at this level, pump price hikes will be almost inevitable. With households across the country still feeling the cost of Christmas this is not the start to 2018 anyone would have wanted. It could also negatively affect business and further fuel inflation. The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil is just a touch below $70 at $69.33, the highest level since 5 December 2014. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.6% in the final quarter of 2017, according to an estimate by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research*. That would be the fastest rate of growth since the final three months of 2016, and would put annual growth in 2017 at 1.8%, slightly below growth of 1.9% in 2016. The economy grew by 0.4% in the third quarter of 2017. Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at the thinktank, says: We estimate that economic growth recovered to 0.6% in the final quarter of this year from 0.4% in the third quarter. Economic growth has picked up in the second half of 2017 after a period of subdued growth in the first six months. The recovery has been driven by both the manufacturing and the service sectors, supported by the weaker pound and a buoyant global economy, while construction output continues to lag. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to wait until 26 January for the first official estimate from the ONS. *In this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda I incorrectly stated the NIESR estimate would be published at 1pm. Sorry about that. AM The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small exporting firms are optimistic about the future, according to the trade body that represents them, despite Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wider trade deficit in November. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said the broader trend was more positive, with the trade in goods and services deficit narrowing by \u00c2\u00a32.1bn to \u00c2\u00a36.2bn in the three months to November. Mike Cherry, national chairman at the FSB: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a positive step to see the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total trade deficit narrowing in the three months to November 2017. Our own research shows exporting small firms remain optimistic about trade prospects, with an increase in those reporting either stable or increasing international sales in the last quarter of 2017. Our exporters continue to benefit from a depreciated pound and strong economic growth overseas. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The success of the UK economy rests on helping more small businesses to export, and with nine in ten small firms that do business internationally trading with EU nations, securing the right Brexit deal will be crucial. The ONS stats show an increase in exports to non-EU countries have contributed to the narrowing of the deficit, showing the importance of new agreements with key markets beyond Europe. Here is our full story on the UK data published this morning: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business secretary Greg Clark is in Paris for talks with Carlos Tavares, the chief executive of PSA, owner of Peugeot and Vauxhall. Concerns over the future of the Vauxhall plant at Ellesmere Port mounted after another 250 job cuts were announced this week, bringing the total number of redundancies announced over the past three months to 650. The cuts mean that more than a third of the workforce will have been lost since PSA took control last year. The pound is slightly up against the dollar, rising 0.1% to $1.3551. Earlier it dipped below $1.35 for the first time in a week, despite some fairly upbeat UK data. Against the euro, the pound is down 0.5% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1291. The dollar meanwhile is down 0.6% against a basket of other major currencies, its biggest drop in a month. The FTSE 100 has slipped into the red, failing to hang on to earlier gains as markets across Europe fall: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers are benefiting from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upswing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the global economy according to Christian Jaccarini at the Centre for Economics and Business Research. As the manufacturing sector is relatively outward-looking, producing around 45% of exports despite accounting for just 10% of UK employment, manufacturers have been significantly helped by a buoyant global economy and the weakened pound in recent quarters. The eurozone, which accounts for almost half of UK exports, is performing strongly and economic forecasters are unambiguously optimistic about its prospects moving forward. Though significant geopolitical threats remain, the world economic outlook is also positive. World air freight rose as much in 2017 as it has in the previous five years taken together. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, says the ONS data published this morning suggests the UK economy ended 2017 on a decent note. The first official estimate of growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 will be published on 26 January, but think tank NIESR will give its own estimate at 1pm today. The economy grew by 0.4% in the third quarter. Clarke says: UK GDP growth for the 4th quarter of 2017 is looking good again after some encouraging industrial and construction output data for November. These are the last concrete official monthly data that feed directly into the GDP arithmetic and give us the best clues to the likely growth rate when the data are released on 26 January. The manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 trade body, EEF, the manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation, said firms were feeling positive about prospects for the year ahead. A quick check in the rear view mirror confirms that UK manufacturers were, in the main, in good shape as 2017 came to a close with the majority of sub-sectors enjoying growth. Exports continue to pick up with the pace of growth in goods headed overseas outpacing the rate at which we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sucking in imports, enabling us to start chipping away at our sizeable trade deficit. Manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations for the year ahead point to output and export growth being maintained through this year on the back of continuing support from a burgeoning global economy. This, together with an on-going commitment from government to deliver on its industrial strategy will be crucial in helping to propel the sector forward. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, points out that industrial production has grown now for eight consecutive months, making it the longest run of growth since May 1994. A breakdown of the figures for industrial production - which grew 0.4% in November - showed growth in two of the four sub sectors over the month. Energy supply rose by 3.2% as temperatures dropped in November Manufacturing output was up 0.4%. There was broad-based strength in the sector, which helped to offset a sharp 7.1% fall in car production as demand slides Mining and quarrying fell by 1.4% Water supply, sewerage, and waste management dipped 0.8% The Office for National Statistics has published some key data on UK trade, industrial production and construction output. Here are the headline figures: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade in goods deficit with the rest of the world was the biggest in five months in November, rising to \u00c2\u00a312.2bn from \u00c2\u00a311.7bn in October Industrial production was stronger than expected, increasing by 0.4% in November following a 0.2% rise in October. Manufacturing output increased by 0.4%, beating expectations and the previous month Construction output was weaker than forecast, rising by 0.4% in November following a 1.1% drop a month earlier. Ole Black, senior statistician at the ONS, comments: There was strong and widespread growth across manufacturing with notable increases from renewable energy projects, boats, planes and cars for export. However, despite a small uptick in November, construction again contracted in the last three months, with private house building providing the only positive news in the sector. The trade deficit narrowed in the last three months, mainly due to increased exports of services, shipments of works of art and cars. Over the last year exports of goods, particularly cars, machinery and crude oil, have continued to increase, and at a faster rate than imports. Lidl had record UK sales in December, up 16%, as more customers visited the German discounter. Shoppers bought about 600 tonnes of Brussels sprouts, 17m mince pies and more than 800,000 litres of champagne and prosecco. Lidl cited research from Kantar Worldpanel that concluded it was the fastest-growing supermarket over the festive period. Christian H\u00c3\u00a4rtnagel, the chief executive of Lidl UK, said: Lidl UK has had a fantastic 2017 and this was capped by our strongest Christmas trading period to date. Customers came into our stores to buy more of their Christmas items, knowing they could find high-quality products at market-leading prices. We look forward to bringing the Lidl offering to more communities across the UK, as we continue our rapid expansion plan this year. Moss Bros has fallen into the category of Christmas loser after issuing a surprise profit warning this morning. The menswear retailer and suit hire business said fewer than expected customers visited its shops in December. Moss Bros now expects full-year, pre-tax profit in the range of \u00c2\u00a36.5m-\u00c2\u00a36.8m, slightly below current market expectations. Its chief executive, Brian Brick, gives his assessment: Having made considerable progress in building a strong, profitable, cash-generative menswear business, which has outperformed the market in recent years and despite continued progress throughout much of 2017, we faced a very tough December trading environment, which led to a significant reduction in store footfall and a hardening of the corresponding competitive environment in which we operate. In common with many UK retailers, the year ahead looks like being an extremely challenging one, not least because of the uncertain consumer environment, wider political backdrop and significant cost headwinds we face from a weaker pound, business rates and increasing employee-related costs. Having hit a closing high on Tuesday, the FTSE 100 has continued to make gains this morning, up about 10 points. Financial stocks and Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are among the biggest risers, as the leading index outperforms most of its European peers. The latest scores across Europe this morning: FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,740 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.3% at 13,348 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.2% at 5,515 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.3% at 23,071 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.03% at 10,430 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.3% at 399 Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is the latest big retailer to give an update of its trading performance over the crucial Christmas period. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mixed bag. Total sales were up 1.2% in the three months to 6 January and 1.1% on a like-for-like basis. That was in line with expectations. Grocery sales rose 2.3%. But general merchandise sales fell 1.3%, reflecting the growing reluctance among consumers to spend as much on non-essential, discretionary items. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s said profit would be moderately ahead of the expected \u00c2\u00a3559m because it had found more ways to save money by merging its supermarkets with Argos. This is what its chief executive, Mike Coupe, had to say: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re pleased with our performance across the group this quarter. We had a strong Christmas week, with record sales, more than 340,000 online grocery orders and stellar growth in Argos fast-track delivery and collection. Online accounted for 20% of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales during the quarter. Friday 22 [December] was our biggest sales day for stores and we also delivered an online grocery order to customers every second. Customers bought more Taste the Difference food than last year as people treated themselves and our popular 25p veg lines helped our customers live well for less. Read our full story here: Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, financial markets, eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big day for UK data, as official figures will shed light on how various parts of the economy are performing. The ONS figures on trade, manufacturing and construction will cover the month of November, giving a clearer picture of the state of the wider economy in the final quarter of 2017. Britain has started to slip down the G7 league table of growth, and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures will provide a backdrop to David Davis and Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trip to Germany, as the Brexit secretary and chancellor make a direct plea to German businesses to help them secure a good deal. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important day for UK data. Manufacturing has been a standout performer for the UK in Q4, if various independent surveys are to be believed, so it would be a surprise if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ONS announcements don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t confirm that picture. The agenda: 9.30am: UK trade figures are expected to show the goods deficit was roughly unchanged in November at \u00c2\u00a310.7bn. 9.30am: UK construction data for November is forecast to show a 0.8% rise in output, following a 1.7% drop in October. 9.30am: Industrial production and manufacturing figures are expected to show faster growth for the sectors in November. 1pm: The National Institute of Economic and Social Research will publish its estimate of UK growth in the fourth quarter of 2017. Also in the spotlight today are Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and fashion brand Superdry. Both companies have updated the market on their Christmas trading performance.",

Phrases [in the minutes] indicate a further adjustment but in our view no abrupt end.</p> <p>We stick to our previous view that the ECB will not stop QE in September but will rather decide on another \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lower for longer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd beyond September, probably until the end of the year. Interestingly, the ECB is more and more focusing on growth and seems to regard inflation only as a derivative of growth developments. Judging from previous experiences, to get an inflation rate sustainably at around 2%, the Eurozone economy needs to have a positive output gap.

                "bodyText":"The FTSE 100 may have hit a new peak, Wall Street may have recovered from Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses but the mood was more downbeat in Europe. The strengthening euro after the more hawkish than expected minutes from the European Central Bank pushed a number of European markets into the red by the close of trading. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 14.43 points or 0.19% at 7762.94 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax was down 0.59% at 13,202.90 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.29% lower at 5488.55 But Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 0.64% to 23,305.26 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex edged up 0.07% at 10,435.2 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.28% to 846.98 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 142 points or 0.56%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. One of the consequences of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market moves is that Just Eat has overtaken Marks &amp; Spencer in market value. WIth its 4.7% rise Just Eat is now worth \u00c2\u00a35.46bn. Marks on the other hand has fallen 7% to be valued at \u00c2\u00a34.87bn. Another day, another record close for the FTSE 100. Despite a poor performance from key retailers following their updates - Marks &amp; Spencer is down 7% and Tesco off 4.5% - the leading index has added 0.19% to a new record of 7762.94. Earlier it recorded a new intraday peak of 7768.96. Commodity stocks were in demand following the rise in oil prices, while the biggest gainer was Just Eat, up nearly 5% as analysts at Barclays raised their price target from 700p to 1000p. Brent crude has climbed above $70 a barrel, a new three year high. Growing demand as the global economy strengthens and the effect of Opec and Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement to extend output caps continue to support the price. But it is bad news for motorists, who face an increase in petrol prices: Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The euro rocketed higher this Thursday afternoon following a slightly more hawkish than expected set of ECB meeting minutes. While the end of QE isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t here just yet, there were a few notable shifts in the phrasing of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s December accounts that suggest talk of winding down its massive bond buying programme is likely going to become more and more prevalent as 2018 continues. Of course the euro \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which at the moment doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need much excuse to celebrate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was incredibly receptive to these signals. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the chief business economist at IHS Markit on the ECB minutes: The euro gained 0.9% to $1.2053 following the release of the ECB minutes, although it has now come off its best levels and is currently sitting at $1.1.2045. It is up around 5% against the pound at 88.9p. Earlier, a more hawkish tone from the minutes of the recent European Central Bank meeting gave some support to the euro. With the eurozone economy improving, the ECB minutes suggested policymakers might soon start preparing the markets for the end of its massive stimulus programme. The minutes said: The language pertaining to various dimensions of the monetary policy stance and forward guidance could be revisited early in [2018]. John Dolan, senior dealer at FEXCO Corporate Payments, said: The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mood music has dramatically picked up the tempo. While this is far from a definitive announcement, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clear signal that monetary policy tightening has entered mainstream ECB thought. On this evidence, the end of loose monetary policy is coming, and coming faster than previously assumed. But despite the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasingly brisk growth rate, the ECB is still deeply concerned about inflation and the stubbornly low pace of wage rises. So for all the hawkish nods and winks in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minutes, the QE money presses are still expected to keep turning until September. The euro has strengthened as markets adjust to this change of tone, and the stakes for Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next press conference have notched up as markets dare to hope that the ECB is finally ready to wean the Eurozone economy off monetary stimulus. Economist Carsten Brzeski at ING believes there will be no abrupt end to QE: It is unsurprising that the ECB is not ignoring further steps in its tapering (or recalibration) process. Phrases [in the minutes] indicate a further adjustment but in our view no abrupt end. We stick to our previous view that the ECB will not stop QE in September but will rather decide on another \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lower for longer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd beyond September, probably until the end of the year. Interestingly, the ECB is more and more focusing on growth and seems to regard inflation only as a derivative of growth developments. Judging from previous experiences, to get an inflation rate sustainably at around 2%, the Eurozone economy needs to have a positive output gap. This could, but does not necessarily have to, happen in the course of 2018. It is also obvious that the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balancing act between uniting the Governing Council and not distorting markets on the rest of the way towards the exit is a difficult one. While the ECB had actually tried to hush speculation with the October decision for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lower for longer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, some ECB officials\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 talks are clearly undermining this intention. In this regards, next week should be interesting when both Jens \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the hawk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Weidmann and Benoit \u00e2\u20ac\u0153first proponent now advocate for a September end\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Coeure will have public appearances. US stock markets have opened in positive territory, as concerns about the bond market eased (pace Bill Gross). Investors were put on edge on Wednesday after reports that China was planning to cut its buying of US Treasuries. A denial however seems to have calmed the nerves a little, for the moment at least. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: US stocks, Treasuries and the dollar all sold off [on Wednesday] on reports that China is considering cutting purchases of Treasuries. China is a huge buyer of US debt and so, should the reports turn out to be correct, one would expect yields on US debt to rise, which is why we saw such a knee jerk reaction. The report was later denied and even labelled fake news by China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FX regulator, which prompted an unwinding of the earlier moves, although investors appear to have remained on edge. Yields had already been rising in the 24 hours preceding the report after the Bank of Japan bought fewer 10-25 year and 25-40 year JGBs than it had been previously, prompting speculation that monetary stimulus is being withdrawn, despite the central bank having claimed only last month that tightening is not imminent. Despite any remaining jitters, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has recovered 55 points or 0.23% ahead of a host of forthcoming trading updates. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.23% higher while the Nasdaq 100 is up 0.21%. Time for a quick recap, before Wall Street opens. Marks &amp; Spencer has been crowned as a Christmas loser, after reporting underwhelming sales figures. The high street chain suffered a 2.8% decline in clothing sales, while food - often a solid performer - shrank by 0.4%. Shares in M&amp;S have slumped to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, down 6.5% right now, taking the Footsie away from a record high. Analysts say the figures show that M&amp;S is suffering from weak consumer confidence, and the growth of e-commerce. Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have also been pummelled today, down 4%, even though it recorded a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrecord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Christmas. Tesco grew sales by 1.9% over Christmas, which wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to meet City forecasts. But analysts are hopeful the CEO Dave Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turnaround plan is working. Another street name, John Lewis, warned that its profits have been hit by inflation - even though sales were up year-on-year. Black Friday was a record, but that could actually have eroded John Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profitability, thanks to its promise to never be knowingly undersold.... In other news.... Germany has posted its strongest annual growth in six years. Eurozone industrial production has surged, as Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery picks up Influential investor Bill Gross has warned that bonds, and men, are in a bear market It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s getting harder to obtain credit in the UK, according to the Bank of England Newsflash: More Americans became unemployed last week than expected. The number of US citizens filing new claims for jobless benefit jumped by 11,000, to 261,000 - which is 10,000 more than expected. That suggests that US companies cut staff at the turn of the year, and might be a sign that the labor market is weakening. Or it could just be down to seasonal factors. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The trend of rising US jobless claims looks to be gathering momentum into the early parts of 2018, with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading confirming a fourth rise in as many weeks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the White House will need to address why such a traditionally robust labour market has begun to dwindle in recent months, there will be no reaching for the panic button just yet as labour market data during year-end holidays tends to be a little unpredictable. The severe cold snap can also be blamed for keeping people out of work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any figures that remain under the 300,000 barrier will be viewed as positive, and President Trump can be comfortable for now knowing that the jobs market will likely remain tight for the foreseeable future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Spotted: The best reaction to Bill Gross\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments: An influential billionaire investor has warned that US government debt has entered a bear market -- just like your average man. In remarks that might cause a stir, Bill Gross of Janus has compared the US Treasury market to the recent torrent of revelations about unacceptable conduct by wealthy and powerful men. Bonds, like men, are falling in value and will continue to depreciate, Gross says in a new letter to his clients. He writes: Bonds, like men, are in a bear market. For both, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to say when it all began. There was no Helen Reddy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I Am Woman\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd moment back in June 2012, and then again in July 2016 when the 10 year Treasury double-bottomed at 1.45%, but then in retrospect it should have been obvious that for bonds, like men \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153their time was up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Eighteen months ago, it was obvious to most observers that the economy, measured by nominal GDP, was not going to go much lower than 3% and that the Fed was having second thoughts about quantitative easing. Gross does \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconcede\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that men have some positive qualities - not losing the remote control (!) and starting wars (good for economic progress, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122tcha know). But his serious point is that US bond prices rose much too high after the financial crisis, sending the yield (rate of return) to historically ultra-low levels. That process has started to reverse recently -- the US 10-year Treasury bond now yields 2.55% today, up from that 1.45% 18 months ago. Gross argues that the bear market will drive prices down, and yields up, during 2018. As he puts it: Oprah shouted, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Their time has come\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The bear bond market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time has come as well. Many would say, including yours truly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the first to predict this. US bond yields have been creeping higher for months, as the US Federal Reserve continued to unwind its stimulus programme. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts are another factor - they could push inflation higher, which is usually bad for bond prices. Gross has a reputation for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccolourful\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 commentary, and some observers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too impressed by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effort: But.... Gross isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually criticising the #MeToo campaign, and he backs the idea of Oprah Winfrey could run for president. Indeed, he argues: Actually most of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems would go away if men just stayed home, watched football and learned to talk to their partners during commercial breaks. There are certainly enough of them. Jewellery maker Pandora has added to the anxiety in the retail sector today by missing its sales targets for the last year. The news sent its shares spiralling down by over 10%, on track for their worst day in six years. Reuters has the details: Pandora missed its own 2017 sales forecasts on Thursday and warned of thinner margins ahead, putting shares in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest jewellery maker on course for their worst day in more than six years. In a trading update, Pandora said it aims to generate around half of its revenue from rings, earrings and necklaces by 2022 and would increase its annual collections to 10 per year from seven. The Danish firm also aims to increase the share of its owned stores in a bid to gain larger share of revenue and better be able to control its brand. Boom! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has just hit a new all-time intraday high. The blue-chip index has risen to 7,764 points for the first time ever, up 15 points this morning, extending its recent rally. Online takeaway ordering app Just Eat is the top riser, up over 5% at 809p. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because Barclays has just hiked its target for its shares to \u00c2\u00a310, from 700p, in recognition of its blistering sales growth. But traditional retailers are having a tougher time. Marks &amp; Spencer is down almost 6%, while Tesco has lost 4.3% today. By my reckoning, that takes Marks &amp; Spencer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value down to around \u00c2\u00a35bn, while Just Eat is now worth nearly \u00c2\u00a35.5bn. Quite remarkable. A business without any stores, that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually produce the food its customers eat, can be worth more than a company with over 900 UK stores and 30 million-plus customers. Hugh Fletcher, Global Head of Consultancy and Innovation at ecommerce consultancy Salmon, says \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcforward-looking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 UK retailers who embraced technology are now reaping the rewards. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Christmas sales figures from retailers this week paints a varied picture of their success, with mixed sales performance across the industry. The retailers who have spent time investing and learning about omni-channel strategies are those that are starting to pull away from the less digitally literate ones, with the likes of Boohoo and Ted Baker revealing strong online sales for the Christmas period, with the latter reporting a huge 35% rise in online sales. The hard work of years of investment and organisational change is now visible, and with these stats there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no hiding for the digital laggards. Earlier this week Marks &amp; Spencer announced a major shake-up of its IT system; a sign that its previous technology efforts weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really paying off. Over in Greece the statistics service has announced a further drop in unemployment - by far the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest social ill. Helena Smith reports from Athens. From a record high of of almost 28% in September 2013, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate dropped to 20.7% in October with Elstat, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics agency, putting the number of registered unemployed at 990.288 people. At the height of Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 debt crisis five years ago more than 1.3 million Greeks were recorded as being out of work resulting in a massive exodus of well-trained professionals to wealthier European countries. But Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s youth continue to pay a high price with the jobless rate among those under the age of 25 hovering at 40.8% - down from 44.4% a year ago. Greece has by far the highest unemployment rate in the euro zone - along with a debt pile that stands at around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac320bn, also the highest in the EU. If budget projections are correct unemployment could fall to 18.4% this year, in a country whose economic output has dropped by around 26% since 2008. Take note, consumers and retailers. Lenders are making it harder to get credit. The Bank of England has just reported that the availability of unsecured credit to households decreased in the last three months of 2017 - the fourth quarterly decline in a row. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because lenders took a tougher line when assessing applications, and are likely to keep tightening in 2018. The BoE says: Lenders expected a significant decrease in Q1 [January-March 2018]. Credit scoring criteria for granting total unsecured loan applications tightened again in Q4, and lenders expected them to tighten significantly further in Q1. The latest eurozone factory figures are out, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sparklingly good. Eurozone industrial production jumped by 1% during November, and was 3.2% higher than a year earlier. October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate was also revised up, from 0.2% to 0.4%, further suggesting that manufacturers ended 2017 on a high. Most of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major retailers have now reported financial results for the festive period. Tesco look like one of the winners (despite missing City forecasts), while M&amp;S are firmly in the losers camp after its clothing and food sales fell. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re keeping tabs on the sector here: Getting back to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retailers, Martin Lane of money.co.uk says Tesco fought a good fight over Christmas, while M&amp;S struggled: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tesco is still facing fierce competition from the likes of Aldi and Lidl, but these results show they are still holding their ground. They can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to rest on their laurels though. With both Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Morrisons beating their Christmas trading forecasts, the supermarket giant needs to keep prices competitive despite inflation to keep customers loyal and coming back for more. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These positive results come in stark contrast to Marks and Spencer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s who are suffering. Their signature luxury products are being undercut by bargain supermarkets at a fraction of the price. Shoppers expect quality and convenience for less than ever before, and M&amp;S simply aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offering that at the moment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Breaking away from UK retailers, we have some strong economic data from Germany. The German economy expanded by 2.2% in 2017, the fastest rate since 2011. Once you adjust for working day changes, GDP actually rose by 2.5%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a stronger performance than many experts were predicting last year, when political risks threatened the German economy. Carsten Brzeski of ING says: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP data mark the end of a remarkable year for the German economy. A year ago, consensus forecasts for German growth were around 1.5% for 2017. Now, GDP growth is likely to come in at around 2.5%. How could the German (and the Eurozone) economy surprise so positively? A year ago, the German recovery already looked rather stretched. Sentiment indicators stagnated, with Brexit, the upcoming Dutch and French elections political risks had increased, and the new US administration had added possible trade wars into the growth equation of every forecaster. One year later the lesson is clear: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it was not politics, but economics, stupid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Following a real Trump-spirit, the strong labour market, low interest rates and low inflation pushed the domestic economy into a sixth gear. Also, instead of suffering from protectionism or a Trump trade war, exports surged to new record highs and the long awaited investment pick-up finally kicked in. The result: the strongest annual growth performance since 2011. Yikes! Shares in Marks &amp; Spencer are now down 5% as the selloff gathers pace. Chief executive Steve Rowe has told journalists that Britain is suffering a spending squeeze. This means the UK consumer is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quite fragile, quite volatile\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Rowe adds (rather like M&amp;S\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price this morning...) Richard Lim, chief executive at Retail Economics, says Marks &amp; Spencer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial results for the last three months paint a worrying picture: M&amp;S continues to struggle with the sheer pace of structural change reshaping the industry. The business model has come under increasing strain as the unforgiving shift towards online and the experience economy collide with inflexible leases, high rents and excess properties.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed either: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThis is a disappointing set of figures for M&amp;S, particularly in its food and online businesses. Sales in clothing and home actually fell by the biggest margin, but in a market which is shrinking, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more a reflection of wider economic trends. In recent years the food business has been the bright light of the M&amp;S empire, but its glow has definitely dimmed of late. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably a result of consumers tightening their belts when it comes to grocery shopping, and the strong performance of supermarket premium ranges suggests when customers are splashing out, they are increasingly doing it at Sainsbury, Tesco and Morrison rather than at M&amp;S. Online sales growth at M&amp;S also looks pretty feeble when compared to the wider market. Steve Rowe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of pushing digital sales at M&amp;S to one third of the total looks like a steep climb from here, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be hoping a new deal to outsource 250 IT jobs to the Indian conglomerate Tata is part of the solution. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still early days in the M&amp;S turnaround plan, however the risk is by the time M&amp;S gets up to speed, the rest of the pack might have disappeared out of sight.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Connor Campbell of SpreadEx is also concerned by the drop in food sales: While M&amp;S avoided a Debenhams-esque disaster, it was a long way from Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprisingly strong Xmas numbers. The perpetually unfashionable clothing and home business was, as ever, the headline casualty, posting a 2.8% plunge in like-for-like sales across the 13 weeks to the end of December \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hardly a surprise given the division\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head, Jo Jenkins, shockingly jumped ship in October. But, but, but, the clothing department is always a bit rubbish; how about the food business, ostensibly the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shining star which, on paper, should have received a Christmas boost? Well once again the division under-performed expectations, suffering a 0.4% decline in comparable sales at the same time as its major supermarket rivals all saw some level of growth. Marks &amp; Spencer just can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shake its image as a sector dinosaur, with these results nipping a nascent rise in the bud as it fell 2.5% after the bell. Bryan Roberts, global insight director at tcc global, says Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turnaround plan is on course. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite many predictions that Tesco had \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Christmas, with that accolade instead being shared by Morrisons and the Co-op, the market leader nonetheless enjoyed a very creditable festive period. We were impressed by Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seasonal ranging and merchandising across both food and general merchandise, backed up by solid availability and ongoing improvements in customer service and shopper experience. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While a lot of attention in 2018 will be focused on the integration of Booker, we feel confident that the core supermarkets are in largely good shape.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Retail analyst Steve Dresser agrees: Neil Wilson of ETX Capital points out that Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food sales did well: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lots to be positive about for Tesco as the Dave Lewis turnaround continues to yield results. Q3 was strong with like-for-like sales +2.3%, with a particularly good performance in Fresh Food, which grew by 3.7% in the UK. Stronger grocery and fresh food sales offset a less impressive performance in general merchandise and slower tobacco sales following the Palmer &amp; Harvey failure. But Naeem Aslam of Think Markets cautions that several rival supermarkets did better: Looking at competitors such as Sainsbury and Morrison, both have beaten their forecast for Christmas trading. This doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put Tesco in a strong position at all. The retailer which dominates the British High Street needs to make sure that it keeps its tools sharp to fight inflationary pressure by keeping the prices low. There is no doubt that Tesco has turned the corner and avoided a Debenhams style disaster but it needs to make sure that it stays on track to deliver on its medium-term ambition. This is mainly because the competition is fierce in this space and discounters such as Lidl and Aldi have performed extremely well. Lidl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christmas sales increased by 16% and Aldi saw 15%. Amid the torrent of company news, small UK retailer Card Factory has slipped out a profits warning. It blames \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continue pressure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on its profit margins, plus \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wage inflation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the inflationary pressure from the weak pound. Shares are down 21% in early trading! Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Zoe Wood on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales figures: Tesco and John Lewis have emerged as winners from a tough Christmas trading period as Marks &amp; Spencer reported a downbeat set of figures with a slump in sales of both food and clothing. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest supermarket chain reported like-for-like sales growth of 1.9% for its UK stores, a performance it said was thanks to the strength of its food business which saw underlying growth of 3.4%. At M&amp;S, the chief executive, Steve Rowe, admitted there had been a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mixed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd performance. Its like-for-like clothing and homewares sales fell 2.8% while, despite inflation of about 3.7%, sales in its food halls were down 0.4%.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s her full story: DING DING! The London stock market is open...and retail shares are falling. Marks &amp; Spencer are down 2.4% in early trading, as traders react to its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmixed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Christmas trading figures. Tesco are being thumped too, down 3.6% despite posting a rise in sales over the festive period. That confirms that the City had hoped for stronger figures from Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest supermarket. Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christmas trading figures were dented by the demise of wholesaler Palmer &amp; Harvey. Palmer &amp; Harvey, which supplied around 90,000 UK shops, collapsed in December with the loss of thousands of jobs. This left the supermarket giant struggling to get enough tobacco products on the shelves, and apparently knocked 0.5% off like-for-like sales growth [partly explaining why it missed City forecasts]. Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO Dave Lewis says: Incorporating Palmer &amp; Harvey volumes and complexity during this peak period was challenging, resulting in lost tobacco sales across December and putting further strain into our distribution network, particularly post-Christmas. Whilst I am pleased to say these challenges have now been resolved, they took the shine off an otherwise outstanding performance for the period as a whole. Although Tesco is reporting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153record\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Christmas, its shares may actually drop when the stock market opens. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the City had expected an ever bigger jump in sales. Some analysts had expected growth of 2.4% or more, not the 1.9% which Tesco actually reported this morning. Elsewhere, online electrical goods vendor AO World has posted an 11% jump in revenues for the last three months of 2017. But the company also warns that the UK economic outlook remains uncertain. Online fashion retailer Boohoo.com had a good Christmas The company, which recently acquired PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal, doubled its revenues in the last four months of 2017, in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in highly successful trading period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Mahmud Kamani and Carol Kane, joint CEOs, say: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are delighted to report another set of strong financial and operational results, with record sales in the four months to December across all our brands. The Black Friday period was our most successful ever and we traded well throughout the period under review. Ouch! House of Fraser has just reported some rather unimpressive figures - which won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t calm fears over its future. Sales at House of Fraser sales shrank by 2.9% over the six-week Christmas period, a poor performance. It also says that the first week of the post-Christmas sales was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disappointing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, although things have picked up since. Last week we learned that House of Fraser is pushing its landlords for a rent cut, and planning to downsize some of its stores. Onto John Lewis! They have just reported a 2.5% increase in gross sales over the Christmas period, with takings up at its department stores and Waitrose supermarkets. Black Friday was a particular highlight - boosting weekly sales by 7.2%. Sir Charlie Mayfield, Chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe traded well during the Christmas period, with gross sales in the six weeks to 30 December \u00c2\u00a31,962m, up 2.5% on last year, with 1.4% sales growth in Waitrose and 3.6% in John Lewis. This was due to the exceptional hard work and commitment of our Partners. We focused on our differentiated product offering, attention to service and strong value proposition, underpinned by our Never Knowingly Undersold promise. But Mayfield also warns that profits have been hit by rising inflation: The pressure on margin seen in the first half of the year has intensified because of our choice to maintain competitive prices, despite higher costs mainly due to the weaker exchange rate. This will negatively affect full-year financial results as indicated previously. Marks &amp; Spencer has less to celebrate this Christmas. Like-for-like sales in the UK fell by 1.4% in the last 13 weeks of 2017. Food sales dipped by 0.4% while clothing sales declined by 2.8%. Steve Rowe, Chief Executive says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153M&amp;S had a mixed quarter with better Christmas trading in both businesses going some way to offset a weak clothing market in October and ongoing underperformance in our Food like-for-like sales. As a result, full year guidance remains unchanged.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales figures in detail.... Boom! Supermarket giant Tesco says it has racked up its best ever Christmas. UK like-for-like sales over the festive period rose by 1.9%, including a 3.4% rise in food sales over the Christmas period. Tesco says it posted its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153biggest ever sales week in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, thanks to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fresh food market outperformance of nearly 4%\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dave Lewis, Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, is upbeat, saying Tesco is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153firmly on track to deliver our medium-term ambitions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have continued to outperform the market throughout this period, particularly in fresh food, thanks to our most competitive offer for many years. Our trading momentum accelerated across the third quarter and into December, with the four weeks leading up to Christmas Day delivering record sales and volumes in the UK. Retail analysts are impressed: Financial results are flashing across trading screens in the City.... Good morning. Today, a blizzard of Christmas trading updates will show how some of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest retailers fared over the festive period. Marks &amp; Spencer, Tesco, House of Fraser and John Lewis all report results today. Online retailers AO World and Boohoo.com will all jostle for attention, as we try to separate the Christmas crackers from the turkeys. City analysts are expecting Tesco to do well, while Marks &amp; Spencer may have struggled (if only Meghan Markle had worn that \u00c2\u00a345 M&amp;S jumper a little sooner...) In recent days we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen profit warnings from Debenhams, Mothercare and Moss Bros, but decent performances from Next and Sainsburys. It appears that companies selling food have performed better than non-food outlets, partly because food price inflation has pushed up turnover. Retailers who resisted slapping \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsale\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stickers all over their stores have also been rewarded, as colleague Sarah Butler reported earlier this week: Kate Calvert, a retail analyst at Investec, said the different experiences of Debenhams and Next indicated that clothing chains which held back from early discounting may have fared better. That may potentially be good news for M&amp;S, which had fewer promotional days in 2017 than the year before, according to Calvert. But she still expects a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mediocre\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd performance from M&amp;S with clothing sales at established stores down by 3%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It will be more like Next than Debenhams,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. While retail specialists plough through these results, economists will be examining new UK credit stats, a healthcheck on Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, and the latest eurozone factory output data. European markets are expected to open a little higher. Last night, Wall Street fell after reports that Donald Trump will soon pull America out of the Nafta trade pact. Traders will also be watching the US bond market closely, after Treasuries suffered a sharp selloff yesterday. As the Financial Times explains: Is the three-decade bond bull market coming to a close? A fierce sell-off in the US bond market abated late on Wednesday but left yields on benchmark government debt at their highest level in nine months. There were signs of this last year but here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the sell-off could be very different this time. The yield of 10-year Treasuries approached levels not seen since the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trumpflation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd retreat nearly a year ago, hitting a nine-month high of nearly 2.6 per cent on expectations that cash freed up by the recent US tax cut will finally help spark higher inflation driven by stronger economic growth. So, a busy day ahead....

                "bodyText":"GKN, the FTSE 100 aerospace and automotive company which issued a shock profit warning in November, has rejected an unsolicited \u00c2\u00a37bn approach from rival Melrose and announced plans to split in two. A bid battle is now likely as Melrose, which specialises in buying struggling businesses, turning them round and selling them at a profit with the proceeds given back to shareholders, will pursue its interest despite GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opposition. GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares jumped by more than a quarter to an all-time closing high of 420p on the news, above the initial 405p cash and share offer on the table from Melrose. But Melrose shares subsequently climbed 6%, lifting the value of its offer to 419p a share. Analyst Sandy Morris at Jefferies said the Melrose move could draw out rival bidders, such as US group Spirit AeroSystems or Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tyre and automotive group Continental. Private equity companies could also be interested. GKN said the Melrose approach was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153entirely opportunistic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and undervalued the company. But Melrose responded, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[We believe] that there would be significant operational and commercial benefits arising from Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ownership of GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s businesses, reversing a history of existing GKN management not delivering on margin targets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Melrose chief executive Simon Peckham added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think it has a good business which is underperforming. The fight is about who is best placed to manage the business properly. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really down to the shareholders now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The proposed takeover was immediately criticised by Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable, who said it was a serious threat to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial strategy and accused Melrose of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153asset stripping\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But Peckham dismissed the charge. In a reference to GKN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to split in two, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The only bit of financial engineering being announced is by the board of GKN, not us. We have a great record of investing in businesses.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd GKN, which used to be known as Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds and traces its history back to 1759, has struggled in recent years and its profit warning came after a downturn in its US aerospace business. It expects to write down between \u00c2\u00a380m and \u00c2\u00a3130m as the value of stocks at the division had been overestimated. The biggest factory, in St Louis in Missouri, makes air frames for F-15 and F/A-18 fighter jets. Following the warning, its proposed chief executive Kevin Cummings was ousted from the business even before he took up the post and was replaced by non-executive director Anne Stevens on a temporary basis. Now Stevens, a former senior executive at Ford, has been handed the job permanently. GKN said Stevens had conducted a review which would lead to the company splitting its aerospace division \u00e2\u20ac\u201c formed by the purchase of a stake in Westland helicopters in 1988 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from its automotive business. It said both businesses would benefit from being separate companies with distinct investment profiles and capital allocation policies. But Melrose maintained it would be better to improve the performances of both divisions before any split. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The separation of the automotive and aerospace units has been on the cards for years, with little obvious crossover between the two businesses. Historically, the pension deficit has held the group together, but with the sprawling footprint likely to have contributed to recent profit warnings, the reasons for divorce now seem to outweigh the costs of splitting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The money to be made from a split is likely to have been what drew turnaround specialist Melrose to the table in the first place \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the challenge for newly confirmed chief executive Anne Stevens is to deliver a better result for shareholders than the 405p she turned down today.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd GKN said current trading was in line with expectations, with 2017 profits expected to be slightly ahead of the 2016 figure of \u00c2\u00a3678m before the US write-off. Melrose said it had approached GKN a week ago and given the company a deadline of Friday to respond, but instead GKN went public about the proposed deal. Melrose now has until 9 February either to make a firm bid or walk away. The three men who built Melrose into a \u00c2\u00a34.4bn business The key directors behind Melrose have a track record of buying up underperforming companies, turning them round and selling them on at a profit. Christopher Miller was a protege of Lord Hanson, the 1980s wheeler dealer who built up a corporate empire with a number of aggressive takeovers. After leaving Hanson, Miller bought into small shoe retailer Wassall, alongside David Roper, an accountant who had previously been at Warburg merchant bank and whom he worked with in Switzerland before his Hanson days. Along with Peckham, a solicitor, they turned Wassall from a company worth just \u00c2\u00a31.9m into a wide-ranging engineering business, thanks to a series of ever larger takeovers. Roper was given the nickname \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Grinder\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, supposedly for his detailed financial analysis of companies targeted for takeover. Eventually Wassall was itself sold to US buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for \u00c2\u00a3672m in 2000. After spending a couple of years doing little but improving their golf handicaps, according to Roper, he and Miller teamed up with Peckham again to set up Melrose. They put in \u00c2\u00a33m of their own money and floated the company on Aim in 2003 with a market capitalisation of \u00c2\u00a310m. Once more they used the company to mount a series of acquisitions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c diecast specialist Dynacast, engineering groups McKechnie, metering business Elster among them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c before disposing of them and returning the proceeds to shareholders. Melrose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current businesses are ventilation equipment manufacturer Nortek and generating equipment group Brush. Miller, Roper and Peckham, along with Melrose finance director Geoff Martin, hit the headlines last year when it emerged that they would share a bonus pot of \u00c2\u00a3160m, one of the biggest corporate paydays in the City. Setting out their philosphy, Roper once said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We find fundamentally good businesses which are badly managed but need a change of culture.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A takeover of GKN would be their biggest deal yet, and their biggest challenge.

Here is their note:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>MITIE 5% probability-weighted revenue upside.</strong> In our view, MITIE has the widest array of opportunities as it offers similar services to Carillion and has a considerably lower market share in public sector than private. Facilities management contracts at Heathrow Airport (where MITIE has provided services since 2010), Centrica (MITIE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new CEO is ex-Centrica), Mapeley HMRC, Nationwide and Prisons FM all offer upside. Although balance sheet uncertainty and the FCA investigation into the timing of the September profit warning under previous management could count against it, the recent \u00c2\u00a3525m Home Office immigration detainees escort contract suggests otherwise.</p> <p> <strong>Serco 3% probability-weighted revenue upside, but 7-8% EPS impact due to current low margins.</strong> In December 2017, Serco signed a Business Purchase Agreement to acquire a portfolio of selected UK health facilities management contracts from Carillion for \u00c2\u00a347.7m. Carillion is now in breach of the BPA so Serco could walk away, renegotiate, or deal directly with the individual special purpose vehicle operating contract holders. In our view, management remains committed to completing the transaction, may accelerate transition from the original schedule, and seek dialogue with Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remaining healthcare contracts (up to \u00c2\u00a360m additional revenue). Elsewhere, Prisons FM, Hestia and Allenby/Connaught may also offer upside.</p> <p><strong>Babcock 2% probability-weighted revenue upside.</strong> In our view, Babcock could generate additional revenue from two areas: 1) Almost ten years ago, Network Rail transferred business to Babcock after the demise of Jarvis and \u00c2\u00a330-40m of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s track renewal and electrification business could follow a similar path; 2) The Next Generation Estate Contracts as Babcock previously operated two regions and has a long-standing, deep and supportive relationship with the MoD. Although it will wish to be a supportive partner to the MoD, these contracts were loss-making and require viable economic terms.</p> <p><strong>Sodexo 1% probability-weighted revenue upside.</strong> In our view, Sodexo also has a wide array of opportunities including facilities management contracts at Mapeley HMRC, Nationwide, Prisons FM, Hestia, Northwood Joint Permanent HQ, and Allenby Connaught PFI. However, the probability-weighted impact on group organic revenue growth would be a mere 1%.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a5f8afee4b092da99aa753c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-17T17:51:03.866Z\">5.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There are several companies which could replace Carillion on public contracts, says Fitch Ratings, but any additional costs will depend on the individual project. The ratings agency - which did not rate Carillion and says the engineering and construction sector is generally sub-investment grade - said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The implications of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse for the UK PFI/PPP sector will vary between projects. There are several companies that could replace Carillion on individual projects, but replacement costs on construction projects will depend on how advanced construction is, and on how much money, if any, is owed to sub-contractors.</p> <p>Similarly, the availability of suitably qualified replacement operators and the project\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to absorb the potential for increased costs and delays if the operator is replaced, is an important consideration in our project ratings analysis. Fitch does not rate any PFI/PPP project that has Carillion as a contractor or service provider. The fact that the company has gone into liquidation suggests there is no value in some of its existing contracts and that they were under-priced. This implies that replacement costs will have to compensate the new contractor/operator for that under-pricing.</p> <p>Carillion had a number of joint ventures with other established construction companies which should be well-placed to understand replacement risk.

Economist James Knightley at ING gives the background:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Canadian economy is strong and inflation pressures are rising, hence why the BoC hiked. But fears over the future of NAFTA are causing concern. This is key for the future path for interest rates</p> <p>Following a raft of strong activity data and a pick-up in inflation the Bank of Canada raised the target for its overnight rate to 1.25%. This was broadly the view amongst economists and in financial markets, which had swung behind the idea of a rate rise following two consecutive bumper Canadian jobs reports and stronger inflation readings.</p> <p>This was reflected in the accompanying statement, which stated that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153labour market slack is being absorbed more quickly than anticipated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It also highlighted strong data, inflation being close to target and the belief that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economy is operating roughly at capacity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as reasons to raise interest rates.</p> <p>They are expecting to see a slowdown in 2018, but have had to acknowledge that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153growth is expected to remain above potential through the first quarter of 2018\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>Nonetheless, there are clearly risks, most notably the potential for Donald Trump to pull the plug on NAFTA. US-Canadian trade flows total an amount equivalent to 32% of Canadian GDP so disruption would be very bad news. Uncertainty on this issue is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clouding the economic outlook\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd according to the statement, which is likely to weigh on business investment and trade in their view.</p> <p>Consequently, the BoC still see the need for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some continued monetary policy accommodation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and warn that the Governing Council will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remain cautious in considering future policy adjustments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Despite this the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic outlook is expected to warrant higher interest rates over time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>We certainly agree and see further upside to Canadian growth given the improving global backdrop and rising commodity demand. We are also encouraged by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent comments, hinting at a growing willingness to work with Mexico and Canada on a NAFTA compromise. As such we are predicting a two more 25bp hikes in the second half of 2018. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a5f6976e4b0fe5e06bfbbaa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-17T15:22:18.481Z\">3.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is the Press Association story on the Carillion directors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bonuses:</p> <blockquote> <p>Bonus payments to directors and former executives at collapsed construction giant Carillion have been stopped.</p> <p>The move came amid political anger about bumper payments to executives who had been in charge as the firm headed for the rocks.

Until then, although clearly across the detail of her brief, she struck the wrong tone in at least two places. Refusing to engage with Corbyn second question just because it did not conclude with a question mark sounded petty, and her repeated insistence that the government was just a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153customer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of Carillion, while technically correct, made her sound rather feeble.</p> <p>She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just a customer - she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the prime minister, armed with the full power and authority of the UK state. May came to office promising a crackdown on excessive corporate and a bolder and more imaginative PM would have use the Carillion catastrophe to reboot this whole agenda. Surprisingly, May did not even try to do this, and her response to Corbyn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s question about what the Carillion directors are receiving sounded correct but uninspiring. That paved the way for Corbyn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s powerful final question/soundbite, a tirade against the whole private sector contracting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153racquet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It was his best moment. May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final answer was her most effective too.</p> <p>Her argument about Corbyn and McDonnell being fundamentally anti-business is persuasive enough to have some traction, but attacking New Labour for putting these contracts out to tender in the first place was probably a mistake. If anyone is going to get credit of opposing New Labour neoliberalism on an issue like this, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not going to be May, but Corbyn.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jan/17/juncker-urges-uk-to-stay-in-eu-and-says-hed-be-happy-to-have-it-back-if-it-goes-politics-live\">Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs -  Politics live</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a5f3f43e4b003d428b09e83\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-17T12:27:44.934Z\">12.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">May: Some private sector Carillion workers will keep being paid</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Still at PMQs, Jeremy Corbyn asks Theresa May about the future of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army of staff, and its top brass.</strong></p> <p><em>Q: Can she guarantee that no more money is handed to the chief executive and directors of Carillion, at a time when 8,000 workers on its private sector contracts face not being paid?</em></p> <p>The prime minister replies that some of those Carillion staff, who work on private sector contracts, will keep being paid.</p> <p>That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because companies have been hammering out agreements with the Official Receiver since it took control.</p> <p>May says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are a number of facility management contractors who have come to an agreement with the Official Receiver which means their workers will continue to be paid.</p> <p>The official receiver is doing their job and working with these companies.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the bonuses, May says that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfast-track\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 investigation launched by the Receiver will investigate whether there was any misconduct by Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top executive.</p> <p>She also denies that it was the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job to ensure that Carillion was properly managed -- it was a customer, not the manager.

                "bodyText":"Another day of developments following Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock collapse on Monday. Good news for many of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employees. The Insolvency Service said that 90% of the companies who employed Carillion have decided that they want those services to continue, and pledged to keep paying for them. An estimated 8,500 people of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK workforce were employed on private sector work and faced the risk of being laid off, since the government is not guaranteeing to pay their wages. But almost 10% of those companies have not joined the agreement, making it an uncertain time for staff on those contracts. Meanwhile bonuses and severance payments to former Carillion executives have been stopped, as of the date of the liquidation. And there was good news for small firms hit by Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse. Banks have agreed emergency measures to help them keep trading and do not face a cash crunch if they are owed money by Carillion which they are unlikely to get. Unsurprisingly, Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn clashed over Carillion at prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s question time. Meanwhile shares in outsourcer Interserve fell sharply after a report the Cabinet Office was keeping a close eye on the company. But they recovered after the Cabinet Office said it did not believe any of its suppliers were in a similar position to Carillion. The company also maintained its financial position was improving. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Speaking of companies picking up Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contracts, analysts at Jefferies have been taking a look at the possible candidates. Here is their note: MITIE 5% probability-weighted revenue upside. In our view, MITIE has the widest array of opportunities as it offers similar services to Carillion and has a considerably lower market share in public sector than private. Facilities management contracts at Heathrow Airport (where MITIE has provided services since 2010), Centrica (MITIE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new CEO is ex-Centrica), Mapeley HMRC, Nationwide and Prisons FM all offer upside. Although balance sheet uncertainty and the FCA investigation into the timing of the September profit warning under previous management could count against it, the recent \u00c2\u00a3525m Home Office immigration detainees escort contract suggests otherwise. Serco 3% probability-weighted revenue upside, but 7-8% EPS impact due to current low margins. In December 2017, Serco signed a Business Purchase Agreement to acquire a portfolio of selected UK health facilities management contracts from Carillion for \u00c2\u00a347.7m. Carillion is now in breach of the BPA so Serco could walk away, renegotiate, or deal directly with the individual special purpose vehicle operating contract holders. In our view, management remains committed to completing the transaction, may accelerate transition from the original schedule, and seek dialogue with Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remaining healthcare contracts (up to \u00c2\u00a360m additional revenue). Elsewhere, Prisons FM, Hestia and Allenby/Connaught may also offer upside. Babcock 2% probability-weighted revenue upside. In our view, Babcock could generate additional revenue from two areas: 1) Almost ten years ago, Network Rail transferred business to Babcock after the demise of Jarvis and \u00c2\u00a330-40m of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s track renewal and electrification business could follow a similar path; 2) The Next Generation Estate Contracts as Babcock previously operated two regions and has a long-standing, deep and supportive relationship with the MoD. Although it will wish to be a supportive partner to the MoD, these contracts were loss-making and require viable economic terms. Sodexo 1% probability-weighted revenue upside. In our view, Sodexo also has a wide array of opportunities including facilities management contracts at Mapeley HMRC, Nationwide, Prisons FM, Hestia, Northwood Joint Permanent HQ, and Allenby Connaught PFI. However, the probability-weighted impact on group organic revenue growth would be a mere 1%. There are several companies which could replace Carillion on public contracts, says Fitch Ratings, but any additional costs will depend on the individual project. The ratings agency - which did not rate Carillion and says the engineering and construction sector is generally sub-investment grade - said: The implications of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse for the UK PFI/PPP sector will vary between projects. There are several companies that could replace Carillion on individual projects, but replacement costs on construction projects will depend on how advanced construction is, and on how much money, if any, is owed to sub-contractors. Similarly, the availability of suitably qualified replacement operators and the project\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to absorb the potential for increased costs and delays if the operator is replaced, is an important consideration in our project ratings analysis. Fitch does not rate any PFI/PPP project that has Carillion as a contractor or service provider. The fact that the company has gone into liquidation suggests there is no value in some of its existing contracts and that they were under-priced. This implies that replacement costs will have to compensate the new contractor/operator for that under-pricing. Carillion had a number of joint ventures with other established construction companies which should be well-placed to understand replacement risk. If Fitch considers the availability of substitute operators unlikely, given the specialised nature, size, or location of a project, our rating may be capped at that of the operator. Education select committee chairman Robert Halfon wants to know what impact Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse will have on schools and the 1,400 apprenticeships run by the company. He has written to education secretary Damian Hinds, saying: Given the scale and nature of the services provided by Carillion to almost 900 schools and colleges, it is essential that the impacts of the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse are understood and steps taken to ensure the continuity of services such as school catering and facilities management across the country. First he loses his bonus and now he loses another job. Former Carillion chief executive Richard Howson has just resigned as a non-executive director at oilfield services company John Wood Group. The government has welcomed the emergency support that banks will provide to help smallercompanies affected by Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liquidation. Away from Carillion and over to Canada, where the central bank has raised interest rates from 1% to 1.25%. Economist James Knightley at ING gives the background: The Canadian economy is strong and inflation pressures are rising, hence why the BoC hiked. But fears over the future of NAFTA are causing concern. This is key for the future path for interest rates Following a raft of strong activity data and a pick-up in inflation the Bank of Canada raised the target for its overnight rate to 1.25%. This was broadly the view amongst economists and in financial markets, which had swung behind the idea of a rate rise following two consecutive bumper Canadian jobs reports and stronger inflation readings. This was reflected in the accompanying statement, which stated that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153labour market slack is being absorbed more quickly than anticipated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It also highlighted strong data, inflation being close to target and the belief that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economy is operating roughly at capacity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as reasons to raise interest rates. They are expecting to see a slowdown in 2018, but have had to acknowledge that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153growth is expected to remain above potential through the first quarter of 2018\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Nonetheless, there are clearly risks, most notably the potential for Donald Trump to pull the plug on NAFTA. US-Canadian trade flows total an amount equivalent to 32% of Canadian GDP so disruption would be very bad news. Uncertainty on this issue is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clouding the economic outlook\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd according to the statement, which is likely to weigh on business investment and trade in their view. Consequently, the BoC still see the need for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some continued monetary policy accommodation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and warn that the Governing Council will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remain cautious in considering future policy adjustments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Despite this the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic outlook is expected to warrant higher interest rates over time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We certainly agree and see further upside to Canadian growth given the improving global backdrop and rising commodity demand. We are also encouraged by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent comments, hinting at a growing willingness to work with Mexico and Canada on a NAFTA compromise. As such we are predicting a two more 25bp hikes in the second half of 2018. Here is the Press Association story on the Carillion directors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bonuses: Bonus payments to directors and former executives at collapsed construction giant Carillion have been stopped. The move came amid political anger about bumper payments to executives who had been in charge as the firm headed for the rocks. The Insolvency Service said payments, including those included in severance packages for former executives, had been halted after the firm went into liquidation on Monday... At Prime Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Questions, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn lashed out at the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wildly excessive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bonuses paid to directors. Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former chief executive Richard Howson pocketed \u00c2\u00a31.5m in salary, bonuses and pension payments during 2016 and, as part of his departure deal, Carillion agreed to keep paying him a \u00c2\u00a3660,000 salary and \u00c2\u00a328,000 in benefits until October. Former finance chief Zafar Khan, who left Carillion in September, was due to receive \u00c2\u00a3425,000 in base salary for 12 months. Interim chief executive Keith Cochrane was due to be paid his \u00c2\u00a3750,000 salary until July, despite leaving the company in February...The Prime Minister said the Official Receiver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation into the firm would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153look into the conduct not just of current directors but also of previous directors and their actions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It was possible to take action to claw back bonuses that have already been paid, she indicated. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Official Receiver does have the power to ensure that, in reviewing payments to executives, where those payments are unlawful or unjustified he can take action to recover those payments,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Prime Minister said. Was there a discussion about the profit warning within the department? Heaton says we were aware of the growing worrying signs from Carillion so we stepped up our contingency planning. The committee moves on to other issues. Heaton is asked about the costs to the taxpayer. He says this is unknown. We need to pay the official receiver for services , there may be additional costs, dislocation costs or costs of stabilising the services. Heaton is asked what steps and contingency plans were taken, given Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning in July. He says the contract was not an easy one for Carillion and the services we were getting weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t perfect so we were working very hard to manage the contracts. Plus we were doing contingency planning for this very outcome, looking at bringing it in house or getting new owners etc. Heaton said the priority was business continuity, vital services being maintained. Michael Spurr, chief executive of the prison and probation service, said Carillion staff continued to work. Talks are going on with the official receiver. Spurr says, we have staff on site and we have directly employed staff we can deploy to make sure services can continue [while discussions with the official receiver go on]. In parliament, the public accounts committee is quizzing Richard Heaton, permanent secretary at the ministry of justice, and begins by asking about the department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exposure to Carillion. Heaton says the main exposure is in the prison service. Carillion provided facilities management services for half of the public prisons, effectively all those south of Birmingham. The services are now being provided through the official receiver. Also a small number of courts had facilities management services provided by Carillion through joint ventures, and it is also involved in a very small way in the legal aid helpline. Payments to former Carillion directors have been stopped from the date of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liquidation, says the Cabinet Office. Minister Oliver Dowden told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World At One: I can confirm that any payments to directors beyond liquidation date have been stopped. So these people aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to be paid. The move includes severance payments. A spokesman for the Insolvency Service said: Any bonus payment to directors, beyond the liquidation date, have been stopped and this includes the severance payments which were being paid to some senior executives who left the company. Transport secretary Chris Grayling has also defended the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to hand contracts to Carillion even after its profit warning, says ITV. Grayling said all work was given to consortia rather than individual companies, including the contracts for the HS2 rail link. He told ITV News: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been clear for sometime that Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had issues, many construction firms have had issues over the years. HS2 did not have a contract on this project with a single company, it contracts with consortia; the whole consortia, the whole joint venture is responsible for delivering the project. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not for government, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not for HS2 to exclude firms, possibly pushing them under, because of the impact on their business, arguably illegal to do so, because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no legal reason to exclude them. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman has confirmed that 90% of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector clients want to keep employing its service. That means that most staff will keep being paid (at least in the short term while the Official Receiver deals with the situation). Andy Bell of Channel 5 News says its good news: The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jim Pickard agrees: But Noble Francis, economics director of the Construction Products Association, argues that Carillion staff in the building industry need more help: Newsflash: Many of the Carillion staff employed on private sector contracts will continue to be paid while the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liquidation is carried out. The Insolvency Service has announced that most (but not all) of the companies who employed Carillion have decided that they want those services to continue, and pledged to keep paying for them. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important development, as an estimated 8,500 people of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK workforce were employed on private sector work. They faced the risk of being laid off today, as the government isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t guaranteeing to pay their wages. It also confirms what Theresa May told parliament in PMQs. However, almost 10% of those companies have not made such a pledge -- meaning that staff on those contracts face uncertainty, and perhaps job losses. A spokesperson for the Insolvency Service said: The Official Receiver is very pleased with the level of support shown by Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector service customers. Over the past 48 hours all of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector service customers have been contacted to determine their ongoing needs. Over 90% of these customers have indicated that they want Carillion to continue providing services in the interim until new suppliers can be found and will provide funding which enables the Official Receiver to retain the employees working on those contracts. Work has paused on construction sites, pending decisions as to how and if they will be restarted. Speaking of job losses, a Bank of England policymaker has suggested that UK unemployment will actually keep falling. Michael Saunders used a speech in London this morning to suggest Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record-beating unemployment rate, already at its lowest point since the mid 1970s, can fall even further still. Although most economists now think the jobless rate could have reached its nadir at 4.3%, comparable with the level in June 1975, as the economy begins to slow, Saunders said it could reach 4% in 2018, or fall even further still. Saunders, who joined the committee just three days after August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emergency Brexit package was unveiled, also said it was his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hunch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pay would rise further than most people expect this year. Wages could go up to about 3% and probably a little higher next year, he said. All of this would have implications for interest rates rising further, as the Bank has kept a watching brief on pay growth, waiting for wages to rise before it can hike the cost of borrowing even further still, after its first rate hike in a decade in November. However, all of this is very much inkeeping with Saunders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 previous comments that low levels of unemployment should lead to pay growth, which he has used before to justify voting for higher rates. The City is unlikely to view this as a key moment that will inform the next decision from Threadneedle Street, due on the 8th February. Jeremy Corbyn also laid into Theresa May over wider issue of privatisations. He argues that the system is broken, and that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153costly racket\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of employing firms such as Carillion, Capita and Virgin to run privatised services must end. In response, May accuses Labour of putting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153politics before people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd through its opposition to businesses, and points out that a third of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contracts were signed under Labour. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Andy Sparrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s snap verdict, from his Politics Live blog. PMQs - Snap verdict: One of the best PMQs for ages, with strong, detailed questions, the prime minister being properly held to account, and Corbyn and May using the exchanges to make big, political arguments. Corbyn comfortably come off best - he has the wind behind him on this issue - but May managed to pull it back a bit with her final answer. Until then, although clearly across the detail of her brief, she struck the wrong tone in at least two places. Refusing to engage with Corbyn second question just because it did not conclude with a question mark sounded petty, and her repeated insistence that the government was just a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153customer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of Carillion, while technically correct, made her sound rather feeble. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just a customer - she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the prime minister, armed with the full power and authority of the UK state. May came to office promising a crackdown on excessive corporate and a bolder and more imaginative PM would have use the Carillion catastrophe to reboot this whole agenda. Surprisingly, May did not even try to do this, and her response to Corbyn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s question about what the Carillion directors are receiving sounded correct but uninspiring. That paved the way for Corbyn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s powerful final question/soundbite, a tirade against the whole private sector contracting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153racquet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It was his best moment. May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final answer was her most effective too. Her argument about Corbyn and McDonnell being fundamentally anti-business is persuasive enough to have some traction, but attacking New Labour for putting these contracts out to tender in the first place was probably a mistake. If anyone is going to get credit of opposing New Labour neoliberalism on an issue like this, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not going to be May, but Corbyn. Still at PMQs, Jeremy Corbyn asks Theresa May about the future of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army of staff, and its top brass. Q: Can she guarantee that no more money is handed to the chief executive and directors of Carillion, at a time when 8,000 workers on its private sector contracts face not being paid? The prime minister replies that some of those Carillion staff, who work on private sector contracts, will keep being paid. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because companies have been hammering out agreements with the Official Receiver since it took control. May says: There are a number of facility management contractors who have come to an agreement with the Official Receiver which means their workers will continue to be paid. The official receiver is doing their job and working with these companies. On the bonuses, May says that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfast-track\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 investigation launched by the Receiver will investigate whether there was any misconduct by Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top executive. She also denies that it was the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job to ensure that Carillion was properly managed -- it was a customer, not the manager. And the government was right not to bail out a private company. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also challenges May about Carillion. Q: Why did the government hand Carillion \u00c2\u00a32bn of contracts after it had issued a profits warning last summer? May explains that a profit warning means that a company is going to make lower profits than expected (indeed...) If the government pulled out everytime a company issued a profits warning, it would ensure that companies failed and jobs were lost, May says. And it would interrupt public services. Corbyn hits back, saying it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s responsibility to ensure that Carillion is being run properly. He says the government either handed Carillion contracts to keep it afloat (a strategy that failed) or it was simply negligent. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of rowdiness in the House of Commons, as Corbyn points out that hedge funds were betting against Carillion even as the government was meant to be monitoring it. Q: Why did the government withdraw its Crown Representative (a key oversight role) from the Carillion crisis last summer? May says there is now a new Crown Representative in place, replacing the one who left. In the interim, the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief commercial officer and the cabinet office director of markets and suppliers took over those responsibilities -- so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not true that the government didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have oversight. They clearly weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t looking very well, Corbyn shoots back (cue laughter on his back benches) Carillion went into liquidation with debts of \u00c2\u00a31.29bn, and a pension deficit of \u00c2\u00a3600m, he points out. As expected, Carillion is a big issue at PMQs (liveblog here) Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Q: How will the government guarantee that Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apprentices are kept employed to complete their apprenticeships, and paid? Theresa May says she understands that it has been a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153difficult time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for many people, who are worried about their jobs and pensions. She says those who work for Carillion in the public sector should keep turning up to work, and they will be paid. But the government isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t running Carillion - it is a customer of Carillion. May reassures the House of Commons that the government is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153looking very carefully\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the issue of apprentices. British banks are putting emergency measures into place to help small firms who are suffering from the collapse of Carillion. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to UK Finance, the trade body that represents the industry. Stephen Pegge, UK Finance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director for Commercial Finance, says banks want to help companies in Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supply chain to keep trading: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK banks and the Government are working closely to make sure the impact of the Carillion liquidation on SMEs in the supply chain is understood and managed in a way that best supports those in need of assistance. Lenders are contacting customers and, where appropriate, are putting in place emergency measures, including overdraft extensions, payment holidays and fee waivers to ensure those facing short term issues can be helped to stay on track.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is a very important issue -- thousands of companies are facing financial losses, because they were owed money by Carillion which (probably) won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t never be repaid. Over in parliament, Prime Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Questions is about to start. I imagine Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liquidation might come up. Our Politics Live blog is tracking all the action, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep an eye too: Labour MP Jon Trickett, Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office, is concerned that the Cabinet Office is keeping a close eye on Interserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances. Trickett argues that the government was reckless in awarding new contracts to the firm, even after it posted several profit warnings last year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government awarded Interserve numerous contracts after significant profit warnings, clearly showing us that Carillion was not an isolated case. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Tory Government is wedded to a dogma which would rather see public services in private hands, so their shareholders cream off the profits and the British people pick up the bill. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even when these huge firms are in unstable positions, the Government would rather risk our services than actually run them for the public . \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The time is up on the few profiteering at the expense of the many.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about Interserve: Interserve is not the next Carillion, says UK government Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s architects are calling for a major rethink in how public sector contracts are awarded, in the light of the Carillion crisis. Adrian Dobson, executive director of the Royal Institute of British Architects, says the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s procurement process is flawed. Rules that are meant to guarantee high standards actually restrict competition, and make it too hard for small businesses to get involved, RIBA says. This means a small group of major companies get most of the deals, which is a big problem if they then run into difficulties. Dobson explains: Standard pre-qualification questionnaires (PQQs) tend to bias selection in favour of larger multi-disciplinary suppliers. In architecture this might be requirements to have three built projects of a similar type, high turnover or PI requirements and multiple accreditations. This leads to a reliance on a small pool of large companies such as Carillion; narrowing the talent pool and concentrating risk in too few hands. Smaller business, including architects, are often restricted to being tier 2 and 3 sub-contractors who are then particularly vulnerable to overhead financial collapses of this kind, where the cashflow crisis gets passed down the supply chain. Dobson also shares the concerns that a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdomino effect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 could ripple through the construction sector: Carillion has around 20,000 workers in the UK, but there will also be a vast impact on the many sub-contractor firms that work with Carillion, including architects. The last significant bankruptcy in construction was ROK in 2010, which we understand had annual revenue of \u00c2\u00a3715 million compared with Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a35,200 million; a huge difference in magnitude Incidentally, Interserve warned in October that it could breach the conditions agreed with its lenders, after a profit warning. Richard Fletcher of The Times points out that the warning signs have been building for a while... Interserve is like Carillion in one respect -- it may not be well known to the public, but it has a significant role in UK public life. It employs 80,000 worldwide, including 45,000 in the UK. It plays a role building offices and car parks, and offers cleaning, catering, security and maintenance services to a range of organisations. It is also Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest provider of probation and rehabilitation services in England and Wales, and supervises approximately 40,000 medium-low risk offenders at any one time. And also like Carillion, it has kept winning government contracts after posting profit warnings. Press Association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ben Woods explains: Despite flagging financial troubles towards the end of last year, Interserve has landed a number of hefty wins, including an extension on facility management services at the BBC worth \u00c2\u00a3140m and a \u00c2\u00a3227m Government contract to provide similar services for the Department for Work and Pensions. Breaking: The World Economic Forum has highlighted the threat to environment in its annual Global Risks report. The WEF says that the upturn in growth has led to economic risks being downgraded. But concerns are rising over extreme weather events, natural disasters, failure to adapt to climate change, biodiversity loss and man made natural disasters. Many of the experts surveyed by WEF also singled out \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcweapons of mass destruction\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as a key risk. Worryingly, many of the business leaders, economists and politicians who took part in the Risks report also expect military conflict to become a bigger risk this year. Breaking: Interserve has hit back at suggestions that its financial health is weakening. An Interserve spokesperson says that the company is still performing as expected, and that its operating profits could actually beat City forecasts. The company also insists there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing untoward regarding its contact with the Cabinet Office. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official statement, following the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report that civil servants are concerned. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Last week we announced that we expect our 2017 performance to be in-line with expectations outlined in October and that our transformation plan is expected to deliver \u00c2\u00a340m-\u00c2\u00a350m benefit by 2020. This remains the case and we expect our 2018 operating profit to be ahead of current market expectations and we continue to have constructive discussions with lenders over longer-term funding. We are keeping the Cabinet Office closely appraised of our progress as would be expected.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Interserve shares are recovering some of their losses, following that vote of confidence from the Cabinet Office. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re now down just 4%. The Cabinet Office says it does not believe any of its suppliers are facing the same problems as Carillion. Responding to the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report that it is monitoring Interserve, a spokesperson says: We monitor the financial health of all of our strategic suppliers, including Interserve. We are in regular discussions with all these companies regarding their financial position. We do not believe that any of our strategic suppliers are in a comparable position to Carillion. Tim Roache, the general secretary of the GMB union, has called on the government not to throw Carillion workers in the private sector to the wolves. Speaking on Radio 4, Roache urged other firms working alongside the failed company to take them on. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want other private sector companies to take on Carillion workers with decent terms and conditions. But that takes time. The government response to say if that hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happened in 48 hours then here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the JobcentrePlus address - that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a scandal. What we said to Greg Clark yesterday is we need more time and the companies need more time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Roache also said there should be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moratorium on outsourcing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while the failure of Carillion is investigated. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital insists that Interserve is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, following the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report about Cabinet Office concerns this morning. He writes: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the most heavily shorted FTSE stocks and it has a lot of debt. Net debt was c\u00c2\u00a3513m at year-end but is set to peak in the first half of 2018 as a result of refinancing, restructuring and cash flows phasing from its energy to waste contracts that were the source of the original profits warnings. However in the case of Interserve, the arithmetic doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look anything like as bad as Carillion. Even if net debt tops \u00c2\u00a3600m in H1 2018m, its market cap as of Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close was \u00c2\u00a3176m, although this is likely to be lower today. Carillion was facing oblivion as its market cap declined to just \u00c2\u00a361m against liabilities of c\u00c2\u00a31.5bn. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been winning contracts too, although as Carillion reveals, this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean an awful lot if the lenders are ready to pull the rug out. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jamie McGeever points out that Interserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price is often volatile, as investors weigh up its financial strength: Over in the City, shares in outsourcer Interserve have tumbled by over 10% in early trading. This seems to be triggered by a report in the Financial Times that a team of UK Cabinet Office officials are watching the company closely. Interserve provides a range of services to the UK public sector, including healthcare, construction and probation services. According to the FT, civil servants have put the company under scrutiny after it released a profit warning last year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour of their report: Interserve has come under pressure from the increase in the national minimum wage as well as large losses on a waste-to-energy project in Glasgow. Not only are a number of investors betting that the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price will fall but some of its debt is trading at a steep discount to face value. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ministers are very worried about Interserve, but the team is small and low-key as they are not wanting to unsettle,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one official. Another government aide confirmed that Interserve was being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153monitored\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but said there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no comparison\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with Carillion: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are regular discussions with all of our 30 strategic suppliers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Interserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares tumbled at the open, down as much as 15% to 102.3p, from 121p last night. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that domino effect in action: Construction experts have warned that Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downfall could trigger a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153domino effect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd among smaller sub-contractors. Brian Berry, chief executive of the Federation of Master Builders, fears many \u00e2\u20ac\u0153innocent victims\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will be brought down, if projects which had been outsourced to Carillion are put on hold. Berry told Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today Programme: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now we are in a very precarious position where thousands of workers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know quite what their position is and often they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get on site. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Carillion actually aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t doing the work, they are relying on sub-contractors to do the actual building work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those companies are relying on the money coming from Carillion, that has stopped.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Many of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suppliers have been left with unpaid invoices for work done in recent weeks. They fear that these bills may not be paid by the Official Receiver -- as creditors are only expected to get a few pence for every pound they are owed. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, business and the eurozone. The collapse of Carillion continues to loom over the UK economy, as tens of thousands of workers face the threat of redundancy. Some 30,000 UK firms are thought to be owed money by the stricken construction and services group, forcing some to start laying off staff. That process could intensify today, as the government only offered Carillion-exposed companies will only receive two days of government support. Last night, union bosses urged the government to do more to protect jobs and public services which had been outsourced to Carillion, which fell into liquidation on Monday morning with huge debts, and a pension black hole. As we report this morning: Subcontractors owed money by the construction and services giant are already being pressurised by their banks and have begun laying off workers, as the threat of contagion afflicting the sector was likened to a near re-run of the banking crisis. Andrew Adonis, the former Labour transport minister, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a bit like Lehman Brothers [the Wall Street investment bank that collapsed in 2008]. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what the impact will be. A very large part of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work was project management where subcontractors do the work, but these subcontractors don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if they will be paid.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The World Economic Forum is releasing its latest Global Risks Report 2018 this morning, ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gathering in Davos. It will identify the main threat facing the global economy, from geopolitics to climate change. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be watching cryptocurrencies after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Overnight, bitcoin plunged close to $10,000, as fears of a regulatory crackdown bit. European stock markets are expected to fall too:",

                "bodyText":"Despite the stronger euro as the dollar weakens, European markets have ended the week on a positive note with the Stoxx index at its highest level for ten years. Growing hopes about company earnings and growth in the economy have combined to offset any negative concerns. In the UK the FTSE 100 has also finished higher, despite a weak performance from retailers after disappointing high street sales figures for December. In the US, early optimism has receded, as investors await news on whether the government faces a shutdown. Worse than expected US consumer confidence figures have also hit sentiment. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 29.83 points or 0.39% at 7730.79 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 1.15% to 13,434.45 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.58% to 5526.51 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was 0.5% better at 23,749.22 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.45% at 10,479.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.19% to 847.56 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 55 points or 0.21%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, have a good weekend, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest on Carillion. Rob Davies writes: The chair of the British Medical Association has demanded answers about the future of two major hospitals that Carillion was building when it collapsed, amid mounting concern about the impact of any delays on stretched NHS services. Patients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 groups joined the doctors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 trade body in calling for clarity after local NHS trusts admitted that work on the \u00c2\u00a3335m Royal Liverpool University and Birmingham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a3350m Midland Metropolitan hospitals is on hold. Aidan Kehoe, chief executive of the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University hospitals NHS trust, said Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liquidation would further postpone a project that has already been delayed twice. The full story is here: Dr Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit, agrees the impact of a US government shutdown should be modest. But given that could be the case, it might make such a move more likely. He said: The impact of a shutdown, if it happens, on the economy should be very limited as it affects only so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnon-essential\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 government services. Financial markets may also be inclined to discount this renewed display of dysfunctionality in Washington as the tax bill has already been passed. This could be yet another reason why Democrats as well as Republicans may be willing to take a stand and shut the government down That said, they currently still have another 13 hours to prevent such an embarrassment. How bad would a US government shutdown be. Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics said: It is still possible that Congress will reach a late deal to avoid a partial government shutdown, but the chances of agreement seem to be slipping away. That said, even if it lasted for a week or more, a shutdown would have only a modest impact on first quarter GDP growth. Oil prices are on track for their biggest weekly fall since October as a recent rally fizzles out. A rise in US production has outweighed declines in inventories, and the output cap agreed by Opec and Russia. Analysts had always expected US shale producers to ramp up their activities as the crude price recovered, providing a counterpoint to the Opec attempts to reduce supplies. The International Energy Agency said in its latest report that global oil stocks had tightened, but it pointed out that the US production increases would have an impact. Brent crude, which hit a three year peak of $70.37 a barrel on Monday, is now down 1% on the day at $68.62. Back with UK retail sales, and while the FTSE 100 might be in positive territory, the representatives from the high street are having a bad day all round. B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher is down 2.6%, the biggest faller in the leading index. It has been hit by, not only the disappointing retail sales figures themselves, but also the profit warning from Carpetright, suggesting big ticket home improvement items are off the agenda at the moment for UK consumers. Carpetright meanwhile is down a massive 43%. Also on the slide are shares in Next, down 1.9%, Tesco, 0.7% lower and - in the FTSE 250 - Dixons Carphone, off 2.6%. The survey indicated some uncertainty about Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts, especially the timing of any benefits to consumers, but the bulk of those questioned though the reform would be positive. The survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Richard Curtin said: While the preliminary January reading for the Sentiment Index was largely unchanged from last month (-1.5%), consumers evaluated current economic conditions less favorably (-4.6%). This small decrease in current conditions produced a small overall decline. Importantly, the survey recorded persistent strength in personal finances and buying plans, while favorable levels of buying conditions for household durables have receded to preholiday levels in early January, largely due to less attractive pricing. The Expectations Index remained virtually unchanged at 84.8. Tax reform was spontaneously mentioned by 34% of all respondents; 70% of those who mentioned tax reform thought the impact would be positive, and 18% said it would be negative. The disconnect between the future outlook assessment and the largely positive view of the tax reform is due to uncertainties about the delayed impact of the tax reforms on the consumers. Some of the uncertainty is related to how much a cut or an increase people, especially high income households who live in high-tax states, face Near and long term gas price expectations inched upward in early January but remained significantly below their peak. While long term inflation expectation remained at its 2017 average level and short term inflation expectation inched upward, consumers continued to remain very optimistic about the low national unemployment rate. Meanwhile the latest US economic indicator has come in below expectations. The University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment came in at 94.4 in January, down from December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final figure of 95.9 and below analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts of a rise to 97. Although of course there are contigency plans being put in place, just in case the US government does shut down...... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our piece earlier on the attempts to prevent a US government shutdown: As expected, US markets have made a positive start, with investors seemingly untroubled by the prospect of a government shutdown. As well as the feeling that a resolution will be found at a vote in the Senate later, the political risks are overshadowed for the moment by optimism over company results during the earnings season. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 12 points or 0.07% higher while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.24% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.32%. There are a couple of potential market moving events ahead in fact: Craig Erlam, analyst at the currency firm Oanda, says US investors are likely to shrug off fears over a US government shutdown when the opening bell rings on Wall Street: US equity markets are seen reversing Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses at the open on Friday, even as investors prepare for the first government shutdown since 2013 if the Senate doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pass a temporary spending bill. Investors don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear particularly bothered about the prospect of a government shutdown, with the assumption being that one will eventually be signed and any economic impact will be minor or non-existent. While the US dollar has remained under significant pressure, there is little to suggest this is related to the budget talks while rising US yields is likely more a reflection of the general central bank tightening environment. The backdrop for UK consumers will remain tough in 2018 before easing in 2019, according to Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC. Commenting on the weak retail sales data out this morning, the former member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee says: Taking 2018 as a whole, prices are still likely to increase more than wages, so this will be another year of consumer squeeze. As a result, we expect economic growth to be around 1.5%, not disastrous, but disappointing compared with the mid 2010s. Weak consumer spending will continue to be a drag on the UK economy in 2018, but the prospects are brighter for 2019 and beyond - as long as we get a reasonable Brexit deal with the other EU-27 countries. Greece has won rare praise today from EU commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief spokesperson, Margaritis Schinas, fuelling hopes that debt relief talks could soon be in the offing. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Four days after MPs endorsed more biting austerity measures and reforms in a rowdy parliamentary vote, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal progress was roundly applauded by the man more usually associated with tough words for the country. In an interview with state-run ERT TV, EU commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas described the bailout compliance review Athens is currently conducting with creditors as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153model review\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153going very well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everyone wants Greece to stand firmly on its feet,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, insisting it was imperative that forces inside the country supported the corrective economic adjustment reforms that had been legislated under international economic supervision under the three emergency rescue programmes Athens had received. Now that the latest bailout review was about to be concluded \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with eurozone finance ministers expected to unlock up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6bn in aid for the country when they meet in Brussels on Monday - discussion on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-bailout era could begin, he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153From September, the political winds in Europe have changed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Schinas said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the first time all of our economies are in growth \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and the euro is regaining its place as an anchor of stability on the world scene.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in 2015, Yanis Varoufakis said he Alexis Tsipras whether he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153completely stupid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd* after the Greek prime minister agreed to a demand by international creditors in for large primary surpluses. Speaking to Parapolitika radio about his time as Greek finance minister, Varoufakis said: I told him: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAre you completely stupid? What did you get in return?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 And he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOh, did I do something stupid? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s OK, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take it back\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Varoufakis criticised his successor Euclid Tsakalotos, calling him a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153yes man\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I no longer recognise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Ouch. *Varoufakis said he did not actually use the word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stupid,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it was worse than that. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quick markets round-up from Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets: Equities are positive to close out the week, rebounding from a negative US close and ahead of a key Senate vote to stave off a government shutdown tonight. Weaker than expected UK retail sales have seen the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue chip index take a leg higher, benefiting from sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retreat from fresh post-referendum highs earlier this morning. Interestingly, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is the rank outperformer, this in spite of additional euro strength after hawkish ECB comments, whilst US equities point towards a positive open this afternoon. The FTSE has climbed higher thanks to the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness...while miners are embracing the weaker dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fillip for metals. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.28% at 7722 while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up just over 1% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.47%. Over in the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open around 88 points higher. As for the pound, it is down 0.12% against the dollar at $1.3875 - despite the pressures on the US currency - and 0.27% lower against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1317. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that time of year again when world leaders and big thinkers prepare to head to the Swiss ski resort Davos to debate the most pressing social and economic issues. Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, is the latest world leader to confirm her attendance at the event next week, joining Donald Trump, Theresa May, Justin Trudeau and Emmanuel Macron among others. The work and pensions select committee has written to the pensions regulator with a series of questions on Carillion. Publishing the letter, Frank Field, Labour MP and chair of the committee, said: I am pleased that the liaison committee will be investigating Carillion - the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse begs questions across government. We have some specific concerns on the pensions side. It beggars belief that a company can be allowed to run with such apparent recklessness - and be so lucrative for the directors and shareholders - when it has a giant pension deficit and a mountain of debt. I will be proposing we take evidence from the company directors, the trustees, the pensions regulator and the auditors who somehow concluded Carillion was a going concern. Where our concerns overlap we will look to work closely with the business committee, as we have done successfully in the past. The dollar index, which measures the US currency against a basket of other major currencies, has hit a new three-year low today of 90.331 as fears of a US government shutdown mount. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch believe the dollar will recover some ground against the euro in the coming months. Support for EUR/USD from forward rate divergence may be peaking whilst markets look ahead to the European Central Bank meeting and any commentary on the euro from European Central Bank president Mario Draghi. EUR/USD could be vulnerable from a dovish Draghi. The USD has sharply weakened as a result of the recent wave of global central bank repricing, despite strong US data. EUR/USD appreciation has been supported by relative interest rate expectations, however upside potential looks limited for now. A USD rebound is likely in the first half of 2018, predicated on corporate repatriation flows and vastly underpriced Fed vs ECB expectations. More here on this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dismal UK retail sales data: The STOXX 600, comprising some of the biggest companies across Europe, is at the highest level since August 2015: Investors are in buoyant mood this morning, with gains in all major markets despite the strength of the euro and the pound against the dollar. The FTSE is up 15 points. Latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.2% at 7,716 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.9% at 13,399 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.4% at 5,518 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.8% at 23,824 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.4% at 10,475 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.4% at 400 Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics says the drop in December retail sales signals \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a disappointing end to 2017\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get the first official estimate of UK economic growth in the final quarter of 2017 from the ONS next week, on 26 January. As it stands, economists polled by Reuters are predicting growth of 0.4% in the fourth quarter, the same rate as the third quarter. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says retail sales did little to boost the economy in the final quarter of 2017. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been waiting for the pay squeeze to filter through to the high street, but so far retail sales have held up better than many expected. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales data from the ONS disappointed, however, with consumers cutting back on Christmas spending after November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Black Friday splurge. This continues the trend of bringing Christmas spending forward to take advantage of early discounts. The figures undershot expectations by some margin, falling 1.5% on the month and rising just 1.4% year-on-year. Economists had forecast the latter number at 3.0%. This means retail sales made next to no contribution to UK economic growth in the final three months of 2017. The big question now is whether this is the start of a worrying trend for the economy, or whether falling inflation and rising wages will come to the rescue. The figures from the ONS show that retail sales on 2017 overall rose by 1.9% - the weakest annual growth rate since 2013. The drop in UK retail sales in December has so far failed to hit the pound, which is still up 0.2% at $1.3918. Sterling is down 0.1% against the euro, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1332, not far off where it was before the retail figures were published. The sharp fall in retail sales over the month of December (-1.5%) can partly be explained be Black Friday sales, which encouraged shoppers to bring forward some of their Christmas spending to November. But people are also finding they have less money to spend because prices are rising faster than wages. Rhian Murphy, a senior statistician at the ONS, explains: Retail sales continued to grow in the last three months of the year partly due to Black Friday deals boosting spending. Consumers continue to move Christmas purchases earlier with higher spending in November and lower spending in December than seen in previous years. However, the longer-term picture is one of slowing growth, with increased prices squeezing people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending. Over the year the proportion of internet spending is continuing to rise, with almost one in every five pounds spent online by the end of 2017. Ouch. UK retail sales fell by 1.5% in December, more sharply than the 0.6% drop forecast by economists. It was also a lot worse than November, when sales rose 1%. More soon. The market value of Dignity, one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest funeral providers, has halved this morning after the company warned that it would have to cut its prices this year as a result of intense competition. Shares are down 50% at 959p, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 250. Dignity said that while its profits for 2017 were in line with expectations, 2018 would be a different story because it planned to cut the price of some of its funeral services. While the pre-arranged and crematoria businesses are performing strongly with no change to the board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations for these businesses, the board is keen to address the continuing acceleration of price competition facing its funeral business. The board is therefore taking decisive action on its funeral pricing strategy with a view to protecting market share and repositioning the group for future growth. Consequently, the board believes that the results for the period ending 28 December 2018 will be substantially below the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current expectations. Effective immediately, the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s simple funeral will be reduced by an average of approximately 25% and there will also be a price freeze for the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s traditional funerals in the majority of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s locations. Consequently, the group is now embarking on a rigorous review to ensure that its funeral operations are organised to run more efficiently and effectively. The business secretary Greg Clark was put on the defensive when interviewed about Carillion by Nick Robinson on Today. Main points from Clark: Minsters did not meet Carillion bosses at any time after the profit warnings (which began last summer) but were kept informed by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153officials\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Powers are available to the Insolvency Service to claw back bonuses from Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bosses. He couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say whether the thousands of small businesses owed money by Carillion would be paid. That is a matter for the Insolvency Service. The government was right to keep awarding contracts to Carillion. It will be held to account on these decisions in the coming months. Clark is asked by Nick Robinson why was there no contact between Carillion and senior ministers at any time after the profit warnings, which began in July 2017. Actually there was substantial contact between the crown commercial service who are responsible for the oversight of public sector contracts. That is the appropriate mechanism, you have senior officials monitoring these contracts. Officials report to ministers. So ministers did know that Carillion was in trouble? So why carry on handing them contracts? I think that everyone in the whole country could see the profit warnings that were issued. Many companies give profit warnings, that means they expect to make less money than they had previously forecast. If the government on each occasion downed tools and said we could no longer do business, that would cause difficulties for many companies that were healthy and viable. Over the months ahead there will be lots of opportunities to scrutinise the decisions that were taken. That is right and proper. On the issue of clawing back bonuses from Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top executives, Greg Clark says the powers exist and will be used where necessary. The Insolvency Service have very powerful sanctions available here. I wrote to the head of the service to make sure the receiver looked not just at the conduct of the current directors, but the previous ones to see if they had contributed to this collapse. And the sanctions including the recovery of bonuses that may have been paid are very substantial and they are available to the Insolvency Service. Greg Clark has been on BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme talking about Carillion and the taskforce meeting he held on Thursday. He says he is working closely with business organisations, trade unions, banks and the department of work and pensions to make sure everything is done to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maximise the continuity of these small businesses\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that were suppliers to the collapsed Carillion. However, he says the issue of whether these small suppliers will get the money they are owed is a matter for the receivers and not the government. The job of the official receiver is to wind the company up in an orderly way, to realise the assets, and to deal with creditors claims ... so make an assessment of how much people will get back. Our latest story on Carillion: Shares in Carpetright have plunged in early trading after a major profits warning. They are down 48% at 85p. The flooring company said post Christmas trading had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significantly behind expectations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and warned full-year profits would come in somewhere between \u00c2\u00a32m to \u00c2\u00a36m. The City had been expecting up to \u00c2\u00a315.6m. Another sign that consumers are growing increasingly reluctant to commit to major, non essential, spending decisions at a time when inflation is outpacing wage growth. Chief executive Wilf Walsh: Despite a positive start to our third quarter, we have seen a significant deterioration in UK trading during the important post-Christmas trading period. While average transaction values were up year on year, the number of customer transactions since Christmas was sharply down, which we believe is indicative of reduced consumer confidence. The severity of the decline in footfall over this key trading period and our more cautious view of the outlook for the balance of the year leads to a significant reduction in our full year expectations. Against this background of a further deterioration in market conditions, we remain committed to driving through the improvements that are essential to the long term repositioning of the business. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound is holding on to its post Brexit-vote highs against the dollar, up 0.2% this morning at $1.3917. It is on course for a fifth weekly rise against the US currency. Sterling has been supported by a number of factors, including optimism over Brexit negotiations, some decent data, and dollar weakness. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets gives his view: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been another decent week for the pound as it looks set to post its fifth successive weekly rise in a row against the US dollar. A new post Brexit vote high of $1.3943 this week has raised expectations of a move through the $1.40 area in the next few days in the hope that a more convivial tone will develop between Brussels and London as the prospect of the upcoming trade talks looms on the horizon. While that remains highly optimistic, sterling short positions have continued to get squeezed hard. The pound is down 0.1% against the euro however, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1340. UK retail sales data for December, published at 9.30am, will provide insight into whether cash-strapped consumers - under pressure from falling real pay - were willing to spend over the Christmas period. Economists polled by Reuters are predicting a 0.6% fall in sales over the month, following a 1.1% increase in November. However, some analysts suspect the number might come in a touch higher after better-than expected figures from the British Retail Consortium. Also this morning we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had profit warnings from Carpetright and the funeral provider Dignity. More on those soon.",

                "bodyText":"Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of London, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest insurance market, has become the latest financial firm to announce that it plans to stop investing in coal companies. Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s will start to exclude coal from its investment strategy from 1 April. The definition of what is a coal company and the criteria for divestment will be set over the coming months. The firm has long been vocal about the need to battle climate change, with insurance one of the worst affected industries by hurricanes, wildfires and flooding in recent years. The insurance market decided last month to implement a coal exclusion policy as part of a responsible investment strategy for the central mutual fund that sits behind every insurance policy written by the Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market. Inga Beale, Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of London chief executive, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That means that in the areas of our portfolio where we can directly influence investment decisions we will avoid investing in companies that are involved mainly in coal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is there more the insurance sector could be doing to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy by choosing sustainable or low-carbon stocks?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s does not underwrite operations directly, but offers a marketplace to almost 90 syndicates of other insurers. Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has been slower to take action than others. Other big UK and European insurance companies, including Aviva, Allianz, Axa, Legal &amp; General, SCOR, Swiss Re and Zurich, have been shifting away from coal and other fossil fuels due to concerns about climate risks. About \u00c2\u00a315bn has been divested by insurers in the past two years, according to a recent report from Unfriend Coal Network, a global coalition of NGOs and campaigners including 350.org and Greenpeace. It said 15 companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c almost all in Europe \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have fully or partially cut financial ties by selling holdings in coal companies and refusing to insure their operations. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Axa was one of the first financial firms to reduce investments in coal in May 2015 and is still leading the way. It said last month it was ditching investments and ending insurance for controversial US oil pipelines. After being criticised by campaigners for applying a threshold of 50% of revenues to define coal companies, it lowered the threshold to 30%. The Church of England has gone further, pulling out of investing in companies that make more than 10% of their revenues from thermal coal or oil from tar sands. Analysis by the ClimateWise coalition of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest insurers published in December 2016 found that more frequent extreme weather events were driving up uninsured losses and making some assets uninsurable. The report concluded that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153protection gap\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the difference between the costs of natural disasters and the amount insured \u00e2\u20ac\u201c had quadrupled to $100bn (\u00c2\u00a379bn) a year since the 1980s. Insurance companies are perhaps also mindful of the danger that they could suffer a huge loss if their investments in fossil fuel companies were rendered worthless by action on climate change, as the Bank of England warned in 2015. However, some banks are still investing in coal plants, according to research from campaign groups. Beale told the Guardian that she would be discussing the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new investment strategy at the World Economic Forum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual meeting in Davos this week. Climate change and what investors can do will feature prominently at the meeting of political and business leaders. Beale said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It goes beyond climate change.

it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a stern warning that capitalism is failing to serve the people.</strong></p> <p>The message is being read by Cardinal Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson.</p> <p>In it, the Pope says there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moral imperative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to create the conditions needed to allow everyone to live in a dignified manner</p> <p>He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s urges delegates at WEF to build a better foundation for a just society, that can restore dignity to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153those who cannot dream of a better world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>Pope Francis warns of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153growing fragmentation between states and institutions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with new actors emerging, and new economic competition and regional trade agreements.</p> <p>In a damning verdict on the world today, the Pope warns that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an ambition for profit at all costs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is driving future fragmentation and individualism, rather than inclusiveness.</p> <p>He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The recurring financial instabilities have brought new problems and serious challenges that governments must confront, such as the growth of unemployment, the increase in various forms of poverty, the widening of the socio-economic gap and new forms of slavery, often rooted in situations of conflict, migration and various social problems.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ordinary people risk being treated as mere cogs in a machine to be exploited, the Pope continues, adding:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whenever a human life no longer proves useful for that machine, it is discarded with few qualms.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also warns that artificial intelligence and robots must be used for the service of humanity, rather than to undermine it.</p> <p>Economic freedom must not prevail over the freedom of men and women, and their rights, the Pope says, declaring:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We cannot remain silent in the face of the suffering of millions of people whose dignity is wounded, nor can we continue to move forward as if the spread of poverty and injustice has no cause.</p> </blockquote> <p>He concludes by wishing WEF his best wishes for a successful meeting, and invokes \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe divine blessings of wisdom and strength\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on those attending. </p>

To avoid this fate, millions of people need to be helped into new roles - probably into a whole new career path.</p> <p>Without reskilling, only 2% of workers have an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoptimal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 chance of a rewarding new role, WEF says. But with proper investment in training, they reckon 95% of the most threatened workers could end up in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood-quality, higher-wage work\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in industries that are creating, not slashing, jobs.</p> <p>The report has analysed employment data to find \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood fits\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for staff whose current jobs are at risk. For example, assembly line workers could retrain in construction, and metal fabricators could move into pipelaying.

And while predicting the exact nature of the demand for skills is impossible, recent research from the World Economic Forum reveals that across a wide range of scenarios, investment in workforce reskilling and human capital development is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno-regret action\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat is, it will be a beneficial investment even in the absence of skills shortages.<br></li> <li>For policy-makers, fostering continuous reskilling and lifelong learning across the economy will be critical in order to maintain a labour force with the tools needed to fuel inclusive economic growth and to ensure that companies can find workers with the skills needed to help them succeed and contribute their full potential to the economy and society.<br></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-22T12:31:57.154Z\">at 12.31pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a65c8dae4b0ff81ba72697f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-22T11:23:07.955Z\">11.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Time for a market update.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 has recovered some of its poise after its early dip, and is now up around 0.07%.</p> <p>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is virtually unchanged, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has slipped by a marginal 0.04%.

                "bodyText":"That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight, from a rather cold and snowy Davos. See you in the morning for full coverage of Day 1. GW Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key message from Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech to WEF tonight, as he collected his Crystal Award. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To disfigure a woman by throwing acid on her face is one of the crudest acts of subjugation imaginable. At the source of it lies the view that a woman does not have the right to assert her choice,. We need to open access for each and every one with a true sense of ourselves, not as more powerful or less privileged but as equals.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rukh Khan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-profit Meer Foundation provides support to female victims of acid attacks and major burn injuries through medical treatment and legal aid. The dancing is over, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve hotfooted it across from the Congress Centre to hear from Global Himalayan Expedition, an Indian social enterprise. GHE have a good story to tell too - they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve using solar panels and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdecentralized microgrids\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to bring power to remote communities in India. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re watching a video now, about how a village who relied on kerosene lamps now have modern LED lighting. GHE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jaideep Bansal, who is one of WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglobal shapers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, explains that the children in the village used to trek three miles to school. Now they have an internet connection -- no sooner were they online then they were checking out their own region on Wikipedia. Inspiring stuff. More details here. Elton John\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack on inequality will, rightly, provoke reminders that he is himself fabulously wealthy - with an estimated \u00c2\u00a3290m in the bank. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what happens when you shift a quarter of a billion records over a glittering career. And in his defence, the Elton John AIDS Foundation (EJAF) has raised more than $400 million (according to WEF). From inequality to...ballet! WEF delegates are now enjoying a performance led by La Scala\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s principal dancer \u00c3\u00a9toile Roberto Bolle, which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m told \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fuses the work of Antonio Vivaldi and Astor Piazzolla to explore the fine line between chaos and harmony in our relationship with nature.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Finally, Sir Elton John receives his Crystal Award from the World Economic Foundation, for his philanthropic work. Sir Elton explains that he became a philanthropist because he had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lost who he had become\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wanted to reconnect, i wanted to be a decent person\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Sir Elton talks about the battle against HIV/AIDS - it was a death sentence 25 years ago, he says, but there are now millions of people on life-saving medicine. The musician ends by challenging delegates at Davos to deliver on their mission to improve the state of the world, adding; The world needs to be changed - the inequality in the world is, to be honest, disgraceful. Now, Bollywood star Shar Rukr Khan gives a moving speech about the strength of women, such as those who have suffered acid attacks, and children who are overcoming suffering. Collecting her WEF crystal award, Cate Blanchett tells the audience that we must rebuild the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshared bonds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 between people if we are to tackle the refugee crisis. The Australian actor laments the lack of empathy and compassion. She explains that if we can drop the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcloaded label\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrefugee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 it is earlier to see the person behind it. It is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very very easy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to turn your back on those in need, if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think of them as fellow human being, Blanchett says, adding: Once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve born witness you cannot turn away. Pope Francis has sent a message to the World Economic Forum, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a stern warning that capitalism is failing to serve the people. The message is being read by Cardinal Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson. In it, the Pope says there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moral imperative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to create the conditions needed to allow everyone to live in a dignified manner He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s urges delegates at WEF to build a better foundation for a just society, that can restore dignity to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153those who cannot dream of a better world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Pope Francis warns of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153growing fragmentation between states and institutions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with new actors emerging, and new economic competition and regional trade agreements. In a damning verdict on the world today, the Pope warns that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an ambition for profit at all costs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is driving future fragmentation and individualism, rather than inclusiveness. He says: The recurring financial instabilities have brought new problems and serious challenges that governments must confront, such as the growth of unemployment, the increase in various forms of poverty, the widening of the socio-economic gap and new forms of slavery, often rooted in situations of conflict, migration and various social problems. Ordinary people risk being treated as mere cogs in a machine to be exploited, the Pope continues, adding: Whenever a human life no longer proves useful for that machine, it is discarded with few qualms. He also warns that artificial intelligence and robots must be used for the service of humanity, rather than to undermine it. Economic freedom must not prevail over the freedom of men and women, and their rights, the Pope says, declaring: We cannot remain silent in the face of the suffering of millions of people whose dignity is wounded, nor can we continue to move forward as if the spread of poverty and injustice has no cause. He concludes by wishing WEF his best wishes for a successful meeting, and invokes \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe divine blessings of wisdom and strength\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on those attending. Given the state of the world, I think they may need it.. Klaus Schwab welcomes delegates to the 48th World Economic Forum. He calls WEF the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153foremost multi-stakeholder group in the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delegates include politicians, business leaders, the heads of international organisations, charities and trade unions, plus the new generation of young global leaders. The point behind WEF is is that governments, businesses and civil society cannot solve the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems alone. He reminds us that WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambition is to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Improve the state of the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and urges delegates to follow three rules: respect human dignity and diversity serve the community be a trustee of the next generation Delegates are flooding into the main Congress Hall at the World Economic Forum, as founder Klaus Schwab prepares to open this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s event. Despite the disruption caused by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s snow, the cavernous space is pretty packed. That may be thanks to the lure of celebrity. Schwab is going to hand over three crystal awards: Cate Blanchett, for her leadership in raising awareness of the refugee crisis Sir Elton John, for his leadership in the fight against HIV/AIDS Shah Rukh Khan, for his leadership in championing children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rights in India Just in: Nine out of ten business leaders in Britain are upbeat about the growth prospects for their companies this year despite uncertainty about the impact of Brexit. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to consultancy firm PwC, which has just released its annual survey of chief executives at a press event in Davos. PwC found that optimism about the health of the global economy was boosting confidence; 36% of business leaders expected the global economy to strengthen in 2018, up from 17% in 2017. But, the number of UK business leaders who describe themselves as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery confident\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has dipped to 34% from 41% last year. PwC also uncovered signs that British businesses are reining in their hiring plans. The number of UK business leaders expecting to increase headcount has fallen slightly to 54% from 63% last year, while 15% expect to reduce headcount, compared to 10% in 2017 In a disappointing development, global flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) fell by 16% in 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to a new report from UNCTAD - the United Nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arm for trade, investment and development issues. UNCTAD reports that FDI shank to $1.52 trillion last year, down from $1.81 trillion in 2016. That indicates that companies cut back on spending on new factories and the like. FDI flows into Europe shrank by 27%, while in US it slumped by a third. UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi says FDI spending is on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bumpy road\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While FDI in developing countries remained at a level similar to the previous year, more investment in sectors that can contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals is still badly needed. Promoting FDI for sustainable development remains a challenge.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As a measure of economic success, GDP has plenty of critics. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too blunt, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t distinguish between building atom bombs or orphanages, or take account of environmental damage or economic inequality. So, the World Economic Forum has just launched a new metric of national economic performance as an alternative to GDP. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s called the inclusive development index, and it attempts to do a better job of evaluating countries, by focusing on living standards, and whether policymakers are doing a good job of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfuture-proofing their economies.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 The index is based on growth and development; inclusion; and intergenerational equity, tracking metrics like GDP per capita; labour productivity; employment; and healthy life expectancy. So how does Britain do on this measure? Not very well, basically. The UK comes just 21st, some way behind Germany (12th), Canada (17th) and France (18th). But the other three G7 nations did even worse, with the US coming 23rd, Japan 24th and Italy just 27th. Norway, Iceland, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Denmark filled the first five places. The Treasury have sent a short response to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IMF forecasts: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are building a Britain that is fit for the future by improving skills, backing innovation and investing in infrastructure to deliver a stronger economy and guarantee a better future for the next generation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to the latest IMF forecasts: Although the IMF has raised its forecast for global growth, the UK has missed out. The Fund has cut its forecast for UK growth in 2019 to 1.5%, down from 1.6% previously. Although that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small move, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s notable that other countries have seen their projected growth revised UP. For example, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predicted growth has been raised from 1.5% to 2%, while the US is now on track for 2.5% growth next year. The IMF expects the global economy to expand by 3.9% this year, which highlights how the UK will lag behind. The IMF also expects UK GDP to increase by 1.5% this year, below its long-term trend, and much slower than the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s projected growth of 2.7% in 2018. John McDonnell MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chancellor, pins the blame firmly on the government: McDonnell (who is due in Davos later this week) says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The IMF report out today confirms what others have been saying \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the UK economy is not growing as fast as many other advanced economies. It further exposes the effect of the last seven years of Tory economic failure. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Philip Hammond should drop his plans to continue the austerity policies that have weakened our economy. We urgently need a change of direction from the Chancellor. There is no excuse for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmore of the same\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 approach. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The next Labour government will provide the serious investment our country needs, underpinned by our Fiscal Credibility Rule, to build a high wage, high skill economy for the many not the few.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Outside the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference, the weather at Davos is decidedly wintery. Delegates are stepping off the train into a flurry of monster snowflakes, there are huge snowdrifts everywhere, and the roads are jammed in all directions. As usual, the whole resort has been taken over by the WEF circus, with security guards controlling the traffic and guards on the perimeter of the Congress Hall. On that note, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hand over to Graeme Wearden in Davos. Here is a link to the opening remarks by Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic counsellor, at the World Economic Outlook press conference: Meanwhile US markets have opened lower, as investors concentrate more on the US government shutdown than the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s raised forecasts. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 35 points or 0.13% while the S&amp;P 500 is off 0.06% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.01% lower. Final question: will China continue to play a bigger role [in the global economy]? Obstfeld: There is no question China is a major player. Chinese growth is incredibly important to world growth. It is important for China to support the multilateral system. It will require further steps from China, to open its own economy to imports and work on a range of issues. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role is critical. Question on whether growth is even a worthwhile pursuit if not everyone benefits. Obstfeld says GDP doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t measure the distribution of rewards [from growth]. You could do that but it would be a value judgement, and economists have struggled with this for centuries. How do you measure overall utility? You have to keep GDP as an anchor and where it does not get at all the social or welfare issues you want, you have to supplement it with other data. It will never be possible to have one number to summarise the totality of the happiness of people in the worlkd, but GDP is a key concept and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep looking at it. Question on bitcoin and systemic risk. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like to comment on specific cryptocurrencies. Blockchain technology in general, we see possible advantages. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an interesting development. [But] cryptocurrencies offer risks, regulators need to watch them carefully. Do you expect US growth to become a drag on global growth after 2020? Obstfeld: The tax bill and its impact is complex, lot of uncertainty around our forecast. A lot of the impact is explicitly temporary. Could be a surge of investment in near term, when it stops could be some payback. But some [of the measures] are not temporary. So some potential for payback in US growth [could] result in slower import growth in the US which would affect trading partners. How big those effect would be is hard to predict. What role does China play now compared to ten years ago? How about the Federal Reserve? Obstfeld: China carried out large fiscal stimulus at time of crisis. Even though its growth rate has come down, it is still a major source of growth. there are challenges which the leadership has recognised in terms of strengthening financial regulations... the relationship between local and federal budgets. We see China as a strong driver of global growth going forward. As for the Fed we expect them to make data dependent decisions to achieve full employment and stable prices. Question on the risks facing the global economy. Obstfeld says, It is hard to identify one risk, policymakers need to think broadly and for the long term, not just the next political cycle. The next recession may be closer than we think and the ammunition to combat it will be less than previously, he says. On to the questions. The current upturn was not by chance, says Obstfeld, it owed much to accommodative macro economic polices. Our view is the current upturn is not likely to be a new normal. Advanced economies are leading the upswing, but will return to growth rates below pre-crisis levels. Demographic change and low productivity present challenges. The two biggest national economies driving growth, China and the US, are predicted to see lower growth in future. Easy financial conditions have also left a legacy of debt. There is less good news in Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa (in terms of growth). Voters in many countries have soured on political entities, with a turn to more nationalistic tendencies and this would harm longer term growth prospects. The overarching risk at the moment is complacency. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic counsellor, says countries have to ask themselves three questions: how can we raise our economic efficiencies over the long term; how can we avoid this upturn ending in new slowdown; and how can we be sure we have the tools to counter the next downturn. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde says we should be encouraged by global growth but should not be complacent. There are too many people left out of the economic growth, she says. Also, this is mostly a cyclical recovery. And without continuous reforms, aging populations, low productivity etc will continue to weigh. There are uncertainties ahead. There is a troubling increase in debt across a number of countries. You may say it is for the IMF to see these risks, but what we see in the medium term does give us grounds for worry. She says now is a perfect opportunity for world leaders to repair their roof (as in repair the roof while the sun is shining.) We think policymakers should make the difficult structural and fiscal reforms needed. Boost long term growth, pay down debt where it is too high. Growth needs to be more inclusive, not only across countries but within countries. This requires training for workers at risk of being displaced by new technologies. We need new opportunities for young people, and for women. We need robust global co-operation if we are to tackle shared problems (tax evasion, climate change, corruption etc). The IMF is holding a press conference on the world economic outlook which can be viewed here. The global economy will grow faster than expected this year and next as Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate tax cuts provide a short-term shot in the arm, despite fears over rising inequality and overheating financial markets, the International Monetary Fund has said. Launching its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) report at the annual Davos gathering of the global elite in Switzerland this week, the IMF upgraded its growth forecast for the world economy by 0.2 percentage points to 3.9% for both 2018 and 2019. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic counsellor, said Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts, passed into law at the end of last year, should encourage businesses to invest in additional economic output \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which should provide a positive, albeit short-lived, boost for the US and its trade partners. However, he said there are risks on the horizon from a potential sharp drop in markets after the recent surge in equity valuations. He also warned world leaders gathering at the Swiss ski resort in the Alps that they would need to tackle inequality and boost the resilience of their economies, or face a downturn that will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153come sooner and be harder to fight\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than expected. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Political leaders and policymakers must stay mindful that the present economic momentum reflects a confluence of factors that is unlikely to last for long,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upgrade comes amid a synchronised global upswing, as the economies of the US, eurozone and Asia recover from the depths of the 2008 financial crisis a decade ago. However, the current economic sweet spot has been helped by central banks around the world keeping interest rates low and pumping billions of dollars into their economies through quantitative easing. Our full story is here: The view from the train on the way to the World Economic Forum in Davos, as seen by Graeme Wearden and Larry Elliott: Still with Greece, and ahead of the eurogroup meeting, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s officials are expressing confidence that a new loan disbursement of up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.7bn will be granted. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Greek officials are calling today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup the beginning of the end of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nine-year ordeal under international supervision. Even though some demanded reforms are still pending, insiders are not anticipating especially tough words from euro area finance ministers when they meet under Mario Centeno for the first time this afternoon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am 99 per cent sure they are going to give us the green light for the next [bailout] instalment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd MEP Stelios Koulouglou told the Guardian. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are expecting soft stuff.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Koulouglou, who represents the governing leftwing Syriza party in the European parliament, said disbursement would not only conclude the debt-stricken country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third compliance review but pave the way to the end of international supervision under its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn third bailout programme. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After this there is a fourth, and last, review but it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be at all as gruelling and then we will be at the end.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Briefing reporters at 2 PM local time, the government spokesman, Dimitris Tzannakopoulos, said after today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro group Athens would enter \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the last stretch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before officially exiting the programme in August. The government expected the bailout tranche to be \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.7bn \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on the recommendation of the euro working group\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which advises eurozone finance ministers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of that amount \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.7bn will be given [to Greece] by mid-February upon completion of technical prior actions [reforms] without a new meeting of the eurogroup,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. There was good news for Greece and Spain from a couple of ratings agencies late on Friday, giving a lift to their bond prices today. Reuters reports: Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs fell to six-week lows and short-dated bond yields in Greece tumbled on Monday, after ratings upgrades for the two southern euro zone states provided further evidence of a turnaround for the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peripheral economies. Fitch upgraded Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A-\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with a stable outlook late on Friday, citing a broad-based economic recovery and limited impact on the economy from Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence bid. It was Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rating from one of the top three ratings agencies since the euro zone debt crisis. S&amp;P Global Ratings, releasing its review on Greece after Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market close, lifted Greek long-term, foreign currency ratings for the first time in two years on improvements in the finances and fiscal outlook for the debt-laden nation . \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fact that it is the first ratings upgrade in two years is a political win for government and the euro zone,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Patrick O\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDonnell, an investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management in London, referring to the Greek upgrade. The US government shutdown may be having little impact so far on global equity markets, but it has pushed the already weak dollar even lower. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Sterling heavily flirted with $1.39 as it climbed 0.2%, while the euro crept back across $1.225 after rising by the same amount. Against each other, however, neither currency could gain the upper hand, with the pound effectively flat the wrong side of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.134. Despite cable lurking around its post-Brexit peak, the FTSE managed to overcome its initial wobble this Monday, nudging back above 7730 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c roughly 70 points off its all-time highs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as the day went on. The DAX, meanwhile, remained in the ball-park of its own record intraday high, sitting flat around 30 or so points away from 13500 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the latest news surrounding a possible German coalition between the CDU and SPD could only keep the index from dipping in the red, rather than propel it to fresh highs. Greece is edging closer to an exit from its bailout programme: The world faces a massive and urgent need to reskill millions of workers whose jobs will be eliminated by technological change in the next few years. A new report from the World Economic Forum shows that employees across the economy risk suffer falling incomes or unemployment as the 4th industrial revolution disrupts the workplace. To avoid this fate, millions of people need to be helped into new roles - probably into a whole new career path. Without reskilling, only 2% of workers have an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoptimal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 chance of a rewarding new role, WEF says. But with proper investment in training, they reckon 95% of the most threatened workers could end up in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood-quality, higher-wage work\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in industries that are creating, not slashing, jobs. The report has analysed employment data to find \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood fits\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for staff whose current jobs are at risk. For example, assembly line workers could retrain in construction, and metal fabricators could move into pipelaying. In old media, printers could swap their presses for tractors and become farm or ranch managers. Worrying, women will suffer the most if we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get this right. Female employees currently carry out 57% of the 1.4 million US jobs expected to be disrupted by technology by 2026, such as secretarial and administrative roles. They also have fewer escape routes. Without reskilling, on average, at-risk women have only 12 job transition options, while at-risk men have 22 options. With reskilling, women have 49 options, while men have 80 options. Last year, WEF warned that 5 million jobs across 15 advanced economies would be disrupted by 2020. This new report is based on data from America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Labour market, but its conclusions feel relevant to a wider audience. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advice for those looking nervously at the future of work: For individuals, particularly those under risk of displacement, simply to remain employed will require engaging in lifelong learning and regular reskilling. Additionally, for all workers, continuous learning will not only be key to securing employment but also to building stable, fulfilling careers and seizing rewarding job transition opportunities. For employers, relying solely on new workers entering the labour market with the right ready-made skills will no longer be sufficient. And while predicting the exact nature of the demand for skills is impossible, recent research from the World Economic Forum reveals that across a wide range of scenarios, investment in workforce reskilling and human capital development is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno-regret action\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat is, it will be a beneficial investment even in the absence of skills shortages. For policy-makers, fostering continuous reskilling and lifelong learning across the economy will be critical in order to maintain a labour force with the tools needed to fuel inclusive economic growth and to ensure that companies can find workers with the skills needed to help them succeed and contribute their full potential to the economy and society. Time for a market update. The FTSE 100 has recovered some of its poise after its early dip, and is now up around 0.07%. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is virtually unchanged, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has slipped by a marginal 0.04%. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Stock markets in Europe are a mixed bag this morning as investors access the political landscape. The shutdown of the US government hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spooked investors as there was a similar muted reaction the last time it happened in 2013, but nor has it given traders a reason to buy into the market. In Germany the SPD have agreed to begin formal talks with Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CDU. This is a step in the right direction for German politics and traders will be watching it closely. In the wake of the collapse of Carillion, rival companies have been successful in their contingency plans to keep projects going, says ratings agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. But they could face having to sign new contracts on less favourable terms, it adds in a new report: Project companies are satisfactorily implementing contingency plans to avoid an impact on services or cash flows after the liquidation of British construction and services firm Carillion. However, moderate credit deterioration is possible because some project companies will need to sign new contracts with alternative subcontractors, potentially with less favourable terms or pricing... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Projects continue to provide contracted services despite Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liquidation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Kunal Govindia, a Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Assistant Vice President and co-author of the report. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, if replacement subcontractors are procured it could lead to an increase in operating costs, although there are mitigating factors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Staff wages, supplier invoices and other facilities management (FM) costs are ultimately paid out of the offtaker unitary payment and there is no reliance on Carillion having sufficient cash. Currently, project companies are continuing to observe the contractual payment mechanics. As part of their contingency planning, project companies had engaged with possible replacement subcontractors. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expects that new subcontractors will join the various projects over the coming months. However, there is no guarantee that the new contract will be on the same terms and pricing. Project companies could potentially face increased FM costs without an accompanying increase in revenue. Two factors mitigate this risk. Firstly, soft FM services are benchmarked periodically and cost increases are passed to offtakers. Secondly, projects are resilient to FM cost increases, as demonstrated by generally adequate cost increase sensitivities. Meanwhile Kier has said around 200 Carillion employees working on HS2 and the Highways England smart motorway schemes have been offered the chance to join the company. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a number of companies jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon (step forward Long Island Iced Tea) and seeing their shares soar. And it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t peaked yet, it seems: A rather downbeat survey on UK household finances from IHS Markit: You would imagine stock markets would be rather edgy at the prospect of a US government shutdown. But apparently not. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 53 points on Friday, and the futures are indicating a small decline at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open of around 44 points. And the long term impact on US markets seems limited: A new report on the growing gap between rich and poor is timely in the run up to the Davos meeting. Larry Elliott writes: The development charity Oxfam has called for action to tackle the growing gap between rich and poor as it launched a new report showing that 42 people hold as much wealth as the 3.7 billion who make up the poorest half of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population. In a report published on Monday to coincide with the gathering of some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest people at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Oxfam said billionaires had been created at a record rate of one every two days over the past 12 months, at a time when the bottom 50% of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population had seen no increase in wealth. It added that 82% of the global wealth generated in 2017 went to the most wealthy 1%. The charity said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unacceptable and unsustainable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a tiny minority to accumulate so much wealth while hundreds of millions of people struggled on poverty pay. It called on world leaders to turn rhetoric about inequality into policies to tackle tax evasion and boost the pay of workers. Our full report is here: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Larry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reality check ahead of the meeting: And finally, a rundown of the hot topics in the chilly Alps: Ahead of the latest World Economic Outlook, Lord Jim O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill - the former Conservative treasury minister and remain supporter - is optimistic about the outlook for the UK. In an interview with BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed, Lord O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill said the UK was benefiting from better than expected global growth, and forecasts are likely to be upgraded, dwarfing the more gloomy predictions about the effects of Brexit. But O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill, who is on the board of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said the question was, how much better would Britain be doing without the uncertainty of its future relationship with the EU. He said: I certainly wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have thought the UK economy would be as robust as it currently seems. That is because some parts of the country, led by the North West [of England], are actually doing way better than people seem to realise or appreciate. As well as this crucial fact, the rest of the world is also doing way better than many people would have thought a year ago, so it makes it easier for the UK. A recent assessment suggested growth in the UK could be on average 3% lower by 2030 than it would have been if Britain remained in the single market and customs union. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill said: If that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the worst that Brexit will deliver, then I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry about it. Now, my own view is if we go for a really hard Brexit or a no-deal Brexit, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably suffer more than that 3%. But if it is only 3%, what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on with the rest of the world - helping us - and with productivity improving, that will easily dwarf a 3% hit over 13 years, easily. He admitted the stronger performance could mean he and many economist had been too pessimistic about the effects of the Brexit vote: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m almost embarrassed to accept that it might sound like that. Because of course in principle I share the views of many that Brexit is a really weird thing for the UK to impose on itself from an economic perspective. And maybe this [better global growth] means the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be able to cope with Brexit better than certainly somebody like me might have thought some time ago. But I would quickly add at the same time, I have felt for a good couple of years, as important as Brexit is, it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the most important thing facing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. Brexiteers are going to be like the cat with the cream. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthere you go, told you so\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which of course is ridiculous. He said major sectors of the economy closely linked to the EU, such as car manufacturing and pharmaceuticals, were still facing significant threats if the UK does leave the customs union and the single market. Bookmakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shares are showing losses on reports that the UK government is planning to cut the maximum stake on fixed odds betting terminals from \u00c2\u00a3100 to \u00c2\u00a32. It said in October it would reduce the stake to between \u00c2\u00a350 and \u00c2\u00a32, to tackle the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crack cocaine of high street gambling.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A consultation period ends on Tuesday. William Hill is down 13%, Ladbrokes Coral has lost 12% and Paddy Power Betfair has fallen 2.6%. Analyst Alistair Ross at Investec said: A DCMS official apparently indicated that while no formal decision has been made, \u00c2\u00a32 is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchighly likely\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. However Matthew Hancock, the new Secretary of State, has only just been appointed (9 January), and we think it is unlikely that a final decision on FOBT staking limits has actually been made. We also note that the FOBT consultation only closes tomorrow, and suspect speculation on the final outcome is premature. As expected it has been an uncertain start to the week for European markets. The FTSE 100 has fallen 0.13%, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is down 0.1%, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB has lost 0.33% but Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex is up 0.3%. More on the German coalition talks. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ING economist Carsten Brzeski: Given the very detailed informative talks in January, the official coalition talks should not take too long - if all parties stick to the desired results. However, the SPD delegate pushed the party leaders to renegotiate details of the informative talks regarding the healthcare system, the labour market and immigration, increasing pressure on the SPD to bring some new political achievements from the forthcoming talks. The willingness of the CDU to really re-open some of the most controversial issues seems to be very limited. ... However, once there is an official coalition agreement, all SPD party members, more than 440,000, will get the chance to vote for or against it. Compared with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s party congress, this party members\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vote will be a much tougher nut to crack. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest report on the talks: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly quiet start to the week at the moment but it is the quiet before the storm. Later today the Davos shindig kicks off, with the great and the good putting the world to rights. One highlight, if that is the right word, is Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scheduled appearance on Friday, assuming it goes ahead in the midst of the US government shutdown. Also this week come the latest policy meetings from the Bank of Japan - which surprised the market by announcing an unexpected slowdown in its bond buying programme - and the European Central Bank. UK unemployment figures and UK and US GDP numbers will also be closely watched. But back to today, and ahead of the official start of the Davos meeting (the World Economic Forum to give it the proper name) comes the latest assessment of the global outlook from the IMF. Not everyone is taken with Davos though. UBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul Donovan says: The data calendar is pretty empty today. This leaves markets at the mercy of media coverage of events at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Significant policy announcements are unlikely, but Davos does give journalists an opportunity to pontificate while wearing silly hats. It also gives locals in Davos the opportunity to rent out their premises to attendees and move out for the duration, as Rupert Neate reports: Markets are likely to open in a mixed fashion, as investors take on board not only the US government shutdown, but the news from Germany that it came a step closer over the weekend to ending its political stalement and forming a coalition goverment. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Having seen the US government shutdown confirmed after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US close there might be a case for suggesting that stocks may well be adversely affected. This seems unlikely in the long run given that the shutdown, at least in the short term, is likely to be fairly limited in nature, given that by and large economic data from across the globe continues to show a fairly robust level of economic activity. Furthermore, dysfunctional US politics isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really anything new, in fact dysfunctional politics appears to be becoming the norm, not only in the US, but the world over, even if in Germany we do appear to be starting to make progress on the formation of a new government after the German SPD party membership granted permission for the party leaders to begin new coalition talks with Angela Merkel. Despite this progress, and before we hang out the bunting, there still remains some way to go before any form of agreement starts to evolve into a workable arrangement between the various parties. Here is IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts for the market open: Also on the agenda today, eurozone finance ministers will discuss the improvement in the Greek economy in the first eurogroup meeting hosted by new president Mario Centeno.

The US currency has been under pressure on worries that the Trump tax cuts would increase the already hefty US national debt. And the dollar has become less attractive as other central banks begin edging up interest rates and gradually removing their long standing stimulus programmes.</p> <p>And despite a resolution to the government shutdown, the problem has only been postponed until early next month. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Renewed dollar weakness is the revival of yet another familiar friend from 2017. Post-shutdown euphoria has been replaced by a weary acceptance that we will probably have to do this all over again in just over two weeks. Why buy the greenback, when so many other economies can show solid growth without the government disruption so prevalent in the US at the moment?</p> </blockquote> <p>So with the stronger pound, the FTSE 100 came off its best levels.

Uncertainty about possible Eurozone reform, Italian elections and the success of the German coalition negotiations clearly take a backseat to improved economic factors.</p> <p>Over the past few months, consumer confidence improved most notably because of a much more positive view on the general economic situation, modest improvements in assessments of the financial situation and increased amounts of current and expected major purchases. This indicates that optimism and stronger consumption are going hand in hand, spurring the household consumption component of GDP growth. While unemployment expectations have become slightly less favourable over the last months of 2017, this is actually at odds with businesses indicating that hiring expectations remain very high.</p> <p>With such a favourable outlook, it could well be that the record for consumer confidence could be breached a few more times in 2018.

                "bodyText":"Time for a quick recap of the main events from the first day of Davos: Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has challenged business leaders and politicians to end gender inequality and tackle unacceptable and systemic sexual harassment. You can watch a clip here. Trudeau also announced that the ten members of the trans-pacific partnership have agreed to extend their agreement. Oxfam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Winnie Byanyima has also hailed campaigners against sexual harrassment, saying they have helped people worldwide. Davos also heard that parents need to teach their sons not to hit women, rather than simply how to hit baseballs. India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Narendra Modi has warned that globalisation is under threat, and also cited climate change and terrorism as key threats to the global economy. The mood at Davos has been optimistic, although bank bosses have warned against complacency. An MIT economics professor has predicted that Facebook will barely exist in 20 years. Australian actor Cate Blanchett has criticised politicians for pandering to anti-refugee sentiment, instead of helping the millions of people displaced worldwide. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW A positive start following news that the US government shutdown had been resolved, for the moment at least, soon faded, leaving European markets a mixed bag by the close. Sterling rose above $1.40 to a new post-Brexit vote high, partly due to hopes that a successful trade deal can be negotiated, but also thanks to continuing weakness in the dollar. The US currency has been under pressure on worries that the Trump tax cuts would increase the already hefty US national debt. And the dollar has become less attractive as other central banks begin edging up interest rates and gradually removing their long standing stimulus programmes. And despite a resolution to the government shutdown, the problem has only been postponed until early next month. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Renewed dollar weakness is the revival of yet another familiar friend from 2017. Post-shutdown euphoria has been replaced by a weary acceptance that we will probably have to do this all over again in just over two weeks. Why buy the greenback, when so many other economies can show solid growth without the government disruption so prevalent in the US at the moment? So with the stronger pound, the FTSE 100 came off its best levels. But Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax hovered around record levels, following upbeat consumer confidence figures and signs that a coalition government could be moving closer. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fluctuated between positive and negative, but Nasdaq was lifted by the positive Netflix update. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 16.39 points or 0.21% at 7731.83 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.71% to 13,559.60 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.12% at 5535.26 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.22% to 23,836.60 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.24% at 10,609.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.62% to 872.00 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 28 points or 0.11%. NF Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of Justin Trudeau laying down the law on sexual harassment: Justin Trudeau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech has caused quite a stir, with its trenchant criticism of greedy, uncaring businesses and gender inequality. Adam Parsons of the BBC thinks it was a punchy speech: John Stackhouse of Royal Bank of Canada says Trudeau is shaking up the idea of what \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDavos Man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 acts like: Ian Bremmer says Trudeau showed how gender equality is an important economic issue: But Jamie Drummond of campaigning group One isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced Trudeau will deliver: Justin Trudeau also made an important point about trade. He tells Davos that Canada is trying to convince U.S. President Donald Trump that the NAFTA trade agreement was in the interest of the United States as well as other countries. Trudeau says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working very hard to make sure that our neighbour to the south recognizes how good NAFTA is and that it has benefited not just our economy but his economy and the world economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Justin Trudeau moves onto another vital issue - campaigns such as #MeToo and Time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Up. The Canadian PM declares: These movements show us we must have a critical discussion on women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rights, equality and the power dynamics of gender. Sexual harassment in business and in government is a systemic problem and it is unacceptable. As leaders, we must recognise and act to truly show that time is up. Justin Trudeau now urges business chiefs at Davos to help fight inequality by hiring, promoting and retaining more women. Getting more women into the workforce isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just the right thing to do, or the nice thing to do, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the smart thing to do, he tells the World Economic Forum, Studies show it can provide a significant economic boost. Firms need to address gender pay, and he warns that many firms aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t doing as well as they think. Just paying men and women the same doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go far enough, unless you also tackle the barriers faced by female workers. Women do more part-time work, and more unpaid work than men. Parental leave and childcare policies must be reexamined, Trudeau tells WEF. Firms should implement policies to improve gender balance. He also reminds us that he introduced Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first gender-balanced cabinet, and the performance of those female ministers has proved the naysayers wrong. Justin Trudeau has warned that businesses and politicians are failing to help their workers and citizens in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rapidly changing world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. People have been taken advantage of, losing their jobs, the Canadian PM warns: Governments and corporations, we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t done enough to address this. He also blasts corporate greed, saying: Too many corporations have single-mindedly put the pursuit of profit ahead of the well-being of workers. The gap between the rich and the poor is staggering, Trudeau points out, adding All the while, companies avoid taxes and boast record profits with one hand while slashing benefits with the other. Our priority must be the people who are struggling the most, and who will never get to Davos, Trudeau says. And he warns that if we operate on the basis of business as usual, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the system will break down and we will all fail.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau is now speaking to Davos. He begins by thanking the seven all-female co-chairs for organising this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s WEF. He then makes an important announcement: The 10 remaining members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership have concluded a new agreement that will maintain their alliance. The agreement reached today in Tokyo is the right deal, Trudeau insists. It will create growth, prosperity, and middle class jobs in Canada today and for generations. This is significant, as Donald Trump pulled the US out of the TPP. In an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau will give a special address to the World Economic Forum. As a liberal, feminist leader, Trudeau is a Davos favourite. But that shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean he gets a free pass. Jamie Drummond, executive director of the development group One, says that Trudeau isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually delivering on pledges to make the world a better place. As Drummond puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so exasperating that prime minister Justin Trudeau will make another great speech today while the facts point in a shocking direction. Smart aid rates under Trudeau are lower than under his conservative predecessor Stephen Harper, the money he loudly promised would be new to fight aids, TB and malaria was in fact not new, and his feminist foreign policy is not backed by new funds. This can and must change now. Not in 2020, or some vague theoretical far-off point after the next election. Drummond urges WEF delegates to put Trudeau under pressure to deliver. This week in Davos he must be asked when and by specifically how much he will increase funding for girls education and women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic empowerment; and please, he must do it this year. If we want him be a great leader on these issues, we must withhold praise until we see the quality of his action not just his delightful adverbs. Trust Trudeau - but verify. And if Davos doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pressure leaders like Trudeau to be the best they can be, or hold them accountable, this gathering is a self-defeating backslapping waste of time the world doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As we reported this morning, Drummond is threatening not to come back to Davos unless this annual shindig starts delivering the goods. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is among the world leaders who have lined up to get to Davos, reports Helena Smith from Athens: Tsipras, who arrived only hours after Athens wrapped up a third bailout compliance review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c edging ever closer to ending dependence on international bailout loans when the programme expires this summer - is meeting investors also gathered in Davos. The leftist\u00e2\u20ac\u201cled government, in an about\u00e2\u20ac\u201cturn of its previous antagonism, is now keen to attract foreign capital as it prepares the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s return to capital markets. This afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting is much in the vein of luring investors to fund projects in Greece with an eye to slashing unemployment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at 21% still the highest in the EU and by far the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest social ill. Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup meeting saw euro area finance ministers agreeing to disburse \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.7bn to the debt -stricken nation in two instalments. The first chunk of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.7bn will be released in February, once outstanding reforms are implemented, to cover debt servicing needs, arrears and creation of a cash buffer that will support Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s return to markets. Talks on debt relief are expected to begin soon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c along with a fourth compliance review which included 88 creditor-mandates reforms being taken by June. Sounding a note of optimism, EU Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said the single currency bloc should prepare for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a successful conclusion, which means Greece being back as a normal member of the eurozone and the final signal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the end of the Greek crisis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After the better than expected German consumer confidence figures, there is more positive news from Europe. Eurozone consumer confidence rose from 0.5 points in December to 1.3 points in January, according to the European Commission. This was well above forecasts of a figure of 0.6. In the wide European Union, confidence jumped 1 point to 0.4 points. ING economist Bert Colijn said: With inflation still low, job growth surprising on the upside, house prices increasing and growth forecasts adjusted upwards, there is a lot to like for consumers and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evident. The current mood among consumers is nothing short of ecstatic and current levels of confidence are generally associated with further acceleration in household consumption growth. Uncertainty about possible Eurozone reform, Italian elections and the success of the German coalition negotiations clearly take a backseat to improved economic factors. Over the past few months, consumer confidence improved most notably because of a much more positive view on the general economic situation, modest improvements in assessments of the financial situation and increased amounts of current and expected major purchases. This indicates that optimism and stronger consumption are going hand in hand, spurring the household consumption component of GDP growth. While unemployment expectations have become slightly less favourable over the last months of 2017, this is actually at odds with businesses indicating that hiring expectations remain very high. With such a favourable outlook, it could well be that the record for consumer confidence could be breached a few more times in 2018. This, in turn, confirms the rosy short-term picture for Eurozone growth. NF Dacher Keltner, Professor of Psychology from the University of California, is also on the sexual harassment panel alongside Winnie Byanyima. He says: Men tend to take more risks, they tend to be a lot more aggressive, and they tend to sexualise thing. So if you give a man power, those default tendencies will be expressed. Women tend to be more collaborative, co-operative, empathetic. You give them power, studies show it will amplify those pro-social tendencies. Lisa Sherman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Advertising Council, says parents can do more to help boys treat women with respect. You teach your son how to hit a baseball, how to hit a jump shot, how to hit the net. But we should really be talking to them about who not to hit, and why. Peggy Johnson, executive Vice-President for Business Development at Microsoft, says the younger generation are helping to force change. She explains that her daughter recently started her career, and told her that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhen there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an inappropriate joke at work, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t laugh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. I thought back and thought, when I was her age I always laughed, says Johnson. My daughter said to me that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d learned not to laugh at these jokes from me, but she actually learned it from me in my 50s, not my 20s. Winnie Byanyima, the executive director of Oxfam International, is speaking powerfully about sexual exploitation against women around the globe. All the women in the world should be grateful to American women for taking a stand, and saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Me Too\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Byanyima says, referring to the campaign that spread around the globe after the Harvey Weinstein scandal. It has brought new attention to a problem that is deep. Women in the developing world are at the bottom of the supply chain of big business. Oxfam hears stories of their lives, Byanyima explains, such as hotel housekeepers. All of them told us that they had faced sexual harassment or knew someone who had faced sexual harassment. It goes on with impunity. Domestic workers globally suffer abuse, she continues, and some of them are like slaves in the homes where they work. Only a few countries have ratified a new convention for domestic workers. It is not an accident that women are abused sexually at work or at home. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to the social norms that are there to justify their economic exploitation. That is why it is so important to tackle economic inequality, as this will also help tackle violence against women. Byanyima says there are three ways to tackle this problem: Remove all the laws that discriminate against women in the economy Tackle the social norms that justify sexual exploitation. Businesses have an important role to play here - they can use their factories, supply chains, advertising. Unilever are doing it, so others can too. Bring women into every level of decision-making and leadership, so they can drive change. In the wake of the resolution to the US government shutdown, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was initially expected to open higher. But when trading began the Dow dipped 27 points or 0.1%, with investors moving on to worry about the impact of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move to impose steep import tariffs, including possible retaliation. South Korea and China both protested at the duties on washing machines and solar panels. The S&amp;P 500 however edged up 0.03% and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.23%. The uncertainty has taken some of the shine off European shares, with the FTSE 100 now up just 0.11% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac virtually unchanged. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is now up 0.76%, off its best levels. NF David Autor, Ford Professor of Economics at MIT, has predicted that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s giant tech companies - such as Facebook - will suffer the face of previous dominant companies. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on a panel asking \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccan we live with monopolies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Autor explains that we currently live in an environment of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwinner takes most\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 markets, where having a small edge over your competitor gives you a massive advantage. So firms like Amazon and Facebook are growing organically (people are on Facebook because their friends are on Facebook), but that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that this growth is healthy. Or sustainable, in the long run. We did have these monopolies in the past, Autor points out, citing the US railroads, and AT&amp;T which was broken up by regulators. Also, companies which appear indomitable can fade pretty fast, he says - and then makes a bold prediction: I would guess that Facebook will be almost non-existent 20 years from now. Autor is also critical of the US model where employees are not treated as stakeholders (unlike shareholders). This situation has created a level of inequality that has led to political upheaval, he says. Elsewhere in Davos, the head of the Red Cross has warned that fresh humanitarian crises could break out this year. Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, says there are a lot of fragile situations that could develop into \u00e2\u20ac\u0153full-fledged\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd conflicts (as we saw with the Rohingya crisis in 2017). Maurer says there are plenty of places on the brink of war, violence and disruption. He cites Southern Philippines (which is under martial law), Myanmar, Afghanistan, the Middle East, and large parts of Africa as places where the Red Cross sees fragility - but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know which one will blow up in our face\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So what can Davos do about it? Top business leaders have the skills and resources to help businesses in those fragile areas, and help them tipping into conflict. Maurer also warns that humanitarian organisations need more money: In 2018 we face a big gap between the needs of people and the capacity of the international system as a whole to respond. The gap can only be bridged by more and better finance. Ultimately, Blanchett says, we must remember we are all citizens, and stand up for what we believe in. Cate Blanchett is close to tears, as she talks about one refugee family she met in Jordan. They had fled conflict with five of their children, being shot at by all sides. Eventually, the father had to choose between carrying his suitcases and carrying his children (he chose the children). No-one should be put in that position, she says. Q: Aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t politicians taking a hard line on refugees because they are reacting to the concerns of their populations? Cate Blanchett argues that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re actually reacting to populist media and the news cycle. We are at a fork in the road, she says. We try to teach our children to be compassionate, to be tolerant, to accept diversity, to share. But all the structures that are around them are not doing the same, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a schizophrenic world they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re living in. And taking a swing at populist politicians, she says she don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand how turning people in a boat back became an election winner. Australian actor Cate Blanchett is talking about the refugee crisis now (yesterday she was handed a WEF award for her work on this issue). She explains how she went backpacking through Europe in her youth, which opened her eyes to economic inequality. I was staying in youth hostels that were more like Turkish prisons, She explains, seeing people who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have anywhere else to go Q: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a lot of criticism of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy to refugees.... Blanchett says she was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbewildered\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to see the generous, openhearted, multi-cultural Australia she grew up in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flouting the UN humans rights convention\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I was very distressed that Australia was reverting back to practices that made us a fortress again. This drove Blanchett to become a goodwill ambassador to UNHCR I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shameful. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so much misinformation about refugees. They are forced to flee, and then they are vilified in the media. Blanchett says the misinformation about refugees is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very distressing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t connect with the actual people she has met. There are 65 million displaced people in the world, 22 million are refugees, half are women and children. But just 1% have been resettled in advanced developed economies. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the developing world that is shouldering the deep burden of refugees. She cites the Lebanon, where a quarter of the population are now refugees. Blanchett also criticises the way refugees are reported in the media: People are told this narrative that these people, who have so much to offer, are going to be a burden on us or become a terrorist threat. Q: But have some people in developing economies been encouraged to travel to countries such as Germany, because they hoped to be given asylum? Should we not talk about it, Blanchett replies rhetorically. The problem is not going to go away. These are not terrorists. These are innocent people, who want to return home. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also calling for more burden-sharing between countries, to help address the refugee crisis. The problem with all this optimism at Davos is that business leaders, economists and politicians have a nasty habit of missing impending disaster. WEF veterans point out that the mood is often particularly upbeat shortly before a crisis. Barclays CEO Jes Staley summed it up this morning, on the financial crisis session when he said Davos feels \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a little bit like 2006 when we were all talking whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve solved the riddle of economic crises.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Carlyle Group David Rubenstein agreed, saying: Generally, when people are happy and confident, something wrong happens. Back with the UK public finances, and a Treasury spokesperson said: We have made great progress in reducing the deficit by three quarters since 2010, but government debt is still far too high. Our balanced approach to government spending is getting debt falling, while investing in key public services and keeping taxes low. And the Office for Budget Responsibility said: It appears that the underlying improvement in borrowing so far this year is a little faster than would be consistent with our November forecast. NF Christoph Franz, the chairman of Roche, agrees that spirits are high at Davos this year - and with good reason. Speaking to CNBC, Frans argues that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchealthy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economic growth is boosting optimism among top execs. Basically, I have been here for more than ten years, I share your perspective, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very positive mood right now among business leaders here in Davos, and I think the reason is, we see a growth perspective in, not only some specific countries, but on a global scale, and the growth is achieving numbers which we have seen only before 2007. So, the economy is taking up, and for the time being, it is growth which has been created by a lot of investment. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers continue to be optimistic about business prospects and exports, but are increasingly worried about skills shortages. The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest industrial trends survey for the three months to January showed 27% of firms were more optimistic about the general business situation that three months ago, while 14% were less optimistic. The balance of +13% is up from -11% in the previous quarter. Growth in manufacturing output and domestic and export orders all picked up, compared with the previous three-month period, although the monthly order book figure showed a fall from +17 in December to +14 in January. And the number of firms saying a lack of skilled labour was likely to limit output over the next three months was the highest for more than four decades. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good to see manufacturing going from strength-to-strength with growth up and the buoyant global economy boosting export orders. But the past depreciation in Sterling continues to leave its mark on firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 costs and margins. With expectations for factory gate price inflation at their highest in 30 years, the pressure on consumer prices looks set to persist. Capacity pressures are ramping up and skill shortages are a big concern, underlining the importance of establishing a future immigration system that provides companies with access to talent and labour. The building blocks of a new system that meets economic needs and public concerns must start with scrapping the net migration target, which has never been fit-for-purpose. NF Yup. Modi wraps up his speech by identifying three priorities: The world economy must be more inclusive Policymakers must remain committed to a rules-based world order Reforming the major institutions of the world, connected to politics, the economy and securtry He talks about the Indian soldiers who died in world wars in the 20th century, to help create \u00e2\u20ac\u0153peace and humanity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. India can be a humanising and harmonising force in an uncertain world, Modi promises, citing Indian prayers and poetry which advocates a free and peaceful world. Together we can create a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcheaven of future\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, he promises, in a somewhat gushing conclusion. Alas, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not taking any questions. On climate change, Modi says India is making big progress towards hitting its goals for renewable energy. Modi says India will achieve strong growth over the next few years. Kenneth Roth of Human Rights Watch suggests Modi isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t living up to the glowing ideals he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preaching today: (remember, Modi was once banned from visiting the US following claims he had supported Hindu extremists during Hindu-Muslim riots. He was later cleared by the Indian Supreme Court). Modi is now encouraging businesses to invest in India, citing the hundreds of laws and regulations which have been stripped out to make te economy more competitive. Instead of red tape, we offer you a red carpet, he jokes. Democracy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just a political system, says Modi - it is a life view and a lifestyle. He cites India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proud democracy and diversity, declaring: For a society with diverse religions, cultures, languages, attires and cuisines, democracy is not just a political system but a way of living: Thirdly, the world is threatened by the rising attacks on globalisation, says Modi. We must accept that globalisation is slowly losing its lustre, he says. And he pits some of the blame on the institutions created after world war 2, such as the United Nations. Do the structures and action plans of these organisations match the aspirations and dreams of mankind, Modi asks rhetorically. Then he takes aim at protectionism, saying: Forces of protectionism are raising their heads against globalisation. They want to reverse its flow. The world risks new tariff and non-tariff barriers, he continues, cautioning that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations have come to a kind of standstill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The second major threat is terrorism, Modi continues. He says there is an artificial distinction between \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood and bad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 terrorism, and a worrying radicalism of young people. The world has moved from needs-based to greed-based consumption, says Modi seriously. This does not live up to the ideals of Gandhi, or the teaching of Buddha. Modi cites climate change as a major threat. Glaciers are melting, islands are disappearing under the sea, and in Davos we have the worst snow in 20 years, he says. And he criticises the leaders of advanced economies for not showing more solidarity Everyone talks about reducing climate emissions, but there are very few countries who back their words with their resources to help developing countries to adopt appropriate technology. Very few of them come forward to help. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction to Modi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for co-operation to build a better future, rather than descending into isolationism. Narendra Modi now turns to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fractures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the global economy, citing unemployment, inequality, lack of opportunities. Some important questions come to mind, which require answers, he says. Is our global order widening these fault lines, increasing these differences, and giving preference to isolationism over harmony and conflict over co-operation, he asks, adding: What paths can we follow, to eliminate rifts and differences. How can we realise the dream of a beautiful shared future. Modi is speaking in Hindi, incidentally, so the audience are getting a realtime translation. Today, data is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest asset, Modi declares. We are accumulating mountains and mountains of data, he continues. There is now a race to control data, because it is believes that whoever is able to control the data can dominate the world. Narendra Modi takes the stage, to another round of applause. He begins with a history lesson. The last time an Indian PM was at Davos was in 1997, when H. D. Deve Gowda visited. Back then, India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP was $400bn - it is now six times larger. WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theme in 1997 was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuilding the networked society\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Today, it is not just a networked society. We are living in the world of big data, artificial intelligence and robots. Back in 1997, Modi continues the eurozone didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist, the Asian financial crisis wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected, and there was no sign that Brexit might happen. Very few people had heard of Osama Bin Laden, and Harry Potter was also an unknown name. Back then, Google didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist, a web search for Amazon would bring up a river or jungle, and tweeting was done by birds, Modi declares. Davos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder, Klaus Schwab, is introducing Narendra Modi now. Globally we are moving to a multipolar, and multi-conceptual world, says Schwab. In a seemingly fractured world, India presents a bright image of optimism, he adds. It also presents an investment opportunity (something that business leaders at Davos will be interested in) There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a buzz on the floor of the World Economic Forum as India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister Narendra Modi prepares to give the opening speech. Modi is a big draw - the main hall is filling up fast with delegates keen to hear his words. The speech should be streamed live here: Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit says the mood at Davos is very different this year than in 2017. He tells us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a lot more optimistic and the optimism is broad based. Last year the Americans were upbeat but the Europeans were gloomy. A year ago the feeling was that politics was going to overwhelm economics but the opposite has happened. An improving economy may make populism less compelling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Behravesh says that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival in the White House a year ago led to an increase in business confidence. Corporate America was not keen on Barack Obama, he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business finally got a president it thought was business friendly and the reduction in regulation has been received well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Business also likes the package of tax cuts Trump finally pushed through Congress at the end of 2017 and which are weighted in favour of the well off and corporations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our estimate is that the tax cuts will add 0.3 percentage points to growth in 2018, 2019 and 2020\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Behravesh says. There are two risks, he adds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US and global economy may be running too hot. We think unemployment in the US will go as low as 3.5%, which is well below estimates of full employment. The question is how soon wage inflation and price inflation picks up. If inflation surprises on the upside we could see the Federal Reserve and other central banks step on the brakes a lot harder. The stock market could take a hit and that would be bad.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The other risk is that Trump starts making good on his protectionist threats. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So far his bark has been worse then his bite, Behravesh says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But I think China is going to come under a lot of pressure from the US this year. The US is very unhappy about the China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unwillingness to toe the line on intellectual property.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in Germany, consumer confidence remains strong. The ZEW institute economic sentiment index came in at 20.4 points in January, up from 17.4 the previous month and better than the forecasts of a reading of 17.8. And this came amid uncertainty over the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political future and before the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement to take another step towards a coalition government. The index remains slightly below the long-term average of 23.7 points, but it is still a positive outcome. Meanwhile the current conditions index rose from 89.3 points o 95.2. ZEW president professor Achim Wambach said: The latest survey results reveal an optimistic outlook for the German economy in the first six months of 2018. With 95.2 out of 100 points, this is the most positive assessment of the current economic situation since the introduction of the survey in December 1991. Private consumption, which was the most important driver of economic growth in 2017, is likely to continue to stimulate growth in the coming six months according to the survey participants. The assessment of the global economic environment in Europe and the USA is also much more favourable than it was at the end of 2017. NF Despite the warnings from Davos, investors are pushing markets higher again this morning. There is renewed confidence following the IMF raising its growth forecasts on Monday (albeit not for the UK), as well as relief that the US government shutdown has been resolved, at least for another couple of weeks. Meanwhile there were no surprises from the Bank of Japan, which recently unnerved markets by reducing its monthly bond buying programme by $10bn. This time it left monetary policy unchanged. So the FTSE 100 is up 0.31%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.11% and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 0.86% better and at new highs. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taken a while for the DAX to join in with the all-time high hitting performances of the FTSE and the Dow Jones seen in 2018. However, with German coalition talks steadily moving along, a stop-gap deal to end the US government shutdown, and a subsequent pullback from the euro against the dollar, the bourse seems ready to bulge, shooting up by 130 points to tease a 13600 record peak. In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which jumped 142 points or 0.55% after the news of the impasse over the government shutdown had been resolved, is expected to open 84 points higher. Fiona Cincotta at City Index said: The FTSE bounced on the open this morning, following a record session in the US overnight. The Dow surged over 140 points, whilst the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq tagged on 0.8% and 1% respectively, all hitting unchartered territory. The rally took place after the Democrats and the Republicans passed the funding bill to end the US government shut down, 72 hours after it started. NF Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit came in much better than expected, giving a boost to chancellor Philip Hammond. Thanks to an unusually large credit from the European Union and the strongest VAT receipts on record, public sector net borrowing fell from \u00c2\u00a38.25bn in November to \u00c2\u00a32.6bn last month. This was well below analyst forecasts of a figure of around \u00c2\u00a35bn. There was a \u00c2\u00a31.2bn credit from the EU related to the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s smaller than expected overall budget and improved economic performance. With the UK economy holding up despite Brexit vote fears, VAT receipts rose by an annual 4.8% to a record \u00c2\u00a312.3bn. Total public borrowing since last April is now \u00c2\u00a350bn, 12% less than in the same period in 2016 and leaving Hammond on track to meet his full year target of \u00c2\u00a349.9bn by the end of March. NF More highlights from the Davos talk about financial risks: Anne Richards, chief executive of M&amp;G Investments, fears that a devastating IT crash could cause the next financial crisis. She tells an audience in Davos that policymakers risk ignoring the threat posed by investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reliance on technology, and the damage that could be caused if key systems go down. Richards says she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buy the argument that a geopolitical crisis will bring the bull market crashing down. After all, markets handle geopolitical events all the time. Instead, she fears that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153systemic risk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd posed by new technology, and the cloud, could provoke an event that changes the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153animal spirits\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the markets today. Richards warns: We all have businesses that are absolutely reliant on a very small number of people who provide the pipes that we put our business though. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a technology thing out there that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all somewhat blind to. It would be interesting to think how markets would react if none of us could trade for one, or two or three days\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd David Rubenstein, co-executive chairman of The Carlyle Group, is also on the panel. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more worried about political threats - predicting that if there is a geopolitical crisis, markets will be hurt and firms will pull back from capital investment. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Economic Forum is being led by an all-female group of co-chairs. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re giving a press conference now: Erna Solberg, prime minister of Norway, is speaking now - calling for a new crackdown on illegal finance and corruption. Solberg says this is fuelling terrorism and security threats, and making it harder for emerging economies to develop their economies. She suggests a MeToo campaign to fight corruption is needed: We need to see who is taking money, who is bribing others, and show that this is unacceptable in all our societies. Solberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other priority is gender equality -- she warns that women are still treated unfairly in many economies. The barriers to women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s participation [in the labour market] is still large in many societies - it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make sense economically or politically. Can Emmanuel Macron really succeed where his predecessors failed, and reform the French economy? Tidjane Thiam, the boss of Credit Suisse, says the answer is a resounding yes. Speaking on a panel about \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglobal markets in a fractured world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Thaim says Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s programme of labour market reforms would have led to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certain electoral defeat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 20 years ago - not last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s triumph against Marine Le Pen. As Thiam puts it: Macron only got elected because the French public, the French nation, decided to change. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how it works in a democracy. Political scientist Ian Bremmer agrees that market sentiment and political reality have got out of whack.... The usual high security measures are in place in Davos this morning. Armed guards prevent any non-delegates getting into WEF; even if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re accredited, you have to negotiate airport-style security before you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re actually allowed in. The snowdrifts have also provided a new reason to ban protests in Davos this week. Davos officials say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the extremely tight space situation due to the enormous amount of new snow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave any space for a rally.... UBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, Axel Weber, has warned that sentiment in the market is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too buoyant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Speaking on CNBC this morning, Weber said there was a worrying gap between investor optimism and the actual state of the economy. Investors are taking risks, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting adequate compensation for those risks. At some time, if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got to stop it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got to stop. He added that the markets could be in a more difficult position by the time of Davos 2019.... Justin Trudeau says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be batting for middle-class Canadians in Davos this week. His speech this afternoon is also expected to cover corporate responsibility and the role of women in a changing world. Davos regular Jamie Drummond says he may not come back, unless this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting makes real progress towards tackling inequality. Drummond is the executive director of the development group One, which he co-founded with the rock star Bono. In a blog, Drummond said he had been stung by the accusation that he had spent so long hobnobbing with the 1% that he was becoming a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Davos man.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A feminist activist, and someone I deeply respect, recently commented that I was at risk of becoming that awful thing: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dca Davos Man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Definitions vary but this phrase generally refers to a male who goes to places like Davos and inhabits an elite, unaccountable bubble while determining the fates of those without access to it. The comment cut deep. It forced me to question any complicity I might have in a system I have tried so hard to change. So I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m putting my inner Davos Man on notice, and making this commitment: this will be my last World Economic Forum unless this one helps deliver on three crucial areas in the fight against extreme poverty and gender inequality. Those areas are the global education emergency; women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic empowerment; and ambitious financing to back Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge youth boom.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Philip Jennings, head of the global union UNI, has been one of the strongest voices for labour at Davos for many a year but 2018 will be his last meeting before retiring in the summer. Speaking to the Guardian, Jennings said the current business model built on the principle of shareholder value was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not fit for purpose\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that the opportunity provided by the financial crisis of a decade ago to build a more inclusive economy has been squandered. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald Trump is Mr Shareholder value\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Jennings said, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He is exhibit A of the fractured world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Jennings said a test for the business leaders in Davos talking about the problems of global inequality was whether they recognised trade unions and collective bargaining at their firms. And he predicted a backlash against three of the new titans of the global economy: Amazon, Facebook and Google. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These companies were once seen as angelic, seen as our saviours\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Jennings said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the big three has such market influence and power that the world has to wake up and start thinking about the need for anti-trust action. One of the fractures in the global economy is the power of the new monopolies and the danger it represents\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The huge snowfalls in Davos recently mean the ski resort is now facing a Level 5 avalanche risk - the highest rating. Some homes have reportedly been evacuated, due to fears that the snow is too unstable. There has already been big delays getting up the mountain (someone I met last night spent six hours crawling here from Zurich), leading to plenty of chuntering among delegates. Davos has had an early wake-up call. PR chief Richard Edelman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual trust index shows that Americans have become much less trusting of politicians, business chiefs and the media over the last year. He says: No country saw steeper declines than the United States, with a 37-point aggregate drop in trust across all institutions. At the opposite end of the spectrum, China experienced a 27-point gain, more than any other country. The survey shows that people are more worried about the rise of disinformation -- and finding it hard to separate truth from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 So, genuine voices of expertise are now regaining credibility. Edelman explains: Journalists have risen 12 points, and CEOs recorded a seven-percentage point gain, since 2017. Good morning from Davos! World leaders, business chiefs, trade unions, the heads of charities and NGOs, celebrities and the media are gathering in this small ski resort to discuss the state of the world, and how to improve it. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s WEF is taking place amid the biggest snowfalls in many years. This is already leading to inequality on the streets of Davos: workers are furiously shovelling drifts aside and driving snowploughs as the global elite queue bumper-to-bumper to reach the WEF congress centre and the exclusive hotels and converted shops where events are taking place. Last night, Pope Francis set the mood by issuing a stern warning not to remain silent in the face of economic inequality and injustice. In a message read to the Davos attendees, the Pope warned not to allow people to be used as cogs in a machine and then chucked aside. He declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153New actors are emerging, as well as new economic competition and regional trade agreements. Even the most recent technologies are transforming economic models and the globalized world itself, which, conditioned by private interests and an ambition for profit at all costs, seem to favour further fragmentation and individualism, rather than to facilitate approaches that are more inclusive,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Even Sir Elton John weighed in, describing inequality in the world today as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdisgraceful\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (as we covered in last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blog). Two world leaders will address Davos today, with different priorities. Narendra Modi, who gives the opening speech, is the first Indian prime minister to visit WEF in 20 years. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on a big push to attract more business to his country, billing India as a key growth engine for the global economy. India have sent a large delegation to Davos this year - many of whom found themselves caught up in the transport chaos yesterday. Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Justin Trudeau is expected to pitch at business leaders. But his speech, this afternoon, may also cover weightier issues such as women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s empowerment. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loads of other stuff coming up too, including debates on the financial markets, capitalism, and sexual harassment. The agenda: 9.30am Davos (8.30am GMT): Opening press conference by the Davos co-chairs 9.45am Davos (8.45am GMT): Debate: Are we heading for a new financial crisis? 11.15am Davos (10.15am GMT): Indian PM Narendra Modi gives the opening plenary speech 2pm Davos (1pm GMT): Actor Cate Blanchett speaks about the global refugee crisis 3pm Davos (2pm GMT): Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan talks about women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s empowerment in India. 3.30pm Davos (2.30pm GMT): Debate on gender, power and sexual harassment 5pm Davos (4pm GMT): Debate on capitalism: 5.30pm Davos (4.30pm GMT): Canadian PM Justin Trudeau gives a special address",

Sustainable development, health, human rights - these can never be renounced, and we have to spell them out and regulate them in a common manner.</p> <p>I hope private sector will come to our country to create jobs.. but I have to explain to people [globalisation] is good for them. Otherwise there will be nationalists, extremism. </p> <p>We need to establish a new global contract, unless everyone understands they have a part to play it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work.</p> <p>The new global contract has three duties: the right to invest, share and protect.</p> <p>[On investment} one area we are not doing enough in is education, we have 750m adults who do not have basic literacy skills, we have to invest in education, the education of girls in particular. If we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t invest there will be not equality. It is important all the countries here commit to this [investment in education globally].</p> <p>The duty to share: there is a crisis of contemporary capitalism. It has become a capitalism of superstars, spreading of value added is not equitable. We have to establish mechanisms to share value added more equitably... We also need to speak about gender equality. In France we are launching initiatives [for more visibility], I welcome the commitments from Justin Trudeau.</p> <p>If we want to share value better, we need a more co-ordinated tax approach at a global level. There should not be a race to the bottom. We need a strategy that avoids the maximisation strategies of some companies. It is a moral issue.</p> <p>We need to renounce unbridled tax optimisation. Plus how can you have a tax on digital activities. We all want these big international companies in their country, but there is an unfair model [if they pay low taxes when national companies do].</p> <p>Disruption from digital businesses will destroy millions of jobs, and if those companies do not help finance retraining of people affected, how can I explain that [to those people]</p> <p>I am in favour of IMF being given mandate to survey whole financial system, especially those areas which escape regulation. Cryptocurrencies, shadow banking etc, are not being looked at by IMF, so we have to have a discussion.</p> <p>At what point are we going to stop innovation. To say artificial intelligence, this is a red line. We need to have a framework of international co-operation to promote technology, but also to decide principles which should be decided by government not private companies.</p> <p>Finally, protection, against terrorism, and financial protection. Need government and international co-operation for this. We need to have a discussion in G20, that there must be a monitoring of all those bodies which can promote social cohesion. </p> <p>In terms of climate protection, we have committed to many things but not up to the commitments. China has done an enormous amount of work here. India is also very important.</p> <p>But we now need to follow through and respect Paris agreement. Need a floor price for CO2, if not we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be credible.</p> <p>China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Silk Road has to be a green road.</p> <p>I hope by 2020 we will have an environmental pact which is legally binding.</p> <p>The private sector must also live up to its commitments.</p> <p>Finally it is the financial system which has to accompany this with green financing.

We need less arms and more brains. People have to be trained in an efficient way. We began to reform our education system, we need better access to university.</p> <p>We invest 5% of GDP in education, we will reform apprenticeships. We will invest \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn in education and retraining over five years.</p> <p>We will make innovation the centrepiece of the economy. Reform fiscal mechanisms, create a new \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10bn fund for disruptive technologies.</p> <p>The second pillar of this reform is investment and capital. We need more equity to finance risk and big innovations. We passed reforms to reallocate our savings in this direction. By decreasing corporate taxes, big reform on capital gain.</p> <p>We have reinforced France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attractiveness.</p> <p>The third pillar is acceleration and flexibility. You need more flexible structures and rules to help different companies to change business model and readapt.</p> <p>The idea is to realign France on Germany and northern Europe. Rules much more adapted to business environment, that is a big change and it makes us much more competitive.</p> <p>Fourth pillar - make France a model in fight against climate change. That is a huge advantage in terms of attractiveness and competitiveness. Talent will come where it is good to live. We can create a lot of jobs with such a strategy. We passed reforms for this green strategy. Close coal fired power stations by 2021 (Applause).</p> <p>Fifth pillar of domestic strategy is cultural change. A preference for red tape cuts and cutting complexities. We simplify and streamline processes, and simplify bureaucracy. During last six months we reduced like crazy the number of regulations.</p> <p>We have to guarantee stability for people. We passed all these measures, voted these five year strategy on taxes. Visibility is the strategy and will not change, that is my commitment.</p> <p>It is also about risk. In France it was forbidden to fail, and forbidden to succeed. Now it should be more easy to fail, take risk, but allow people to come back and try something else. When you take risk, you need reward, and you need to reduce the cost of failure.</p> <p>France is a nation of entrepreneures, ao it was a mistake in France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a68b72de4b0473d0bc0fb0a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T16:48:48.361Z\">4.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We have taken action but let us not be naive.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound went on a tear this Wednesday, rocketing higher against the euro and dollar to mark the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best session for more than a month.</p> <p>Cable shot up a remarkable 1.6% as the day progressed, clearing not only $1.41 but $1.42 in one fell swoop. Though the UK jobs report was decent, the highlight being another minor fall in unemployment, the thrust of cable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth is coming from the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bruised and battered start to 2018.</p> <p>Despite ostensibly having the end of the US government shutdown to cheer about the dollar found little room for positivity this Wednesday, almost solely due to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

The Dow Jones was overjoyed at the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest defeat, jumping 160 points to soar to a brand spanking new record peak of 26375. The European markets, on the other hand, shrank in the face of the pound and the euro.</p> <p>With sterling not only destroying the dollar but rising 0.8% against the euro the FTSE took the brunt of the blows, falling to a 3 week low after dropping 0.7%.

The November figure was revised down from 5.81m to 5.7m units. The December fall came after three months of gains, and the National Association of Realtors attributed the decline to a shortage of houses at the lower end of the market.</p> <p>But for the year as a whole, sales rose 1.1% making it the best performance in eleven years. NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Existing sales concluded the year on a softer note, but they were guided higher these last 12 months by a multi-year streak of exceptional job growth, which ignited buyer demand. At the same time, market conditions were far from perfect. New listings struggled to keep up with what was sold very quickly, and buying became less affordable in a large swath of the country.

Apart from the weak dollar, one of the reasons for the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength at the moment is the prospect of further UK interest rate rises, hence a 0.7% gain against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1464. The stronger than expected employment and wage growth numbers only add to that expectation.</p> <p>Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the Bank of England had initially responded to the risks to demand from the Brexit vote by easing its policy in August 2016, it became increasingly data dependent over the course of 2017, eventually hiking its main policy rate by 25bp in November \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first hike in a decade.</p> <p>This came as a bit of a surprise for markets that seemed to be focusing more on downside risks to demand from Brexit than the signs of growing underlying inflationary pressure.</p> <p>According to market pricing, the BoE is set to hike the bank rate once again towards the end of the year. In our view, this seems still seems inconsistent with the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data dependant approach and outlook for GDP and wage growth. Economic growth is likely to remain robust, partly helped by the strong global backdrop. Meanwhile, the BoE expects the unemployment rate to remain below its estimate of full employment (4.5% unemployment) throughout its forecast. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the BoE to justify its ultra-accommodative policy stance.</p> <p>We therefore look for two hikes in the Bank Rate in 2018, one in Q2 and one in Q4, followed by one in Q3 2019. Even with a modest continued tightening in which the Bank Rate increased to 1.25% by the end of 2019, UK monetary policy would remain highly accommodative. We will be paying close attention to the forward guidance at the February Inflation Report for signs the BoE is preparing markets for another rate hike soon.</p> </blockquote> <p>Daniel Vernazza, economist at UniCredit, is less hawkish on rates but admits today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data could make a rise this year more likely:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We continue to expect the MPC will keep the stance of monetary policy on hold this year and only hike again once Brexit-related uncertainty is resolved, probably in 2Q19.</p> <p>However, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market release, together with the likelihood of a robust 4Q17 GDP report due to be published on Friday, stronger global growth, and some resolution of Brexit-related uncertainty, increases the risks that the MPC already delivers another 25bp hike later this year.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full story on the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK data:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/24/uk-employment-level-hits-joint-highest-since-1971\">UK employment level hits joint highest since 1971</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>NF</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T12:20:56.796Z\">at 12.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a687646e4b04cea3dc7ab1b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T12:08:05.318Z\">12.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of the attractions of Davos for the global elite is that they can squeeze in more meetings with fellow leader than in the average month.</p> <p>IMF chief Christine Lagarde has been showing the way; offering support to Lebanon over its refugee crisis and giving Portugal a thumbs-up too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Lagarde/status/956134151454896128\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Very please to meet in Davos with Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prime Minister Antonio Costa and congratulated Finance Minister Mario Centeno on his election as President of Eurogroup.

However, vacancies are also at an all-time high, revealing difficulties for employers in some economic sectors, including those with a high proportion of migrant employees facing the challenges of Brexit.</p> <p>This reflects what employers who have engaged in our Brexit research say they are experiencing on the ground \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that they are losing some EU migrants and finding it more difficult to recruit both British and EU workers. The sectors with high vacancy rates include those with relatively high proportions of migrant employees, including from the EU.

Strong employment numbers were just the nudge the pound needed to get over $1.41, where it is just about holding at present.</p> <p>After showing signs of a slowdown, there was a strong bounce back in employment in December. Wage growth ex-bonuses rose by 2.4% compared to 2.3% in the quarter to October. Although below inflation at the present there are signs that tentatively rising wage growth will converge with falling inflation in the coming months. Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery will only aid that process and is a reason to be more bullish on the UK economy and sterling. Generally speaking we are also seeing less chance of the cliff-edge exit with the tone of Brexit negotiations more constructive since December following the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement to financial terms.</p> <p>But for all the chatter about Brexit and UK unemployment numbers, this is very much a soft dollar story. The dollar index has given up the 90 handle and we have the dollar below 110 against the yen for the first time since September and the euro has broken to a fresh three-year high.</p> <p>The pound is now well bid above its 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages and with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blast above $1.41 seems set to consolidate above $1.40. There is not a huge amount of resistance on the upside for cable. The 50% retracement of the move from $1.71 to $1.19 is at $1.4590. Then we have the $1.4770 May 3rd 2016 high before the all-important $1.5000 level comes back into play. But these seem a long way off and depend entirely on dollar weakness to be sustained.</p> <p>For that we will look to Davos and what president Trump says with regards to trade. Concerns about trade wars \u00e2\u20ac\u201c put on the back burner last year as the administration battled with Obamacare and tax reform \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have resurfaced. Tariffs on washing machines and solar cells may only be the start, while there are ongoing worries about Nafta. Trade concerns are trumping the Trump tax policy as far as the dollar is concerned. And the focus on the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide seems to be dampening the mood generally in equity markets.</p> <p>Nevertheless, dollar softness may well be overdone and shorts could be squeezed when GDP figures for the fourth quarter are released, which are likely to confirm yet more acceleration in growth in the US and could see markets bet on a faster pace of tightening by the Fed than currently priced in.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>NF</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T10:49:29.092Z\">at 10.49am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a685ea7e4b04cea3dc7a9f5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T10:30:30.358Z\">10.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Real wages are still being squeezed in the UK according to the latest data, with pay growth including bonuses steady at 2.5% and despite an increase from 2.3% to 2.4% when bonuses are excluded. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>With pay growing at 2.5% [including bonuses] and inflation running at 3.0%, the squeeze on real wages continues for the ninth consecutive month. But with inflation seemingly set to fall back towards the 2% target, this looks like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll come to an end in the next few months. We should remember, however, that the only true driver of real pay growth and rising living standards is productivity growth.

                "bodyText":"Some late news: Seven Latin American countries are to benefit from a new anti-malaria initiative unveiled in Davos by the philanthropist Bill Gates and the Inter-American development bank. The Regional Malaria Elimination Initiative is expected to deliver more than $180mn to fight the disease in Belize, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. Money from the Gates Foundation, the IDB and the Carlos Slim totalling more than $80bn is expected to leverage in a further $100mn from the countries affected. Gates said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This collaboration will build on each of the partners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 unique capabilities and expertise to cover financial and technical gaps in the region, demonstrating that we can eliminate malaria today using current tools. It will also help strengthen health systems in the region, positioning countries for success against other high-priority vector-borne diseases such as Zika, dengue and Chikungunya.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More Macron reaction: I think the social contract has to involve all the stakeholders. We have to fight against strategy of free riding. A new global and shared framework should be based on co-operation and multilateralism..We have a tremendous responsibility.. The answer is partly here in this room. In a way our new frontier is our commitment. If we commit ourselves to make our current globalisation more fair..so we can converge and build a new globalisation. We have a question. Do we decide to do it or no? And this is now? (Applause as he ends) We are committed to fighting against terrorism. We need to continue to work with our partners at military and diplomatic levels... Sometimes we thought getting rid of a tyrant we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like would get what we wanted... But we have to win the war against terrorism and create conditions for a durable peace...We need to provide a development and education policy. I think we have to reconnect with a framework which provides for the common good. Sustainable development, health, human rights - these can never be renounced, and we have to spell them out and regulate them in a common manner. I hope private sector will come to our country to create jobs.. but I have to explain to people [globalisation] is good for them. Otherwise there will be nationalists, extremism. We need to establish a new global contract, unless everyone understands they have a part to play it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. The new global contract has three duties: the right to invest, share and protect. [On investment} one area we are not doing enough in is education, we have 750m adults who do not have basic literacy skills, we have to invest in education, the education of girls in particular. If we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t invest there will be not equality. It is important all the countries here commit to this [investment in education globally]. The duty to share: there is a crisis of contemporary capitalism. It has become a capitalism of superstars, spreading of value added is not equitable. We have to establish mechanisms to share value added more equitably... We also need to speak about gender equality. In France we are launching initiatives [for more visibility], I welcome the commitments from Justin Trudeau. If we want to share value better, we need a more co-ordinated tax approach at a global level. There should not be a race to the bottom. We need a strategy that avoids the maximisation strategies of some companies. It is a moral issue. We need to renounce unbridled tax optimisation. Plus how can you have a tax on digital activities. We all want these big international companies in their country, but there is an unfair model [if they pay low taxes when national companies do]. Disruption from digital businesses will destroy millions of jobs, and if those companies do not help finance retraining of people affected, how can I explain that [to those people] I am in favour of IMF being given mandate to survey whole financial system, especially those areas which escape regulation. Cryptocurrencies, shadow banking etc, are not being looked at by IMF, so we have to have a discussion. At what point are we going to stop innovation. To say artificial intelligence, this is a red line. We need to have a framework of international co-operation to promote technology, but also to decide principles which should be decided by government not private companies. Finally, protection, against terrorism, and financial protection. Need government and international co-operation for this. We need to have a discussion in G20, that there must be a monitoring of all those bodies which can promote social cohesion. In terms of climate protection, we have committed to many things but not up to the commitments. China has done an enormous amount of work here. India is also very important. But we now need to follow through and respect Paris agreement. Need a floor price for CO2, if not we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be credible. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Silk Road has to be a green road. I hope by 2020 we will have an environmental pact which is legally binding. The private sector must also live up to its commitments. Finally it is the financial system which has to accompany this with green financing. In EU and eurozone we need to have a way of having a green financial sector. Macron, who has been mostly been speaking in English, reverts to French. Europe should find a new ambition. Economic growth is not an end in itself. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made a mistake saying things will get better because we have growth. The search for growth has sometimes made us forget what it takes to achieve it. Some people thought that if we had growth, all problems will be solved. Not the case, because this growth is less equitable. You cannot have a one stop solution. You have to co-ordinate positions. Everything is being fragmented. We have societies made up of nomads. There are more and more people who think getting out of globalisation is the right option. We have a major challenge, not just for governments. A lot of governments think you have to be more nationalist. States have often gone in wrong direction because we undermined internationalism. For many years we have been going in the wrong direction. In terms of trade we are moving back to strategies of non-co-operation, undoing what globalisation has been able to achieve. For climate change we have not be able to achieve what we have said we would achieve. And we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t established an organisation at a world level which looks at artificial intelligence and automation. We allow private companies to control this. We have never had a multilateral approach to this. We are encouraging technological change..and we are in danger of living in a Darwinian world. My message is France is back. We will never have French success without European success. Angela Merkel expressed her vision and we worked very closely in that direction. The core strategy is: we have to fix some short term measures. But we have to also redesign a ten year strategy for Europe. Europe has a role to play vis a vis China and the US. If we want to avoid fragmentation of the world, we need a stronger Europe. We have to have a 10 year strategy to make Europe a green, scientific and political power. We need more ambition to have a more united Europe. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not naive, we will not build something that ambition at 27. But we have to change our methodology, not wait for all the people round the table to go forward, Those who do not want to move forward should not block the most ambitious people in the room. This will make our eurozone much stronger, fairer. At the end of this year, we hope for a common strategy for ten years. First, its about human capital. Our world has changed. We need less arms and more brains. People have to be trained in an efficient way. We began to reform our education system, we need better access to university. We invest 5% of GDP in education, we will reform apprenticeships. We will invest \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn in education and retraining over five years. We will make innovation the centrepiece of the economy. Reform fiscal mechanisms, create a new \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10bn fund for disruptive technologies. The second pillar of this reform is investment and capital. We need more equity to finance risk and big innovations. We passed reforms to reallocate our savings in this direction. By decreasing corporate taxes, big reform on capital gain. We have reinforced France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attractiveness. The third pillar is acceleration and flexibility. You need more flexible structures and rules to help different companies to change business model and readapt. The idea is to realign France on Germany and northern Europe. Rules much more adapted to business environment, that is a big change and it makes us much more competitive. Fourth pillar - make France a model in fight against climate change. That is a huge advantage in terms of attractiveness and competitiveness. Talent will come where it is good to live. We can create a lot of jobs with such a strategy. We passed reforms for this green strategy. Close coal fired power stations by 2021 (Applause). Fifth pillar of domestic strategy is cultural change. A preference for red tape cuts and cutting complexities. We simplify and streamline processes, and simplify bureaucracy. During last six months we reduced like crazy the number of regulations. We have to guarantee stability for people. We passed all these measures, voted these five year strategy on taxes. Visibility is the strategy and will not change, that is my commitment. It is also about risk. In France it was forbidden to fail, and forbidden to succeed. Now it should be more easy to fail, take risk, but allow people to come back and try something else. When you take risk, you need reward, and you need to reduce the cost of failure. France is a nation of entrepreneures, ao it was a mistake in France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history. We have taken action but let us not be naive. Globalisation is going through a challenge. I came here to make a call for action, to all and every one of us. France has been affected by change and globalisation. A few months ago I had to fight with a nationalist party, since there was a lack of understanding about globalisation in my country. Why, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deliver, results were poor. Some people proposed getting out of globalisation as a solution. I have the responsibility to build a France that is prosperous and open, but also standing for those left behind. I have to make France more competitive to finance a fair system. Macron says we are talking about globalisation in a place cut off from the rest of the world by snow. It is hard here to believe in global warming, and you didnt invite anyone sceptical of global warming this year. Applause. A video clip has emerged of David Cameron, former UK PM, describing Brexit as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a mistake, not a disaster\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: French president Emmanuel Macron is next up at Davos. Today is being billed as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moment of truth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by Greek government officials as prime minister Alexis Tsipras meets his Macedonian counterpart in Davos. A solution to the seemingly unsolvable dispute between Greece and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia could be solved in Davos. That, at least, is what both sides are hoping as Tsipras and his Macedonian counterpart Zoran Zaev meet this afternoon. The bilateral meeting takes the quest for a settlement a notch up the diplomatic scale and is being seen as possibly groundbreaking. The two Balkan neighbours have been at odds over the former republic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name for the past 25 years with Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 asserting that exclusive use of the nomenclature \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Macedonia\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd conceals territorial ambitions against its own eponymous region of Macedonia. Around 100,000 demonstrators protested over the issue in the northern Greek capital of Thessaloniki on Sunday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It will be a moment of truth,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a senior Greek official adding that it would allow Athens to see how far Skopje was willing to compromise on the issue. More on the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current buoyancy, and more to the point, the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The pound went on a tear this Wednesday, rocketing higher against the euro and dollar to mark the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best session for more than a month. Cable shot up a remarkable 1.6% as the day progressed, clearing not only $1.41 but $1.42 in one fell swoop. Though the UK jobs report was decent, the highlight being another minor fall in unemployment, the thrust of cable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth is coming from the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bruised and battered start to 2018. Despite ostensibly having the end of the US government shutdown to cheer about the dollar found little room for positivity this Wednesday, almost solely due to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos. At a press conference Mnuchin argued that a weaker dollar was better for the US economy for trade reasons, a comment that was tantamount to kicking an already very sickly dog. Combine that lack of policy support with a weaker than forecast US flash services PMI and a disappointing existing home sales number and the greenback gave up the ghost as the bell rang on Wall Street, plunging to a variety of fresh lows as it matched its sharp decline against the pound with a 0.8% drop against the dollar and a 1% slide against the yen. Of course these currency movements had major ramifications for the global indices. The Dow Jones was overjoyed at the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest defeat, jumping 160 points to soar to a brand spanking new record peak of 26375. The European markets, on the other hand, shrank in the face of the pound and the euro. With sterling not only destroying the dollar but rising 0.8% against the euro the FTSE took the brunt of the blows, falling to a 3 week low after dropping 0.7%. The DAX and CAC, meanwhile, both slipped 0.3%, despite the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3 year high-hitting gains against the dollar being tempered by its losses against sterling. More US data, and a weak housing market report for December. Existing home sales fell by 3.6% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.57m units, worse than the 2.2% decline which had been expected by analysts. The November figure was revised down from 5.81m to 5.7m units. The December fall came after three months of gains, and the National Association of Realtors attributed the decline to a shortage of houses at the lower end of the market. But for the year as a whole, sales rose 1.1% making it the best performance in eleven years. NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said: Existing sales concluded the year on a softer note, but they were guided higher these last 12 months by a multi-year streak of exceptional job growth, which ignited buyer demand. At the same time, market conditions were far from perfect. New listings struggled to keep up with what was sold very quickly, and buying became less affordable in a large swath of the country. These two factors ultimately muted what should have been a stronger sales pace. NF We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had the initial January PMI numbers for January for the US, and unlike Europe it is manufacturing which is outperforming, rather than the service sector. The IHS Markit manufacturing PMI has climbed from 55.1 in December to 55.5, while the services PMI slipped from 53.7 to 53.3. The composite index edged down from 54.1 to 53.8. Despite the dips, all the indices were above 50, showing expansion rather than contraction. IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson, said: January saw an encouraging start to the year for the US economy. Business activity across the manufacturing and service sectors continued to expand, driving further job gains as companies expanded capacity. Manufacturing is faring especially well, in part thanks to the weaker dollar, providing an important spur to the economy at the start of the year. Although the overall pace of economic growth signalled by the surveys waned to an eight-month low, the forward-looking indicators suggest the slowdown will prove transitory. In particular, business optimism about the year ahead improved markedly and inflows of new orders hit a five-month high. Growth should therefore pick up again in coming months. Inflationary pressures meanwhile kicked higher, with January seeing the second-largest monthly increase in input costs since 2015. Higher oil prices were widely reported but, more generally, stronger demand is also helping companies push through price hikes. NF US markets have hit new records in early trading, helped by reasonable results from a number of major companies and the continuing weakness of the dollar. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a high of 26,344, up more than 0.4%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.25% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.19%. NF A quick look at the pound versus the dollar and the euro since the EU eferendum, courtesy of the Press Association, and it is quite a contrast: NF Returning to the dangers of populism, Angela Merkel warns of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpoisonous mix\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 created if people feel they are getting an unfair deal. She warns against descending into stereotypes, saying: When you say Americans are protectionist by nature, Germans are tight-fisted by nature, you are generalising. The next thing is Muslims are like this, Christians are like that. If you not respect each person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s individuality, and already have your pre-conceived notion before you even talk to them, that is the very basis of populism. We want to have a good partnership with Britain in the future, Merkel continues. Access to the single market is contingent on the freedoms, including freedom of movement. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in their hands how close they want the partnership to be. We are prepared to be open-minded about this partnership. Angela Merkel now turns to the digital revolution, warning of the social damage that it could cause. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not enough to just convince 20% or 30% of the population of the benefits of the digital age. Policymakers need to help people who will otherwise be left behind, she says. The chancellor repeats her earlier point that we must avoid making the mistakes of the 20th century again. The new digital economy creates good opportunities, Merkel says, but it also creates \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enormous confusion, and people feel left behind\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We must create a true social market economy as we say in Germany in this digital age. Merkel ends with a request - keep your fingers crossed for us getting into government as soon as possible. Are you listening, Donald? Turning to Brexit, Angela Merkel says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave the European Union is regrettable. But on the upside, it has given Europe \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the courage to move forwards\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She also name checks France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new(ish) leader, Emmanuel Macron, saying his victory last spring has given a new impetus to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reform drive. Merkel is making some important points about Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in the world: Angela Merkel warns that populism is on the rise, with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153polarising state of affairs in many countries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The German chancellor cites the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disruptive changes of technology\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is shaking up society and worrying people. There is also polarisation in Germany for the first time in decades, Merkel continues - following the eurozone crisis, and challenge of migration. Merkel reminds us that she is still holding talks to form a new government (with the social democratic party). But she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certain that Germany wants to make a contribution to solving the problems of the world. Shutting ourselves off from the rest of the world will not help she says, adding: Protectionism is not the proper answer. Next up: German chancellor Angela Merkel take the stage. She reminds delegates that 2018 marks the 100th anniversary of the end of the first world war. The political actors a century ago \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsleepwalked\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 into a crisis, Merkel says. We must ask ourselves...have we learned the lessons of history, Merkel continued. And she suggests we have not, declaring: This generation born after the second world war will have to prove they have learned the lessons of history. That means remaining committed to multilateralism, working together to solve problems, Merkel continues. Taking questions, Italian PM Paulo Gentiloni says that the issue of migration had a big influence on the Brexit vote. Italy is sticking to its principles, though, he says - saving the lives of those who try to get to Europe, and refusing to close its ports to those who cross the sea. Gentiloni says: This is one of the more costly political decisions you can take in these times. but this is the Italian decision, full stop. And finally, Donald Trump speaks to Davos in two days time - what is your message to him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Welcome to Davos\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Gentiloni wisecracks. But he then makes a serious point - that there is a limit to how far any one country can push things within the current framework. Yes you can defend and protect your citizens, your workers, your companies, but we live in a framework of trade agreements, free trade, international rules, multilateral decisions, and we have to keep this system running. Turning to new technology, Gentiloni says that digital innovation is threatening the quantity and quality of available jobs. We must not give in to the idea of a world destined to be split between a cosmopolitan digital elite and an army of precarious and underpaid local workers. And on Europe, the Italian PM says that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perfect storm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd caused by the Brexit vote, the economic crisis and unchecked migration is over. The EU now has an opportunity to relaunch itself. Gentiloni says firmly: These years are now behind our back. Those who have bet on a final crisis of the European Union have clearly lost. Italy is doing its bit to help with the migration crisis, Paulo Gentiloni says, saying that Italian investment is helping the African economy. The Italian PM then reminds his audience that Italy has an election in 40 days - he hopes that populist forces will not prevail [unfortunately for Gentiloni, his Democratic party is lagging in the polls]. Populism, Gentiloni says, frequently gives the wrong answers to the right questions. Politicians must not ignore the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeep causes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of discontent among their citizens, he says There are still unacceptably large parts of our populations who feel unsatisfied with their conditions and worried about the future. The damage caused by the great recession has still not been mended, Gentiloni continues. Economic growth is not reducing inequalities, but in many countries including Italy they are still widening, even if economic growth is there. They are reaching even more intolerable levels. Italian PM Paulo Gentiloni is on his feet - telling Davos that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is improving. Gentiloni says: In the last two years, our economy is back to growth, and now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s picking up speed. One year ago, the IMF forecast that we would only grow by 0.7% in 2017. Actual growth in 2017, according to the IMF, was 1.6%. He adds: Exports rose by 9.7% between November 2016 and 2017. Employment is up by one million units, to a 40-year high. Gentiloni says his government is doing its best to improve the business conditions, reform the labour market, raise skills and cut bureaucracy. This reforming effort must continue, and will continue, while our public debt must decrease at a steady and sustainable pace. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a buzz in the main Davos congress hall, as delegates prepare to hear from Italian prime minister Paulo Gentiloni, and then German chancellor Angela Merkel. Jack Ma has also warned Davos that technology could trigger a third world war, unless leaders work together to mitigate its disruptive effects. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The first technology revolution caused the First World War and the second technology revolution caused the Second World War - and now we have the third. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there is a Third World War I think that should be a war against disease, pollution and poverty, not a war against ourselves. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t align together , human beings are going to fight each other, because each technology revolution makes the world unbalanced.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hopes of a showdown between Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker at Davos tomorrow have been dashed. The EC president has cancelled his visit after contracting stomach flu, so he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be giving his scheduled speech tomorrow. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another quote from Alibaba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jack Ma, urging policymakers not to trigger a trade war: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Globalization is a growing pain. It is so easy to launch a trade war but it is so difficult to stop a trade war and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m scared and concerned.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sterling is climbing higher again, now up more than 1% at $1.4152. Apart from the weak dollar, one of the reasons for the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength at the moment is the prospect of further UK interest rate rises, hence a 0.7% gain against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1464. The stronger than expected employment and wage growth numbers only add to that expectation. Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg, says: While the Bank of England had initially responded to the risks to demand from the Brexit vote by easing its policy in August 2016, it became increasingly data dependent over the course of 2017, eventually hiking its main policy rate by 25bp in November \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first hike in a decade. This came as a bit of a surprise for markets that seemed to be focusing more on downside risks to demand from Brexit than the signs of growing underlying inflationary pressure. According to market pricing, the BoE is set to hike the bank rate once again towards the end of the year. In our view, this seems still seems inconsistent with the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data dependant approach and outlook for GDP and wage growth. Economic growth is likely to remain robust, partly helped by the strong global backdrop. Meanwhile, the BoE expects the unemployment rate to remain below its estimate of full employment (4.5% unemployment) throughout its forecast. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the BoE to justify its ultra-accommodative policy stance. We therefore look for two hikes in the Bank Rate in 2018, one in Q2 and one in Q4, followed by one in Q3 2019. Even with a modest continued tightening in which the Bank Rate increased to 1.25% by the end of 2019, UK monetary policy would remain highly accommodative. We will be paying close attention to the forward guidance at the February Inflation Report for signs the BoE is preparing markets for another rate hike soon. Daniel Vernazza, economist at UniCredit, is less hawkish on rates but admits today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data could make a rise this year more likely: We continue to expect the MPC will keep the stance of monetary policy on hold this year and only hike again once Brexit-related uncertainty is resolved, probably in 2Q19. However, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market release, together with the likelihood of a robust 4Q17 GDP report due to be published on Friday, stronger global growth, and some resolution of Brexit-related uncertainty, increases the risks that the MPC already delivers another 25bp hike later this year. Meanwhile here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full story on the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK data: NF One of the attractions of Davos for the global elite is that they can squeeze in more meetings with fellow leader than in the average month. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has been showing the way; offering support to Lebanon over its refugee crisis and giving Portugal a thumbs-up too. She even squeezed in a chat with cellist Yo-Yo Ma. E-commerce magnate Jack Ma has made a passionate plea to world leaders t Davos not to launch a trade war. Speaking on a panel, the head of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alibaba says trade should be a solution to the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems. If you used it as a weapon, young people and businesses will suffer most. Ma says: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThey will be killed, just like when you bomb somewhere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. An important view, given the tensions between China and the US - and Wilbur Ross\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comment about America \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccoming to the ramparts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Back in Davos, the World Economic Forum have launched a new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Global Centre for Cybersecurity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Based in Geneva, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meant to help build a safe and secure global cyberspace, and protect businesses and governments from online attacks. Interpol and BT are also involved. J\u00c3\u00bcrgen Stock, Secretary General of Interpol, says this partnership will address the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153global threat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of cybercrime. The pound has peaked at $1.4118 against the dollar, for the moment at least. But it is still up 0.7% so far today at $1.4097. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: A green-gilled greenback and a half decent UK jobs report made for a very strong Wednesday for the pound. Kicking the currency while it was down, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin claimed at a press conference in Davos that a weaker dollar is good for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcas it relates to trade and opportunities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This turned an already bad morning worse for the greenback, with the currency falling 0.4% against the euro, where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sunk to a fresh 3 and a bit year nadir, and 0.7% against both the yen and the pound. Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains against the dollar caused cable to flit about the $1.41 mark for the first time since the Brexit referendum result back in June 2016. The pound didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop there, however; it also rose 0.4% against the euro, lifting back to its best price in just shy of 7 weeks. The FTSE wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t best pleased with all this, dipping 0.2% as it continued to shed its early 2018 record-breaking momentum. The pound was aided by a UK jobs report that by and large didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ruffle any feathers. Wage growth came in unchanged at 2.5%, and rose to from 2.3% to 2.4% excluding bonuses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in terms of its relation to inflation, though real wages are still being squeezed there are signs that this should ease in the coming months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while unemployment fell by 3000 to 1.44 million (the unemployment rate didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually change, remaining steady at 4.3%). NF Back with the UK data. From Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon: Earlier, as well as the preliminary PMIs for France and Germany, there were also estimates for the eurozone as a whole. This showed the same pattern, with manufacturing slipping back in January and services rising. The eurozone manufacturing PMI dipped from 60.6 to 59.8 while services climbed from 56.6 to 57.6. The composite index rose from 58.1 to 58.6. Unicredit Bank economist Edoardo Campanella said: The eurozone starts 2018 with a bang, continuing to churn out solid economic figures. January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Composite PMI hit a near 12-year high, rising to 58.6 from 58.1 and pointing to annualized GDP growth of almost 4%. Economic activity further accelerated in the services sector to the fastest pace since August 2007, while it slowed down in the manufacturing industry \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after having recorded an all-time high last December. NF The UK jobs data today shows the difficulties employers are having filling vacancies, especially those companies which use a large number of EU migrant workers, says theNational Institute of Economic and Social Research. Associate research director Dr Heather Rolfe said: UK labour market statistics released today show employment in the 3 months up to November 2017 is at a record high, driven by an increase in full time employment. However, vacancies are also at an all-time high, revealing difficulties for employers in some economic sectors, including those with a high proportion of migrant employees facing the challenges of Brexit. This reflects what employers who have engaged in our Brexit research say they are experiencing on the ground \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that they are losing some EU migrants and finding it more difficult to recruit both British and EU workers. The sectors with high vacancy rates include those with relatively high proportions of migrant employees, including from the EU. Accommodation and food services, where one in six workers are EU migrants is one such sector. The challenges of attracting and retaining workers are likely to increase with prolonged uncertainty about the terms of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the EU. NF Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: Sterling breached $1.41 to record another post-Brexit high as a renewed bout of dollar softness and some better-than-expected employment numbers fuelled bids. Strong employment numbers were just the nudge the pound needed to get over $1.41, where it is just about holding at present. After showing signs of a slowdown, there was a strong bounce back in employment in December. Wage growth ex-bonuses rose by 2.4% compared to 2.3% in the quarter to October. Although below inflation at the present there are signs that tentatively rising wage growth will converge with falling inflation in the coming months. Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery will only aid that process and is a reason to be more bullish on the UK economy and sterling. Generally speaking we are also seeing less chance of the cliff-edge exit with the tone of Brexit negotiations more constructive since December following the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement to financial terms. But for all the chatter about Brexit and UK unemployment numbers, this is very much a soft dollar story. The dollar index has given up the 90 handle and we have the dollar below 110 against the yen for the first time since September and the euro has broken to a fresh three-year high. The pound is now well bid above its 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages and with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blast above $1.41 seems set to consolidate above $1.40. There is not a huge amount of resistance on the upside for cable. The 50% retracement of the move from $1.71 to $1.19 is at $1.4590. Then we have the $1.4770 May 3rd 2016 high before the all-important $1.5000 level comes back into play. But these seem a long way off and depend entirely on dollar weakness to be sustained. For that we will look to Davos and what president Trump says with regards to trade. Concerns about trade wars \u00e2\u20ac\u201c put on the back burner last year as the administration battled with Obamacare and tax reform \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have resurfaced. Tariffs on washing machines and solar cells may only be the start, while there are ongoing worries about Nafta. Trade concerns are trumping the Trump tax policy as far as the dollar is concerned. And the focus on the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide seems to be dampening the mood generally in equity markets. Nevertheless, dollar softness may well be overdone and shorts could be squeezed when GDP figures for the fourth quarter are released, which are likely to confirm yet more acceleration in growth in the US and could see markets bet on a faster pace of tightening by the Fed than currently priced in. NF Real wages are still being squeezed in the UK according to the latest data, with pay growth including bonuses steady at 2.5% and despite an increase from 2.3% to 2.4% when bonuses are excluded. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: With pay growing at 2.5% [including bonuses] and inflation running at 3.0%, the squeeze on real wages continues for the ninth consecutive month. But with inflation seemingly set to fall back towards the 2% target, this looks like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll come to an end in the next few months. We should remember, however, that the only true driver of real pay growth and rising living standards is productivity growth. This is something the UK has struggled with since the financial crisis, and as yet nobody seems to have solved the puzzle. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: While it is encouraging that regular earnings growth picked up slightly, subdued economic conditions are likely to weigh on wage growth over the next year. As a consequence, pay growth is likely to remain stubbornly below price growth over the near term, dampening consumer spending, a key driver of UK GDP growth. NF The president of Brazil, Michael Temer, is speaking now -- encouraging business leaders to provide fresh investment. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: The relentless rise in sterling, which has seen it jump over 3% in the last 10 days is looking durable. The good news for the economy is that more people are working with rising wages despite any uncertainty associated with leaving the European Union. Lord Jim O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neil looks vindicated so far in his belief that strong domestic and global growth will overcome Brexit headwinds. Matthew Brittain, investment analyst at wealth manager Sanlam UK, said: The real worry [for the UK economy] is centred around the consumer where wages have been increasing at a lower rate than inflation (ie falling in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd terms). So another bright spot in this release is that weekly earnings ticked up from 2.3 to 2.4% versus a year ago, which is still lower than inflation (3%) but at least the gap is steadily being closed Since the data makes it slightly more likely that the Bank of England will increase interest rates later on in the year the immediate reaction is a rise in sterling to \u00c2\u00a31.41 with bonds and equities both under a little pressure. NF Sterling has climbed above $1.41 against the dollar after the better than expected UK unemployment and wages data. It is up 0.7%, a new peak since the Brexit vote but still below the $1.4878 level on the day of the referendum itself. Against the euro sterling is up 0.3% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1416. The pound is benefitting from the signs of a stronger economy, and growing hopes that a Brexit deal can be reached. It is also being helped by the weakness of the dollar, which has fallen even more after the comments from US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin at Davos. The US currency has been under pressure since the tax cuts announcement, with fears the reforms would push the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge deficit even higher. News of trade sanctions against South Korea and China have not helped, prompting fears of retaliation. Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com, said: Sterling has bounced back in fine style, particularly against the dollar where it has climbed above $1.40 for the first time since the historic Brexit vote. Unemployment continues to fall, while there are signs that wages are finally growing, with employees willing to take more risks to ask for a pay rise, or even consider moving jobs. Although nothing has been decided yet, the general consensus is that the final version of Brexit could be softer than previously thought, which can only be good for the UK economy as a whole. NF Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details from former UK PM Tony Blair at Davos (speaking on Bloomberg TV) Asked whether there was any other way to avoid Brexit apart from having a second referendum, Blair said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You could have a general election. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we do go through with Brexit - and I hope we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a complete change and we will have to fashion a new future for the country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said that when people have clarity on what the Brexit deal might look like - and he suspects it will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hotch potch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it will be very difficult to persuade people that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than what we have now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Q: What is he expecting from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Friday? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what to expect. For me the issue is not responding to what Donald Trump has just said, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the reasons that brought him to power ... the cultural and economic alienation ... this is the root of the problem that needs to be addressed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd UK employment rose unexpectedly in the three months to November, while wages rose by a higher than forecast 2.4%, excluding bonuses. The number of people in work rose by 102,000 in the quarter, said the Office for National Statistics, the biggest increase since the three months to July. Analysts had expected a fall of 13,000. The unemployment rate was steady at a four decade low of 4.3%. As for wages, the 2.4% figure was up from 2.3% in the three months to October and better than the forecasts of a flat reading. With inflation slipping back from 3.1% to 3% in November, the wage gap has edged lower. Total pay growth including bonuses was steady at 2.5%, as forecast. NF While the German and French leaders are at Davos, there is some reasonable data from both countries. The latest manufacturing PMIs for the two have come in below expectations but the service sector has outperformed. For France the preliminary manufacturing PMI for January came in at 58.1, down from 58.8. The services PMI rose from 59.1 to 59.3, with the composite PMI up from 59.6 to 59.7. In Germany the manufacturing index fell from 63.3 to 61.2, the services rose from 55.8 to 57 but the composite slipped from 58.9 to 58.8 NF The US dollar is sliding like an ill-prepared delegate on the streets of Davos, thanks to Stephen Mnuchin. The Treasury secretary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comment about not being worried about the weak dollar has sparked another wave of selling, sending the greenback to a fresh three-year low. Former chancellor George Osborne says the vote for Brexit was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an alliance of the insulated and the insecure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In a discussion on the causes of Brexit and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory Osborne said the insulated were elderly voters who owned their homes outright but were anxious about the pace of change while the insecure were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on the margins of employment and looking for something to address their grievances.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That was a classic good-cop/bad cop performance from Stephen Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross at Davos this morning. Mnuchin tried to calm concerns ahead of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit, by insisting that America First wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t incompatible with working with other countries. But Ross was more combative, insisting that America had been treated badly by other nations in the past, and that Trump is simply levelling the score. Ross comments about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153US troops coming to the ramparts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and other countries talking about free trade but actually being protectionist, are a hint about how the US will behave behind the scenes at the World Economic Forum this week. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction: Final question -- will the US be reassuring delegates at Davos that it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t creating a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrace to the bottom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on tax? Stephen Mnuchin replies that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always been clear with fellow finance ministers that this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s objective. This was about creating a comparable system for US companies to compete fairly, and we see that working. Q: What retaliations do you think China might take if the US imposes new tariffs? Every time you take a trade action, there is the possibility of the other side taking a trade action in retaliation, Wilbur Ross replies. To the degree that this happens, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a question about what the US would do next, Ross continues. Boom! Asked about the dangers of a trade war, US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross argues that it has been underway for some time. The difference is that the US troops are now coming to the ramparts. Stephen Mnuchin denies that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clash between America being \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcopen for business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic goals. This is about an America First agenda, but America First does mean working with the rest of the world. President Trump is looking out for US workers and US interest, just as he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect other world leaders to do, Mnuchin adds. Q: How concerned are you about the weakness of the US dollar? The dollar is one of the most liquid markets. Where it is in the short term is not a concern at all, says Mnuchin. A weaker US dollar is good for trade, he continues. And in the long term, the strength of the US dollar is a sign of the strength of the US economy. Q: Have you any evidence that your tax reforms are boosting investment? The vote from the market is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpretty positive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Mnuchin replies. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen many companies come out and commit hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars, he says - citing Apple as an example. We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be happier. The response from US businesses has been even better than we expected. Q: How does the America First economic agenda match up to the World Economic Forum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goals? Our objective is to be here to interact with our counterparts. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very important for the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest economy, Mnuchin replies. Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross weighs in too, repeating that some of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading partners are protectionist, even if they talk about free trade. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that adhering to the rules is protectionist. We think in fact it is essential to having markets operate properly, to have people play by the rules. Q: Are you worried that China might cut its holdings of US government debt? Treasury secretary Mnuchin says that some of the reporting of this issue has been inaccurate. The market for US treasuries is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, he adds. Q: Is there a bubble in the United States financial markets? Mnuchin says that forums like Davos are never very good at predicting markets. What we see in the US markets is a reaction to the economic changes we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made, he suggests - but he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to comment on other markets. As we look at US economic growth against the rest of the world, US economic growth looks very good - and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good place to invest, he continues. Q: What do you think about Justin Trudeau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about NAFTA yesterday? We totally believe in full and free trade - anyone who wants to do it on a reciprocal basis are very welcome, Stephen Mnuchin replies. Q: What might you do next against China over protectionism? Wilbur Ross: There are a number of other actions pending. Reports have been drawn up for President Trump to consider (he references the aluminium market) There will be a very busy trade agenda in terms of those actions by the US, and there are the formal actions with relation to NAFTA, Ross adds. Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross speaks next, and rubbishes the idea that the US tax cuts are creating a new trade barrier This is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153funny concept\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Ross says: The US has been on an uncompetitive model before, but it is now on a very competitive one. Ross also touches on free trade -- and insists that any actions taken by America are in response to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inappropriate behaviour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading partners. Many countries are very good at the rhetoric of free trade, but actually practice protectionism. Stephen Mnuchin, the US Treasury secretary, has just arrived at a packed-out press briefing here at Davos. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accompanied by Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. Mnuchin begins by saying he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thrilled to be at Davos, with the largest US delegation to WEF ever. Obviously tax reforms and tax cuts were a major part of what we achieved in Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first year, Mnuchin says - which will bring \u00e2\u20ac\u0153literally trillions of dollars\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd back to the UK. We are committed to achieving a 3% growth target, Mnuchin continued. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just good for the US, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for the world economy too. Mnuchin declares: We are open for business, and we look forward to being here through the week. Former UK prime minister Tony Blair is in town! He just spoke to Bloomberg TV about the need for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153progressive centerism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More on that later... The boss of Lloyds of London has warned that the focus on dry economic measures such as GDP has helped to create the backlash that led to Brexit. Speaking to CNBC at the World Economic Forum, Inga Beale said policymakers need to think differently about how they measure the economy. Beale explained: I do remember, when we were going through the campaigning around Brexit, in the UK, we, as businesses, were talking about GDP. Most of the members of the public don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even know what that means, you know, they-, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t relate to them. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a definite feeling that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not being included, and they want to challenge the, you know, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcas is\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, at the moment. They really want to go out and say, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not happy with this status quo. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not hearing me. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not respecting me. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not included.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 And when we talk about GDP, that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel very inclusive for them. On Monday, the World Economic Forum did launch a new, more inclusive measure of economic performance that also tracked inequality and sustainability. Britain came just 21st. Sounds like Emmanuel Macron is only paying a flying visit.. Last night, around 2000 demonstrators in Zurich marched in protest at Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit to the World Economic Forum. Reuters reports that a small group even managed to demonstrate here in Davos: About 20 demonstrators broke through security to reach the Davos Congress Centre, holding banners and shouting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wipe out WEF\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before they were peacefully disbanded by police. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump is just one of the other people we disagree with. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been protesting every year now against the World Economic Forum and if Trump comes or not we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care. Trump is just, maybe he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just the best symbol of this world,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd protester Alex Hedinger told Reuters TV in Davos. More here. Now this is interesting.... Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin is going to give a briefing at Davos in around 30 minutes. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting is billed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are open for business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - perhaps an attempt to calm worries over President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s America First agenda.... Good morning. The second day of the World Economic is getting underway, with a strong European flavour. German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Emmanuel Macron and Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni are all due on the Davos main stage today - a chance to set the agenda before Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eagerly-awaited speech on Friday. But the Americans are already fighting for the spotlight. US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin is in town, and speaking to the press this morning (we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hopefully have more on that soon). Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s King Filipe, and the presidents of Brazil and Zimbabwe are also making appearances. Plus, Davos delegates will be discussing economic inequality (despite the obvious irony), slavery, and the opportunity and threats posed by technology. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even a footballer in town. Manchester United\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Juan Mata will be pushing his Common Goal charitable fund, which encourages sports stars to donate some of their massive salaries to good causes. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some of the events we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try to cover: 10am Davos (9am GMT): IMF chief Christine Lagarde on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Solving the Economic Generation Gap\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 10.20am Davos (9.20am GMT): Special Address by Michel Temer, President of Brazil 11.15am Davos (10.15am GMT): Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s King Felipe VI speaks 12.30pm Davos (11.30am GMT): Session on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcStabilizing the Mediterranean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with Italian PM Paolo Gentiloni and Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alexis Tsipras 2pm Davos (1pm GMT): Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa speaks 2.20pm Davos (1.20pm GMT): Special Address by Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany 3.30pm Davos (2.30pm GMT): Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai on AI and technology\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on society 4pm Davos (3pm GMT): A session on how to end slavery 5.30pm Davos (4.30pm GMT): Special Address by Emmanuel Macron, President of France 6pm Davos (5pm GMT): Manchester United\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Juan Mata talks about his Common Goal charitable work",

When someone says a good exchange rate is good, that is targeting exchange rate. That goes back to years ago before the [recent] terms of agreement were agreed.</p> \n  <p><em>Q:Why did you chooses September to end QE?

What level of concern was there today about a possible change in US policy [after US dollar comments]</em></p> \n  <p>Yes there was concern. It was broader than simply the exchange rate, but about broader state of international relations right now. If this leads to an unwarranted tightening of monetary policy we would have to think about our monetary policy strategy.</p> \n  <p>On communications, you see same thing in other jurisdictions. All the communiations since Dec have in common three characteristics. All based on commitment to objective of inflation target. None questioned the sequence whereby interest rates will stay at current levels well past end of asset buying programme. Well past was emphasised.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Some commentators factoring in an interest rate rise this year? At its current level does euro reflect fundamentals?</em></p> \n  <p>Based on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data I see very few chances at all that interest rates can be raised this year. On euro, we should ask is it produced by strength of economy, or by statements, or by monetary policy elsewhere. </p> \n  <p><em>Q: Another question on the G30 membership, could it compromise ECB?</em></p> \n  <p>Draghi repeats his previous answer, but adds ombudsman said there was no evidence the meeting influenced ECB, and ECB must have contacts with other financial participants.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Will differences of views within ECB deepen on exit strategy? At March meeting, will you give restatement of forward guidance.</em></p> \n  <p>I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the differences are as substantive as they were on other occasions. Some are a little more confident, if they live where inflation is rising. But there are not deep existential differences.</p> \n  <p>But there may be differences on when to say certain things, when to move forward. Markets have expectations on path, but also on dates, timelines. </p> \n  <p>In March we will assess how things stand at that point in time.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a69d9b0e4b00f225a1c7a86\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T15:06:10.845Z\">3.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">ECB: Draghi press conference</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Away from Davis briefly and back with the ECB, and president Mario Draghi said at his press conference that domestic price pressures remained muted, inflation has yet to show a convincing upward trend.</p> \n  <p>He said the recent foreign exchange volatility is a source of uncertainty. An ample degree of monetary stimulus is necessary.</p> \n  <p>On the economy, he said there could be positive growth surprise in the near term. But there were downside risks remain relating to global factors, forex.</p> \n  <p>More on inflation: he said it was expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our measures, rising wage growth etc</p> \n  <p>He then repeats his usual call to governments to do more: To reap the ull benefits from monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute. Structural reform in euro area countries needs to be stepped up . On fiscal policies, the case is strengthened for rebuilding fiscal buffers, especially in in countries where debt remains high. Strengthening EMU remains a priority.</p> \n  <p>Now for questions:</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What will have to happen for the exchange rate to be a problem for the inflation target? And you said in December you would revisit guidance [on the bond buying programme] early this year?</em></p> \n  <p>Draghi says there is confusion about the guidance comment, there was no difference between what was said at the December meeting and what Draghi said at the press conference. All that was said was there would have to be discussions about the need to have a discussion in the early part of the year. That discussion hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really started. We went through the events since October to now, trying to assess whether something has changed. There was not much of a change except the strengthening of the economy a little more than expected. By and large the risk to growth is balanced.</p> \n  <p>We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t declare victory. Price pressures are muted. Underlying inflation is showing little signs of upward movement. So we simply restated policy.</p> \n  <p>He said the commitment to the inflation target remained firmer than ever. Monetary policy will remain accommodative.</p> \n  <p>On exchange rates he said there were three reasons for volatility. The improvement in the economy, the heightened market sensitivity to perceived changes in our communication. Finally the use of language in discussion exchange rate developments that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed in October in Washington [an agreement between governments on exchange rate policy]</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a263a300171d6e4db1e16a9fb5d2f56b0fed19e9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a263a300171d6e4db1e16a9fb5d2f56b0fed19e9/27_0_750_450/500.jpg\" alt=\"newdraghi25\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Draghi at the press conference</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ECB</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p><em>Q:Dollar weakness is what you were probably referring to. It must not be helpful to hear a lower dollar is something [US officials] like. Are we heading to currency war scenario. Also, could you envisage ending QE programme in September.</em></p> \n  <p>We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t target exchange rates, they are important for growth and price stability. </p> \n  <p>Movements justified by strength of economy are a fact of natiure. Are there other movements caused by use of language, not parts of terms agreed. Whether that has an effect on our inflation path...inflation is our main concern. Too early to assess whether pass through has already taken place, and what will be extent.</p> \n  <p>Some are questioning the extent of pass through, but large exchange rate movements are bound to have an effect. In Washington - ministers and governments recognised excessive volatily or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse effects. [They agreed] we will refrain from competitive devaluations and will not target exchange rates for competitive purposes.</p> \n  <p>On second question, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any discussion today, but we never stop the programme abruptly.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Will you give up you membership of the G30, after ombudsman letter?</em></p> \n  <p>We received the letter from the ombudsman, we will respond in time. There is a procedure. We will assess the letter and the comments and respond.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: German pay negotiations. Could there be broad pay increases across eurozone economy following Germany?</em></p> \n  <p>We observe from a monetary policy angle, where we consider wage growth as a convincing sign of future inflation convergence to our objective. Whether it spreads, depends on conditions of labour market. Tight conditions in Germany, not so in other countries.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Are there financial stability risks from long term accommodative policy? </em></p> \n  <p>Vice president Vitor Constancio answers. No one can talk about asset price bubbles in euro area. We have overstretched valuations in some places for commercial real estate, high yield corporate bonds but nothing else.... We see prices in market are close to fair value. Same is true of housing prices. Fundamental values are in line with fundamental. Prices of houses increasing by 4%, between 2000 and 2006 they were up 7%. So no general situation of overvaluation in residential properties.</p> \n  <p>Some countries have also taken macroprudential policies to combat excesses.</p> \n  <p>The effect on banks of negative rates, taking into account all our policies, they have been favourable to their profitability which is still low but increasing.

In Asia overnight it hit $1.4328, and although it has eased back from that, it is still up 0.11% so far today at $1.4255.</p> \n  <p>It is partly the expectation of an earlier than expected UK rate rise, given the recent strong data including Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment and wages figures. But of course there is also the weak dollar, hit recently by the expectation that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts would raise the already hefty US deficit. More immediately Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin told Davos the US wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worried about a flagging greenback. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Steven Mnuchin (US Treasury Secretary) went to Davos and said that a weaker dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcis good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He also pointed out that that he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t concerned by where it is in the short term and that in the longer term, its strength is a reflection of the strength of the US economy. In other words, he said very little really, but he said it under snow-plastered slopes and he was speaking to a market where dollar bulls have been under the cosh. A few more capitulated.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Against the euro the pound is pretty flat, down just 0.01% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1473 ahead of the latest European Central Bank meeting. But the euro is up against the dollar, 0.11% better at $1.2421.</p> \n  <p>The strength of the euro presents a problem for ECB president Mario Draghi. If he appears too bulllish at hinting at an end to the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE programme, the euro will appreciate even further. And that would keep a lid on inflation which is already below the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target. Equally, he cannot ignore the improving European economy. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets explains:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>With headline inflation remaining well below its 2% target rate at 1.4% and an economy that continues to show decent levels of economic activity the ECB is faced with having to navigate the minefield of guiding markets over the tightrope of communicating a credible timeline for stimulus reduction and interest rate policy, while trying to move CPI back to target against the difficulty of a rising currency. </p> \n   <p>Since the beginning of 2017 the euro has risen 18% against the US dollar and could well rise even further given yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks by US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin.<strong> </strong></p> \n   <p>Last week ECB vice president Vitor Constancio along with Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ewald Nowotny expressed concern about recent exchange rate movements. These concerns are likely to have increased in recent days which will make today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference by ECB President Mario Draghi much more interesting. He can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very well ignore the improving outlook but if he comes across as too bullish the euro could well be well on the way to the 1.3000 level by the end of this quarter.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Draghi would have to adopt a delicate approach and seek a strategy which stops the euro from firming further. The only way out of this situation for him would be to emphasize that the process of the rate hikes is not within sight yet. The market is expecting a rate hike in 2019 from the ECB, Draghi would have to pull a rabbit out of hat in order to convince the market that rate hike isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the agenda and market participants are getting ahead of themselves.</p> \n   <p>We do think that overly dovish statement by the European central bank is priced in the euro to some extent. If Draghi fails to convince the market or if he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound as dovish as the market is expecting, we think that the euro can take off from here. I think the risk to the downside for the euro are limited, it is the upside move which would be more exciting. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>NF</strong></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T09:35:55.305Z\">at 9.35am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a699fbae4b0473d0bc1006d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T09:14:06.963Z\">9.14am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b01f8328d4d3d09f9d57f014effee666cffec85\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b01f8328d4d3d09f9d57f014effee666cffec85/0_0_3500_2518/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swiss police officers on the roof of the Davos Congress Hotel this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"719\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swiss police officers on the roof of the Davos Congress Hotel this morning.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Balibouse/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a699c38e4b00f225a1c77eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T08:59:11.454Z\">8.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conservative Party has confirmed she will hold social media giants to account in Davos:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CCHQPress/status/956450450433339392\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theresa_may?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@theresa_may</a> will put pressure on social media companies to stop providing a platform for terror, extremism and child abuse.

                "bodyText":"A late PS, from the Associated Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pan Pylas on the moment Trump arrived at the World Economic Forum. One way to get President Donald Trump to stop and talk at the World Economic Forum: wield a book about him. On his way into the World Economic Forum, Trump stopped and talked for about ten seconds to one delegate who was brandishing a copy of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153God and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by Stephen E. Strang. He then proceeded to hold the book aloft in his left hand. Trump is the first U.S. president to attend the World Economic Forum since Bill Clinton back in 2000. Trump is holding a series of meetings and is due to deliver a speech on Friday in which he will argue that what is good for the U.S. economy is beneficial for the global economy. And finally, readers will be keen to know that Donald Trump is probably tucked up in bed. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the final dispatch: Motorcade arrived at the Intercontinental at 9:23. Pool did not see POTUS get out. He will sleep here tonight. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all from us until tomorrow! Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some colour from Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dinner with business leaders, from the White House press pack: President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes narrowed, as he looked a bit tired by the jetlag and long trip. But he seemed to enjoy the camaraderie with businessmen, joking with them about their success and lofty responsibilities, and nodding in agreement as they spoke about their large manufacturing capacity and thousands of US-based employees. Among the topics discussed: Kanye West\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in designing Adidas shoes, Mack Trucks made by Volvo, Nestl\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-chocolate business portfolio. Among Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s asides: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When he says he works for Siemens, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the president of Siemens!...Wow, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big!....Good luck with the G.E. purchase.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump spoke about the thriving American economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c crediting his tax policies, deregulation and his role as a cheerleader for American business. Soros then claims the bitcoin price will be propped by up by dictators, who use it to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuild their nest eggs abroad\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Q: As a former currency trader (who beat the Bank of England on Black Wednesday) what do you think of cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin is not a currency, Soros replies. A currency is supposed to be a stable store of value, and a currency that can fluctuate 25% in a day can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be used to pay wages It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a speculation, based on a misunderstanding. Soros suggest the EU should help Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy develop, if it wants to address the migration crisis. Onto questions. Q: What should be done to tackle the technology giants? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very complicated issue, Soros replies. It requires the full-time attention of those who formulate and enforce new laws. I put my faith in them, especially commissioner Vestigar who has done so much to enforce the laws - and made an award against Google. Q: If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like social media companies, why do you buy shares in them? calls out a diner from the back of the room. Soros doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reply (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure he heard). Instead he takes a question about migration, saying he cares about refugees because he was one himself; he came to Britain and was better treated than refugees arriving in Europe today. Another punchy quote from Soros: On Europe, Soros suggests that a multi-speed, multi-track approach would be more successful. This would allow Britain to rejoin the EU in the future without having to commit to joining the euro, explained Soros (who hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given up hope that Brexit won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen). George Soros then turns his guns at the technology sector. In a blistering attack, he accuses social media companies of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deliberately engineering addiction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153particularly harmful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for adolescents. He accuses them of inducing customers to give up their autonomy too. Soros says there are similarities between internet platforms and gambling platforms - pointing out that casinos have developed techniques to hook customers so they keep gambling even when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve run out of money. But... while tech giants may think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re masters of the universe, they are actually just slaves to preserving their dominant position Soros continues. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a matter of time before the monopoly of the US IT giants is broken, he declares: Davos is a good place to announce that their days are numbered. Regulation and taxation will be their undoing. I see Trump as a purely temporary phenomenon which will disappear in 2020, or earlier, Soros says - winning a laugh from his audience as they tuck into their chicken, potatoes and spinach. Soros adds that he expects a Democratic landslide in 2018. America must recognise the reality that North Korea has become a nuclear power, Soros continues. There is no military action that can prevent what has already happened. The only sensible strategy is to accept reality\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.and come to terms with North Koreas as a nuclear power. That means working with China to find a solution. Soros says that the survival of our whole civilisation is at stake, due to the rise of Kim Jong Un in North Korea and Donald Trump in the United States. They both seem to be willing to risk a nuclear war to keep themselves in power. At another dinner in Davos, billionaire businessman-turned-philanthopist George Soros is giving his views on the state of the world. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that open societies are in crisis, with various forms of dictatorship on the rise - such as Vladimir Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Russia. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the United States, President Trump would like to establish a mafia state, but can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Soros continues, because America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s institutions, constitution and its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vibrant civil society\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow it. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the prospect of Donald Trump visiting the UK later this year: UK government officials have been updating the British press about Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Donald Trump this afternoon, shortly after he arrived at WEF (and brought it to a standstill). Mark Knoller, CBS News White House Correspondent, has details of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dinner with European business chiefs: Donald Trump is now sitting down for diner with the bosses of some of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest companies. Mark Tucker, the chairman of HSBC, and Punit Renjen, the chief executive of Deloitte, are flying the flag for Britain - according to this guest list from the White House press pack: President Donald J. Trump Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Department of State Secretary Kirstjen Nielson, Department of Homeland Security General H.R. McMaster, National Security Advisor Gary Cohn, Director of the National Economic Council Kasper Rorsted, Adidas (Apparel)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Joe Kaeser, Siemens AG (Tech)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Heinrich Hiesinger, Thyssenkrupp AG (Industrials)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Eldar Saetre, Statoil ASA (Energy)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dNorway Mark Schneider, Nestle SA (Food and Beverage)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSwitzerland Vas Narasimhan, Novartis AG (Pharmaceutical)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSwitzerland Mark Tucker, HSBC (Financial Services)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dUK Patrick Pouyanne, Total SA (Energy)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dFrance Carlos Brito, Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (Food and Beverage)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dBelgium Rajeev Suri, Nokia Corporation (Technology)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dFinland Punit Renjen, Deloitte (Consulting)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dUK Martian Lundstedt, AB Volvo (Auto)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSweden Werner Baumann, Bayer AG (Pharmaceutical)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Bill McDermott, SAP SE (Technology)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dGermany Ulrich Spiesshofer, ABB Ltd (Manufacturing)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSwitzerland \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 This list was amended on 26 January 2018 to correct inaccurate details provided by the White House press office. The spelling of Carlos Brito\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first name was corrected from Carols, and the location of Anheuser-Busch InBev NV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters has been corrected from the Netherlands to Belgium. President Trump is likely to face protests if and when his visit to the UK takes place, even if it is just a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153working visit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. For a start, Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson pulled no punches, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump is a dangerous, misogynistic racist and is deserving of the protests he will undoubtedly face. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If and when he comes to the UK the Liberal Democrats will be at front and centre of the protests.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The White House says Theresa May and Donald Trump discussed plans for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153working visit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to London. That may mean that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a full-blown state visit. A working visit would mean less pomp and ceremony (and probably not a visit to see the Queen). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official statement (which includes that all-important nod to the Special Relationship). President Donald J. Trump met today with Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom. The President and Prime Minister discussed joint efforts to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS and other jihadist terrorist organizations in Syria and Iraq. They discussed the importance of confronting Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s destructive behavior across the Middle East and fundamental flaws in the Iran nuclear deal. The leaders committed to expanded trade between the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as how the two countries can work together to ensure all nations engage in fair and reciprocal trade practices. The two leaders also discussed plans for a working visit to London in the coming months and affirmed the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special relationship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between the two countries is stronger than ever. Donald Trump emerged from his meetings a little while ago, and briefly chatted with delegates who hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been driven away by security. He said his first day at Davos had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153really good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very successful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, before calling it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very great day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key quote (with thanks to the White House press corp) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the real message is we want great prosperity and we want great peace and I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the message. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been going really well. A lot of people are coming back to the United States. We are seeing tremendous investment and today has been a very exciting day. Very great day and great for our country. Thank you very much.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details: Q: Is America great? Trump: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Q: Is everybody else great? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump said, turning his head toward the questioner as he walked through the convention hallway. Donald Trump may be in the spotlight in Davos today, but it was Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments by US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin about the dollar which caused ructions at the European Central Bank. Mnuchin said that a weaker dollar was good for American trade, and ECB president Mario Draghi suggested this was not in the spirit of an agreement between governments made in October in Washington. Draghi said: Ministers and governments recognised excessive volatily or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse effects. [They agreed to] refrain from competitive devaluations and not target exchange rates for competitive purposes. He said the current exchange rate volatility was partly due to\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdthe use of language in discussing exchange rate developments that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments yesterday sent an already weak dollar still lower. Marco Valli, chief European economist at UniCredit Bank, said: [The ECB] remains fairly relaxed about the effects of a stronger euro, but bluntly criticised the recent foreign exchange messages from the US administration, seen as violating the long-standing international commitment to avoid competitive devaluation. And of course Donald Trump has tweeted about his meeting with Theresa May: Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Donald Trump at Davos took place shortly after she gave a special address to the World Economic Forum (highlights start here) May focused on the opportunities and threats of new technology, and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to equip its economy for the challenges ahead. Paul Sheard, chief global economist at S&amp;P Global Ratings, tells us that she missed a trick by not also talking about Brexit, and UK-US relations. Prime Minister May made a strong pitch for the UK to be seen as a global leader in AI and regulation-friendly innovation, but \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdI thought her not spending some time laying out the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest thinking on Brexit - particularly what it aspires for the all-important future relationship - was a bit of a missed opportunity. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what details still need to be finalised, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that officials can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually get Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit nailed down. One possible hitch might be the certainty of large protests against the US president from British citizens appalled by his view on climate change, accusations of sexual harassment, the Muslim ban, his America First policies - to name just four. Trump is reportedly rather worried about facing major protests - something he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been spared in Davos, due to its ultra-tight security net. Bloomberg reported this week that the US president had asked May to make sure he got a good reception. In one phone conversation during 2017, Trump complained to May over the criticism he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been getting in British newspapers. Amid warnings that Trump would face protests in the streets when he arrived, he told the prime minister he would not be coming to the U.K. until she could promise him a warm welcome. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official. Barring a few details, US president Donald Trump will visit the United Kingdom later this year. May and Trump asked their respective officials to work on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfinalising the details\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of a trip, at the end of their bilateral meeting here in the World Economic Forum. A Downing Street spokesman says that: The PM and President concluded by asking officials to work together on finalising the details of a visit by the President to the UK later this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no word on when it might happen, though. Downing Street also say that the two leaders discussed Brexit, Iran, terrorism, and worries that jobs could lost at Bombardier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory in Northern Ireland due to the trade dispute with Boeing. The spokesman says: The two leaders began by discussing Bombardier, with the PM reiterating the importance of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs in Northern Ireland. The PM and the President discussed Iran, and the need to work together to combat the destabilising activity which it is conducting in the region, including ballistic missile development, and continuing efforts to ensure Iran does not develop nuclear weapons. They also agreed on the importance of continuing to stand side-by-side in the fight against Daesh in Syria and elsewhere. The Prime Minister updated the President on the good progress which had been made in the Brexit negotiations so far. The two leaders reiterated their desire for a strong trading relationship post-Brexit, which would be in the interests of both countries. NEWSFLASH: Theresa May and Donald Trump have asked officials to work on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153finalising the details of a visit by the President to the UK later this year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Downing Street said. More to follow. Swiss campaign group CAMPAX have hung a Trump protest banner on a mountain at Sargans - about 50 kilometres from Davos. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a photo of the Davos meeting room which Donald Trump and his delegation swept into, a couple of hours ago: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a huge crowd at the bottom of the stairs; I think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only one way out.... During his meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu, president Trump suggested that aid would be withheld from the Palestinians if they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show respect. He said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they disrespected our great Vice President\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Last November, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t meet Mike Pence during his visit to the Middle East). Trump said (via the White House pool report): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The money is on the table. And the money was never off the table. [Yesterday, it was reported that former US secretary of state John Kerry had advised Abbas not to give in to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demands] Israeli president Benjamin Netanyahu has returned from his meeting with Trump. He says it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excellent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the White House pool report on the Trump-May meeting: President Trump and PM May sat beside one another in a WEF conference room with aides on each side. Among them on US side: Gary Cohn, HR McMaster, Tillerson, Sarah Sanders. Highlights: Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Its a false rumor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that there is tension in the US-UK relationship. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on the same wavelength in I think every respect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The two are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153liking each other a lot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153joined at the hip\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when it comes to the military. He looked at her and said there was nothing that would happen where the US would not be there for Britain. May also reaffirmed the special relationship. When asked about a state visit, May said it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being discussed now. Trump seconded that. No answers to shouted questions about the far right video retweet [back in November, Trump retweeted several anti-Muslim videos] Donald Trump has also talked about the prospect of a trade deal with the UK, but only in very general terms. Trade between the US and the UK is going to increase \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmany times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Trump said during his meeting with May, adding: The discussions...that will be taking place are going to lead to tremendous increase in trade between our countries, which is great for both in terms of jobs. Q: But what about a state visit to Britain? May and Trump say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll talk about that during their meeting at Davos. Several people have come down the stairs where Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meetings are taking place. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve spied IMF chief Christine Lagarde, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, and Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chancellor John McDonnell. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve all been meeting the US president - there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than one room up there. Q: How large an effect does your communication have on exchange rate? When I said communication I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean ECB communication but other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s communication. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t target exchange rate. When someone says a good exchange rate is good, that is targeting exchange rate. That goes back to years ago before the [recent] terms of agreement were agreed. Q:Why did you chooses September to end QE? Commodities are priced in dollars and could effect inflation data. When we recalibrated programme last October we had a discussion whether it should be six or nine months, and how much. So after that we came out with this educated outcome. In defining our objective we have different definitions, including underlying inflation which excludes energy etc. We target headline inflation, but we look at evidence from other definitions. Q: Oil price has risen significantly since December, could that cancel out strong euro. Yes, although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not easy to understand exactly the timing of these compensations. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imply we accept a certain level of exchange rate as a good or bad thing. And with that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over. Q: how do you feel about ECB communications this year including from individual members, could it be improved. What level of concern was there today about a possible change in US policy [after US dollar comments] Yes there was concern. It was broader than simply the exchange rate, but about broader state of international relations right now. If this leads to an unwarranted tightening of monetary policy we would have to think about our monetary policy strategy. On communications, you see same thing in other jurisdictions. All the communiations since Dec have in common three characteristics. All based on commitment to objective of inflation target. None questioned the sequence whereby interest rates will stay at current levels well past end of asset buying programme. Well past was emphasised. Q: Some commentators factoring in an interest rate rise this year? At its current level does euro reflect fundamentals? Based on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data I see very few chances at all that interest rates can be raised this year. On euro, we should ask is it produced by strength of economy, or by statements, or by monetary policy elsewhere. Q: Another question on the G30 membership, could it compromise ECB? Draghi repeats his previous answer, but adds ombudsman said there was no evidence the meeting influenced ECB, and ECB must have contacts with other financial participants. Q: Will differences of views within ECB deepen on exit strategy? At March meeting, will you give restatement of forward guidance. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the differences are as substantive as they were on other occasions. Some are a little more confident, if they live where inflation is rising. But there are not deep existential differences. But there may be differences on when to say certain things, when to move forward. Markets have expectations on path, but also on dates, timelines. In March we will assess how things stand at that point in time. Away from Davis briefly and back with the ECB, and president Mario Draghi said at his press conference that domestic price pressures remained muted, inflation has yet to show a convincing upward trend. He said the recent foreign exchange volatility is a source of uncertainty. An ample degree of monetary stimulus is necessary. On the economy, he said there could be positive growth surprise in the near term. But there were downside risks remain relating to global factors, forex. More on inflation: he said it was expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our measures, rising wage growth etc He then repeats his usual call to governments to do more: To reap the ull benefits from monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute. Structural reform in euro area countries needs to be stepped up . On fiscal policies, the case is strengthened for rebuilding fiscal buffers, especially in in countries where debt remains high. Strengthening EMU remains a priority. Now for questions: Q: What will have to happen for the exchange rate to be a problem for the inflation target? And you said in December you would revisit guidance [on the bond buying programme] early this year? Draghi says there is confusion about the guidance comment, there was no difference between what was said at the December meeting and what Draghi said at the press conference. All that was said was there would have to be discussions about the need to have a discussion in the early part of the year. That discussion hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really started. We went through the events since October to now, trying to assess whether something has changed. There was not much of a change except the strengthening of the economy a little more than expected. By and large the risk to growth is balanced. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t declare victory. Price pressures are muted. Underlying inflation is showing little signs of upward movement. So we simply restated policy. He said the commitment to the inflation target remained firmer than ever. Monetary policy will remain accommodative. On exchange rates he said there were three reasons for volatility. The improvement in the economy, the heightened market sensitivity to perceived changes in our communication. Finally the use of language in discussion exchange rate developments that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed in October in Washington [an agreement between governments on exchange rate policy] Q:Dollar weakness is what you were probably referring to. It must not be helpful to hear a lower dollar is something [US officials] like. Are we heading to currency war scenario. Also, could you envisage ending QE programme in September. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t target exchange rates, they are important for growth and price stability. Movements justified by strength of economy are a fact of natiure. Are there other movements caused by use of language, not parts of terms agreed. Whether that has an effect on our inflation path...inflation is our main concern. Too early to assess whether pass through has already taken place, and what will be extent. Some are questioning the extent of pass through, but large exchange rate movements are bound to have an effect. In Washington - ministers and governments recognised excessive volatily or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse effects. [They agreed] we will refrain from competitive devaluations and will not target exchange rates for competitive purposes. On second question, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any discussion today, but we never stop the programme abruptly. Q: Will you give up you membership of the G30, after ombudsman letter? We received the letter from the ombudsman, we will respond in time. There is a procedure. We will assess the letter and the comments and respond. Q: German pay negotiations. Could there be broad pay increases across eurozone economy following Germany? We observe from a monetary policy angle, where we consider wage growth as a convincing sign of future inflation convergence to our objective. Whether it spreads, depends on conditions of labour market. Tight conditions in Germany, not so in other countries. Q: Are there financial stability risks from long term accommodative policy? Vice president Vitor Constancio answers. No one can talk about asset price bubbles in euro area. We have overstretched valuations in some places for commercial real estate, high yield corporate bonds but nothing else.... We see prices in market are close to fair value. Same is true of housing prices. Fundamental values are in line with fundamental. Prices of houses increasing by 4%, between 2000 and 2006 they were up 7%. So no general situation of overvaluation in residential properties. Some countries have also taken macroprudential policies to combat excesses. The effect on banks of negative rates, taking into account all our policies, they have been favourable to their profitability which is still low but increasing. So negative rates have been absorbed by banking sector. Draghi talks about fiscal buffers. Interest rates will at some point stop being so low. At that point all governments will want to have policy space, so budget consideration now when the time is good is favourable. NF We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve now got video footage of Theresa May and Donald Trump meeting. Trump says he and May have a mutual feeling of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcliking each other a lot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He says there have been a false rumour out there, which he wants to rebut. He tells May: We have great respect for everything you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing, and we love your country. We think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s truly good. Trump says that the US and the UK are working on economic development, trade and military issues. We are very much joined at the hip when it comes to the military Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Trump is over - she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departed the scene without speaking to the press. Next up.... Israel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Benjamin Netanyahu. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gone up the stairs with a small group, presumably to meet Trump. Curiously, Theresa May and a few advisors came down from the Trump meeting.....vanished into another room...reappeared and then went back up again. OK, it looks like Trump and May have been holding their meeting - and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly over.... White House reporters are travelling with Trump - here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the latest pooled reports: Pool arrived at 2:40 at the conference center after brief motorcade through town that includes some small souvenir shops, ski shops, restaurants. There were some JP Morgan flags posted on the route as well. The smattering of onlookers included a few waving American flags and some young kids in ski helmets. A few more photos of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival: I managed a short video clip of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival: President Trump and his entourage then move up the stairs, to a constant clicking of cameras. One delegate welcomes him to Switzerland. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Thank you very much. Great country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump replies. He then continues up another flight of stairs, to an area where most delegates (and journalists) aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allowed. A security guard is now posted there to prevent any intruders. Trump arrives to his audience; reporters shout out a few questions. Asked what his message is to Davos, he replies \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Peace and prosperity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There are a few laughs. Here he comes...... The entire World Economic Forum has gone into a weird semi-lockdown. Half the delegates are crowding around, in a hush, waiting for Trump. The rest are milling around in the corridors and lounges, or getting on with business. Curiously, most delegates are waiting in silence..... President Trump is about to arrive at the World Economic Forum. People are crowding around the security cordon and flocking on the balcony , desperate for a glimpse. Theresa May ends her speech by calling on the World Economic Forum to work together to solve the problems she identified. The UK has a proud history of stepping up and delivering progress that can deliver for all, she says: Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s renew our commitment to collaboration - and set ourselves on a path to benefit all our people. Now, and for generations to come. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it. No questions. Theresa May says technology companies employ some of the brightest minds in the world - they should be able to design a system where unacceptable content is deleted automatically. No-one wants to be known as a a platform for terrorism, or the best place for child pornography, she points out. She says there are three key priorities: Considering whether new regulations are needed for these tech platforms Investors must think about the social impact of the firms they invest in. Working on the ethical implications of Artificial Intelligence Theresa May is now challenging social media companies to do more to protect users - especially children. We want Britain to be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153World leader in innovation-friendly regulation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says (not the catchiest slogan). That means being the safest place in the world to be online, while also being a great place to run a digital business. Technology companies must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153step up to their responsibilities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the PM says sternly. Companies simply cannot stand by while their platforms are used to facilitate child abuse, modern slavery, or the spreading of terrorist and extremist content. Theresa May singles out Uber as an example of the potential,and problems, created by technology. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an innovative company, but it has also got things wrong - with safety issues and concerns about its treatment of workers The solution isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t to shut them down, but to improve the system so companies work better. Employment law must protect workers and give businesses the flexibility it needs, says the PM - it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just be a one-way street. Maybe 2/3 full was an overstatement.... May is pitching to businesses here, saying the government is raising Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s digital skills for the 21st century. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also at the forefront of low-carbon technologies, she declares. And on artificial intelligence, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only at the beginning of what AI can achieve, says May. Those of you up here in Davos mustn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget the plight of those who face losing their job after 20 years, says May. We must channel the power of business and government together to harness technology, and make it a force for good, May continues - to address people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns. I understand the power of business as a force for good. Free markets drive risk-taking that have delivered the great advances of our time. But I also believe in the power of government, she adds. Our new business strategy will make Britain one of the best place in the world to start and run a business, she pledges. Turning to technology, Theresa May says the internet can deliver $2.2 trillion worth of GDP to developing countries. And just last week, a drone saved two boys from drowning off Australia by carrying a float to them. Medical tests show that technology can reduce breast cancer cases by a third. But people are worried about the malevolent impact of technology, she says. Britain will continue to be an advocate of free trade after Brexit, May insists. And she challenges Davos delegates to live up to their commitments, in three ways: The commitments on steel must be implemented. Aid donors must match the UK and help developing countries The World Trade Organisation must do more to keep pace with the global economy - she singles out the service sector, and e-commerce Theresa May begins by saying that last year, she warned that the benefits of free trade weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being shared fairly, and this risked undermining the global world order. One year on, there are grounds for optimism. Global growth is strengthening. The populism of the far left and far right has not made the progress some predicted, and in the UK, unemployment is at a 40-year low and government and business are working together well. Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum, is introducing Theresa May now. The room is roughly two-thirds full - respectable, not as much as for president Macron last night. Schwab says many Davos attendees were impressed last year, by May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s passionate plea to address global slavery. That work continues this year, he says. Cowbells are ringing across the Davos congress centre (yes, really), to tell delegates that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech starts soon. The hall is filling up well, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not packed out yet. One delegate tells me she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hoping to hear some clarity on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future after Brexit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of uncertainty right now\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. At the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lunch in Davos, Philip Hammond insisted that Britain would leave the EU on 31st March 2019. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a statement of political reality, the chancellor insists. Hammond said Britain should go for something more ambitious than previous deals with the EU. An off-the-shelf Norway or Canada agreement won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. Unusually for trade talks, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re starting from a point where we are already deeply interconnected with highly aligned regulatory systems and close co-operation on defence and security. Should go for something much more ambitious than anything that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previously been agreed. Former UK cabinet minister and New Labour architect Peter Mandelson was also at the lunch, and pointed out that French president Emmanuel Macron had hosted 140 CEOs at Versailles the other day. Mandelson warned: For France, Brexit is a gift that keeps on giving. Hammond hit back, though, saying you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get more top CEOs in London on an average day (probably not all meeting a world leader, though!). The European Central Bank has left interest rates unchanged and repeated that its bond buying programme will run until September or beyond if necessary. The ECB added it could increase the programme from its current \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30bn a month if circumstances change: If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the asset purchase programme (APP) in terms of size and/or duration. On rates it said they would be kept at present levels \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Of course the detail will come in president Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference this afternoon, when analysts will be looking for more on the future of the QE programme and when rates might rise. But Draghi must be tempted to keep his cards close to his chest, and avoid anything which could push the euro higher when inflation is still below the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target. NF Donald Trump and his team are staying at the Intercontinental Hotel in Davos. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sensible move from a security point of view; the Intercontinental is at the edge of Davos, rather than slap bang next to the conference centre like the Belvedere (scene of many parties and meeting). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also up a steep hill, so easier to prevent protests . The White House press pack report that they saw onlookers snapping pictures of the Trump convoy, but no demos on the route. Hello... Business Insider\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul Colgan has spotted some anti-Trump protesters outside the conference halls. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very tight security all around the Davos area, making it hard for demonstrators to travel up the mountain and exercise their democratic rights. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d almost think the global elite didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to know what people really think of them.... Chancellor Philip Hammond is cracking some jokes at the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lunch with British business chiefs - including one at Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expense. He reminds his audience that it was a walk in the mountain air that inspired the prime minister to call a general election last year*. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m discouraging her from taking any strolls, Hammond grins. * - (wiping out her majority) Boris Johnson once said that he was put off from visiting parts of New York by the very real risk of meeting Donald Trump. Well in Davos, you also run the very real risk of running into Piers Morgan. The UK journalist and TV personality has done well, though, securing an exclusive sit-down interview with the US president. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to air on Sunday night, with clips released on Friday morning. Davos delegates without a swanky lunch invite (or the time to go) are being fed individual jars of pasta dishes. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great fun to watch the global elite scrambling to over each other whenever the waiting staff emerge with a new tray of goodies. Your humble correspondent finally gets a pot, balances it on his iPad - and is promptly mistaken for a waiter by a fellow delegate who tries to nab it off me. Maybe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for a career change... Trump has touched down in Switzerland, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of him in the Congress Hall yet. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader, Leo Varadkar, is in Davos -- and refusing to accept that Apple got an unfairly good tax deal from the Irish government. In 2016, the EC ruled that Apple had received \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn of state aid. Last November, it referred Ireland to the European Court of Justice because Dublin hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t started reclaiming the cash. According to Varadkar, this process will start soon.....but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not rolling over in the ECJ. Speaking of the CBI, UK retail sales have grown modestly in January so far, according to its latest distributive trades survey, but at a slower pace than anticipated. The survey showed a balance of +12 for January, down from +20 in December. Sales for the time of year were the weakest compared to the norm for more than four years, said the CBI. Orders to suppliers also fell, and looking ahead retailers expect similar growth in sales volumes while orders are forecast to be flat. Anna Leach, CBI head of economic intelligence, said: Retailers have seen fairly modest sales growth this month overall, but it is online retailers who have set the pace during the January sales. Household spending will remain under pressure this year from higher inflation and low wage growth, which will continue to weigh on sales growth in the retail sector. NF British business chiefs and media leaders have headed to a lunchtime event with chancellor Philip Hammond, hosted by the CBI. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a traditional part of the Davos week for the UK delegation, but this year it could be a little frostier than usual. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because CBI chief Caroline Fairbairn declared last week that Britain must remain in the customs union after Brexit. I imagine the Treasury weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t best pleased by this intervention (unless we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve outsourced Brexit negotiations to the CBI...a safer bet than using Carillion, anyway). But we understand that Hammond won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use his speech to rebut Fairbairn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call, and will cover other issues.... My colleague Larry Elliott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s there, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have more details soon.... Theresa May has given an interview to Bloomberg. She spoke about the revelations about sexual harassment at a charity dinner in London, saying: I was frankly appalled when I read the report of this Presidents Club event. I thought that that sort of attitude of the objectification of women was something that was in the past. Sadly, what that event showed is that there is still a lot more work for us to do. That chimes with Malala Yousafzai\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments this morning. Our Politics Live blog has more details: We hear that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Donald Trump will take place shortly after her speech (which starts at 2pm, or 1pm GMT). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to focus on foreign affairs issues like Syria and North Korea. Theresa May has now ended her private meeting (perhaps a roundtable?) and swept the WEF congress hall in a gaggle of aides. Down the stairs at pace, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quickly into another secure section of this rabbit-warren of a building. Disappointingly she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop for questions - a camera had been lined up, just in case. Still, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear from her in a couple of hours. Chancellor Philip Hammond has told the Davos panel on financial risks that Europe will lose out if the City suffers after Brexit. New York and Singapore would benefit from new business, he says, not European cities. The idea that you can recreate London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial centre anywhere else is a fantasy. Hammond also says that financial services are very important to the UK side, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the centre of our negotiating strategy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Those who say the financial sector will not be part of a deal have not been looking at the numbers, he says. We have a trade deficit of \u00c2\u00a3100bn with Europe, and a surplus in services of \u00c2\u00a340bn, Hammond explains, adding: The only deal that can be done is one that can be fair to both parties One that included trade and not services would not be fair to the UK. Theresa May and her entourage have just swept through the Davos congress centre, into a private meeting room. Alas media are certainly not allowed in to listen. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treasury secretary, Stephen Mnuchin is also on the panel on the future of finance. Yesterday, Mnuchin sent the dollar tumbling by saying a weak currency is good for exports. Today, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very relaxed about the whole issue, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the short term where the dollar is is not a concern of mine. It is not something I spend a lot of time thinking about.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mnuchin also denies that America is trying to launch a trade war, insisting that the US doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want less trade it wants \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fair trade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The big debate on financial stability is also underway. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, says trade is one of the factors leading to stronger growth. When asked about the risks of a trade war, she says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Who would want to do anything that would lead to weaker growth? Al Gore, former US vice-president, has suggested that Donald Trump can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disrupt the battle against climate change - especially if he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reelected in 2020. Speaking on a panel here in Davos, Gore says there is strong momentum to fight climate change. Several governors of our largest states, hundreds of cities, and thousands of US businesses are now ensuring that the US will not just meet, but exceed, the commitments it made in the Paris Agreement. Gore explains that America can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t legally leave the Paris Agreement (to act to limit rising global temperatures) until after the next presidential election. And if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new president (at which point Al Gore offers a silent prayer), they could give 30 days notice and America would be back in the agreement. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the good news. The bad news, Gore says, is that the maximum action that is political feasible falls far short of the minimum of what is needed to battle climate change. So, we need to move the boundary of what politicians can do. You can watch the panel live, here. Back in the UK, and mortgage approvals by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks fell to their lowest level since April 2013 in December, according to trade association UK Finance. Banks approved 36,115 mortgages for housebuying, down from 39,007 in November and 19% lower than a year ago. Annual growth in consumer credit slipped from 0.8% to 0.7%. And this could give the Bank of England a problem: NF Newsflash: Theresa May has met with South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa.....and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a fondue dish in sight either. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former press chief has caused a stir this morning, accusing the PM of spending last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Davos \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sitting in a hotel eating fondue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rather than meeting fellow world leaders and business chiefs. Writing in The Times, Katy Perrior claims the PM struggled to schmooze at the 2017 World Economic Forum, and even turned up with the wrong sort of footwear (her new \u00c2\u00a3120 snowboots should work better this time). Perrior claiming business leaders were frozen out by May: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcElsewhere they get personal audiences with President Macron in France and Malcolm Turnbull in Australia but not so much as a digestive biscuit from the PM. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDoes she have any idea how frustrating that is for them? Other world leaders are on a charm offensive, desperate to woo major businesses to their shores. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAs we count down to post-Brexit Britain, she would do well to spend less time enjoying the fondue and more time meeting and greeting.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 More here. Personally, I was disappointed not to see May meeting business chiefs and academics at Oxford University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excellent Davos cheese and port party last night (maybe I left too early #bestbehaviour ) Perrior also claims May turned down the chance to meet Alibaba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jack Ma last year. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still at Davos, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still time to make amends, prime minister... Kristin Lemkau, JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief marketing officer, sums up Davos so far: Sterling continues to go from strength to strength. In Asia overnight it hit $1.4328, and although it has eased back from that, it is still up 0.11% so far today at $1.4255. It is partly the expectation of an earlier than expected UK rate rise, given the recent strong data including Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment and wages figures. But of course there is also the weak dollar, hit recently by the expectation that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts would raise the already hefty US deficit. More immediately Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin told Davos the US wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worried about a flagging greenback. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale said: Steven Mnuchin (US Treasury Secretary) went to Davos and said that a weaker dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcis good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He also pointed out that that he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t concerned by where it is in the short term and that in the longer term, its strength is a reflection of the strength of the US economy. In other words, he said very little really, but he said it under snow-plastered slopes and he was speaking to a market where dollar bulls have been under the cosh. A few more capitulated. Against the euro the pound is pretty flat, down just 0.01% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1473 ahead of the latest European Central Bank meeting. But the euro is up against the dollar, 0.11% better at $1.2421. The strength of the euro presents a problem for ECB president Mario Draghi. If he appears too bulllish at hinting at an end to the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE programme, the euro will appreciate even further. And that would keep a lid on inflation which is already below the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target. Equally, he cannot ignore the improving European economy. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets explains: With headline inflation remaining well below its 2% target rate at 1.4% and an economy that continues to show decent levels of economic activity the ECB is faced with having to navigate the minefield of guiding markets over the tightrope of communicating a credible timeline for stimulus reduction and interest rate policy, while trying to move CPI back to target against the difficulty of a rising currency. Since the beginning of 2017 the euro has risen 18% against the US dollar and could well rise even further given yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks by US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin. Last week ECB vice president Vitor Constancio along with Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ewald Nowotny expressed concern about recent exchange rate movements. These concerns are likely to have increased in recent days which will make today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference by ECB President Mario Draghi much more interesting. He can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very well ignore the improving outlook but if he comes across as too bullish the euro could well be well on the way to the 1.3000 level by the end of this quarter. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said: Draghi would have to adopt a delicate approach and seek a strategy which stops the euro from firming further. The only way out of this situation for him would be to emphasize that the process of the rate hikes is not within sight yet. The market is expecting a rate hike in 2019 from the ECB, Draghi would have to pull a rabbit out of hat in order to convince the market that rate hike isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the agenda and market participants are getting ahead of themselves. We do think that overly dovish statement by the European central bank is priced in the euro to some extent. If Draghi fails to convince the market or if he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound as dovish as the market is expecting, we think that the euro can take off from here. I think the risk to the downside for the euro are limited, it is the upside move which would be more exciting. NF Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conservative Party has confirmed she will hold social media giants to account in Davos: Bruce Carnegie-Brown, chairman of Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, says that companies are taking out more insurance against cyber attacks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is the fastest growing part of our business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Carnegie-Brown says, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Companies are certainly becoming more concerned about the risks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has 30% of the global market, Carnegie-Brown says, with 85% of the business coming from US firms. The insurance market is changing, he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are more concerned about cyber attack than a fire when it comes to the potential impact on their business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carnegie-Brown says he has been floating the idea in Davos that governments might use part of their aid budgets to insure poor developing countries against the cost of natural disasters. Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s will pay out almost $5b to the US states affected by the three hurricanes last year but says the world as a whole is under-insured. Malala also warns that world leaders need to invest more in education, to help future generations. Malala Yousafzai, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s youngest Nobel Prize winner, is speaking at Davos right now, about the importance of giving girls equal rights to education. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s explaining that education can play a key role in improving giving the message of equality. So what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your message to Trump on the issue of gender equality, asks Miriam Elder of Buzzfeed. Yousafzai says: I get so disappointed to see that people in these high positions openly talk against women, do not accept women as equals, they harass woman. It is just shocking to think that is is happening I hope that women stand up and speak out against it. I hope that people who are involved in such shameful things think about their own daughters, their own mothers, their own close female relations, and just imagine for a second, could they let it happen to them? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they would accept that. Malala, who was shot by the Taliban in 2012 after campaigning for girls education, says women must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153raise up their voice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and reach the ears and minds of those who still hold views which we hoped didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist any more Just in: chancellor Philip Hammond says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very happy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the strength of sterling, which has hit its highest level since the Brexit vote. Foreign exchange rates are a big story at Davos, after America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin seemed to hint that Washington liked a weaker dollar Some of President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top officials are briefing the press again this morning. Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross is in combative mood, denying that America is protectionist - even though it just slapped new tariffs on washing machines and solar panels from Asia. Ross also says that America is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more interested\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in bilateral trade deals than multilateral ones - which doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bode very well for the ongoing NAFTA negotiations. John McDonnell, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chancellor, is also in Davos, and bringing a warning for the global elite: McDonnell will be telling top business people and world leaders that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re dangerously insulated from the problems outside WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security cordon and swanky parties: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many of those attending the World Economic Forum have been patting themselves on the back as international growth figures have begun to pick up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But they should be worried. In the real world, outside the Davos bubble of Alpine restaurants and chalets, the global economic system they have built isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working for billions of people. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And just as Davos faces the risk of an avalanche this week, growth for a few risks a political and social avalanche unless there is fundamental change to our rigged economic system. Philip Hammond, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chancellor of the Exchequer, is also at Davos. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been giving his views about artificial intelligence at a Microsoft breakfast, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are at the point where computers move from being dumb and fast to being smart and fast.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hammond says AI is going to be disruptive and managing the process is the key to it being accepted, warning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To many it will seem to be a big threat to their prosperity and livelihoods\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Losers would include members of the middle class but it was important to embrace the new technology rather than resist it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not create a generation of 21st Century Luddites who feel the only chance of survival is to resist change.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hammond said AI would affect the jobs market, would disrupt business models and had ethical dimensions including privacy and the way new technology could be used in wars. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The choice is simple: do we look inward or outward, look to the future or cleave to the past?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here are some photos of Donald Trump setting off to Davos last night: Good morning from Davos. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another big day at the World Economic Forum, with Theresa May giving a keynote speech this afternoon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and meeting Donald Trump on the sidelines. The UK PM is expected to put technology giants under pressure to clean up their act and tackle extreme content. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say: Investors can make a big difference here by ensuring trust and safety issues are being properly considered. And I urge them to do so. These companies simply cannot stand by while their platforms are used to facilitate child abuse, modern slavery or the spreading of terrorist and extremist content.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Her meeting with Trump will be a chance to talk trade after Brexit, discuss terrorism, and perhaps patch up that Special Relationship after the row over the US embassy. As Beth Rigby from Sky News puts it: The two leaders are expected to focus on areas where there is common ground in international affairs: North Korea, as well as eradicating Islamic State in Syria and northern Iraq. They might touch on Iran. But the thornier issue of Russian aggression in Europe is less likely to be raised as the Prime Minister seeks to soothe relations and not stoke further tensions. President Trump set off for Davos last night - part of the biggest US delegation ever. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be hearing more from his team this morning. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also masses of other events, covering gender equality, financial stability, tax avoidance and climate change.

Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>US 10s [ten year bond yields] just hit 2.71%, while German bund yields are also on the march higher with the 5-year turning positive for the first time since 2015.

At this stage in the cycle it makes sense for yields to be climbing but breakout beyond the 30-year trend line does signal the bond bears are here at last. A spike to 3% in the 10-year now looks very possible and a bond market rout could spook the market. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a6ee940e4b0d3de59ee3fc6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-29T09:31:34.690Z\">9.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank says it will keep a prudent and neutral monetary policy, but admits the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy still has problems, including high debt levels and the risks of an asset bubble.</p> <p>It added in its latest bulletin that it had the right conditions to keep the renminbi basically stable, and said a two way fluctuation in yuan rates would become the norm.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-29T09:39:40.371Z\">at 9.39am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a6ede6ae4b0530bd3483689\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-29T08:48:58.343Z\">8.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Julian Dunkerton, the co-founder of Superdry, is nearly \u00c2\u00a318m richer after selling part of his stake in the fashion retailer.</p> <p>Dunkerton, which is now the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s product and brand director, sold one million shares at the end of last week at \u00c2\u00a317.80 each.

ING foreign exchange strategist Viraj Patel says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In an action-packed week for global markets, the main event will be President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s State of the Union address (Tueday 2100 ET) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is set to outline the administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2018 policy agenda ahead of the pivotal November midterms. With US trade policy in particular focus, the burning question for investors is which type of Donald Trump will turn up: Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde?</p> <p>While the former manifestation may have appealed to the international elite at Davos, we would not be entirely surprised to see the more fiery characteristics of the President surface back on home soil in Washington. Indeed, with President Trump fighting low approval ratings, fresh allegations that he wanted to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller last year and with little policy progress to show (beyond the Tax Bill) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s every chance that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAmerica First\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 policy talk has a protectionist sting in the tail this week. As such, we expect global risk sentiment to remain on red alert ahead of the speech \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with outside risks that USD/JPY could fall to the 107.00 level on a more contentious Trump State of the Union address.</p> <p>As for the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broader trajectory, it will now be very difficult for Washington to put the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcweak dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 genie back in the bottle. The damage is already done \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and with structural factors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as a late US economic cycle, relative US asset valuations and the twin current account and fiscal deficits \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all supporting a weaker dollar trend, the naturally tendency will be for the greenback to fall over the course of 2018. Add a US political and policy uncertainty premium into the mix \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline could transpire quicker than what we had initially expected.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a6ecfdfe4b0d3de59ee3f4f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-29T07:40:57.568Z\">7.40am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The weaker pound and euro are expected to give some support to stock markets when they open.:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/957863725611929600\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">European Opening Calls:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FTSE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FTSE</a> 7678 +0.16%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DAX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DAX</a> 13378 +0.28%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CAC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CAC</a> 5546 +0.31%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MIB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MIB</a> 23899 +0.17%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IBEX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#IBEX</a> 10631 +0.34%</p>&mdash; IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/957863725611929600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 29, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a6ec8bbe4b03d22f608b5cd\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-29T07:38:51.845Z\">7.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Agenda: Currencies in focus as dollar strengthens</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong></p> <p>The dollar has been under pressure for some time now, and is set for its worst start to a year for around 30 years.

                "bodyText":"With the dollar recovering from its recent weakness, and continuing uncertainty over Brexit, the pound has come under pressure today and is currently 0.63% lower at $1.4080. Meanwhile bonds prices are falling and yields rising, as central banks increasingly look to move away from their low interest rate and QE programmes which have supported markets for several years now. German and US yields in particular have move sharply higher. In the US, the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred measure of inflation - the PCE index - was in line with expections, up from 0.1% in November to 0.2% last month. But the savings rate fell to a more than 12 year low. Elsewhere the European Union has warned Donald Trump it is ready to retaliate on trade if the US tries to crack down on imports. And cryptocurrencies were back in the spotlight on concerns about a crackdown in Japan after hackers stole $400m from the Coincheck exchange. Finally, accountancy firm KPMG is to be investigated by the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Reporting Council over its role in the collapse of construction group Carillion. On that note, it is time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. With the recovery in the dollar, a decline in bond prices and a busy week ahead, US markets have slipped back from their record levels. As well as the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest interest rate setting meeting, there is the State of the Union address and a host of results from the likes of Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon. Apple is already weighing on the markets, following reports it would make half the number of planned iPhone Xs this quarter. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped 37 points or 0.15%, the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.26% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.32%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full report on the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning to Donald Trump over trade. Daniel Boffey writes: Brussels has warned that it stands ready to retaliate and potentially open up a transatlantic trade war if the US delivers on apparent threats to restrict European imports. The US president, Donald Trump, claimed in an interview with ITV broadcast on Sunday that the EU had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very unfair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on American exporters, and that it would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153morph into something very big\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153turn out to be very much to [the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] detriment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Washington is currently examining the case for protecting US economic interests on national security grounds, including the imposition of import tariffs on aluminium and steel. Responding to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, a spokesman for the European commission told reporters in Brussels that the EU was ready to hit back if its importers were made to suffer. The spokesman said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For us trade policy is not a zero sum game. It is not about winners and losers. We here in the European Union believe that trade can and should be win-win. The full report is here: The latest set of US inflation figures have risen in December in line with forecasts. The personal consumption expenditures price index - it may be a mouthful but it is the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred measure of inflation - climbed from 0.1% in November to 0.2% last month. On an annual basis it rose 1.5%, the same as in November. It is still below the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. Meanwhile consumer spending increased by 0.4% last month, again in line with expectations. The November figure was revised upwards from an initial reading of 0.6% to 0.8%. Personal income rose 0.4%, up from 0.3% in November, while wages increased by 0.5%. The savings rate fell to 2.4% from 2.5% in November, the lowest level since September 2005. Stock markets are pretty steady at the moment, but will that last if bond yields continue to climb? On the weak pound, financial analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: With little else to focus on investors turned their attention to Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent bout of Tory turbulence, much to the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s displeasure. The Prime Minister is dealing with the umpteenth swell of dissent over the state of her leadership, while at the same time having to try and quash the latest beef between her warring ministers, this round sparked by leaked Whatsapp messages from climate change minister Claire Perry calling Brexit voters \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcswivel-eyed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Add onto that the Lords constitution committee labelling the EU withdrawal bill as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfundamentally flawed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 just one day before the legislation is set to be debated, alongside a warning from EU leaders that the UK is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnot ready\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to secure a divorce deal, and there was plenty for the previously soaring pound to fret about. The pound continues to slip back against the dollar, and is now down 0.66% at $1.4074. Against the euro, sterling is down 0.32% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1352. As well as the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery, the pound is being hit by renewed Brexit uncertainty, after the continuing splits in the Conservative party and the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perceived weakness. President Trump said at Davos on Friday that he wanted free and fair trade, comments which did little to assuage fears of a possible trade war. Especially since they followed the imposition of tariffs on washing machines and solar panels from China and South Korea. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Friday did nothing to increase [concerns about a trade war], but neither did they assuage them. His comments that the US wanted free but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trade suggested that he would not be shy in confronting what he considered unfair trade practices, potentially putting him on a collision course with China, as well as the European Union. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a response from Europe: On a lighter note: Is this the end of the battle for the sunbed? Thomas Cook is offering holidaymakers the chance to pre-book sun loungers, eliminating the need for the dawn dash to the pool to bag one with a towel. For \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25, customers will be able to book a specific sun lounger for their entire holiday. The Anglo-German company says it is the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first package holiday firm to offer this service, which it is trialling at three hotels in Lanzarote, Gran Canaria and Fuerteventura from the end of February. Customers will receive an email six days before departure asking if they would like to choose their sunbed in advance. They will be able to choose their preferred spot on a pool plan featuring a compass to help them work out what time of the day areas will be in the sun or shade. Read more here: The FTSE 100 is currently managing to stay in positive territory, just. But European markets have slipped back after a bright early start. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index is up 0.13% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dipped 0.23% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is down 0.07%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is expected to open some 37 points lower, but Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, reckons US markets could generally be a better bet than European bourses. He said: The FTSE 100 [is] gaining ground thanks to a weaker pound and a strengthening price of copper. Rising copper prices have helped boost the commodity-heavy FTSE 100, with Anglo American, Glencore, Rio Tinto, and Antofagasta helping drive the index into the green. After last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses, UK traders will hope that this will represent the beginning of a resurgence for the FTSE, yet with the dollar devaluation likely to drive the pound higher yet, it makes more sense to be long US markets over their European counterparts. Today sees a somewhat serene start to what is likely to be a fairly frantic week, with the second half providing a whole host of top tier economic data points to drive market sentiment. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state of the union address tomorrow sees the market focus shift back to US economic prospects, and with the potential for a raft of infrastructure projects around the corner, there is another good reason to be long US stocks. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Reuters report on the earlier Chinese central bank comments: China will consider including shadow banking, property financing and internet financing in its macro-prudential assessment (MPA), central bank vice governor Yi Gang wrote on Monday, according to China Finance, a publication under the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-biggest economy still has problems and hidden dangers as the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt levels are still high while asset bubble risks have not yet been fully contained, Yi wrote. The central bank will maintain prudent and neutral monetary policy while seeking to increase flexibility and effectiveness of liquidity management, Yi said. China has conditions to keep the yuan basically stable, Yi said, adding that the regulator will look to increase the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate flexibility. Back in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, bitcoin is down 3.5% at $11,284 on fears of a further crackdown by regulators, this time in Japan. This follows news that one exchange, Coincheck, would refund around $400m to customers after hackers stole holdings in NEM, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenth biggest cryptocurrency. NEM is currently down around 8%. Fiona Cincotta at City Index said: This incident highlights one of the biggest concerns towards crypto currencies, namely security. The Japanese government have ordered Coincheck to beef up its security to prevent a repeat incident, as more authorities are clamping down on the virtual currency. Given the headline grabbing numbers, this hack is unlikely to disappear into headline history fast. Japan is one of the largest markets for cryptocurrency trading, accounting for around 30% -40% of global traded volume last month. Should this hack seriously dent confidence in virtual currencies, Bitcoin could see the selloff extended. Bond prices are coming under pressure on the growing signs that central banks are moving away from their low interest rate and QE programmes. With the US economy growing at 2.6% in the final quarter and the Bank of Japan governor saying inflation was close to reaching its target, US Treasury bonds fell and the yield [or interest rate] rose. In Europe comments over the weekend from Klass Knot, head of the Dutch central bank, that the ECB should clarify how it will end its asset purchases have also hit the bond market. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yield on its five year bonds has risen to 0.004%, the first time it has been in positive territory for more than three years. French and Dutch bond yields have climbed to their highest levels since July. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: US 10s [ten year bond yields] just hit 2.71%, while German bund yields are also on the march higher with the 5-year turning positive for the first time since 2015. It does look like this is capitulation time for bond bulls as yields are entering breakout mode, which will have important consequences for equity valuations. At this stage in the cycle it makes sense for yields to be climbing but breakout beyond the 30-year trend line does signal the bond bears are here at last. A spike to 3% in the 10-year now looks very possible and a bond market rout could spook the market. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank says it will keep a prudent and neutral monetary policy, but admits the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy still has problems, including high debt levels and the risks of an asset bubble. It added in its latest bulletin that it had the right conditions to keep the renminbi basically stable, and said a two way fluctuation in yuan rates would become the norm. Julian Dunkerton, the co-founder of Superdry, is nearly \u00c2\u00a318m richer after selling part of his stake in the fashion retailer. Dunkerton, which is now the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s product and brand director, sold one million shares at the end of last week at \u00c2\u00a317.80 each. That amounts to 1.23% of the company and still leaves him with more than 25%, making him its largest shareholder. Superdry shares have surged 20% over the past year but an update earlier this month saw them slip back after it revealed a 28% fall in half year profits. More on the collapse of construction group Carillion. Julia Kollewe reports: Accountancy firm KPMG is to be investigated by the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Reporting Council over its role in the collapse of Carillion. The business secretary, Greg Clark, welcomed the investigation, which the accounting watchdog said followed inquiries made since Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock profit warning in July. The FRC said it would conduct the investigation, which will cover 2014 to 2016, and additional audit work carried out during 2017, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 as quickly and thoroughly as possible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Carillion went into compulsory liquidation two weeks ago with debts of \u00c2\u00a31.3bn, a pension deficit of nearly \u00c2\u00a31bn and a host of unfinished public contracts. The full story is here: The move comes ahead of a select committee hearing tomorrow with the FRC, the Insolvency Service and Carillion pension trustees. MPs have already accused the Pensions Regulator of failing to act while Carillion racked up debts to pay dividends and executive bonuses, as the business built up a pension deficit that reached nearly \u00c2\u00a31bn by the time it collapsed this month. As expected, most European markets have opened in positive territory - just about - helped by the weakness of the pound and euro against the dollar. A weaker currency gives a boost to exporters, with the FTSE 100 in particular packed with overseas earners. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index is up 0.14%, also benefiting from positive performances by mining groups after a 1% rise in the copper price. But drinks group Diageo, one of those which might be expected to benefit from a weaker pound, is down nearly 1% after a downgrade by analysts at RBC. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac have climbed 0.1%, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is up 0.17% but Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex has dipped 0.2%. Despite the prospect of further US interest rate rises this year, ING Bank believes the dollar weakness is likely to continue (notwithstanding today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move higher.) Apart from the US inflation data later and the two day Federal Reserve meeting which starts tomorrow, there is another big event which could have a major impact on the curreny. ING foreign exchange strategist Viraj Patel says: In an action-packed week for global markets, the main event will be President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s State of the Union address (Tueday 2100 ET) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is set to outline the administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2018 policy agenda ahead of the pivotal November midterms. With US trade policy in particular focus, the burning question for investors is which type of Donald Trump will turn up: Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde? While the former manifestation may have appealed to the international elite at Davos, we would not be entirely surprised to see the more fiery characteristics of the President surface back on home soil in Washington. Indeed, with President Trump fighting low approval ratings, fresh allegations that he wanted to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller last year and with little policy progress to show (beyond the Tax Bill) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s every chance that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAmerica First\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 policy talk has a protectionist sting in the tail this week. As such, we expect global risk sentiment to remain on red alert ahead of the speech \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with outside risks that USD/JPY could fall to the 107.00 level on a more contentious Trump State of the Union address. As for the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broader trajectory, it will now be very difficult for Washington to put the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcweak dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 genie back in the bottle. The damage is already done \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and with structural factors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as a late US economic cycle, relative US asset valuations and the twin current account and fiscal deficits \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all supporting a weaker dollar trend, the naturally tendency will be for the greenback to fall over the course of 2018. Add a US political and policy uncertainty premium into the mix \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline could transpire quicker than what we had initially expected. The weaker pound and euro are expected to give some support to stock markets when they open.: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The dollar has been under pressure for some time now, and is set for its worst start to a year for around 30 years. Conversely US stock markets are making their best start for the same period, partly due to that very dollar weakness. Concerns that President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reforms will add to the already hefty US deficit have undermined sentiment for the US currency, as has the prospect of a trade war which picked up pace last week as the US slapped tariffs on washing machines and solar panels from China and South Korea. Contrasting comments at Davos did not help. Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin said he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind a weak dollar, then Trump said virtually the opposite a day or so later. But the weakness in the dollar looks like it might be starting to attract some bargain hunters, with the currency regaining a little ground in Asia and edging higher in Europe. And although the Federal Reserve is expected to make no move on interest rates at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting - the swansong for Janet Yellen as Fed chair - further rises are expected this year. Later today come some US inflation figures which are likely to influence whether the dollar can hold onto its gains. Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group said: Investors will now look ahead to the release of US PCE [personal consumption expenditure] figures, the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred measure of inflation. Month on month inflation is expected to have increased 0.2% in December, from 0.1%. Meanwhile, on a annualised basis a constant reading of 1.5% is forecast. Given the ongoing concerns at the Fed over the sluggish inflation in the US, a higher reading this afternoon, could help cement the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bounce. At the moment the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery has left the pound 0.28% lower at $1.4128 while against the euro sterling has dipped 0.1% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1376. As well as being affected by the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery, the pound is being undermined by renewed Brexit concerns, with peers saying the EU withdrawal bill needs to be withdrawn and the prime minister under growing pressure amid calls for the chancellor to be sacked. The US PCE figures are due at 1.30pm GMT, which is the main item on the economic agenda.",

The eurozone even grew faster than the U.S., which expanded by 2.3 percent.</p> <p>In the decade since 2007, the eurozone has had to grapple with one crisis after another, starting with the financial crash of 2008 that prompted the deepest worldwide recession since World War II. That exposed the weak underbelly of the eurozone the state of the public finances in a number of member economies. </p> <p>Four countries Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus had to be bailed out by their partners in the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund, and in return they made deep budget cuts to get their public finances into shape, hitting their economies hard.</p> <p>The Greek economy, for example, shed around a quarter of its output, and saw unemployment and poverty levels ratchet higher. </p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only recently that fears of a eurozone break-up have eased.

David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says another factor for the US market decline is concern about what the Federal Reserve will say tomorrow at the end of its two day meeting: Profit taking is rife on Wall Street as the hefty declines last night has spooked traders and now the selling has intensified. Investors have been concerned about the US stock market being overbought for some time, and now it seems the jitters are setting in. The chatter is the Federal Reserve will raise growth and inflation expectations, and that is pushing up US government bond yields, which are now at a rate that is attractive to investors. The jump from stocks to bonds could continue until we hear from the US central bank tomorrow. The US dollar index has fallen to a three year low, and that is likely to lead to inflation as imports are tipped to become more expensive. The perception that inflation will rise is fuelling the rise in US government bond yields. Despite Goldman Sachs talking of a possible market correction, not everyone agrees. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s State of the Union address later could give a renewed lift to flagging markets: The global stock selloff has persisted into a second day, with overnight losses in Asia giving way to widespread selling in Europe and the US. Interestingly, with gold and the yen gaining ground over recent weeks, there has clearly been an underlying risk-off move waiting to rear its head. However, with treasuries selling off throughout the beginning of 2018, there is reason to believe that market confidence will not be gone for long, as investors shift away from bonds amid improved economic and corporate performance... The focus is going to shift firmly onto the US from here on, as markets brace themselves for Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s State of the Union address. Despite the pause in the US equity rally, there is reason to believe that Trump could provide enough of a boost to see us back into the highs yet again. Talk of a $1.5 trillion infrastructure package may simply be words for now, but with the tax reforms passed, there is a growing belief that Donald Trump can finally deliver. Away from the markets, and Bank of England governor Mark Carney is appearing in front of the House of Lords economic affairs committee. He is being quizzed on forecasting (timely, given the latest Brexit forecast confusion). My colleague Andrew Sparrow is monitoring Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance in the politics live blog here: As markets continue to wobble, Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell said: The US open was not a welcome sight for the European indices, with an ugly start from the Dow Jones infecting the FTSE et al. The Dow Jones plunged a stomach-churning 300 points after the bell, hitting an 8 day low of just under 26150 as investors stared down the barrel of an incredibly hectic rest of the week. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the unknown of this evening\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s State of the Union address from Donald Trump; the first Fed meeting of the year on Wednesday, with rising bond yields suggesting something hawkish; and a non-farm Friday that may become even more important than normal dependant on what the central bank say mid-week. Interestingly the dollar, which had been mounting something of a comeback as recent as this morning, completely gave up the ghost this Tuesday afternoon. Having at one point fallen below $1.40, cable jumped 0.4% to re-cross $1.41, while against the euro the greenback shed 0.3%, allowing the single currency back above $1.24. All this spelt disaster for the European indices. The FTSE plunged 70 points, falling below 7600 for the first time in more than a month. The DAX and CAC, meanwhile, dropped 0.8% apiece, hitting 13210 and 5475 respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 300 points, which puts it on course for its biggest one day fall since May last year. Added to Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 177 point decline, it would be the biggest two day points fall since June 2016 after Britain voted to leave the EU. US consumer confidence remains strong, according to a new report from the Conference Board. Its confidence index climbed to 125.4 in January from 1 revised figure of 123.1 in the previous month. Analysts had been expecting 123.1. (The survey was taken before this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline on Wall Street of course.) The decline on Wall Street has meant the falls in Europe have accelerated. The FTSE 100 is now down nearly 1%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dropped 0.9% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has fallen 0.8%. Trevor Greetham, head of multi asset at Royal London Asset Management, said: Global stock markets dipped on Tuesday on concerns about rising US interest rates and high equity valuations. This sell-off doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come as a surprise. Investor sentiment has been getting very frothy, with our composite sentiment indicator hitting its highest reading since March 2017 this week. The recent increase in share prices has been powered by the prospect of large corporate tax cuts in America so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s noteworthy that US company directors have started to sell shares in their own companies in large numbers. With expectations running high, we think the sell-off may have further to run and we reduced our exposure to equities in our multi asset funds yesterday, although we still remain overweight stocks. With the world economy strong and interest rates low, we would probably buy a more pronounced dip. The worst performer in the Dow is, unsurprisingly, United Healthcare: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the new healthcare partnership causing all the fuss: US markets have come under renewed pressure, as investors face the prospect of rising interest rates and the withdrawal of central banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bond buying programmes. With bond prices falling ahead of the latest Federal Reserve decision (no move is expected yet but there is a growing expectation of at least three more rises this year) the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 230 points or 0.9% in early trading. After Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 177 point fall, that would mark the first two day decline since December. But bear in mind, US markets had hit new peaks as recently as Friday. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.8% lower and the Nasdaq Composite fell just over 1%. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: The rise in global sovereign bond yields has unsettled investors and hit riskier assets. US 10s are holding above 2.7%, while the 30-year T note is approaching 3%. Certainly the dynamics have shifted in bond markets. Central banks are either out of the market or buying fewer bonds. The Fed is now in the business of selling not buying. The ECB seems to be teeing up a short taper that could see QE end in September, which is a shade earlier than most anticipated back in December. The BoJ is also tilting towards normalisation, albeit much more slowly. Earlier this week Goldman Sachs warned of a possible market correction. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whatever the trigger, a correction of some kind seems a high probability in the coming months,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Peter Oppenheimer, the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief global equity strategist. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[But] the continuation of low core inflation and easy monetary policy suggests that a correction is more likely than a bear market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A sharp decline in healthcare stocks is also hitting the market today, after Amazon, Warren Buffett and JP Morgan teamed up to form their own healthcare partnership. Ahead of Wall Street opening, Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, said: Global equity bulls failed to make an appearance during Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading session as higher U.S. bond yields and caution ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting weighed heavily on sentiment. World shares were under renewed selling pressure today with Asian shares tumbling lower during early trade, following Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steep declines overnight. In Europe, equities tumbled amid the lack of appetite for risk. With Wall Street suffering its largest drop in more than four months on Monday, U.S. stocks could remain pressured by the negative sentiment this afternoon. The eurozone has posted its strongest growth in a decade. The region grew by 2.5% last year, the best performance since the financial crisis. Economists think Europe is going to have another good year. France and Spain led the way. France racked up its fastest growth since 2011, thanks to stronger business spending, while Spain notched up another year of 3%+ growth. But in the UK, new figures show that consumers racked up more credit last month. Mortgage approvals fell to a near three-year low. Over in America, Amazon is piling into the health market in partnership with JP Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway. Shares in healthcare firms are down heavily in pre-market trading. European markets in the red, amid speculation that shares could be heading for a correction. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to get worse when Wall Street opens in half an hour... PwC also made this chart, showing how the eurozone outperformed other major economies last year: Getting back to the eurozone growth figures...Barret Kupelian, senior economist at PwC, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The good news keeps on coming from the Eurozone, which grew at a quarterly rate of 0.6% in the last quarter of 2017. Even though this is slightly slower than the previous quarter, the fuller picture for 2017 is overwhelmingly positive, with growth in the Eurozone ahead of the UK, US and Japan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Taking a more historical look at the growth track record of large advanced economies, the Eurozone can now boast holding the title of the fastest growing large advanced economy four times since the financial crisis compared to three times for the US and the UK and once for Japan. PwC also expect the eurozone to do well in 2018, unless any \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmajor unexpected shocks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hit the global economy. Kupelian says: In our main scenario projection, we expect the Eurozone to grow by at least 2%, marking its strongest two-year streak since the global financial crisis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here. Economists are continuing to welcome today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s French GDP figures, which showed a strong pick-up in business investment. This is from Emily Mansfield of the Economist Intelligence Unit (GFCF = gross fixed capital formation, or the purchase of new assets) Nikolay Markov, senior economist at Pictet Asset Management, hopes this trend will continue: The selloff continues! Wall Street is heading for a second day of losses, as heathcare companies are hit by the surprise arrival of Amazon in their sector... Investors in US healthcare firms may need a lie-down, possibly with a cold flannel.... In other news....retail giant Amazon, Warren Buffett\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Berkshire Hathaway and Wall Street titan JPMorgan have announced a curious tie-up. The three companies are going to create a not-for-profit company to give their own staff high-quality and transparent healthcare. Veteran investor Warren Buffett suggests the trio are keen to shake up the way healthcare is provided in America. Buffett says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy. Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable. Rather, we share the belief that putting our collective resources behind the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best talent can, in time, check the rise in health costs while concurrently enhancing patient satisfaction and outcomes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pan Pylas of Associated Press has a good take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures: The eurozone economy, for so long a source of uncertainty, has enjoyed its best year in a decade, clear evidence it has broken out of its prolonged and acute debt crisis that raised fears about the very survival of the euro currency. In its first estimate for the fourth quarter, Eurostat, the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics agency, said Tuesday that the eurozone expanded by 0.6 percent in the October-December period from the three months before. That more-than-healthy level of growth means that for the whole of 2017, the eurozone economy expanded by 2.5 percent, its best performance since 2007, when it grew 3 percent. The eurozone even grew faster than the U.S., which expanded by 2.3 percent. In the decade since 2007, the eurozone has had to grapple with one crisis after another, starting with the financial crash of 2008 that prompted the deepest worldwide recession since World War II. That exposed the weak underbelly of the eurozone the state of the public finances in a number of member economies. Four countries Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus had to be bailed out by their partners in the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund, and in return they made deep budget cuts to get their public finances into shape, hitting their economies hard. The Greek economy, for example, shed around a quarter of its output, and saw unemployment and poverty levels ratchet higher. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only recently that fears of a eurozone break-up have eased. Greece, notably, is set to emerge from its bailout era this summer, eight years after it first faced potential bankruptcy. Another chart showing how the eurozone outpaced its major rivals last year: ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bert Colijn is also impressed that the eurozone grew by 2.5% during 2017. He writes: Economic growth has shifted to a substantially faster growth path over the course of 2017, and current GDP data confirms that. Eurozone growth for 2017 as a whole was stronger than many advanced markets, like the US and UK for example. While detailed breakdowns have yet to be released, it seems that the Eurozone economy continues to fire on all cylinders. Investment has yet to recover from the crisis fully but has been an essential contributor to growth during the year. However, Colijn is also concerned that the strong euro could hold back growth in 2018 (as exports will be less competitive) Analysts at Ulster Bank are hopeful that the eurozone will continue to grow robustly in 2018. Jacob Deppe, Head of Trading at online trading platform, Infinox, is impressed by Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth last year: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anything the US economy can do the Eurozone economy can do, slightly better it seems. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is the best economic growth the Eurozone has seen since before the Global Financial Crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Where we go from here is anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guess. But with both the US and Eurozone growing in tandem and with Asian economies on a roll, the hope is that 2018 delivers continued growth, further confidence and economic stability for the first time in a decade. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There remain issues on the horizon. Unemployment in the Eurozone, while falling, is still too high, particularly among the young. We now have confirmation that Europe and America both grew much faster than Britain last year. Economists Rupert Seggins has tweeted a handy chart: Aila Mihr of Danske Bank says Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is expanding strongly: NEWSFLASH: The eurozone and the wider EU have both posted their strongest annual growth since the financial crisis. New GDP figures from Eurostat confirm that the European recovery remains on track, with annual growth of 2.5% during 2017 in the EU and the narrower single currency block. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the strongest annual growth in a decade. In comparison, the UK grew by around 1.8% during 2017 (according to figures released last week) Eurostat also reports that the eurozone and the EU both grew by 0.6% in the final three months of 2017, partly thanks to France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.6% growth and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.7%. Compared to Q4 2016, seasonally adjusted GDP rose by 2.7% in the euro area and by 2.6% in the EU28. In another boost, Eurozone and EU growth in the third quarter of last year has been revised up, from +0.6% to +0.7%. There may be some celebrations in Brussels as this data filters through. Three years ago, the eurozone was being rocked by the Greek debt crisis. Now, the region is looking calmer and more secure, despite Brexit. Over in Frankfurt, the European Central Bank might feel vindicated after launching a massive stimulus programme to ward off deflation, drive down unemployment and keep the economy growing. Economists are concerned by the rise in UK consumer borrowing: Breaking; The number of new mortgages approved in Britain has hit its lowest in almost three years. Just 61,039 mortgages were signed off in December, a drop of over 3,000 compared to November. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the smallest number since January 2015. Bank of England figures also show that UK consumers borrowed an extra \u00c2\u00a31.5bn on credit last month. That pushed the annual growth in credit to 9.5%, up from 9.3%. So, people are finding it harder to buy a new house, and borrowing more on credit to make ends meet. Not a good sign for the UK economy in 2018. Poland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy accelerated last year, according to new data. Poland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP expanded by 4.6% in 2017, up from 2.9% in 2016. Mining companies are leading the selloff today: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major stock markets have all fallen this morning, despite the solid growth figures from France and Spain. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100, the German DAX and the French CAC are all in the red, following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses on Wall Street. The selloff in government bonds in recent days is starting to spook the equity markets, encouraging traders to sell shares. Markets have had a strong run, of course, but analysts are wondering whether a selloff is imminent. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts are likely to push US inflation higher, especially if more firms pass savings onto their staff in pay rises. That in turn increases the chance of US interest rates moving up. Yesterday, Goldman Sachs predicted that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a correction of some kind seems a high probability in the coming months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some reaction to the Spanish growth data: Newsflash: Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.7% in the final quarter of 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a slight slowdown, following 0.8% growth in July-September, but still a decent performance. It should make Spain one of the faster-growing European members. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 3.1% during 2017, matching 2016\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance, according to the INE statistics body. The last few months of 2017 were dominated by the Catalonian independence crisis, as the region tried to break away from Madrd. Update: the pound is slipping lower. The most encouraging part of the French growth report is that business investment has risen sharply. This means French firms have boosted their spending on equipment, offices and factories - a sign that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re more confident about their future prospects. Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig story\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Brexit worries are weighing on the pound again this morning. Sterling has shed half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.402, after leaked government papers showed that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy would be worse off under all three likely Brexit scenarios. My colleague Rowena Mason explains: The document suggested that chemicals, clothing, manufacturing, food and drink, and cars and retail would be the hardest hit and every UK region would also be affected negatively in all the modelled scenarios, with the north-east, the West Midlands and Northern Ireland facing the biggest falls in economic performance. France is benefitting from President Emmanuel Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election win and the upturn in the global economy, says Bloomberg. They add: Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is currently working with unions and business lobbies to overhaul France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job training system, and will move on to unemployment insurance in coming months. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire plans a major economy law for the spring that aims to further loosen restrictions on businesses, as well as increase profit-sharing plans for employees. Newsflash: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.6% in the last three months. Strong business investment and rising exports boosted growth, and compensated for a slowdown in household spending. This means France slightly outpaced Britain, which grew by 0.5% in the last quarter. Statistics body INSEE says: Total gross fixed capital formation (business investment) accelerated slightly to +1.1% after +0.9% Household consumption expenditure slowed down (+0.3% after +0.6%). Foreign trade balance contributed positively to GDP growth (+0.6 points after \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.5 points): exports accelerated markedly (+2.6% after +1.1%) while imports slowed down sharply (+0.7% after +2.4%). Inventory changes made a negative contribution (\u00e2\u02c6\u20190.5 points after +0.3 points). The figures also show that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy expanded by 1.9% during 2017 - the strongest annual growth since 2011. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we learn if Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery is on track. New eurozone growth figures, due at 10am GMT, are expected to show that the single currency bloc expanded by 0.6% in October-December. That would be another solid quarter, as the region puts the debt crisis behind it. Individual figures from France (in a moment) and Spain will also give some country-level insights. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be watching the markets closely. Yesterday, government bond prices fell (pushing up bond yields), fuelling fears that the bull market might be over. Wall Street suffered losses last night, and European markets are expected to drop this morning. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains: After such a promising end to last week where the Dow rallied 200 points to a fresh record close, trading on Monday couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been more different. US stocks experienced a spectacular reversal and plummeted overnight, as the US 10 year treasury yield pushed relentlessly higher. Concerns are starting to enter the market that inflation could be catching up and higher interest rates could pour cold water on the bull run. As the US treasury bond sell off depended, US treasury yields shot up to a peak of 2.73%, the highest level since 2014.The Dow dumped 177 points in its worst trading day so far this year and the S&amp;P dived 0.7%. Plus, new UK consumer credit figures will show if Britons melted their credit cards last month, or reined in spending. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 6.30am GMT: French GDP for Q4 2017 (first estimate) 8am GMT: Spanish GDP for Q 2017 (first estimate 9.30am: UK consumer credit and mortgage approval figures for December 2017 10am: Eurozone GDP for Q4 2017 (first estimate)",

Capita specialises in IT solutions for banks, the National Health Service, retailers and other sectors. Its string of profit warnings over the last few years stems from clients delaying new deals after Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the European Union. Consequently, the group has been forced to undertake a painful process of simplification. It had previously depended on acquisitions as the main driver of revenue for years.</p> \n   <p>Another key difference between Capita and Carillion is that Capita generates lots of cash. It ended its last full year with \u00c2\u00a3408m. On that basis, insolvency does not beckon for Capita. However the group is still subject to the same concerns as Carillion. Namely low- (or even zero) margin for contracts for increasingly cautious businesses amid political risk. </p> \n   <p>The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunknown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 could assail Capita as savagely as Carillion too. Most of its non-current assets were intangibles at the end of 2016 and two-thirds were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgoodwill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 linked to acquisitions. These were the last reliable accounts of assets and liabilities before the group began a root and branch review.</p> \n   <p>So, to be clear, Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lenders will remain on side whilst it keeps generating cash and staying within leverage limits\u00e2\u20ac\u201das it has done to date. Beyond those limits, its future is uncertain. For that reason, we think stock price support will be less evident for Capita than selling interest for the foreseeable future. With 4% of shares out on loan, according to FCA data, Capita is a big short. Flimsily positive news could trigger a rush for cover, and an upward spike. The stock is down 84% in two years, near 15-year lows, and certainly oversold. However, we still expect any bounces to be sold, until the group can offer more clarity on growth and profits.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a71efece4b0a3b45e43d7d2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-31T16:37:19.599Z\">4.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price agony is over, for today at least.</p> \n  <p>It has closed at 182.5p, down 165.3p or 47.5%.

He put forward his plan to streamline the business, but there does not appear to have been much talk about a fundraising, judging from what was reported afterwards. In a hold note on January 18, Stifel analysts said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The company hosted an informal meet &amp; greet with new CEO Jon Lewis last night. First impressions are positive. It is still early days in Mr Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenure and there is plenty of strategic work for him and his team to undertake but he gave some strong hints regarding the direction of travel: a simpler, more agile business, focused on depth of expertise as opposed to breadth. He signalled core ares of interest could be customer management, HR and software services. Disposals will happen and in time international expansion will be pursued. No doubt, Mr Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view of what Capita should stand for will evolve as he works his way though the business but as a starting point we welcome any attempts to make the business more streamlined, less opaque and by extension easier to understand.</p> \n   <p>... The new CEO has sketched out some initial thoughts as to the direction of travel which is helpful but we need to have more information on the future shape of the group to take a view on the potential value that can be created for shareholders.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Numis was so enthused it issued a buy note after the meeting:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We had a positive initial meeting with new CEO, Jonathan Lewis. It is easy to be critical of the past, but his observations on some of the structural and cultural issues at Capita highlighted some fundamental problems, but also material opportunities. We were encouraged by his comments on the need for great focus, cost reductions (whilst also re-investing for growth), and need to focus on cash. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a71de11e4b0ec2e958cdedf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-31T15:17:55.888Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>No recovery for Capita.

company has, in the past, taken on more work than it can handle and, accordingly, has become, as the new boss notes, too complex.</p> \n   <p>The second conclusion, which is difficult to avoid, is that Mr Lewis has observed recent events at Carillion and is now seeking to avoid similar risks.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>More here:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\"

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap. Just two weeks after the collapse of Carillion, outsourcer Capita has shocked the market with a hefty profit warning, a \u00c2\u00a3700m cash call on shareholders and the axing of its dividend. The kitchen sink move by new chief executive Jonathan Lewis saw Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares collapse by 47.5%, wiping around \u00c2\u00a31.1bn off the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market value. Capita dominates the UK outsourcing market, and since January 2015 it has won contracts from 292 distinct public sector buyers. A link to the full announcement from Capita can be found here. The Labour party called on the government to put Capita under close review, but a spokesperson for the prime minister denied the company was another Carillion. Frank Field, chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, raised concerns about Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension deficit. Meanwhile few City analysts spotted the problems at Capita, according to their share price recommendations as collated by Reuters. But hedge funds had been shorting the shares. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, says Capita has become another lightening rod for misgivings about outsoucing and public-private finance, but agrees it is not another Carillion: An important difference between Capita and Carillion..is that the latter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems are linked to under-bidding on major contracts but Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s originate in routine services. Capita specialises in IT solutions for banks, the National Health Service, retailers and other sectors. Its string of profit warnings over the last few years stems from clients delaying new deals after Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the European Union. Consequently, the group has been forced to undertake a painful process of simplification. It had previously depended on acquisitions as the main driver of revenue for years. Another key difference between Capita and Carillion is that Capita generates lots of cash. It ended its last full year with \u00c2\u00a3408m. On that basis, insolvency does not beckon for Capita. However the group is still subject to the same concerns as Carillion. Namely low- (or even zero) margin for contracts for increasingly cautious businesses amid political risk. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunknown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 could assail Capita as savagely as Carillion too. Most of its non-current assets were intangibles at the end of 2016 and two-thirds were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgoodwill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 linked to acquisitions. These were the last reliable accounts of assets and liabilities before the group began a root and branch review. So, to be clear, Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lenders will remain on side whilst it keeps generating cash and staying within leverage limits\u00e2\u20ac\u201das it has done to date. Beyond those limits, its future is uncertain. For that reason, we think stock price support will be less evident for Capita than selling interest for the foreseeable future. With 4% of shares out on loan, according to FCA data, Capita is a big short. Flimsily positive news could trigger a rush for cover, and an upward spike. The stock is down 84% in two years, near 15-year lows, and certainly oversold. However, we still expect any bounces to be sold, until the group can offer more clarity on growth and profits. Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price agony is over, for today at least. It has closed at 182.5p, down 165.3p or 47.5%. Not quite at the low of the day, when the shares hit 181.15p. That means around \u00c2\u00a31.1bn has been wiped off the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market value today. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our updated story on Capita, by Angela Monaghan and Graeme Wearden: Nearly \u00c2\u00a31bn has been wiped off the value of the government contractor Capita after the company issued a shock profit warning, axed its dividend payout to shareholders and said it needed to raise \u00c2\u00a3700m to put its finances back on track. The grim state of Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial position emerged just two weeks after the collapse of the construction firm Carillion. In the latest blow to the outsourcing sector, Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new boss unveiled a radical overhaul of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances, and gave a damning assessment of the company, which he said had become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too complex\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and lacking in discipline. Jonathan Lewis, who took over as chief executive in December, said the company needed to raise up to \u00c2\u00a3700m through a cash call on shareholders. He also plans to scrap dividend payouts to save \u00c2\u00a3210m and sell parts of the business to raise cash. A cost-cutting programme is expected to result in job losses among the 67,000 Capita employees, 50,000 of whom are in the UK. The full report is here: Earlier this month, Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new boss met City analysts and seems to have made a good impression. He put forward his plan to streamline the business, but there does not appear to have been much talk about a fundraising, judging from what was reported afterwards. In a hold note on January 18, Stifel analysts said: The company hosted an informal meet &amp; greet with new CEO Jon Lewis last night. First impressions are positive. It is still early days in Mr Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenure and there is plenty of strategic work for him and his team to undertake but he gave some strong hints regarding the direction of travel: a simpler, more agile business, focused on depth of expertise as opposed to breadth. He signalled core ares of interest could be customer management, HR and software services. Disposals will happen and in time international expansion will be pursued. No doubt, Mr Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view of what Capita should stand for will evolve as he works his way though the business but as a starting point we welcome any attempts to make the business more streamlined, less opaque and by extension easier to understand. ... The new CEO has sketched out some initial thoughts as to the direction of travel which is helpful but we need to have more information on the future shape of the group to take a view on the potential value that can be created for shareholders. Numis was so enthused it issued a buy note after the meeting: We had a positive initial meeting with new CEO, Jonathan Lewis. It is easy to be critical of the past, but his observations on some of the structural and cultural issues at Capita highlighted some fundamental problems, but also material opportunities. We were encouraged by his comments on the need for great focus, cost reductions (whilst also re-investing for growth), and need to focus on cash. No recovery for Capita. Its shares are now down 46% at 187p. More from the City on Capita. Analyst Kean Marden at Jefferies called today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kitchen-sink\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd job by the new chief executive: Jon Lewis arrived at Capita last September and has issued a stark initial assessment of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shortcomings this morning. Our initial calculations suggest that 2018 full year consensus earnings per share estimates, once analysts have included rights issue and bonus factor adjustments, could decline by around 40% today. In the medium term, cost savings should help (we think \u00c2\u00a385-90m could be achievable) but the revenue environment remains lacklustre. Peel Hunt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christopher Bamberry said: The focusing of the group on a smaller number of better competitively positioned business, with a strengthened balance sheet, allowing appropriate levels of investment, are welcome steps in the right direction. 2018 pretax profits expectations have been significantly reduced. Rory McKenzie at UBS said: With a new chief executive in place, 2018 was always going to be a significant transition year for Capita \u00e2\u20ac\u201c todays\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 announcement however outlines the scale of the challenges ahead... Capita has i) guided to a 25-33% downgrade to 2018 consensus; ii) suspended the dividend (we think the market was braced for some form of cut already), iii) announced a rights issue planned for 2018 (underwriting in place for up to \u00c2\u00a3700m, i.e up to 30% of pre today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market cap) and iv) announced a non-core disposal programme over the next 2yrs. Capita aims to come back with a full strategic review in 2018 with more details, but for now the pressures look challenging. Consensus EPS for FY18 could fall around 30-50% including the impact of the rights issue. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman is trying to calm fears that Capita could be heading the same way as Carillion, the outsourcing firm which fell into liquidation two week ago. Reuters has the details: The British government monitors the financial health of all its strategic suppliers and does not believe that any, including Capita, are in a comparable position to Carillion, a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Broadly we monitor the financial health of all our strategic suppliers, including Capita, and we are in regular discussions with them regarding their financial position,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the spokesman told reporters, after Capita shares fell sharply on news of a restructuring. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And (I would like) to emphasise we do not believe that any of our strategic suppliers including Capita are in a comparable position to Carillion.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daily Business Today email gives you the lowdown on Capita, Carillion, VW and much more. Besides the key news headlines that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s further confirmation of Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grip on the outsourcing market: This list shows how Capita holds a wide range of public sector contracts: Frank Field MP, Chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, has Capita in his spotlight. Field says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Another day, another outsourcing firm with massive debt, a huge pension deficit, a KPMG audit and the Big Four popping up at every turn in the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chequered history. Sadly, Capita goes on the growing list of firms we are investigating to see if their conduct has endangered current and future pensioners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Field\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s committee, which has previously examined the collapse of BHS, opened an investigation into Carillion two weeks ago. Ian King, Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business presenter, has written an interesting blog post on Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning. He makes two points: The first is that this is textbook stuff from an incoming chief executive. Jon Lewis, who has only been in the job for two months, has seized the opportunity to re-set expectations for the business while the blame can still be pinned on his predecessor, Andy Parker, who stepped down last September, after three and a half years in the job following a string of profits warnings. No-one will blame Mr Lewis for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement. Instead, while the news has cratered the share price, Mr Lewis will earn brownie points with investors for taking tough remedial action to sort out Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems. The company has, in the past, taken on more work than it can handle and, accordingly, has become, as the new boss notes, too complex. The second conclusion, which is difficult to avoid, is that Mr Lewis has observed recent events at Carillion and is now seeking to avoid similar risks. More here: Andrew Brooke, analyst at Royal Bank of Canada, has chewed through Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning - and concluded that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clearly a mess\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He adds: Too many uncertainties for us and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tough to raise money when you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a strategy yet. Over at parliament, Labour MP Ian Mearns has raised the issue of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse two weeks ago, at Prime Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Questions. Mearns says Carillion workers and apprentices in his Gateshead constituency face an uncertain future following the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse. He asks the government to act to prevent future \u00e2\u20ac\u0153corporate theft\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd where \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pirate directors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd siphon off money that should have gone into pension funds and using it to pay dividends and bonuses. Cabinet Office minister David Lidington (who has stepped in as Theresa May is in China) says good progress is being made in finding new position for former Carillion apprentices. He says the government won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pre-empt the Official Receiver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inquiry into Carillion, but adds that the government will publish proposals later this year to stop directors \u00e2\u20ac\u0153siphoning off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pension funds. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is tracking all the PMQs action: Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems mean local and national procurement officers face a tricky decision. They might be tempted to shy away from the company, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning. But Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Adam Parsons points out, such a policy would leave councils and government departments with nowhere to turn: Matt Cockbill, head of the IT and digital leadership practice at Berwick Partners, argues that Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team are making some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153radical overhauls\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Change is an accepted part of business and we need only look at Carillion as an example of where action was taken too late in the day. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any organisation that recognises that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position is weakening and takes proactive and pragmatic steps to understand why - before filling the voids, assessing market impacts and managing the risks will prosper. In some cases this calls for the help of change leaders, and while Capita is in the early stages, its chiefs seem to be taking steps in the right direction.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Few City experts had spotted the full state of the problems at Capita. According to Reuters data, nine analysts rated Capita as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, while just two recommended selling the company. One had it as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, while two optimists reckoned Capita was a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstrong buy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (they presumably have some explaining to do this morning). Even star investor Neil Woodford has been caught out. He recently increased his holding in Capita, having spotted the potential for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant value creation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Morning Star has more details. Panmure Gordon called it right, though: There may be champagne corks popping in Mayfair today. Capita (like Carillion) had been a target for hedge funds who had bet against the company by \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshorting\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 its stock (by borrowing it, selling it, and planning to buy it back at a profit). Any speculator who shorted Capita in recent months will be sitting on a decent profit. Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning has hit shares in other outsourcing companies: In today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement, CEO Jonathan Lewis warns that Capita has seen \u00e2\u20ac\u0153delays in decision making and weakness in new sales\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd since December; a sign that the market is deteriorating? Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, says Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new boss, Jonathan Lewis, is trying to avoid suffering Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fate. Miah writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Another government contractor appears in trouble, but at least Capita are making drastic changes before it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too late. With a new CEO in place for less than two months, it should be no surprise that the troubled group has today announced a deep restructuring programme. This comes after a review of the business by the new management which found that the group has underinvested, has a short term focus, is too focussed on acquisitions to drive growth as well as lacks operational discipline and financial flexibly. Miah add that Capita could become another \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hot political issue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, given its critical role in local and central government. The government have already placed other companies on watch after the Carillion fiasco; no doubt some will say that Capita should be on that list too. The sector in general hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had a great few years and this has been exacerbated by Brexit where contract awards have been delayed due to uncertainty. Terms like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcplunged\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnosedived\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccrashed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 get banded about too easily in the City. But in Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s care, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re fully justified. Shares are now down an alarming 45% at just 190p, which is the lowest level since January 2003. This means that Capita is now worth just \u00c2\u00a31.3bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s barely more than its net debt, which is estimated to be \u00c2\u00a31.1bn. News of a stonking profits warning, a \u00c2\u00a3700m rights issue and the suspension of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dividend have sent investors racing to get out. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: This is a bold move by new CEO Jonathan Lewis and the fact that he thinks that this sort of restructuring is necessary, speaks volumes to the current sentiment around the outsourcing industry in the wake of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insolvency. Concerns over debt levels and pension deficits, along with the over-diversification of the business appears to have prompted this significant slim lining approach. Hewson is also concerned by the pension deficit, which seems to have swelled sharply recently. In 2015 it stood at \u00c2\u00a3188m, and was estimated to be \u00c2\u00a3381m as of June last year, with management undertaking to set aside an extra \u00c2\u00a321m in 2018 to get this number back down. In light of the problems exposed at Carillion the big jump in this number is a particular concern and exposes some particularly uncomfortable truths about shareholders holding management to account. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an excellent chart from Tussell, the data firm, showing how Capita dominates the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outsourcing sector: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade unions are also alarmed by this latest crisis in the UK outsourcing sector. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady has echoed Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for the government to act now. She says: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning from Capita is really worrying. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the TUC is calling for an urgent risk assessment of all large outsourcing firms. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s essential the government completes this quickly and is prepared to bring services and contracts in-house if they are at risk. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford another Carillion.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jon Trickett MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office, has urged the government to put Capita under close review. Trickett says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We cannot afford another Carillion. The Government must take serious steps to oversee the activities of Capita, which is the third major outsourcing company in the last month to issue profit warnings. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Tories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 privatisation dogma risks lurching our public services from crisis to crisis, threatening jobs, taxpayers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 money and leaving people without the services they need. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government must end its ideological attachment to private profit in public services and instead start putting the public interest first.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Capita CEO Jonathan Lewis has been speaking to City analysts. He warned that overhauling the outsourcing group would take at least two years, admitting there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153much to be done\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Lewis says he wants to fix the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sins of the past\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by pumping more money into IT and automation. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moves are the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153first steps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the road to recovery, he adds. Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price is plumbing new debts. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now down 41% at just 204p, down from 347p last night. Earlier this week, the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Public Leaders Network warned that local councils were too reliant on major outsourcers. Joanne Fry, a senior local government officer, wrote: Carillion mainly ran large private finance initiative contracts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c building hospitals, for instance. But firms like Capita, Serco and Veolia run a huge range of different council services, from IT and HR to waste collection, recycling, street cleaning and maintenance. If they were to fail, the risk to councils would be very high. It has become increasingly clear that the business model around outsourcing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or managed services in local government speak \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is fundamentally at fault. More here: Capita is also heavily involved in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pensions industry. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been running the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Teacher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension scheme since 1996, and last October, it took over the administration of the Royal Mail\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension fund. It even has a contract with the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension regulator, to help roll out automatic enrolment (AE) to small and micro employers. But closer to home, Capita also faces a pension deficit of its own, of around \u00c2\u00a3380m. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement says: We are currently undertaking a triennial review of the pension scheme. Our current expectation is that the actuarial deficit after this review will be significantly below the last disclosed IAS19 deficit of \u00c2\u00a3381m at 30 June 2017. In addition to our annual contribution, we are committed to an additional contribution of \u00c2\u00a321m in 2018. We will seek to reduce the remaining deficit as a priority. Earlier this month, my colleague Nick Fletcher ran the rule over the outsourcing industry, following Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump into liquidation. He wrote: About half of Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual turnover of \u00c2\u00a34.9bn comes from central and local government work, ranging from administering the teachers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pension scheme to providing tech services to the NHS, electronic monitoring services and running the Gas Safe register for the Health and Safety Executive. It has 50,000 UK employees, and a net debt of \u00c2\u00a31.6bn compared with its market value of \u00c2\u00a32.8bn. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have lost two-thirds of their value over the past two years after a series of profit warnings and boardroom changes. Bloomberg points out that Capita doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t only run public sector services. It also provides customer service and IT services for some of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest companies. For example, earlier this month it won a new five-year contract with Marks &amp; Spencer; last August, it extended a mortgage outsourcing deal with Tesco Bank. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price tumble means Capita is now worth just \u00c2\u00a31.4bn -- or barely twice the \u00c2\u00a3700m it hope to raise from the City later this year. Natalie Bennett, former leader of the Green Party, says Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems show that essential public services shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be run by companies. The Spectator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fraser Nelson sees a trend emerging.... Patrick Smith of BuzzFeed fears that Capita workers could be axed as the company races to cut costs. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not for the faint-hearted, but you can read Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement online, here: Update on Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transformation, capital structure, funding and trading outlook Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have crashed to their lowest level since 2004 this morning! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a staggering fall from grace; back in 2015 Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares were worth over \u00c2\u00a313, now they are worth just \u00c2\u00a32.35. Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial problems will send \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfresh tremors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 through the outsourcing sector, says Neil Wilson of ETX Capital. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Too complex, too diverse and just haemorrhaging cash \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not talking about Carillion, but fellow outsourcer in a spot of bother, Capita. New CEO Jonathan Lewis is having a proper clear out to fix the business before it heads the way of its erstwhile peer. He says the business is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctoo widely spread across multiple markets and services\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and that there has been \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctoo much emphasis on acquisitions to drive growth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Wilson adds: Signs of problems have been building. In December the shares took a dive as the first clear signs of weakness in 2018 were laid bare, although trading in the second half had just about held firm. The pipeline of new work had fallen to just \u00c2\u00a32.5bn from \u00c2\u00a33.1bn in September. But it looks like things have got worse. In January there was more bad news as it lost a lucrative and profitable contract with the Prudential. Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have plunged by 30% at the start of trading, following this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement. The City is reeling from the triple-whammy of a profits warning, dividend suspension, and a looming \u00c2\u00a3700m cash call. This could be nasty... This is why Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial problems are a big deal..... Newsflash: Outsourcing group Capita has stunned the City this morning by announcing a big profits warning, and suspending its dividend to shareholders. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new chief executive, Jonathan Lewis, is also planning to raise \u00c2\u00a3700m from investors to strengthen Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance sheet after a series of profit warnings last year. In a brutally honest statement, Lewis says \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsignificant changes are needed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at Capita, which is one of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest employers, providing a a wide range of public services in the UK. In a damning assessment of the company, Lewis says: Capita has underinvested in the business and there has been too much emphasis on acquisitions to drive growth. As our markets have evolved, the Group has not responded consistently to new customer demands. Since December, we have continued to experience delays in decision making and weakness in new sales. Today, Capita is too complex, it is driven by a short-term focus and lacks operational discipline and financial flexibility. Capita needs to change its approach. I have initiated a transformation programme, appointed a Chief Transformation Officer and formed a new executive committee to drive this change. I believe that this transformation programme can significantly improve the performance of Capita. Capita now expects to make underlying pretax profits of between \u00c2\u00a3270m and \u00c2\u00a3300m in 2018, way below analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 average forecast of around \u00c2\u00a3400m. Lewis only took over at Capita on 1 December, and has clearly decided that wide-ranging and urgent action is needed. As well as freezing payments to shareholders, and holding a cash call, he also plans to sell non-core operations and push hard for cost efficiencies. An immediate priority is to strengthen the balance sheet through a combination of cost savings, non-core disposals and new equity. My initial review of our cost base highlights that over the next few years there is significant scope for cost efficiencies across a number of areas but also the need to spend more where there has been underinvestment. This comes just two weeks after Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rival, Carillion, lurched into liquidiation... Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The market are nervous this morning. After two days of selling on Wall Street, investors are wondering whether they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing a healthy pullback, or the start of a more serious decline. Yesterday the FTSE 100 shed 83 points, or over 1%, in a flurry of profit-taking and worries that government bond prices are also dipping. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says the prospect of higher interest rates is hitting the bond market [bonds give a fixed return, so are more attractive in a low interest rate environment] Cincotta explains: Sentiment has been low across the board as prospect of rising interest rates is starting to weigh on the global optimism story, a story which had been boosting stocks to record high after record high. The fear that interest rates may have to rise faster than markets had initially priced in amid concerns of faster inflation is starting to weigh on trading decisions. Last night, Donald Trump used the State of the Union to applaud himself for the state of the US economy. As in Davos last week, he tried to sound statesman-like with talk of common ground and unity. As in Davos last week, he also attracted some boos - over immigration. But he avoided any serious attacks on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rivals, which should reassure traders. As Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: There was no criticism of China or Russia and Trump even hinted at a willingness to work across parties. However, in typical Trump style, there were few details on a potential $1 trillion infrastructure spend, which was a blessing in reality, because elaborating on this could have pushed the already high bond yields, higher. Investors are also waiting to hear from America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, and Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final meeting as chair of the Federal Reserve. The Fed isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected to raise interest rates today, but Yellen hint about how the Fed sees the economic landscape. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 7am GMT: German retail sales 10am GMT: Eurozone unemployment for December 10am GMT: Eurozone \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 CPI inflation for January 7pm GMT: US Federal Reserve statement on monetary policy",
