                "bodyText":"A European Union plan to tax Google, Facebook and other internet firms risks failure after a handful of member states announced their opposition. EU countries are studying proposals to levy a 3% tax on big internet companies that make money from user data or digital advertising, in a bid to level the playing field with bricks-and-mortar companies that pay more tax. But the idea, which must be agreed unanimously by all 28 member states, is running into serious opposition, as Ireland, Sweden and Denmark made their criticism public on Tuesday. Germany had initially supported the idea in a joint agreement with France, but is now seeking to water down and delay the proposals, moves that are causing deep frustration in Paris. A dozen countries are moving ahead with their own national digital taxes, with Spain and the UK among the recent converts. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced last week that the UK was prepared to go it alone, with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153narrowly-targeted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd digital services tax that is expected to come into force in April 2020 and raise \u00c2\u00a3400m for the exchequer. Opponents to the digital tax fear the wrath of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s White House, which regards the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to ensure \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fair taxation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of internet giants as an attack on American companies, a charge the EU rejects. Denmark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Kristian Jensen, said that given the way that the tax \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has been framed as aiming at US companies, of course there will be a reaction from the United States.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ireland, which hosts big tech firms including Apple, Facebook and Google, is also opposed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What kind of reaction would this bring if this was a model that was imposed on us?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Irish finance minister Paschal Donohoe asked his counterparts during the live-streamed debate. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, argues that an EU digital tax could spur efforts for an international agreement, led by the the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development thinktank. Paris fears that failure to agree such a high-profile proposal before May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European elections will be a gift to anti-EU populists, such as Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Rally, formerly the Front National, who claim the EU is in hock to big business. But Le Maire offered a big concession, when he announced on Tuesday that France would support delaying the introduction of an EU tax to allow the OECD to make a comprehensive proposal. Behind the scenes, Paris is deeply disappointed that Berlin has gone cool on the idea after the two countries agreed the initiative more than 18 months ago and reaffirmed it in June in the Meseburg declaration, a Franco-German vision of the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future.

A lot would depend on how the Trade War progresses and how tax cuts 2.0 do in the face of a split Congress and use of executive orders.</li> <li><strong>Likely bearish for the US dollar</strong> and so far seen some slight hints that this is playing out but for now the market reaction is not terrifically strong.</li> <li><strong>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be harder for Trump to pass more tax cuts</strong>, and it may be that reform of Dodd-Frank will die.

                "bodyText":"European stock markets have closed solidly higher tonight, as a wave of relief sweeps through trading floors. In London, the FTSE 100 has closed 76 points higher at 7117, up 1.1%. The German Dax gained 0.8%, the French CAC rose by 1.1%, and the Spanish IBEX jumped by over 2%. Gridlock, it seems, is good for stocks today. As David Madden of CMC Markets puts it: Historically, equity markets have performed well out of a divided Congress as traders feel the government finds it difficult to get new laws passed, and therefore not much changes. The US economy had positive momentum going into the midterms, and that is likely to continue. The rise in popularity of the Democrats could be construed as a vote against Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tough trade stance, and perhaps the White House might soften its position regarding China. There is speculation the Democrats are keen to improve infrastructure, and we are seeing a rally in Caterpillar. Mr Trump has set his sights on tech giants like Amazon, and the outcome of the midterms might make it more difficult for him to go after tech titans. The Dow is still 1.1% higher, the S&amp;P 500 is 1,3% higher, while the Nasdaq is now 2.2% up. Donald Trump is due to discuss the election results shortly, at a Washington DC press conference. My US colleague will cover it here: Goodnight! GW Wall Street is pushing higher, after the Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Senate leader suggested the next Congress could take a bipartisan approach. If that happened (and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big if, given the last two years) it could help to get tax reform and infrastructure legislation passed. Reuters has the details: U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday infrastructure and healthcare would be on the U.S. Senate agenda in 2019, after Republicans widened their majority in the Senate but lost control of the House of Representatives in Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elections. Speaking to reporters, McConnell said senators would likely tackle Obamacare fixes and prescription drug prices, but that changes to Medicare and Social Security were unlikely. Additionally, any new tax legislation would need bipartisan support, he said. This is neat: The US dollar is still under pressure, maintaining its earlier losses against the British pound, the euro, the Japanese yen, and other major currencies. The dollar index is currently down 0.5% today, close to the two-week low hit earlier. This is a clear reaction to the Democratic wins in the House of Representatives last night. Investors are concluding that Donald Trump won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to get another big tax cuts package through Congress, meaning less inflation and consequently less pressure to raise US interest rates in 2019 and 2020. Jameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy &amp; market research at FXTM, says: One of the more interesting trends to have monitored in the aftermath of the mid-term results is the acceleration in near-term Dollar weakness. This suggests that investors are descaling away from heavy US dollar buying positions and have potentially been put off holding onto their positions because of the consensus that the Liberal Democrats taking control of the House provides a potential roadblock to President Trump introducing further fiscal stimulus. Duncan Weldon, of UK investment firm Resolution Group, suggests that the midterm election results could trigger a heightened trade war with China: The Wall Street rally shows investors are relieved that the Democrats have control of the House of Representatives, and can block Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda. Candice Bangsund, vice president and portfolio manager at Fiera Capital says investors would welcome a bit of gridlock, after two wild years in Washington: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As widely expected, the US midterm elections have enabled the Democrats to take control of the House of Representatives, while the Republicans retained control of the Senate. This gridlock scenario has ramped-up the challenge for policymakers in seeking to pass major legislation. That said, investor sentiment should be positive in general as a split Congress suggests that Democrats will be unable to roll back tax cuts or reinstate financial regulations, while the status quo for both the economy and the markets should ultimately prevail. As such, global equities are mainly higher this morning as the passage of last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s events has likely removed an element of uncertainty from the marketplace. The Wall Street opening bell is ring-a-dinging.....and shares are rising. The Dow Jones industrial average, the broader S&amp;P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq index have all posted solid gains, as traders react to the midterm elections. My US colleagues have launched a new liveblog covering all the reaction to the midterms.... including this typically presidential threat from Donald Trump: The US stock market is expected to rally when trading begins in around 70 minutes time. The Dow is being called up around 215 points, or 0.8%, as investors take the midterm results in their strides. Geoffrey Yu of UBS Wealth Management says investors may move money into riskier assets, now the US election is over. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153US stock futures edged up this morning, signalling the market sees Republicans as having marginally outperformed. For once, the polls were pretty much on track, but the pundits have been careful to manage expectations after 2016\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s miscalculations, which on balance is probably a healthy development. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153From an economic standpoint, the more gridlock can be avoided the better. We will be interested to see whether certain sectors can benefit from this outcome, such as infrastructure. Investors around the globe are relieved that the Republicans lost their grip on the lower House of Representatives, says Jake Robbins, fund manager at Premier Global Alpha Growth Fund. A divided government has some positives for markets in that the more extreme policies of the Trump presidency will certainly see some push back which financial markets are clearly seeing as a positive. The great fear was a surprise hold by the Republicans in congress which would have allowed Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s combative foreign and trade policies that have so unnerved markets to escalate further. Financial markets are breathing a sigh of relief that this is not the case. Those sectors hit hardest by tariffs such as basic materials, semis and industrials should see some respite, particularly given their underlying growth prospects have remained pretty good and after the selloff these sectors look attractively valued. Political gridlock also means there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little chance that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original tax reforms are reversed. Democrats on the Hill might want to repeal those tax cuts, but the Republican-controlled Senate surely won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow it. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another reason that shares are rallying today [the cuts to corporate tax boost company profits]. Mickey Levy and Roiana Reid of Berenberg explain: Financial markets are expected to take comfort with the split power in Congress: it was widely expected and will be perceived to allow for additional checks and balances on President Trump. The decent election results for Republicans in the Senate should lessen perceptions of a shift to the hard-left in the 2020 elections and ease concerns about a roll-back of pro-business policies. They also believe we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see a lot more political rancour in Congress, but rather less meaningful legislation: We expect even more Congressional dysfunction \u00e2\u20ac\u2018 if that is possible \u00e2\u20ac\u2018 to lead to more convolutions in the already dysfunctional budget process and more threats of government shutdowns. Just in: The MSCI All-Country World Share Index, which tracks global stocks, has hit its highest level since 22 October. Paras Anand of Fidelity International has an optimistic take - Donald Trump could work with the Democrat-controlled House to push through a new infrastructure-spending package. He writes: During the 2016 Clinton election campaign, infrastructure spend was high on the Democrat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy agenda (as it was for Trump). It is possible that with a bi-partisan focus on the pent-up need for domestic infrastructure investment, the Democrat view on the budget deficit may change from opposition (to tax cuts) to accommodation (spending on roads, hospitals, airports). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any development in this direction would further spur the overall economy, continue to push wages in an already tight labour market, and potentially challenge the current expectations around the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activity for next year. Most political events have an underwhelming economic impact - could the US midterms prove the exception?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The outcome of the US midterms has been met with relief by financial markets. says Silvia Dall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Angelo, Senior Economist at Hermes Investment Management. However, it may not last long.. Equities and bonds rallied, while the US dollar weakened. Following the correction in equities markets in October, the lift of the uncertainty surrounding the US mid-term elections paves the way for a solid performance of financial markets into year-end. But that could change in 2019 as fundamentals look less supportive and prospects are more uncertain. She also reckons Donald Trump will face a tougher task getting reelected in 2020, as a Democrat-controlled House may launch new probes into the president: The most significant consequences of the US mid-term elections concern the domestic political landscape. Indeed, a divided Congress means President Trump will have a hard time to get his domestic policies approved; in particular, his promised new round of tax cuts will probably never see the light. In addition, Democrats controlling the House will probably use subpoena powers to widen investigation into issues such as Russian interferences in the 2016 elections. All this will make for a challenging environment for President Trump to operate in, lowering his chances of winning a second term in 2020. In the run-up to this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elections, Donald Trump floated the idea of a new tax cut for America. The idea looked highly speculative at the time, and has now been washed away by the Blue Wave of votes for Democratic candidates. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, says the tax cut simply won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for US fiscal stability, and means Treasury bonds are rallying today (a tax cut would widen the deficit, meaning more government borrowing). If Donald Trump doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t play ball with Congress, America could find itself facing another government shutdown. So warns Andrew Hunter, US economist at Capital Economics. He told clients this morning the risk of a shutdown has risen. Trump has issued plenty of threats to shutter the government in order to extract funding for his border wall or to rein in non-defence spending, and the risks are surely higher now that he can blame the Democrats. The first flashpoint could come in early December, Hunter explains, when the current government funding bill is due to expire. The big clash could arrive in early 2019, if Congress can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree to raise the debt ceiling. Hunter says: The big risk would be a failure to raise the federal debt ceiling when the current suspension expires next spring, which would raise the possibility of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153technical\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd default. Mike Dolan of Reuters has created a neat chart, showing how asset prices have moved since America went to the polling booths yesterday. As you can see, global stock markets (in yellow) are higher, as are European shares (green) and most emerging market currencies (in orange). The dollar (blue) and US bond yields (red) are both down since Tuesday morning. This chart shows how the US dollar is the clear loser in the financial markets today, dropping against all major rivals: The US dollar is extending its earlier losses, and now down 0.6% against other major currencies as a new 12-day low. Bloomberg says: With Democrats winning the House of Representatives majority and Republicans clinching control of the Senate, President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s party loses full control of Congress. The results dim chances for any major fiscal initiative from the administration that might have triggered yield gains and hence a stronger greenback. Mining giants are driving the London stock market higher, with Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton both up almost 3%. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re benefitting from the weaker dollar, explains Russ Mould, investment director at stockbrokers AJ Bell: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A decline in the dollar following the US midterm elections has given a welcome boost to the mining sector as it will be cheaper for many foreign companies to buy dollar-denominated commodities. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also some optimism that Donald Trump might show us the Art of the Deal, and reach a trade agreement with China soon. Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at wealth manager Quilter Cheviot, argues that the White House will want to boast about another win soon: Tariffs implemented in September are due to rise from 10% to 25% on the 1 January 2019, and the President has also raised the possibility of putting tariffs on the remaining $250bn of Chinese imports that he has so far left untouched. It may be that Trump adopts a softer stance in an attempt to get a deal on trade, thus allowing him to proclaim that he has \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsolved\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the China trade issue ahead of his 2020 re-election campaign. You can keep track of all the midterm election results here: Here are five lessons for investors from the midterm elections, from Neil Wilson of Markets.com: Gridlock tends to be good for the stock market, but in this case, it may not be as positive. To a degree the recent selloff in the stock market could be viewed as nervousness ahead of the mid-terms. Of course, the broader macro-economic outlook and US growth story is more important, but we must remember that the US boom is largely a function of Trumponomics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c anything that curtails this will be at least mildly risk-off. A split Congress will, in all likelihood, not stop Trump from doubling down on tariffs with China. This could result in us getting all the anti-growth measures of Trump without more of the pro-growth reforms. Market impact may be relatively muted, although with a slight risk-off tone initially due to uncertainty about what it will mean vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis economic policy, tax cuts and deregulation. A lot would depend on how the Trade War progresses and how tax cuts 2.0 do in the face of a split Congress and use of executive orders. Likely bearish for the US dollar and so far seen some slight hints that this is playing out but for now the market reaction is not terrifically strong. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be harder for Trump to pass more tax cuts, and it may be that reform of Dodd-Frank will die. Pharma stocks may well do well as a divided house probably makes reform of drug pricing off the agenda. Aaron Anderson, senior vice-president for research at wealth manager Fisher Investments, argues that the prospect of political gridlock is actually good for shares. Legislation was hardly flying through Congress before midterms. Now with Democrats controlling the House of Representatives, the GOP increasing its majority in the Senate and President Trump in the White House, it will be nearly impossible to pass anything remotely controversial. That will drive many people crazy, but markets love it. We should now have a long stretch where political risks go way down, which should be good for stocks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares are roaring ahead in early trading in Europe, as investors react to the midterm election results. In London the FTSE 100 has gained 80 points, or over 1%, to 7,119. The French CAC and German DAX are both also up around 1%. Some traders are concluding that gridlock on Capitol Hill could actually be good for America, if it stops Donald Trump driving up the US deficit. Simon French, chief economist at stockbrokers Panmure Gordon, argues that the midterm result is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as good as you could hope\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Having the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wings clipped by losing control of the House is helpful for avoiding the most obvious \u00e2\u20ac\u0153end of cycle policy mistakes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - which in our view is pumping more deficit spending and protectionism into the economy, forcing the Fed to tighten at a faster rate. With the US dollar weakening fast, the pound has gained half a cent to $1.314 - a three week high. The euro has been lifted to a two-week high, at $1.147. Bart Hordijk, market analyst at Monex Europe, says the prospect of Trump and Congress acting like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bickering inmates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the next two years is hurting the US dollar. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nevertheless, domestic political unrest may throw a spanner in the works for the dollar, as Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relations with the Democrats will be essential in the coming months to determine the course of politics. Potentially Trump, who was once a member of the Democratic Party, may manage to come together with the Democrats and agree on broad tax cuts for the middle class. This could be a boost for the economy and the dollar, assuming markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t start to fret about the increasing government deficit. Chances are higher that the Democrats will seize the opportunity to use their new control of certain commissions in the House to step up the investigations in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax dealings, relations with Russia and claims of hush money payments. The menacing club of government shutdowns will be the Democrats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to yield every time Trump goes too far out of line to their taste in the coming months. The dollar may, in the end, get the biggest whack from this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the global economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The US dollar is in retreat this morning after the Democrats won control of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s House of Representatives in a gripping night of election drama. The midterm elections saw a Blue Wave sweep through Congress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lower chamber, giving the Democratic party fresh power to control president Trump. Checks and balances are back -- although the Republicans did put up a better show in the Senate races, increasing their majority. My colleague David Smith reports from Washington: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We rebuked Trump and Trumpism at a critical moment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ilya Sheyman, executive director of the grassroots organisation MoveOn wrote in a celebratory email. Many Democrats will be tempted to see the glass as half empty, engaging in self-flagellation over narrow defeats for some of its rising stars and a worse-than-expected loss of ground in the Senate. But the truth is that in the face of gerrymandering, voter suppression and an economy that continues to stay in the strong shape that Barack Obama bequeathed, the party reclaimed the House majority for the first time in eight years. That is no small achievement. Opinion polls had predicted that the Democrats would have a good night, so these results shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shake the financial markets. But the US dollar is already coming under pressure, dropping by 0.4% against a basket of other major currencies to a two-week low this morning. Investors are calculating that there will now be gridlock on Capitol Hill; the House will be free to oppose Trump policies which Democrats don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree with. This could prevent the White House forcing tax cuts and new spending on infrastructure such as transport and water systems. So if Trump can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give the US economy another jolt of fiscal stimulus, the economy may slow...meaning US interest rates might not rise as fast as feared. James Knightley, economist at ING, says president Trump will be feeling blue this morning: While not a great outcome for President Trump, it could have been worse. He clearly had plans to press on with infrastructure spending and further tax reform in the second half of his presidential term and while the policies are not dead, they are likely going to be curtailed or heavily revised by a Democrat-controlled House. Bi-partisanship will be required for progress to be made and for President Trump to generate a strong platform to defend his Presidency in 2020. However, the US economy will face an increasing number of challenges over the next couple of years as support fades from the fiscal stimulus and weaker global growth (contributed to by President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade protectionism), a stronger dollar and higher interest rates provide increasing headwinds. A weaker economy and potentially falling asset prices and household wealth would compound the problems for President Trump. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be mopping up financial reaction through the day.

And yet this architectural crime will be nothing compared to the damage it is likely to cause to high streets across the north-east, and none more so than Darlington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, which has already lost many of its bigger shops. Analysts at PwC say the north-east has seen a net loss of 72 shops in the first half of 2018. These are the outlets of multiple retailers and the report therefore leaves outside its ambit the many independent shops that have gone to the wall. The north-east was not even the worst. The West Midlands lost 89 of its larger shops. Among the latest to announce closures are Evans Cycles, Debenhams, House of Fraser and New Look. Marks &amp; Spencer is shrinking its high street footprint, as are many others. The trend is unstoppable and affecting everywhere. London is not immune, despite the welter of tourists charging through the West End and beyond. London saw 448 large shops open and 716 close, giving a net loss of 268. Former chancellor George Osborne knew the high street was dying back in 2015. A smart cookie, he hatched a plan to put councils in charge of business rates, the tax that all bricks-and-mortar businesses pay based on the rentable value of their property. Just a quick look at the Amazon shed shows that its rentable value will be a fraction of the shops it replaces. And in the town centres, the trajectory for rateable values is only going down. Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scheme is inspired by the US, where mayors and local governments bargain away tax revenues in return for factories, distribution sheds and the like being located in their areas. Jobs, any jobs, are their priority. Which raises the questions, are the 3,500 Amazon jobs on the outskirts of Darlington the equivalent of shop worker positions in the town? Not when towns are hollowed out, tax revenues plummet and the quality of local jobs slumps.",

BT has raised the white flag in the football rights bidding wars and there is no serious competition elsewhere. Streaming however, is a different ball game. Has the penny really dropped for Persimmon? So farewell Jeff Fairburn, probably the most egregiously overpaid boss in modern corporate history. Last December Fairburn, the boss of housebuilder Persimmon was handed a \u00c2\u00a3100m bonus from an atrociously badly designed long-term incentive plan (LTIP) set up in 2012. That LTIP morphed into a winning lottery ticket when George Osborne unveiled his help-to-buy scheme for first-time buyers in 2013, backed by billions of pounds of taxpayers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cash. It put rocket fuel into new house sales, and housebuilders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 profits. The Persimmon share price had risen fivefold when the LTIP matured last Christmas. Other housebuilders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shares rose just as much, but they did not have LTIPs modelled on those Las Vegas fruit machines which spew out coins like a golden waterfall. The then chairman of Persimmon and the director who signed off the LTIP tried to persuade Fairburn to take a smaller sum and donate a large portion to charity. He refused. They quit. The ensuing furore persuaded Fairburn to forgo \u00c2\u00a325m. Too little, too late. He promised to set up a charitable trust. When? How much? He wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say. Last month, when a BBC reporter asked about the payout, Fairburn stomped off, telling the journalist it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unfortunate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he had asked that. Last week, at long last, Persimmon realised that Fairburn has done lasting damage to the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation and he was shown the door. There are lessons from this saga: all incentives should have a maximum payout; LTIPs which generate cash from external factors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like help-to-buy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are a reward for luck, not performance; shareholders should wake up and realise the damage done to business by executive greed (more than half of Persimmon shareholders backed this payout even amid the furore). Persimmon will now be linked with executive excess for years. To escape the Fairburn stain it may have to change its name. But has the penny properly dropped, even now? Because the interim boss, David Jenkinson, got \u00c2\u00a340m from that LTIP. But for Fairburn it would have been Jenkinson branded one of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greediest bosses.",

                "bodyText":"Thursday was always going to be a hard act to follow after the dramatic events which sent the pound tumbling against the euro and the dollar and triggered a major sell-off of UK-focused shares. Sterling has not fully recovered its losses, but it has had a much better day, particularly against the dollar. The pound is currently trading up 0.7% against the dollar at $1.2860, and is roughly flat against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1274. Having escaped the Thursday sell-off, the FTSE 100 is down 0.6% at 6,996.94, in line with all major European indices. The more domestically focused FTSE 250 is off 0.5% at 18,573.94. Investors are bracing themselves for the twists and turns to come, as Theresa May fights to keep her Brexit plan on the table amid mounting opposition from MPs in her own party. On that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll close up. Thank you for reading the blog and for all the comments, do join us again on Monday. US markets have opened lower: Dow Jones: -0.4% at 25,196 S&amp;P 500: -0.5% at 2,717.65 Nasdaq: -1% at 7,188.42 Tech stocks are under pressure - hitting the Nasdaq in particular - after disappointing earnings from chip maker Nvidia. Data just out shows US industrial production grew by just 0.1% in October, following a 0.2% increase in September. Manufacturing output was slightly stronger, up 0.3% over the month, in line with September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth according to the Federal Reserve. Manufacturing increased despite a 2.8% fall in car production. US futures are down, as traders digest a combination of weaker corporate earnings and trade tensions. The pound has recovered further ground against both the euro and dollar: +0.4% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1320 +0.5% at $1.2843 Equity traders are feeling less chirpy, with all major European markets down this afternoon: FTSE 100: -0.7% at 6,987.15 Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ISEQ: -0.4% at 5,934.01 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.3% at 11,316.97 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.5% at 5,010.33 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.4% at 18,826.70 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.3% at 9,044.50 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.2% at 357.59 Away from Brexit, the other B-word is almost upon us... Black Friday. The annual bargain shopping event is an import from America which traditionally falls on the day after Thanksgiving, meaning Black Friday falls on 23 November this year. But that hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stopped Amazon and a host of other retailers to fire the starting gun a week early. The online retailing giant, and chains including Argos and Currys PC World have lined up discounts on tens of thousands of products \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from large-screen 4K HD TVs, wireless speakers, headphones to laptops - in a bid to entice shoppers from today. According to the consultancy GlobalData, UK consumers are expected to spend \u00c2\u00a310.4bn during the Black Friday sales, which is 3.1% more than in 2017. The chances of the Bank of England raising interest rates in 2019 have dropped according to traders. Money markets are now pricing in an 86% chance of a rate hike next year, down from 90% on Thursday. Before Thursday - and the wave of ministerial resignations over Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s draft Brexit agreement - a rate rise before 2020 was fully priced in. Here are the biggest FTSE fallers this morning as it currently stands: The FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier gains have evaporated as investors remain cautious against a backdrop of heightened political and Brexit uncertainty. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index is down 7 points or 0.1% at 7,031.35, underperforming its European peers and with RBS and the house builders among the biggest losers for a second day. The domestically-focused FTSE 250 is just about hanging on, up 12 points or 0.1% at 18,674.57. David Madden analyst at CMC Markets, gives his take on how the markets are playing out: Stocks in Europe have bounced back today, but some of the major indices have given up some of the early gains. Theresa May had a disastrous day yesterday, and investors are still on edge over the political situation in the UK. Politics is also in focus in Italy as Rome and Brussels are still locked in a stand-off over the budget. For the time being, Brexit will grab more attention in the media, but the Italian problem could spark another round of the eurozone debt crisis. Sterling has received a boost from reports that Michael Gove will not be resigning as environment secretary, despite turning down the job of Brexit secretary. The pound is up 0.3% against both the euro and the dollar, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1306 and $1.2807 respectively. In less encouraging news for Prime Minister Theresa May, bookmaker William Hill has stopped taking bets on the year that she will leave office... Annual inflation in the eurozone picked up to 2.2% in October, from 2.1% in September according to the statistics office Eurostat. It was no surprise, unchanged from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flash\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd estimate published by Eurostat at the end of October. Energy prices, services, and food, alcohol and tobacco prices all contributed to the slightly higher inflation rate. Here is how inflation rates compared last month across the EU: Carsten Brzeski, chief economist of ING in Germany, says that Draghi opened the door for a longer period of low interest rates. When ECB President Maro Draghi gives a speech four weeks ahead of a crucial policy meeting, it is always worthwhile listening closely. It is too early to read any real changes in the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anticipated path for monetary policy beyond the end of the net-QE purchases. However, Draghi at least just sent a clear signal of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s willingness to err on the side of caution when it comes to the first rate hike. The risk that Draghi could go down in European history books as the first ECB president who never hikes rate is increasing. Draghi also took a very thinly veiled pop at Italy, which is pressing ahead with plans to increase spending despite its huge debt pile and major opposition from the EU. To protect their households and firms from rising interest rates, high-debt countries should not increase their debt even further and all countries should respect the rules of the Union. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, has delivered the keynote speech at the European Banking Congress in Frankfurt. Striking a fairly cautious note, Draghi said that while a number of one-off factors had weighed on eurozone growth during the year - such as disruption to car production caused by new emissions tests - there were longer term factors to consider. He cited a slowdown in trade as a risk: Insofar as world trade stabilises at a lower level, its drag on growth could also be temporary. But there are two conditions that could make it longer-lasting. The first is if trade uncertainty rises and dampens euro area export performance, in particular owing to protectionism. The second condition is if uncertainty about external demand spills over into domestic demand through confidence and investment channels. While reiterating the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intention to stop bond purchases by the end of the year, he also appeared to soften the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message about the pace of tightening, saying there was so far little pass-through from higher wages to inflation. That is likely to push back intentions for the timing of the first rate hike. Draghi said: The nature of this forward guidance is contingent on economic developments and therefore acts as an automatic stabiliser. If financial or liquidity conditions should tighten unduly or if the inflation outlook should deteriorate, our reaction function is well defined. This should, in turn, be reflected in an adjustment in the expected path of future interest rates. Read the full speech here. Gains in both the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 have narrowed on reports that it is looking likely Theresa May will face a confidence vote (triggered if Conservative MPs submit 48 letters to the chair of the backbench 1922 Committee). The FTSE 100 is up 17 points or 0.3% at 7,055.26, while the FTSE 250 is up 0.2% at 18,694.71. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, says the pound is mirroring Theresa May in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a display of (potentially brief) Brexit resilience.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He explains: The pound is a bit like Theresa May at the moment. Seriously bruised by the fallout of the Brexit draft deal, shaken by a series of high profile resignations, but, for the time being (and however misguidedly), emboldened by a sense of resilience. All this is to say that sterling avoided another round of losses as Friday got underway. Of course, it is still very early in the day, with some key figures yet to fully reveal their allegiances. Most pressing, perhaps, is Michael Gove, the man who has reportedly rejected an offer to take over as Brexit Secretary because he would not be able to renegotiate the divorce deal. This leaves the prominent Leaver in a sticky situation, with rumours circulating that he may already have one foot out of the door, despite having provided support for May during Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s marathon Cabinet sesh. The FTSE 250 is also up this morning, climbing 0.8% to 18,810 after Theresa May vowed to fight on with her Brexit plan, despite major opposition from within her own party. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reverse all of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses, but the firms listed in the UK-focused index will be relieved nonetheless. Trading is underway across Europe and the FTSE 100 is up 50 points, or 0.7% in early trading. The index of the biggest UK-listed companies was spared the major sell-off on Thursday, largely because so many of the top 100 firms have a large proportion of earnings abroad. The UK focused firms were hit hard however, wiping billions off the market value of house builders and banks. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how it looks across Europe at the moment: FTSE 100: +0.7% at 7,086.59 Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ISEQ: +1.3% at 6,036.19 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.7% at 11,435.61 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.7% at 5,069.27 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.5% at 18,993.71 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.4% at 9,111.40 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.6% at 360.63 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound has steadied this morning after a shocker of a day on Thursday which saw the currency plunge 1.9% against both the euro and the dollar, to lows of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1247 and $1.2722 respectively. Traders sold off sterling at a rapid rate as they digested the resignation of cabinet ministers Dominic Raab and Esther McVey, countless rumours of further potential resignations and, the prospect of a vote of no-confidence in the Prime Minister. Equity markets across Europe also fell sharply, with Irish stocks under particular pressure. UK-focused firms in the FTSE 100 suffered heavy losses - although the index itself closed up 4 points - and the domestic-focused FTSE 250 fell 1.3%. As Friday gets underway, politicians, investors and commentators are braced for another dramatic day - which may or may not materialise. As things stand the pound is steady, up 0.2% against the dollar at $1.2795 and roughly flat against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1280. Things looked similarly calm at this point yesterday...

IMRG said it is now common for lots of spending to take place on phones, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[but] it is unusual, given Friday was a standard working day and people tend to use the device of most convenience, and many would have had access to their desktops at work.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> <p>Black Friday, an American concept that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really exist in the UK 10 years ago, has transformed the way Brits shop, with many retailers saying that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Christmas now happens in November\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>The struggle for retailers will be to hold their nerve over extreme discounting, in order to maintain a reasonable margin and not cannibalise all their Christmas trade.</p> <p>Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving in the US, which happens on the fourth Thursday of November, and traditionally marks the start of the holiday shopping season. The origin of the name is contentious, but most agree that retailers ultimately have the Philadelphia police department to thank for it.</p> <p>The force named the day after the chaos \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and increased demand for policing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that engulfed Philadelphia when shoppers flocked to the high street sales at the same time as large numbers of spectators travelled to the annual Army vs Navy American football match, which was usually held in the city on the same day. They are thought to have started using the term in the 1950s and 1960s, judging by local newspaper reports, and usage slowly crept nationwide.</p> <p>Amazon started offering Black Friday deals in the UK around 2010. Then, in 2013, Asda, which is owned by US giant Walmart, started offering deals in its supermarkets.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The phenomenon of Black Friday in the UK has transformed the pre-Christmas shopping landscape in recent years, to the extent that, for many retailers, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcChristmas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 now happens in November,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ian Geddes, head of retail at Deloitte. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The revenues that will be generated by those participating in Black Friday promotions in this period will likely trump those earned over Christmas week.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>In 2014, the first year with widespread discounting in the UK, shoppers got a little carried away, with numerous arrests following scuffles over the best deals.

The Interactive Media in Retail Group (IMRG), which represents online retailers, said \u00c2\u00a31.4bn was spent online on Black Friday 2017, a 11.7% increase on the previous year. Most of that shopping was done on smartphones (39%), ahead of desktop computers, laptops and tablets. IMRG said it is now common for lots of spending to take place on phones, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[but] it is unusual, given Friday was a standard working day and people tend to use the device of most convenience, and many would have had access to their desktops at work.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Black Friday, an American concept that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really exist in the UK 10 years ago, has transformed the way Brits shop, with many retailers saying that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Christmas now happens in November\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The struggle for retailers will be to hold their nerve over extreme discounting, in order to maintain a reasonable margin and not cannibalise all their Christmas trade. Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving in the US, which happens on the fourth Thursday of November, and traditionally marks the start of the holiday shopping season. The origin of the name is contentious, but most agree that retailers ultimately have the Philadelphia police department to thank for it. The force named the day after the chaos \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and increased demand for policing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that engulfed Philadelphia when shoppers flocked to the high street sales at the same time as large numbers of spectators travelled to the annual Army vs Navy American football match, which was usually held in the city on the same day. They are thought to have started using the term in the 1950s and 1960s, judging by local newspaper reports, and usage slowly crept nationwide. Amazon started offering Black Friday deals in the UK around 2010. Then, in 2013, Asda, which is owned by US giant Walmart, started offering deals in its supermarkets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The phenomenon of Black Friday in the UK has transformed the pre-Christmas shopping landscape in recent years, to the extent that, for many retailers, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcChristmas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 now happens in November,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ian Geddes, head of retail at Deloitte. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The revenues that will be generated by those participating in Black Friday promotions in this period will likely trump those earned over Christmas week.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In 2014, the first year with widespread discounting in the UK, shoppers got a little carried away, with numerous arrests following scuffles over the best deals. Sgt Paul Marshall, a Met police officer, tweeted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even on #BlackFriday shoving people to the floor so you can get \u00c2\u00a320 off a coffee maker is still an assault.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

Other groups said Equinor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s letter was welcome but investments in forests had to be a complement to companies cutting their own carbon footprints. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For it to be meaningful they must commit to hard measurable targets both for cutting emissions in their operations and for investing in renewables,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Andrew Norton, director of the UK-based International Institute for Environment and Development. Oil industry watcher Wood Mackenzie said getting involved in tree-planting was useful as part of fossil fuel companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 climate efforts, but would not be cheap. Valentina Kretzschmar, the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research director, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Reforestation is one of the levers that that can be pulled to help mitigate climate change, however it will be expensive. Without regulatory changes, it is simply not commercially viable for any oil and gas company to start investing in reforestation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 This article was amended on 27 November 2018 to add more details of Equinor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stated intentions.",

The sector has turned at spectacular speed.</p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a demonstration of the thrills and spills of investing in technology, it could be said. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something in that idea, of course, since nobody owns these stocks for a dull life. Investors are betting on fabulous rates of earnings growth, projected many years into the future. It only takes a modest shift in the financial weather for valuation to be whacked.</p> <p>Yet tech stocks do not inhabit an entirely different investment universe. There are at least two reasons why the current tech rout may be signalling broader market worries.</p> <p>First, investors may be looking at 2019 and deciding that the only way is slower for the global economy. One engine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has been running in overdrive this year as President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts have fed into the system. That effect will fade and next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story will be the pace at which the US Federal Reserve lifts interest rates. There is a risk of the Fed doing too much, too soon. Meanwhile, the other global driver \u00e2\u20ac\u201c China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is spluttering. A growth rate of 6.5% looks good from a western perspective but is the slowest since the 2008 financial crisis. There is nothing that will obviously improve next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outlook.</p> <p>That is partly because of the second factor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the US-China trade war. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you want a short-term solution, there is no solution,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jack Ma, the Alibaba billionaire in September, predicting 20 years of trade hostility. Investors didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to believe it, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve having to reassess.</p> <p>Hopes of a truce at this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G20 are low and falling after US vice-president Mike Pence said at an Asia Pacific conference this week that the US \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will not change course until China changes its ways\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Meanwhile, China has launched a high-profile price-fixing investigation into three big computer chip makers, including one US firm. That affair may be unrelated, but it clearly doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make peace over intellectual property more likely. On current form, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d bet that the next round of US tariff hikes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c scheduled for January \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will happen.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153All good things eventually come to an end,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Goldman Sachs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 market analysts on Tuesday, striking a bearish tone in their predictions for 2019. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cash will represent a competitive asset class to stocks for the first time in many years,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Wall Street bank said. That is eye-catching, as end-of-year forecasts are supposed to be, but it reflects the suddenly downbeat mood. If Apple can no longer shift more iPhones at higher prices, which is the micro worry about the tech sector, something big may have changed.</p> <h2>Bumpy road ahead for Renault</h2> <p>The reaction of senior Renault executives to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/20/ghosns-arrest-casts-doubt-on-fate-of-three-car-alliance\">the arrest of Carlos Ghosn</a> was fascinating. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On your behalf, we would like to state here our full support for our chairman and CEO,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wrote chief operating officer Thierry Bollor\u00c3\u00a9 to staff, before stating that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the governance bodies are playing their full role in defending Groupe Renault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate interest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not hard to read between the lines. On the Renault side, they clearly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trust the process by which Ghosn has been accused of under-reporting his income at Nissan and committing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153numerous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd misdeeds. And they clearly suspect this affair will turn into a battle for control of a three-way corporate alliance that also contains Mitsubishi.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>One can understand Renault management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suspicions. Nissan chief executive Hiroto Saikawa didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to hear if Ghosn denies the fraud charges. Nor did he attempt to explain if Nissan, or its auditors, could have been complicit in any alleged wrongdoing. He just seemed anxious to condemn the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd aspects of Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regime and ignore the obvious questions about lax governance at Nissan itself.</p> <p>If Renault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top brass smell a power grab, you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame them. Given the relative recent performance of the two companies, Renault, owner of 43% Nissan, desperately needs the partnership to hold. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revelation on Tuesday that Ghosn had been planning a merger between Renault and Nissan before his arrest in Tokyo, and that Japanese firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board was opposed, will only deepen tensions.</p> <p>Good luck to the French government, owner of 15% of Renault. This tale looks set to become very messy very quickly.</p>",

The sector has turned at spectacular speed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a demonstration of the thrills and spills of investing in technology, it could be said. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something in that idea, of course, since nobody owns these stocks for a dull life. Investors are betting on fabulous rates of earnings growth, projected many years into the future. It only takes a modest shift in the financial weather for valuation to be whacked. Yet tech stocks do not inhabit an entirely different investment universe. There are at least two reasons why the current tech rout may be signalling broader market worries. First, investors may be looking at 2019 and deciding that the only way is slower for the global economy. One engine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has been running in overdrive this year as President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts have fed into the system. That effect will fade and next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story will be the pace at which the US Federal Reserve lifts interest rates. There is a risk of the Fed doing too much, too soon. Meanwhile, the other global driver \u00e2\u20ac\u201c China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is spluttering. A growth rate of 6.5% looks good from a western perspective but is the slowest since the 2008 financial crisis. There is nothing that will obviously improve next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outlook. That is partly because of the second factor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the US-China trade war. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you want a short-term solution, there is no solution,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jack Ma, the Alibaba billionaire in September, predicting 20 years of trade hostility. Investors didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to believe it, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve having to reassess. Hopes of a truce at this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G20 are low and falling after US vice-president Mike Pence said at an Asia Pacific conference this week that the US \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will not change course until China changes its ways\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Meanwhile, China has launched a high-profile price-fixing investigation into three big computer chip makers, including one US firm. That affair may be unrelated, but it clearly doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make peace over intellectual property more likely. On current form, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d bet that the next round of US tariff hikes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c scheduled for January \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will happen. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All good things eventually come to an end,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Goldman Sachs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 market analysts on Tuesday, striking a bearish tone in their predictions for 2019. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cash will represent a competitive asset class to stocks for the first time in many years,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Wall Street bank said. That is eye-catching, as end-of-year forecasts are supposed to be, but it reflects the suddenly downbeat mood. If Apple can no longer shift more iPhones at higher prices, which is the micro worry about the tech sector, something big may have changed. Bumpy road ahead for Renault The reaction of senior Renault executives to the arrest of Carlos Ghosn was fascinating. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On your behalf, we would like to state here our full support for our chairman and CEO,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wrote chief operating officer Thierry Bollor\u00c3\u00a9 to staff, before stating that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the governance bodies are playing their full role in defending Groupe Renault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate interest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not hard to read between the lines. On the Renault side, they clearly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trust the process by which Ghosn has been accused of under-reporting his income at Nissan and committing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153numerous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd misdeeds. And they clearly suspect this affair will turn into a battle for control of a three-way corporate alliance that also contains Mitsubishi. One can understand Renault management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suspicions. Nissan chief executive Hiroto Saikawa didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to hear if Ghosn denies the fraud charges. Nor did he attempt to explain if Nissan, or its auditors, could have been complicit in any alleged wrongdoing. He just seemed anxious to condemn the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd aspects of Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regime and ignore the obvious questions about lax governance at Nissan itself. If Renault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top brass smell a power grab, you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame them. Given the relative recent performance of the two companies, Renault, owner of 43% Nissan, desperately needs the partnership to hold. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revelation on Tuesday that Ghosn had been planning a merger between Renault and Nissan before his arrest in Tokyo, and that Japanese firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board was opposed, will only deepen tensions. Good luck to the French government, owner of 15% of Renault. This tale looks set to become very messy very quickly.",

                "bodyText":"Nicholas Oates started working at an Amazon fulfillment center in Kansas City, Missouri, in August last year, a few months before Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpeak season\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 began in late November, when Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales kick off holiday shopping. That year, 45% of all US online transactions on Thanksgiving Day and 54.9% of all online transactions on Black Friday were made through Amazon. On Cyber Monday, Amazon sold over 64m items , making up a significant portion of the record $6.59bn in total sales for the day. Amazon noted it was their biggest sales day in company history. This year, Amazon expanded their Black Friday sale to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Black Friday Deals Week\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, encompassing Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and offering different sales on a daily basis. To help meet such demand during this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peak season, Oates, 25, said he was already working 60 hours a week. Oates explained that as the work volume increases, Amazon workers are not allowed to use personal time and vacation time use is discouraged. Amazon announced earlier this year a plan to hire 100,000 temporary employees for the 2018 holiday season, though that number has decreased from previous years. The reduction has been attributed to automation and an increased reliance on robots in Amazon fulfillment centers. Oates says the robots on the warehouse floor often wind up knocking items to the ground, slowing down the work assembly and making it more difficult for workers to keep up picking items. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a depressing work culture because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen countless people get chewed up and spit out at this job. One of the biggest, depressing realizations is after I survived peak season, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recognize my department anymore. So many people were gone.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Oates is currently homeless, living out of his car in the Amazon fulfillment center parking lot while working full-time. Oates said he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling with depression. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My quality of sleep has been horrible, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve only been getting four to five hours of sleep a night tops,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Shannon Allen, another Amazon employee who has worked at a fulfillment center in Haslet, Texas, since May 2017, said Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales include many more large items and appliances, which make it more difficult for Amazon workers to keep up with the pace demanded by management. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When people order the larger items, it makes it a little more strenuous on everybody because mass quantities of larger items are not something that we normally deal with every day,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Allen said. In an email, an Amazon spokesperson said the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153number one priority is to ensure a positive and safe working environment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In recent years, thousands of seasonal associates have gone on to join Amazon on a longer-term basis after the holiday season\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the statement said. The National Retail Federation projects overall holiday season sales to increase by 4.1% in 2018. Increasingly, these sales are shifting toward online retail over brick and mortar retail; in 2017, online sales on Black Friday saw an 18% increase from the previous year, while the number of people who shopped in brick and mortar retail stores on Thanksgiving and Black Friday decreased by 4% . Though Black Friday shopping is trending toward online retail, millions of Americans will still shop in person at brick and mortar retail stores, where workers face substantial increases in work volume and demanding schedules, often without any additional compensation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to enjoy Thanksgiving because of Black Friday right after,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ludmiala Blanco, an employee for 25 years at a CVS in Los Angeles, California. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are very demanding, we have huge lines, and we are understaffed for most of the time people rush in.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She noted only full-time employees receive time and a half extra compensation for working holidays like Thanksgiving Day but isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offered at all on Black Friday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really stressful. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chaos everywhere. Having to keep up with the pace management expects you to work at, dealing with the mess and the customers, my anxiety is through the roof,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Noemi Castro, a three-year employee at K-Mart in Los Angeles, California, who is working the morning shift on Black Friday this year. The director of labor education research at Cornell University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Industrial and Labor Relations School, Kate Bronfenbrenner, explained these trends are persistent throughout the retail industry. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a very human, personal cost,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bronfenbrenner said. She noted in the 1980s many places did not open on holidays and were closed on Sundays. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have moved to a world where the biggest shopping days of the year are on holidays.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest retailer, Walmart, has made efforts to compete with Amazon on Cyber Monday while hosting Black Friday sales at their retail stores across the country. Walmart does not offer holiday pay or additional compensation to workers on days like Black Friday. Walmart has faced increasing pressure from workers to raise their minimum wage to $15 an hour. In the wake of Senator Bernie Sanders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Stop Walmart Act introduced last week to push Walmart to raise their wages, Walmart workers are planning protest events outside of the Walmart billionaire heiress Alice Walton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s New York City Penthouse and Walmart.com headquarters in San Bruno, California, on Cyber Monday.

                "bodyText":"Black Friday, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest shopping event, is nearly upon us, and with many high street retailers struggling, shoppers can expect to bag some good bargains. It originated in the US, where stores mark the start of the festive shopping season the day after the Thanksgiving public holiday with big price cuts and promotions. It has become a fortnight-long \u00c2\u00a310bn shopping extravaganza, while some retailers, including Carphone Warehouse and Halfords, offer Black Friday-themed discounts for all of November. Amazon fired the starting gun a week early and is billing this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wave of promotions as its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153biggest-ever Black Friday sale\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It has tens of thousands of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lightning deals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that offer bargains in limited quantities. Much of the shopping will be done online again, with shoppers preferring to bargain hunt on their phones or laptops, rather than queuing up outside shops in the early hours. However, some offers can only be had in stores, for example, at Morrisons. Here is the Observer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s handy guide to how to snap up a bargain and stay out of the red. Consumer experts advise shopping around (you can use comparison websites such as idealo or Amazon price tracker Camelcamelcamel) and checking retailers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 returns policies before buying.

                "bodyText":"Black Friday may be one of the biggest shopping days on the calendar, but it has also spawned a flurry of alternatives to the consumer frenzy from brands and charities. Greenpeace has teamed up with partners including Fashion Revolution and Shareable to back Make Smthing week, during which artists and crafters lead workshops on creative ways to reuse, repair or recycle goods. Events taking place over the weekend include ShareFest in Totnes, Festival of Sustainable Fashion in London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hackney and Leeds Community Clothes Exchange. The Charities Aid Foundation is backing the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts for global charity event Giving Tuesday on 27 November, which encourages people to do something for \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or give something to \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a charity they care about. Celebrities including blogger and Strictly Come Dancing participant Joe Sugg, Ricky Gervais and Martin Lewis are supporting the day which last year raised \u00c2\u00a3213m online alone around the world. In the UK, PayPal will match donations made on the day via its fundraising page or app up to a total of \u00c2\u00a350,000. Some brands will also be supporting charitable efforts on the day including clothing chain FatFace, tea label Pukka Herbs and Pret a Manger. Fatface will donate up to \u00c2\u00a3100,000 of profits made over the weekend to charities including Nepal Appeal, the Prince\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trust Tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Talent programme and recycled swimwear maker Ocean Positive. It will also give the top 10 trading stores \u00c2\u00a32,000 each to donate to local community charities. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The whole Black Friday thing is fake and customers are getting wise to it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said FatFace boss Anthony Thompson. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bigger brands and retailers should look very hard at what they are doing.

                "bodyText":"Finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the meltdown in the oil market: Plus the latest from America, where Black Friday has been a little less boisterous this year... Amazon has reiterated that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protests didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop it handling customer orders, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were fully operational today as our associates focused on delivering for our customers. Any reports to the contrary are simply wrong. We respect the rights of groups and individuals to have their voice, but for us it was business as usual inside our Fulfillment Centres.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some shoppers have also been having a jolly time, by the look of it.... More from the GMB: Currys PC World report that Nintendo Switch, Xbox 1 and iPad minis were their most popular products today. Sales of Ring smart doorbells are up 200% (they let you see who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the door remotely, and chat to them). Barclaycard has updated its transaction data; by 3pm, the number of UK payments handled today was up 10% on last year, but the amount spent is down 12%. Despite being one of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most depressed markets, Black Friday in Greece is so popular that it began four days ago and will only end next week on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCyber Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The Hellenic Confederation of Commerce and Entrepreneurship, which represents small and medium-sized businesses announced this afternoon that one in two Greeks had taken advantage of the super sale with clothes and electronic goods flying off shop shelves nationwide. Buoyed by good weather consumers could be seen in central Athens flooding stores earlier in the day. Greeks trawling the net for buys have increased by a whopping 26%, according to data compiled by the national statistics agency. Earlier this week Paypal said it had calculated e-shopping has jumped 50% on Black Friday and Cyber Monday in Greece, a country where hardships still abounds on the back of the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-running economic crisis and where these events were foreign concepts not that long ago. Plenty of charities, local groups and fashion brands are doing Black Friday differently. Sarah Butler explains: Greenpeace has teamed up with partners including Fashion Revolution and Shareable to back Make Smthing week, during which artists and crafters lead workshops on creative ways to reuse, repair or recycle goods. Events taking place over the weekend include ShareFest in Totnes, Festival of Sustainable Fashion in London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hackney and Leeds Community Clothes Exchange. The Charities Aid Foundation is backing the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts for global charity event Giving Tuesday on 27 November, which encourages people to do something for \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or give something to \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a charity they care about. Celebrities including blogger and Strictly Come Dancing participant Joe Sugg, Ricky Gervais and Martin Lewis are supporting the day which last year raised \u00c2\u00a3213m online alone around the world. In the UK, PayPal will match donations made on the day via its fundraising page or app up to a total of \u00c2\u00a350,000. Some brands will also be supporting charitable efforts on the day including clothing chain FatFace, tea label Pukka Herbs and Pret a Manger. Fatface will donate up to \u00c2\u00a3100,000 of profits made over the weekend to charities including Nepal Appeal, the Prince\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trust Tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Talent programme and recycled swimwear maker Ocean Positive. It will also give the top 10 trading stores \u00c2\u00a32,000 each to donate to local community charities.... Rebecca Long Bailey MP, Shadow Business Secretary, is pushing the government to protect workers facing redundancy at Ellesmere Port: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is devastating news for workers and their families in the run up to Christmas and is especially shocking considering the car maker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent return to profit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bosses must now urgently meet with unions to ensure that there are no compulsory redundancies and work to provide long term certainty to workers and their families during this difficult time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This distracted Government cannot sit back and allow for the decimation of such a vital industry with its highly skilled workforce, the loss of which will be felt not just locally but nationally.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bleak news from the UK car sector -- Vauxhall is cutting 241 jobs at its Ellesmere Port plant, which makes the Astra model. In a statement, the company says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This restructuring is critical to ensure that the Ellesmere Port plant develops its competitiveness during this difficult time within the industry,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The firm, owned by US auto group GM, had already cut jobs earlier this year, and in 2017. This is eBay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest Black Friday ever, according to Rob Hattrell, UK VP of eBay, who adds: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting up to 100 million visits to our marketplace over this weekend and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve lined up some great deals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the X Box One is performing exceptionally well this week. Black Friday isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just about tech, we are seeing high sales volumes in Menswear, DIY equipment and furniture too. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just about the big brands, we support thousands of small businesses on our platform like Velocity Electronics, and on Cyber Monday we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be handing over our biggest advertising space on Piccadilly Lights to them. The dropping oil price is part of a broader theme.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our comprehensive round-up of the best offers out there: Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has backed the push for better conditions at Amazon: Brent crude has now plunged by 28% since early October, when it was trading at $84 per barrel. Newsflash: Oil is having a Black Friday sale of its own. Brent crude has just fallen through the $60/barrel mark for the first time since October 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 4.5% drop today, extending its earlier losses. US crude is also slumping deeper, down 6.6% at just over $51 per barrel. Why? Traders are concluding that slower economic growth and ongoing trade wars means less demand for energy. Cailin Birch, global commodities analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oil prices\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 recent slide primarily reflects the weakening outlook for global oil demand. The US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to issue waivers for major importers of Iranian oil has erased earlier fears that US sanctions would create a supply crunch. Against that backdrop, the slowing pace of Chinese GDP growth, and therefore energy demand growth, is a concern. Emerging economies in Asia, primarily China, will be responsible for much for the new oil consumption in the coming years, so oil prices will remain very sensitive to the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic performance.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The other big trend this year is that more shoppers are buying on their mobiles, rather than making that cold and lonely trek to a special 5am opening. Sarah Butler explains: Argos said half of its orders so far had been made on a handset, up from 40% last year, while Carphone Warehouse said its sales through smartphones were up 8% year on year. Midnight until 1am was the busiest period for online shopping with 87% of sales made via mobiles, according to one estimate. Barclaycard reports that there are more UK Black Friday shoppers than last year, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re spending less. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: 16% increase in the volume of payment transactions compared to the same period on Black Friday last year 21% decrease in the amount spent compared to Black Friday last year Shoppers need to be extra-careful not to fall for a bad deal today, says Nicla Di Palma, equity analyst at Brewin Dolphin. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After a tough year for the UK high street and the dominance of online retailers, this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Black Friday will cover a broader range of products and offer more pronounced discounts. This could see customers lured away from Christmas deals, as they stock up on products ahead of the festive period. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The competition between retailers is intensifying and this should, in theory, benefit customers. But, as today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Which report highlights, customers need to be vigilant as to whether those amazing Black Friday deals really are what they claim to be. The report said 87% of the Black Friday deal items they investigated were available for the same price, or cheaper, at other times of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More protests, this time at Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Milton Keynes offices. This time, the GMB have turned up with an ASBO (anti-social behaviour order), accusing the company of deliberately using loopholes to cut its corporation tax bill. For the record, Amazon UK paid a corporation tax bill of \u00c2\u00a34.5m last year -- half as much as in the previous 12 months, despite a 35% rise in turnover. Tax is paid on profits, not revenue, of course. Amazon tells us that it is business as usual today, despite the protests in the UK, and strikes in Germany, Spain and Italy. The e-commerce giant says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our European Fulfillment Network is fully operational and we continue to focus on delivering for our customers and reports to the contrary are simply wrong.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In Madrid, unions have hung a banner reading \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Exploitation without rights\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the fence outside an Amazon logistics centre. Police are guarding the entrance... Back in the markets, oil is continuing to slide. Brent crude is now down 3% at $60.55 per barrel, the lowest since November 2017. US crude has slumped by 5% as traders brace for a supply glut. The GMB union have created a powerful video for Black Friday, urging Amazon to treat its workers fairly, not like unfeeling automatons: French environmental groups ANV Cop21 and Les Amis de la Terre (Friends of the Earth) are also protesting against Amazon today. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just dumped a load of broken electronics devices outside its French headquarters in Clichy, in northwest France. Les Amis de la Terre accuse Amazon of causing environmental damage by destroying unsold products and failing to help recovery electrical and electronic waste - as well as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153waging an economic war\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on other retailers. Just in: A video clip from Spain of Amazon workers striking, at its San Fernando de Henares warehouse. Unions across Europe are holding protests today against the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinhuman conditions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at retail giant Amazon. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re using Black Friday as an opportunity to highlight problems at Amazon, including tough performance targets, jobsite hazards, and anti-union hostility. In the UK, the GMB union is holding a protest at five stores - including in Swansea: The GMB says: Amazon fosters a brutal, high-pressure work environment in which speed is valued over safety, according to warehouse employees, and the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demanding goals over long, gruelling shifts cause widespread injuries. For example, a GMB survey of UK workers found that 9-in-10 have pain on the job. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have repetitive strain, and spondylosis with arthritis,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one Amazon worker organising with the GMB who fears retaliation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The work is dehumanising, you are a number not a person. if you have health issues, the Amazon way is to pay you off and replace you with temporary workers with less terms and conditions. Elsewhere, chronic pain is too common. Workers in Germany, Italy and Spain are planning to strike today, causing disruption on one of Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest days of the year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: Germany: Amazon workers, members of ver.di, walked off the job this morning at the Bad Hersfeld facility at 8:30 a.m. Italy: Italian labour union FILCAMS CGIL announced a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153state of agitation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and Black Friday solidarity actions at several Amazon facilities. Spain: The Comisiones Obreras (CCOO) will lead a strike at Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s San Fernando de Henares on November 23 and 24. The Madrid-area facility employs 1,800 workers and was last on strike during Amazon Prime Day in May. United Kingdom: The GMB will hold large protests outside of five Amazon warehouses in the UK. One of those \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fulfilment centres,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the 1,500 worker Rugeley warehouse, was recently called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of the most dangerous places to work in Britain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, on the eurozone slowdown: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The cooling of Eurozone business growth to a four- year low adds to signs that the economy faces a disappointing end of the year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Manufacturing remains the main area of weakness, linked in part to having been hit hard once again by deteriorating exports. The slowdown is also being temporarily exacerbated by persistent disappointing car sales. However, November also brought further signs that the manufacturing-led slowdown is spilling over to services, as consumer and corporate demand was often reported to have weakened in the face of headwinds such as rising political uncertainty, tighter financial conditions and higher prices. Uh ho.... growth across the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector has hit its lowest level since the end of 2014 That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest survey of purchasing managers in Europe, from data firm Markit. Firms reported slower order book growth and falling exports, alongside deteriorating optimism about the outlook, plus rising costs and prices. This dragged Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI, a measure of growth, down to 52.4 (from 53.1 in October). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 47-month low. Manufacturing firms suffered particularly badly - suggesting that the trade disputes triggered by America this year are now hurting. Markit says: Manufacturers commonly blamed slower growth on subdued global demand, rising political and economic uncertainty, trade wars and especially sluggish car sales. The survey also shows that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy lost pace. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worrying, especially as the German economy shrank between July and September. Shoppers are being urged not to be tricked by dubious \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbargains\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 today. My colleague Sarah Butler has the details: Research from consumer group Which? released this week found that nearly nine in 10 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd available on Black Friday last year had been even cheaper at other times of year. Jon Holt, head of financial services at KPMG, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Black Friday plays on the excitement of spending while frictionless finance and cheap credit puts that buying buzz within everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grasp. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our poll found that 51% of respondents didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even think the discounts they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re offered on Black Friday are a genuine saving! Having an economy disproportionately built on debt is not sustainable for consumers, retailers or financial services.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Retailers are also at risk of diving further into the red as a result of slashing prices, according to credit ratings agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. It said retailers without a carefully thought-out strategy only succeeded in booking sales they would have made anyway in December, but at lower levels of profit. The nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inboxes are bursting with Black Friday offers: Sergio Bucher, chief executive of Debenhams, says Black Friday is one of the retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest days of the year, and well worth the heavy discounting of prices. He told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the starting gun of the Christmas campaign. Yes, customers are going to be coming to stores and buying some discounted products, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also buy some full-priced products, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be having a coffee, eating a piece of cake, drinking gin and tonic. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This Friday we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to be selling probably pretty much four times as much as a normal Friday so it is a big event for us. It is one of our biggest days of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Commenting on recent speculation that Debenhams could be the next big high street name to go under, Bucher insisted the department store chain has a future despite announcing plans a month ago to close about 50 stores. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Retail overall is a tough place to be right now... we started our transformation about 12 months ago. If you were to go to Watford where we opened a new store you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d see a completely different face of Debenhams so I think that we have a very strong plan and we are transforming our product range as well. We are definitely here to stay. I bought shares two weeks ago, so I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have done that if I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have trust.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes there are a number of stores we will need to close in the future. We see a future for Debenhams with about 100 stores with a bigger online business, and we have started conversations with our landlords.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Black Friday got off with a whimper, rather than a bang, this morning. Some retailers threw their doors open early, but there was little sign of a rush. My colleague Jasper Jolly trudged to Tesco Extra in Surrey Quays, south-east London, and found only a handful of eager punters in the pre-dawn chill. Staff at the Tesco, one of more than 700 holding Black Friday sales across the country, unlocked the giant store at 5am, an hour earlier than usual. They easily outnumbered the seven people waiting outside. Brendan Boshell, a 26-year-old working at a small start-up, was the first outside, hoping to snap up a bargain Xbox One games console. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m quite surprised I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m the only one,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says, after reading about fights for products . In the past, police waited at different stores during the Black Friday sales. Factcheck: Donald Trump seems to have mixed up his oil price numbers in that tweet. US crude only peaked at $76 per barrel last month - it was Brent crude that got into the 80s. Donald Trump has been keen to take some credit (OK, all the credit) for the drop in oil prices, as these tweets show: Certainly, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refusal to condemn Saudi Arabia over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi has cut the risk that Riyadh hits back with a supply shock [this position leaves the White House is now at odds with the CIA over the case]. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war has also left America with an oil glut, as China has cut imports of US crude. In addition, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to grant waivers to allow certain countries to keep buying Iranian oil has also pushed prices down - while also startling the Saudis. Forbes has a good take: Saudi Arabia was caught off guard by the decision to grant waivers, which resulted in too much oil in the market. The price of oil predictably plunged, but Saudi Arabia has vowed to cut production. They are also working with other countries to engineer an even bigger production cut. The President is now attempting to pacify Saudi Arabia by giving the country a pass on the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October, and by publicly thanking them on Twitter. But that will be unlikely to compensate for billions in lost revenue over what Saudi Arabia undoubtedly considers to be a double cross. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group on the sliding oil price: Oil experienced another volatile session overnight. Swings of over 1% have been the norm in the latter part of this week and volatility has been high since the beginning of November. This highlights just how jittery the oil market is right now. US inventories hitting their highest level in 11 months fuelled concerns over a global crude glut amid a worsening economic outlook. The fact that oil traders shrugged off expectations that OPEC will start withholding supply in 2019 to rein in a glut reflects just how concerned oil traders are over the future outlook. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The oil price is sliding this morning, as oversupply fear and trade war angst continues to take their toll. Brent crude has dropped to $61.52 per barrel overnight, its cheapest point since early December 2017. US crude is under pressure too - down 2% today to just $53.39 per barrel, a level not seen since October 2017. Several factors are in play. In particular - signs that supply glut is building up. The fracking industry generating more supplies, and Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s production is still getting to the markets thanks to US sanction waivers. Opec, the producers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cartel, is likely to vote to cut production when it meets next month. That expectation isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t providing much relief now, though. Oil is also being hit by the general drop in asset prices this autumn, and also suffering from fears that the global economy will slow in 2019. Stephen Innes of trading firm OANDA explains: The overhang from swelling US inventories which remain freshly minted in trader minds suggests the massive crude glut continues to outweigh OPEC output cut although tentatively curbing traders downside ambitions. But while a weaker oil price gives Opec a headache, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for countries who import the stuff. Motorists ought to see some benefits at the petrol pump, eventually.... Also coming up today It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Black Friday, famously a time when Americans put down their turkey drumsticks, pick up their credit card, and head to the mall. European retailers have embraced the idea too -- so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be watching for any notable deals, queues and scuffles. Amazon couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even wait for the big day itself (honestly, what happened to tradition?), and launched a pop-up shop in London yesterday: Plus, we get new data showing how the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector is faring this month.

Some new research by Barclaycard has suggested that this year in the UK we will spend \u00c2\u00a31.6bn on experience gifts this Christmas, as people veer away from sending and receiving physical gifts, and look towards presents that can make memories. And are also super-Instagram material. Barclaycard also say that their consumer survey suggested that this year spending in the Xmas period itself on entertainment and events such as gigs, beauty treatments and adventure days will be up 115% on last year If you are thinking of gifting someone an experience, then there are some deals around today that can save you a bit of cash - and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never know you skimped by ordering it on Cyber Monday ;-) Virgin Experience Days are offering a selection of deals as part of their Cyber Weekend promotion. It is worth having a dig around the full list, but here are some of the highlights: 50% off the View from The Shard Experience for two adults (Now \u00c2\u00a332, was \u00c2\u00a364) 75% off a Winery and Brewery Tour for two with tastings (Now \u00c2\u00a37.50, was \u00c2\u00a330) 35% off a London Bungee Jump for one (Now \u00c2\u00a349, was \u00c2\u00a380) 25% off a Vintage Afternoon Tea Bus Tour for two (Now \u00c2\u00a382.50, was \u00c2\u00a3110) 60% off a Supercar experience in 24 locations across the UK (Now \u00c2\u00a355, was \u00c2\u00a3139) There also some deals on London Musicals Aladdin in the West End is offering tickets from \u00c2\u00a325 as a limited Black Friday weekend promotion, with savings on tickets of up to 39%.

It would be remiss of me to spend a whole day live blogging special Cyber Monday offers and then neglect to mention one rather close to home... The Guardian and The Observer What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening? Brilliant offers across our range of print and digital subscription packages Where\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it happening? You can become a subscriber here. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the deal? Save 50% for three months on print and digital subscriptions to The Guardian and The Observer. Offer ends Sunday 2 December. If you are in the market for smart watches, then there are some good deals kicking around today on the web. You can save \u00c2\u00a360 on the Apple Watch Series 3 over at John Lewis, while Withings are offering their Full Black Smart Watch at half-price. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a decent (if slightly exaggerated) price drop on Huawei Band 2 Pro Fitness Wristband at Amazon, and you can also get the Fitbit Unisex Versa Health and Fitness Smartwatch for \u00c2\u00a3159 from the online retail giant. The Garmin Fenix 5 Multisport GPS Watch also has a hefty online discount on it at the moment, bringing it down to \u00c2\u00a3309.99. As one of the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resident Doctor Who nerds there was absolutely no way I was going to get through live blogging Cyber Monday without somehow cramming a Cyberman reference in there. And it is even topical, because episode Kerblam! the other week was about the perils of working in a mostly-automated factory sending out parcels and gifts. Ahem. Fortunately there are some Doctor Who-related deals I can tell you about. Big Finish, who produce Doctor Who audio dramas based on the original series, often with the original actors, have been offering discounts on a range of titles featuring the Time Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fantastic Foes, including the Master, the Daleks, the Ice Warriors, and of course, the Cybermen. Access the deals here using the code FANTASTIC. If you are buying for someone whose cult interests go a bit further than Doctor Who, then it is worth dropping in on the Forbidden Planet special offers page - they have discounts on a range of about 50 items including merchandise for Harry Potter, Rick &amp; Morty, Star Wars, and Deadpool. One of the things I suggested in my piece today about thoughtful presents you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve still got time to make or order was using old photos to make a nostalgic present for relatives or old friends. And you can do that slightly cheaper today, as printing service Photobox are offering up to 50% off everything, with an additional 20% off if you use the code CYBER20. Unfortunately you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a 20% discount on the amount of time it takes you to sort out the mess of photos stored on your laptop. Shopping online isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t without potential pitfalls, and Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of online comparison service money.co.uk, has this advice for people doing their Christmas shopping today. She says shoppers should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153factor in the cost of delivery when you compare prices online. Check whether you can click and collect for free, as this can be a good way to save if you live near a store.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She also warns us to be on our guard, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just because a retailer tells you they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve cut the price of an item you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take it as gospel; you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll only know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good value by shopping around. Be suspicious and check.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And there is a reminder of the consumer rights you enjoy when ordering online: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You get 14 days from the day your order arrives to return it and get a refund. This gives you the flexibility to cancel if you find your bargain cheaper elsewhere. There are some exceptions, like personalised goods, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guaranteed on most other purchases.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If possible, she says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pay for items that cost over \u00c2\u00a3100 by credit card to get protection, so you can go to your credit card company for a refund if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an issue.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Her final warning is one that applies to virtually everything on the internet, whether it is fake news or a Cyber Monday bargain: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If a deal seems too good to be true, treat it with a healthy degree of uncertainty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One of the things about Christmas is that it inevitably leads into the new year, and grand plans to re-invent yourself into a healthier lifestyle. What if you could prepare for that moment in advance? Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how you can do that, and save a little bit of money as well, with Cyber Monday deals on subscription boxes. HelloFresh is a subscription service that allows you to download the app and pick from a selection of recipes each week to be delivered to your door in neat packages with all of the fiddly ingredients portioned out and prepared for you. They often have good introductory deals, but their Cyber Weekend deal takes it one step further, offering 55% off your first 2 boxes/weeks (and you are not obliged to continue your subscription). Birchbox are offering 2 boxes for \u00c2\u00a35 using the code FRIYAY, a promotion they claim is their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153best offer ever.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Usually, boxes are \u00c2\u00a310 each, making this a 75% discount. Plus, December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s box will have a bumper 7 products, and again, the subscription can be cancelled at any time. KiwiCo deliver monthly crates of educational and creative activities for kids of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153every age and interest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and they are currently offering 60% off the first crate for those who sign up on Cyber Monday. Lifebox are part of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wellness Revolution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, delivering a selection of superfood snacks to subscribers every month as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153convenient and affordable way of discovering new and delicious wholefoods.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You can also buy their boxes as a one-off, and for Black Friday they are reducing the price of their Classic and Energy boxes to \u00c2\u00a317.21 (was \u00c2\u00a322.95). With about ten hours of Cyber Monday still to go, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a summary of some of the best deal lists we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve posted so far: Video games and consoles Major UK retailers Smart speakers and home voice assistants Phones and phone accessories Homeware deals Flights and holidays Museums and attractions Plus we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve covered magazine subscriptions, books, vacuum cleaners and kitchen mixers among other things. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m also interested in you sending me any weird and super-niche Cyber Monday offers by email to martin.belam@theguardian.com. Pro-tip 1: Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buy your partner gadgets to do household chores as Christmas presents. Pro-tip 2: If you need a new household chore gadget anyway, today is a good day to buy it cheaper than usual. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a selection of deals on vacuum cleaners: DYSON V7 Motorhead Cordless, Bagless Vacuum Cleaner Peddler are offering up to 37% off the Dyson V7 Motorhead Vacuum Cleaner, bringing it down from \u00c2\u00a3370 to \u00c2\u00a3234.19. However, if you would make use of Dyson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcToolkit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 including additional tools for mattresses, hard-to-reach areas and dried in dirt, Currys PC World are offering the Dyson V7 Motorhead Vacuum in a bundle deal with the Dyson Handheld Toolkit for a combined price of \u00c2\u00a3249. iRobot Roomba 980 Vacuum Cleaner Save \u00c2\u00a350 on the iRobot Roomba at John Lewis &amp; Partners, making it \u00c2\u00a3799, and get a 2 year guarantee included. Also good fun if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got cats or dogs round the house. SHARK IF250UKT True Pet Cordless Vacuum Cleaner Currys PC World have reduced this Shark vacuum cleaner to \u00c2\u00a3279 (was \u00c2\u00a3479) in their Cyber Monday sale. Plus, you can utilise another discount code on top of this promotion, which takes 10% off the marked price when you quote VACUUM10 at checkout, and there is the option to pay monthly. VAX Air Lift Steerable Pet Max Upright Bagless Vacuum Cleaner This well-reviewed vacuum cleaner has been reduced by several retailers with a saving of around \u00c2\u00a350, to \u00c2\u00a3129. However, John Lewis &amp; Partners and Currys PC World are both offering an included 2 year guarantee in their deals. Miele Classic C1 Edition Powerline Bagged Vacuum Cleaner With a saving of \u00c2\u00a351, the Miele Classic C1 Edition Vacuum is now \u00c2\u00a399 at John Lewis &amp; Partners, who claim this deal is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexclusive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to their customers. Like the other John Lewis deals mentioned, this also comes with a 2 year guarantee included and the option to add further protection against accidental damage for \u00c2\u00a310. Happy holiday hoovering! The chances are that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be in charge of buying the presents for at least one football fanatic in the family, and football merchandise is an easy, if obvious, choice for those sometimes-hard-to-buy-for children. Going to club websites today will yield you some savings. At the top of the Premier League Manchester City, Liverpool, Spurs, Chelsea, Arsenal and Everton are all offering discounts on selected lines ranging from 20% at Chelsea to 50% at Arsenal. A quick trip down the leagues showed club shops from the likes of Leeds and Sunderland joining in, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth checking directly with clubs to see if there is a deal on. Even my beloved Leyton Orient have some special offers on, so maybe it is finally the year someone will get me a nice woolly hat to wear at Brisbane Road. As a nation we are still in the grip of bake-off fever, which means the market for kitchen gadgets has never been healthier or more competitive. Here are some deals on stand mixers if you are looking to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153soup\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd up your kitchen gear. You see what I did there. KitchenAid 150 Artisan 4.8L Stand Mixer For anyone who has been waiting to get their hands on the cult favourite KitchenAid Artisan mixer - now is the time. This mixer has been dramatically reduced by several retailers, but most notably, Currys have reduced their price from \u00c2\u00a3549.99 to \u00c2\u00a3274 (a \u00c2\u00a3275.99 saving). Plus, they are offering a further discount code giving customers 10% off their order when they spend over \u00c2\u00a3200 on 2 or more small kitchen appliances and there is also the option to pay monthly. Kenwood kMix KMX754 Stand Mixer The Kenwood kMix has also seen large reductions across the board - AO, Amazon and John Lewis have all reduced their prices to \u00c2\u00a3179. However, John Lewis include a 2 year guarantee with their deal, and you can add an additional 2 years of protection against accidental damage for \u00c2\u00a315. Fearne by Swan: 6 Litre Die Cast Stand Mixer After bringing out several successful cookbooks, Fearne Cotton released her own range of kitchen appliances with Swan. Her 6 Litre stand mixer has not been reduced by many retailers, but Amazon are offering a saving of \u00c2\u00a3175, making it \u00c2\u00a3124.99 (down from \u00c2\u00a3299.99) in four colours, and they are also including free delivery. Sage The Scraper Mixer BEM430 Heston Blumenthal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4.7L stand mixer is on offer at almost 30% off from ECookshop, with free delivery available. While this is a better deal than the likes of AO and Amazon are offering, if you do spot it cheaper elsewhere, ECookshop will endeavour to price match. Also, while we are thinking about the kitchen, do take five minutes to read Zoe Williams\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 amazing interview with bake-off\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kim-Joy Running a live blog about Cyber Monday is a bit like going shopping, but without any of the fun. And by the end of the day I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have got my Christmas shopping sorted either. However, it does mean you run into a lot of rather leftfield suggestions for ways for people to invest and save money. Probably the most obscure promo I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen cross my inbox so far today is for Farmers Weekly. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve extended their weekend sale and today, for the last day, you can subscribe to the Web+ digital version of Farmers Weekly for \u00c2\u00a350+VAT. Go on, you know you want to. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the only place you can get subscription discounts on magazines however. Magazine.co.uk is offering \u00c2\u00a315 off when you subscribe to three titles. iSubscribe, on the other hand, is offering 10% off and a \u00c2\u00a35 credit voucher if you take out magazine subscriptions before the end of today. GreatMagazines.co.uk is offering 20% off new subscriptions over the value of \u00c2\u00a325, and that deal runs until the end of tomorrow. Another magazine with a special deal going on is Anorak, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchappy mag for kids\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 aimed at boys and girls aged between 6 and 12 years old. They are offering 20% off all their single issues and posters with the code HAPPYANORAK. You can have a browse here. Incidentally, you can email me at martin.belam@theguardian.com if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen an even more obscure Cyber Monday deal. Books make a lovely gift, since the choice often says something personal about you, and there are some bargains to be had out there on Cyber Monday. WH Smith are offering 50% off or more on selected titles and Waterstones have a similar deal, while Book Depository have up to 60% off their promotional titles. You can get 20% off online purchases at Foyles with the code BLACKFRIDAY20. CYBER25 is the code you need to unlock 25% discounts with Book People. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget that the Guardian Bookshop is also offering deals and gift suggestions with up to 30% discount, which you can find here. Need a bit of inspiration? Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what our books team were recommending back in the autumn. West Elm are offering 20% off everything in stock, including items that are already in clearance, quoting the puntastic code \u00e2\u20ac\u0153FRIYAY\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in store or online.

For example: Save \u00c2\u00a31000 on selected mattresses Save up to \u00c2\u00a3750 off Hendricks fabric sofas Save \u00c2\u00a3100 on the Jacobs Storage Bench Save \u00c2\u00a330 on bed linen Anthropologie have 20% discounts on selected lines until midnight tonight.

They are also offering free standard delivery on all orders which will be automatically applied at checkout. Other homewares brands that are offering Cyber Monday discounts include Wayfair, Debenhams, and Sofa.com. And with that, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to pop to have some lunch at the Guardian canteen, where I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m hoping there will be some cracking Cyber Monday deals on quinoa and hummus. For the Apple iPhone XR, while Carphone Warehouse are offering a saving of \u00c2\u00a3470 on the a 24 month Vodafone contract for the iPhone XR until midnight (\u00c2\u00a336 per month, \u00c2\u00a359.99 upfront cost), mobiles.co.uk are offering the same deal except with no upfront cost. If it is the Google Pixel you are after, Carphone Warehouse are also offering \u00c2\u00a3510 off their Google Pixel 3 24 month contract with Vodafone, including 100GB of data and unlimited texts and minutes (\u00c2\u00a336 per month, \u00c2\u00a329.99 upfront cost) Mobilephonesdirect.co.uk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top deal for Cyber Monday is a 24 month contract for the Huawei Mate 20 Pro (128GB) at \u00c2\u00a345 a month with no upfront cost. This deal comes with 50GB data, unlimited minutes and texts, an O2 SIM card, free delivery and one month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free insurance. Appliances Direct meanwhile have dramatically reduced the price of the Samsung Galaxy S9 by \u00c2\u00a3240, making it \u00c2\u00a3499. Mobiles.co.uk are pushing several extended deals for Cyber Monday. Among other things they are offering an iPhone XR on Vodafone with 100GB data for \u00c2\u00a336 per month and a Samsung Galaxy S9 on Vodafone with 40GB data in a deal which works out to \u00c2\u00a328 per month. In the market for an iPhone XS? In among the buymobiles.net Cyber Monday offers you can pick one up for \u00c2\u00a337 per month with 80GB of data. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an upfront cost of \u00c2\u00a3119, but it looks to be one of the better deals for that handset today. On the accessories front, Gear4 have big discounts on protective cases for your phones, including 70% off the Piccadilly range and 50% off the Battersea range, which will apparently protect your phone from a 16 foot drop. Screen protectors for the Apple iPhone 6/7/8, iPhone X/XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR are down to \u00c2\u00a320.99 from \u00c2\u00a329.99. If skin care is your thing, then hop over to the Dermalogica website where for Cyber Monday they are offering three for two on full-sized products. Feel Unique, meanwhile, have a range of Cyber Monday deals promising up to 33% off of over 25,000 beauty and perfume products, and the exciting bonus of a mystery gift if you spend over \u00c2\u00a350. *spooky ooo-oooo-oh ghost noise* One big question around Black Friday and Cyber Monday that remains - is it actually making anybody any happier? A couple of days ago my colleague reported on whether the backlash against Black Friday had already started in the UK. Greenpeace is among a group of organisations promoting MAKE SMTHNG as an alternative to the consumer spending over this weekend. During it artists and crafters run workshops on ways to reuse, repair or recycle goods, rather than buying something new. There is some data too about how the Black Friday shopping experience makes people unhappy. HappyOrNot, the company that produce the little machines where you can register how happy you are with a consumer experience by pressing a range of smiley or not-smiley faces, measured 575,000 feedbacks from customers in places like Lidl, Zara, and Tesco. They claim that analysing the data shows that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just lived through the unhappiest UK Black Friday they have on record. As well as a year-on-year decline in happiness, in the UK, Black Friday was slightly unhappier (79.8%) for UK shoppers than an average day in 2018 (80.3%). UK shopper happiness also dropped drastically throughout the day, starting at 84.3% for early birds at 9am, and ending at 78% for those still slogging round the shops at 9pm. None of that today though - with Cyber Monday you can happily do it all from your phone of course. By the way, if you are struggling for Christmas inspiration, we have this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gift guide over here. And here are 12 ideas for gifts that keep giving throughout the year, by taking out a subscription service for someone. The jury is still out on whether having a smart speaker in your home is giving corporations undue surveillance in our private spaces, or whether all that worry is out-weighed by it just really being handy to be able to shout out \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hey, whatsisface, play my electronic surveillance playlist, ta\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, or turn the lights off without getting off the sofa. If you are in the market for one, here are some options: Amazon have a range of discounts on their home speaker products, including \u00c2\u00a335 off the Echo, \u00c2\u00a330 off the Echo Dot, and \u00c2\u00a330 off the second generation Echo Plus. Google offer a variety of smart speakers and their flagship Google Home Hub. You can pick the latter up with a \u00c2\u00a340 discount from ao.com, which brings the price down to \u00c2\u00a399. Currys PC World are also offering deals across the whole range of voice assistants. Amidst the frenzy of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a move in the US to try and get \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Museum Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to be a thing in the middle of it, where people promote more thoughtful activities than shopping. Although, obviously, getting people to part with their cash to attend attractions is still part of the agenda. It hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t particularly caught on in the UK yet, but there are some deals around on museums and attractions if you know where to look. If Lego is your thing, then Legoland in Windsor have a new Haunted House Monster Party Ride launching in spring 2019, and some Cyber Monday offers on booking for it in advance. The deal works out at \u00c2\u00a335 per person based on a family of two adults and two children, and can be accessed here before midnight. When it presumably turns into a Lego pumpkin or something. A Merlin Annual Pass can get you into 32 UK attractions including Madame Tussauds, the London Eye, Alton Towers, Sea Life centres and Warwick Castle. They are offering three months for free, making it last 15 months, if you order during their Cyber week offer. It could make a great gift for a family - but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a bit of small print to note though, and lots of times when you might want to be taking the kids out, like August and Bank Holidays, are excluded from the major attractions. Not a visit, but the Natural History Museum have been running Black Friday and Cyber Monday discounts in their online store all weekend. If there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a transport nerd in your life, then the Black Friday sale at the London Transport Museum might be worth a visit - among the offers there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a range of reproduction vintage posters down to half-price. Oh, and if you do want an educational angle on Black Friday, this article from the Museum of London about how a march on Parliament by suffragettes on 18 November 1910 came to be known as Black Friday due to the repeated assaults on the protesting women might make an antidote to the spending it has come to be associated with today. As well as offers on hotels, airlines often join in Black Friday and Cyber Monday with a series of deals to help you jet away in the new year. British Airways have offers on luxury holidays which expire at midnight tonight, including saving \u00c2\u00a3100 on holidays with a minimum spend of \u00c2\u00a32,500 per booking, and saving \u00c2\u00a350 on holidays with a minimum spend of \u00c2\u00a31,250 per booking. Which don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem like huge savings to be honest. Club Med\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cyber Monday promotion boasts that holidaymakers can save up to \u00c2\u00a3520 per person on all-inclusive holidays. Destinations include skiing in the French Alps and holidays in the Caribbean, covering flights that depart from London, Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh and more. Expedia claim to have secured \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special low Black Friday &amp; Cyber Monday fares from top airlines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gathered the details here. Fleetway also have some deals on flights and holidays - some of the options are gathered together here. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a \u00c2\u00a3100 discount on all holidays over \u00c2\u00a31200 if you enter the code BLACKFRIDAY when booking before 29 November. Norwegian, the low-cost long-haul airline, have up to 30% off flights booked before the end of the day - it might finally be the moment to book that trip to the US. Ryanair have a slightly more convoluted deal going on. If you book a room somewhere with them, you get 10% of the vale back as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Flight credit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on your account that you can then, presumably, spend on the flights to get there. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a more straightforward \u00c2\u00a330 off flights offer. Virgin Atlantic are offering up to \u00c2\u00a3150 off flight and hotel combinations, you need to enter the code BF2018 when booking. The shift to online retailing has made times tough on the high street for department stores. Some of them, like Fenwick, Fortnum &amp; Mason, Harrods and Selfridges have stayed out of the Cyber Monday fray. Others, like Debenhams, are offering plenty of deals. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick whizz around the discounts available online today from some of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major department stores: Debenhams What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening? \u00e2\u20ac\u015312 days of amazing deals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Black Friday spectacular\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Where?

Offers include discounts on Mulberry and UGG, as well as deals on Apple, Samsung and Sonos products. Liberty What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening?

Up to 30% off, with 15% off beauty. The deals aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t grouped together as easily as on other websites though, so you have to have a bit of a rummage through the men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goods to bargain hunt. If you think \u00c2\u00a324 for two pairs of socks is a bargain, of course. If you are after fabrics though, today is the day, as there is 20% of a huge range. A huge amount of attention on Black Friday and Cyber Monday naturally goes to the biggest UK retailers - but there are also a lot of deals to be had from smaller shops and manufacturers on the sites they use to sell. Etsy has gathered together all the items with Cyber Monday discounts on their site into one place. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a huge range of discounted jewellery and clothing, on offer, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a good chance to pick up a few bits to make your home even more festive with a range of discounted Christmas decorations on offer.

In their price match section they are promising 15% off MAC make-up, 20% off Barbour, and 30% off Levi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Ralph Lauren. A word of caution though - it still pays to shop around and do your own price comparisons on Cyber Monday. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just take a retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s word for it that they are the cheapest available today. Remember, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not like the horror of having to flit from crowded shop to crowded shop making price checks, so it really is worth looking around. Black Friday and Cyber Monday have become key fixtures in the retail run-up to Christmas. My colleague Rebecca Smithers reports today that customers in the UK are expected to have spent around \u00c2\u00a37bn across the weekend.

John Lewis said both its stores and website traded well with some stores also reporting a record week. Black Friday, the US-inspired discount event, was the busiest day but business was more broadly spread across the week than in previous years, as the company launched its own discounts earlier in the week and matched the promotional prices of rival stores under its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153never knowingly undersold\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pledge. The strong figures from John Lewis will raise hopes of a better than expected Christmas for the retailer after early data for Black Friday, which fell on 23 November, suggested shoppers had cut back this year. Barclaycard said that shoppers had spent 10% less on the day by mid-afternoon, while footfall in town centres, shopping centres and retail parks was down by 6%, according to the shopper monitoring firm Springboard. Part of that change was because shoppers were able to spread their bargain hunting over a longer period of time because retailers began discounting earlier. Figures from the CBI, released on Tuesday, revealed that overall retail sales increased last month, especially at supermarkets and at shops selling household and recreational goods. Analysts said the pick-up in sales was better than expected after a poor October when sales dropped to their weakest level since last April. But the amount of goods sold dropped in shops selling clothing, footwear, furniture and carpets, and in hardware and DIY stores. And the broadly healthier picture in November after a weak October was unable to prevent an eighth quarter in a row of declining employment across the retail sector. Anna Leach, the CBI head of economic intelligence, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While it is encouraging to see headline retail sales growth strengthen in November after a weak outturn in October, the quarterly survey continues to paint a gloomy picture of the sector. Business sentiment remains poor, investment intentions are flat, and headcount continues to decline.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some analysts fear that Black Friday only served to pull forward sales which could have been booked at full price in October or December. On Tuesday, fast fashion retailer Quiz reported a 2% fall in underlying profits in the six months to 30 September partly as a result of the \u00c2\u00a3400,000 it was owed by House of Fraser when the department store fell into administration in August. Offsetting the good period at John Lewis, the department store\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sister chain Waitrose had a difficult week.
