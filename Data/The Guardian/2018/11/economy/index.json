                "bodyText":"And finally.... Wall Street has closed higher, for the third day in a row. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 264 points to 25,380, up around 1%. That means it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s put on over 900 points in the last three days - quite a bounceback. The S&amp;P 500 also gained just over 1%, while the tech stock revival left the Nasdaq 1.7% higher. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweet citing progress in talks with China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Xi over their trade conflict boosted morale in New York. Traders are also anticipating a good US jobs report tomorrow, while also hoping that the US Federal Reserve might see fit to ease up on interest rate hikes. On that note, goodnight! GW Back in New York, shares continue to recover from last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. The Nasdaq is up 1.5%, as technology stocks such as chipmakers rebound. Brexit optimism, and the prospect of UK interest rate rises next year, are driving the pound higher and higher tonight. Sterling has gained more than two cents, a big move, against the US dollar to almost $1.30. This has slightly weighed on stocks, with the FTSE 100 dropping 13 points or 0.2% to 7,114. Heads-up, UK savers and borrowers. Richard Falkenh\u00c3\u00a4ll, senior FX strategist at Nordic bank SEB, predicts two UK interest rate hikes in 2019 - possibly starting in just three months time. He says: With inflation staying above the target next year and the year after, and with a tight labour market, the BoE will continue with a slow tightening of policy with one or two hikes per year. We expect the next hike in May 2019, followed by one in November 2019. Falkenh\u00c3\u00a4ll suspects the BoE is too optimistic about UK growth, but also reckons earnings growth could strengthen: There is uncertainty related to the domestic cost pressure in the UK where we believe inflation will fall back faster than the BoE projects. There are signs of accelerating wage growth and it will be important to see if this development continues. If wage growth accelerates further towards 3.5-4%, the next hike could be in February 2019, if there is a EU withdrawal deal in place.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A group of top business leaders, academics, economists, entrepreneurs are meeting today at Number 10 Downing Street to tackle Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-standing productivity crisis. The Industrial Strategy Council will oversee the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to boost innovation, improve the business environment, raise wages, enhance Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure networks, and play a key role in areas such as artificial intelligence and clean growth. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tough gig -- UK productivity has been a problem since at least the second world war, resisting a series of governments\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 efforts to raise output closer to Japanese or German levels. But the council, whose membership is being announced today, has a high-quality, experienced bench of talent (and gender-balanced, too). It will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hold the government to account\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says business secretary Greg Clark, by producing success measures for the industrial strategy, and holding the government to account on them. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full membership list: Andy Haldane (Chair) - Chief Economist, Bank of England Dame Kate Barker - Commissioner of the National Infrastructure Commission and recently Chair of the Industrial Strategy Commission. Emma Bridgewater - Founder of Emma Bridgewater Ceramics. Professor Diane Coyle - Bennett Professor of Public Policy at the University of Cambridge. Jayne-Anne Gadhia - Ex-Chief Executive, Virgin Money. Member of the Scottish Business Taskforce. Christine Gaskell - Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) Chair, Cheshire and Warrington. Rupert Harrison - Managing Director of BlackRock. Dame Vivian Hunt - Managing Partner UK and Ireland, McKinsey, Chair of CBI London Council. Dame Rotha Johnston \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Chair of Northern Ireland Screen. Professor Juergen Maier - Chief Executive of Siemens plc. Sir Paul Marshall - Co-founder and Chairman, Marshall Wace LLP. Sir Charlie Mayfield - Chairman, John Lewis Partnership, Chair of Be the Business Lady Nicola Mendelsohn - Advertising executive; Vice-President for Europe, the Middle East and Africa for Facebook. Non-Executive Director of Diageo. Archie Norman - Chair, Marks &amp; Spencer. Formerly Chief Executive of Asda, Chair of ITV, McKinsey Consultant and Director at GEEST, Railtrack and Kingfisher. Hayley Parsons - Welsh entrepreneur and investor, and Founder of GoCompare Roy Rickhuss - General Secretary of Community and member of the Executive Council of the General Federation of Trade Unions and the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation. Professor Dame Nancy Rothwell - President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Manchester and Professor of Physiology, Co-chair of the Council for Science and Technology and past President of the Royal Society of Biology Professor Jennifer Rubin - Executive Chair of the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), Professor of Public Policy at Kings College London Rohan Silva - Co-founder of Second Home, Senior Visiting Fellow at LSE Cities. Matthew Taylor - Chief Executive, Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA). Prime Minister Theresa May explains why the Strategy matters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our modern Industrial Strategy is key to building a successful economy that works for everyone and creating high-quality jobs across the UK. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This Council gathers some of the most influential figures in business, academia, and civil society. Together, they will share their expertise and skills to measure the progress of our strategy and ensure it is boosting people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wages and improving productivity of British businesses.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In other news, US president Donald Trump has claimed progress in the US-China trade wars. That has helped push shares up in Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average has gained 190 points (0.75%) in the first hour of trading. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little late for Halloween japes, but is Mark Carney really serious when he suggests the Bank of England could raise interest rates in a no-deal Brexit scenario? He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absolutely right that inflation could rise sharply if the pound slumps, and expensive tariffs are imposed on European goods. Also, if supply into the economy is squeezed (because goods can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get into the UK), new inflationary pressures would be created as consumers and businesses fought to get their hands on raw materials and finished goods. But in that situation, the economy would also be reeling from a serious shock. Businesses and households would need reassurance, not a painful interest rate hike to drive up the cost of credit. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, reckons the Bank is trying to concentrate minds in Westminster and Brussels. He writes: The idea that the MPC would actually kick the economy on the way down is highly implausible. It is the equivalent of George Osborne saying before the referendum that there would be an emergency budget to raise taxes and cut spending by \u00c2\u00a330bn in the event of a vote to Leave. But Osborne was trying to influence millions of voters: Mark Carney and his MPC colleagues are seeking to concentrate minds among a much smaller constituency: the policymakers negotiating a deal and the MPs who will eventually vote on it. Which is why Project Fear Mk II might just work. Ed Conway of Sky News isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced either, saying: Consider what happened two years ago. The then-chancellor and the Bank warned before the referendum that interest rates might rise if the UK voted leave. Most economists and commentators, myself included, said that this seemed deeply implausible. Lo and behold, at the first practicable moment after the referendum the Bank cut interest rates. It even pumped an extra few tens of billions of pounds into the economy through quantitative easing. In short, it did precisely the opposite of what it warned about before the referendum. It is hard to conclude that the same working assumptions shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t apply this time around as well. The pound has continued to climb, and is on track for its best day since January. Sterling has risen as high as $1.293, up more than one and a half cents, on hope that the UK and EU are making progress. Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about how the economy should pick up pace under a smooth Brexit is also helping: Mark Carney warns that a no-deal Brexit would put the UK into new territory. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no real precedent for a big supply shock hitting a major advanced economy, in the era of inflation targeting, he points out. Q: Did you really tell the cabinet that the Chequers deal would allow the UK to claw back three-quarters of its lost output since the referendum? Governor Carney declines to comment on his recent briefing with cabinet ministers, but he does repeat that Chequers would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better than average\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the press conference. Q: What exogenous risks could hurt the UK economy? Mark Carney say the Bank expects UK growth to fall below potential in the last three months of 2018, partly due to fluctuations in the data as Brexit looms. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent weight in, saying Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open economy makes it particularly susceptible to external jolts. The eurozone does look like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing slower than last year, Broadbent points out (growth halved to 0.2% in the last quarter). Back to Brexit.... Q: Is the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chequers deal closer to WTO terms, or closer to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very very close\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd relationship with the EU, in terms of your forecasts? Chequers is closer to the latter than to the WTO scenario, says Carney -- in other words, it would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current average forecast for the Brexit deal. But he cautions that nothing is agreed yet. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government policy, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a proposal, therefore there are certain things where Chequers is very clear and certain other things which are up for negotiation, he points out. Q: How confident are you in the financial sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preparations for Brexit? Carney says he is confident that UK banks have taken appropriate steps to prepare for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. But he indicates he is less confident with preparations by European banks, saying we need to move to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153actual legal certainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about how cross-border issues are handled after Brexit. This is a MASSIVE issue; there are literally trillions of euros of derivative contracts between banks in the City and the rest of the EU. A no-deal Brexit creates huge issues. Earlier this week, Brussels indicated that they would allow EU traders to use UK derivatives clearing services even if Britain crashes out of the EU without an exit deal. Those comments are welcome, Carney says, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not enough. Mark Carney gets a break from the barrage of Brexit bouncers, with a googly about central bank independence. Q: The US Federal Reserve is under pressure from Donald Trump not to tighten policy, while the European Central Bank has also been criticised by politicians over its stimulus plans. Does this concern you, and why is central bank independence important? The governor jokes that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in favour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of central bank independence, before explaining (at some length) that it underpins credibility. Households, businesses and the financial markets can have more confidence that the Bank of England will control inflation and protect financial stability, if it is both independent and accountable. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s particularly valuable at times when economies are at risk of sudden shocks. Q: Your report shows that wages are going up, but the savings ratio is going down, so are households spending every extra penny they get? Carney says that households have concerns about the general economic situation, but much less concern about their personal financial situation. There is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clearly a range\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of possible Brexit outcomes, Carney continues with an expressive hand wave, particularly about the final end-state relationship. Q: Are you worried that the Bank could become a rule-taker if Britain and the EU agree a financial services deal based on equivalence (as was reported by The Times this morning). Carney declines to comment, but does point out that the government has downplayed that report. Q: Some pro-Brexit economists say a no-deal Brexit is nothing to fear - so why should people listen to the Bank of England instead? Carney reminds the press conference that the BoE correctly predicted the pound would slump if Leave won the 2016 referendum, and the knock-on impact on inflation and incomes. He adde that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts are underpinned by its network of agents across the country, and its panels with businesses. They mean the Bank can see the current impact of Brexit, and how a disorderly exit will hit supply and demand. [I think this is a reference to Economists For Free Trade, who have some very optimistic forecasts for the post-Brexit world] Q: You say a no-deal Brexit isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t likely, but is it more likely than at our previous press conference three months ago? Tough to say, says Carney. But the looming deadline is concentrating minds, and causing companies to defer investment plans. Q: You say a no-deal Brexit would deliver \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an immediate and material hit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the economy -- what will that mean in practice? At a minimum, there will be logistical challenges getting goods through ports, and a knock-on impact on some firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to run at full capacity, says Carney, Q: What will that mean for ordinary people? It depends on the ability of individual firms to prepare for it, the governor replies cagily, particularly those which currently have seamless access to the EU. Q: The government has said this week that austerity is over, but won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t austerity be back if there is a disorderly exit from the EU? Fiscal decisions are a matter for politicians; we set monetary policy around them, Carney says - declining to stray from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchis lane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Regarding the budget.... there has been a shift in the sand towards a more accommodative fiscal stance (because Philip Hammond boosted spending and cut taxes on Monday), but the Bank is still digesting the consequences. On possible future interest rate rises, Mark Carney says he does expect a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rebound\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the economy if a Brexit deal is agreed. We are currently at the point of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maximum uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over Brexit now, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s understandable that businesses are being very cautious, and holding their spending back. Q: Are you saying that you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rule out raising interest rates, even if a no-deal Brexit pushes the UK into recession? Carney says a no-deal, no transition Brexit is unlikely, but the Bank has to be ready. Second, it all depends what happens to supply, demand, and the exchange rate, he reiterates. Thirdly, there would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153potentially fairly large\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hit to supply, more rapid than one is accustomed to in an advanced economy. So the MPC would have to balance the impact on the exchange rate, and any tariffs, against its desire to provide what support it can to the economy. There are scenarios where policy would need to be tightened in the event of a no-deal, no-transition, disorderly Brexit, but that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t what we expect to happen, Carney concludes. In other words, the Bank could be forced to raise interest rates if the pound slumped, pushing up import costs, and tariffs were slapped on imported goods too. Carney is explaining that the Bank must decide how to balance inflationary pressures against any future supply shock. Whatever happens after Brexit, we will set monetary policy to ensure price stability and support the economy during the transition, Mark Carney pledges. Three factors will be crucial when deciding future interest rate moves, he explains: Demand: Withdrawal from the EU will effect demand for UK goods. The impact will be more negative if Brexit is disruptive Supply: There will be a drag on supply as the process of adjusting to Brexit unfolds. If this process is gradual, the impact will be limited. But \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an abrupt and disorderly withdrawal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could lead to severe disruption at the UK border The value of the pound: It could rise if the financial markets have an optimistic view of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future prospects, but a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disruptive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit could push the pound down. A weaker pound would push up inflation. Carney adds that there is little that monetary policy can do to help with large, negative supply shocks. On Brexit, governor Carney says that UK companies are now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153understandably postponing investment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd until they have more clarity about the future. UK households are more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sanguine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, though. Bank of England governor Mark Carney begins his press conference, by explaining that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is facing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153series of transitions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They are: Global financial conditions are tightening, and trade growth is slowing UK fiscal policy is moving to a more accommodative stance The UK economy is adjusting to a new, and currently uncertain, relationship with the European Union Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the Bank of England decision: The Bank of England press conference is underway. You can watch it here. There aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any big shocks in the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new forecasts, but it has trimmed its growth and inflation outlook for 2019: You can see the latest quarterly inflation report online, here. The Bank are helpfully tweeting some charts from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarterly inflation report. Importantly, the Bank of England is signalling that interest rates could fall OR rise after Brexit, depending on how events turn out. It says: The economic outlook will depend significantly on the nature of EU withdrawal, in particular the form of new trading arrangements, the smoothness of the transition to them and the responses of households, businesses and financial markets. The implications for the appropriate path of monetary policy will depend on the balance of the effects on demand, supply and the exchange rate. The MPC judges that the monetary policy response to Brexit, whatever form it takes, will not be automatic and could be in either direction. The Bank has published a handy explanation for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision, and flagged up that interest rates will probably rise \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bit more\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over the next few years. Over the past few years, our economy has needed interest rates to stay very low as we recovered from the global financial crisis. But things have been changing. Our economy now needs a little less support because it is growing a little faster than it has capacity to and inflation is above our 2% target. To ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the target, we need to keep the economy growing at around its speed limit. That is why we raised the official interest rate from 0.5% to 0.75% in August. After raising interest rates in August, this month we have left them unchanged. If the economy performs as we expect, we think we will need to raise interest rates a bit more over the next few years. We expect any rises in interest rates to happen at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. Interest rates are likely to remain substantially lower than a decade ago. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a topline view of the economy: The Bank of England is hopeful that UK business investment will pick up -- if Britain secures a smooth transition deal as it exits the European Union. The Bank says: Business investment has been more subdued than previously anticipated, as the effect of Brexit uncertainty has intensified. Under the smooth transition assumption on which the forecast is conditioned, greater clarity is expected to emerge over the coming months, boosting investment growth. The Bank is also concerned that trade disputes could escalate, hurting the global economy. It says: The global economy continues to grow at above potential rates, supporting UK net trade. Growth has softened, however, and become more uneven across countries, and downside risks have risen. Global financial conditions have tightened, particularly in emerging market economies, and activity has slowed in the euro area. Trade restrictions have increased and there is a risk of further escalation. The Bank of England has also warned that uncertainty over Brexit is weighing on the economy. The minutes of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting say: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The recent intensification of Brexit uncertainty appeared likely to keep business spending subdued in the near term. Breaking: The Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rates unchanged, at 0.75%. More to follow! October was a brutal month for the markets, despite yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Halloween rally. November has got off to a better start, though, with Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main indices all up: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly time for the Bank of England to announce its decision on interest rates, and release its latest quarterly inflation report. That report will show the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new growth and inflation forecast, so should guide us as to the next rate rise (assuming it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come today!). Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool suggests rates shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise next year. He writes: I have plotted annual GDP growth in the UK (%) together with the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1-quarter ahead and 1-year ahead forecasts (most likely outcomes based on market expectations of interest rates). Since 2006, the Bank has over-predicted next quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth by an average of 0.35% per annum and next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth by an average of 0.94% (!) per annum. Since the EU referendum vote, the Bank has improved its forecasting record but still over-predicts next quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth by an average of 0.15% per annum and next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP by an average of 0.31% per annum. So history is telling us that we will the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP growth rate forecast for 2019 needs to be trimmed by a sizeable 0.31% to infer the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153correct\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd GDP growth rate. This is a good reason to put any planned interest rate hikes for 2019 on hold\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The slowdown in UK manufacturing is another example of how a cheap currency isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough, on its own, to spur exports. But Sacha Chorley, portfolio manager at Quilter Investors, argues that sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness since the 2016 EU referendum vote may be cushioning some blows. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Manufacturing has been crushed by concerns over Brexit, with so many uncertainties surrounding imports and exports leading to a steady decline in manufacturing growth, which is headed back toward the levels seen immediately after the referendum. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is particularly notable that this is happening amid a climate of a depreciated pound. Normally this would be expected to stimulate export orders, so it is possible the figures may have been weaker without the exchange rate on the pound falling. The sub-50 employment score is also notably weak, indicating firms are trying to keep a lid on hiring. This will be linked to new order expectations and cost cutting. Newsflash: The Appledore shipyard in Devon is to close, in another blow to British manufacturing. Babcock, the engineering and defence firm, has decided to shut Appledore after new orders dried up, ending a 163-year history. In a statement, it says: Babcock International has today announced it has taken the difficult decision to exit operations at its Appledore facility in Devon, ending its site lease in March 2019. Babcock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus is now firmly on its workforce and its determination to protect their employment within the business. To that end, the company will offer relocation opportunities for all 199 Appledore employees at other Babcock facilities, 140 of whom are already on short-term redeployment to its Devonport operations. Babcock very much regrets having to take this course of action and recognises the impact it will have on its dedicated and professional workforce. The company will now engage in a consultation period, working closely with its employees and their Trade Unions representatives during this difficult time. The Appledore Yard was founded in 1855, and is situated on the estuary of the River Torridge in North Devon. It has produced, or helped produce, survey vessels for the Royal Navy, patrol vessels for the Irish Naval Service, ferries, dredgers and commercial vessels, plus two tall ships for the Tall Ships Youth Trust. Unions had fought to preserve the shipyard. Yesterday they handed the Minister of Defence a petition with 10,000 signatures, urging it to save Appledore. Reaction to the slowdown at British factories last month is flooding in. Justin Benson, head of automotive at KPMG UK, says manufacturing is misfiring. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the UK manufacturing PMI for October dropping by 2.5 points, it suggests that business confidence is on a downward trend. Combine that with Brexit, trade negotiations between the US and China, German elections and Italian debt, the picture it paints is one of increased geopolitical uncertainty. Shannon Murphy, assistant head of risk underwriting at Euler Hermes, says UK factories will remain under the cosh until they have some certainty on Brexit: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our clients are reporting that their customers are cutting contracts for new orders from six months to three. The focus is narrowing from long-term plans as businesses try to manage uncertainty. Until firms have more clarity about what a future relationship with the EU looks like, investment levels are likely to continue to flatline and confidence will remain low. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good time to review credit management procedures.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Economist Samuel Tombs of Pantheon fears the UK economy is weakening: Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, is more confident - pointing out that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing PMI report does show (modest) growth last month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The drop in the PMI reading is disappointing but let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not lose sight of the fact it has remained above 50 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the indicator of growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for 27 consecutive months. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our recent sector survey suggested that once we have clarity about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trading relationship with the EU we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll likely see further growth, with many manufacturers expecting this to deliver a shot of confidence to the sector. But the changes in Europe aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only headwind facing exporters, with some automotive firms citing slow growth in emerging markets like China as a driver behind recent operational changes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153More positively firms across automotive, aerospace and rail sectors are continuing to honour long-term investment plans, despite uncertainty. Economics professor Prem Sikka says the government must do more: City economists had expected UK factory growth to dip a little last month, but today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report is much gloomier than feared. As well as trade wars and Brexit, car manufacturers have been struggling to meet new tougher emissions tests, leading to lower production and a testing backlog. Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says the slump in the UK manufacturing PMI (to just 51.1, from 53.6) is a real worry. He says Brexit has hurt confidence, and is deterring some firms from hiring new staff. Brock explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Alarm bells were ringing in the sector this month as the Index slipped closer to edge of the no-change mark with purchasing falling for the first time in over two years. Overall activity was marred by a drop in export orders and continuing weak domestic demand as Brexit took another bite out of client confidence. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To see inflows of new orders first decline since the middle of 2016 following the referendum, will send shivers down the spine of business. Any hope that the current situation would not continue to impact has surely now evaporated. Employment was also affected with lower levels of hiring, as companies tried to control their costs. Job seekers will find the hiring landscape less friendly during the run-up to departure. Capital Economics also fear that UK factories are heading towards stagnation: Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers suffered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a worrying turnaround\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the worst last month. He fears that the sector could actually shrink over the next few months. At current levels, the survey indicates that factory output could contract in the fourth quarter, dropping by 0.2%. New orders and employment both fell for the first time since the Brexit vote as domestic and overseas demand were hit by a combination of Brexit uncertainties, rising global trade tensions and especially weak demand for autos. Markit found that some firms have been protecting cash flow and cost-cutting, rather than restocking their inventories. Business confidence weakened in October too, Dobson adds, amid \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rising Brexit-related uncertainties and escalating global trade tensions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd UK factories were hit by a drop in foreign demand in October, for the second time in the past three months. Markit says: Some companies reported that Brexit uncertainties had negatively impacted inflows of new work from within the EU. Others focussed more attention on rising global trade tensions and weaker demand from the world autos sector. NEWSFLASH: UK manufacturing growth slumped last month, as factories were hit by a drop in orders. Data firm Markit reports that conditions in the UK manufacturing sector slowed sharply during October. It blames the trade wars trigged by Donald Trump, and the uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union. In a new healthcheck, Markit says: Output growth weakened, while new order inflows and employment both declined for the first time since July 2016 (the PMI survey directly following the EU referendum). The drop in new business was partly driven by rising global trade tensions and Brexit uncertainties. This dragged the UK manufacturing PMI (a broad measure of activity) down to just 51.1 in October, a 27-month low, from 53.6. Any reading over 50 shows growth. New orders and employment levels both declined for first time in 27 months, it adds. More to follow! Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing data might dampen the mood at the Bank of England -- house prices growth has slipped to a five-year low. Prices were flat month-on-month in October, which dragged annual house price inflation down to just 1.6%. A former Bank of England policymaker, Andrew Sentance, argues that the BoE should stop prevaricating, and raise interest rates today (spoiler alert: it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t (probably)...) He writes: On the productivity front, low interest rates may be contributing to the problem rather than providing the solution. Only when interest rates return to more normal levels will businesses have the right incentives to raise productivity and efficiency. A further quarter-point rise in interest rates on Thursday is therefore unlikely to dent growth prospects in the UK economy. Indeed, in the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201d where interest rates have been raised from around zero to around 2% since 2015 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d economic growth has been very strong and resilient. The MPC and the Treasury need to adjust to low economic growth in the UK. It appears to be the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153New Normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and the sooner we recognise that the better. Sterling is jumping sharply today, following reports the UK and the EU are close to an agreement on a crucial part of Brexit. The Times newspaper has got the City excited, by reporting that Theresa May has struck a deal with Brussels that would give UK financial services companies continued access to European markets after Brexit. A government source told the newspaper that British and European negotiators have reached a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tentative agreement on all aspects of a future partnership on services, as well as the exchange of data\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The breakthrough is apparently based on the idea of regulatory equivalence -- in broad terms, the EU and UK agreeing that both sides\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rules are equally strict. That would allow City firms to keep operating in Europe, even after they lose their current \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpassporting\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights. But there are disadvantages -- equivalence isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as concrete as passporting, and one side could be forced by the other side to implement new rules to avoid breaching equivalence (the FT has a good explanation here). Still, the news has cheered currency traders -- sending the pound soaring by nearly one and a half cents to $1.29. Mohammed Kazmi, portfolio manager at private bank UBP, believes the Bank of England could hint at a 2019 interest rate hike today: The Monetary Policy Committee meeting is once again coming at a time of great uncertainty for the BoE with the Brexit deal still hanging in the balance. A lack of clarity herein, coupled with rising external risks following the tightening of financial conditions globally, should keep the bank firmly in a wait-and-see mode. Recent wage growth strength should provide Carney with enough confidence to continue to commit to a rate hike next year, especially with this hike not fully priced until end-2019 now. The pound has been an underperformer recently amongst the majors given the political backdrop and rating agency comments; however, the BoE is unlikely to change this course, with concrete progress on a transition deal required for a turn instead, especially given the stronger dollar backdrop. Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Robert Wood concurs that rate will stay on hold today, telling clients (via Reuters): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Until a deal is done - or not - we suspect the BoE is in suspended animation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit uncertainty makes if effectively impossible for the Bank of England to raise borrowing costs at noon today, economists reckon. As CNBC puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for Brexit uncertainty the Bank of England would probably be thinking about putting interest rates up this week,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, told CNBC via email, adding that interest rates look \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unnecessarily low. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The Bank of England is centre-stage today, as it meets to set UK interest rates and update us on its view of the UK economy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a year since the BoE raised borrowing costs for the first time in a decade (from 0.25% to 0.5%), which was followed by a second small increase in August (to 0.75%). The City doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a hike today, but we could get some firm hints about when borrowing costs return to the giddy heights of 1% or more. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarterly inflation report will also show if the Monetary Policy is more optimistic about UK growth prospects. With wage growth running at a nine-year high of 3.1%, and growth holding up despite Brexit uncertainty, the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers may be getting twitchy. Does Britain really need such low borrowing costs, and weak savings rates, a decade after the financial crisis? Last month, chief economist Andy Haldane claimed that things are looking up: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think there is more compelling evidence of a new dawn breaking for pay growth, albeit with the light filtering through only slowly,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Of course, the Bank can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really consider raising interest rate until Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is resolved. Yesterday, Brexit secretary Dominic Raab suggested a deal would be done within three weeks, only to execute a dizzying and ungainly u-turn a few hours later... But still, Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments could lift or sink sterling. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, says: Traders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attention will turn to the Bank of England monetary policy decision today which is expected to keep interest rates on hold. While Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech and the Quarterly Inflation Report may move the Pound slightly, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still all about the Brexit deal that will decide the fate of the currency. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll discover if the Brexit fog is chilling the economy this morning, when data firm Markit publishes its latest survey of factory firms. The manufacturing PMI is expected to fall to 53 from 53.8, which would show slowing growth.

                "bodyText":"With the words of Donald Trump, we are closing for the week. Thank you for following business live today. JJ US president Donald Trump wasted little time in hailing the jobs report, encouraging Americans to back his party in the upcoming midterm elections. Stock prices traded in New York opened mostly higher on Friday after employment data showed a healthy addition of jobs in the US economy and the strongest wage growth in almost a decade. Apple falls as US markets open Dow Jones Industrial average gains 140 points, or 0.5%, at the open. However, Apple shares fall by about 6% in early trading. December rate hike plus three more in 2019, says ING Unemployment in the US was last lower in 1969, said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING. Payrolls growth has accelerated from an average of 182,000 per month in 2017 to 213,000 per month in 2018. The economy is booming and the bigger struggle for companies is actually finding labour to fill their vacancies. More reaction from economists to the data, with thoughts turning to the next rate-setting meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate-setting body. Josie Dent, an economist, Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive jobs data increase the likelihood that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will raise interest rates in the coming months from their current rate of between 2% and 2.25%. The central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boss, Jerome Powell, has been relatively hawkish in his rhetoric recently, paving the way to higher rates over the course of 2019. However, market volatility will give the FOMC pause, she added. Despite the strong jobs market data, higher than expected Q3 GDP growth and bullish narrative from Powell, FOMC members will be cautious going into the meeting next week due to the considerable stock market corrections seen over the past month. The pace of wage growth is good news for the US president, Donald Trump, writes the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dominic Rushe in New York. In September wages were 3.1% higher than they were a year ago \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first time since April 2009 that wage growth has topped 3%. Despite the record-breaking streak of jobs growth, wage rises have remained stubbornly since the end of the recession. Americans go to the polls on 6 November, with both houses of Congress in play. Hurricane effects? The bumper 250,000 gain followed a more modest 118,000 increase in September, but Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, cautions that hurricane disruption in September may be affecting the data. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that we could be in for another 200,000 plus number in November, as the remainder of those disruptions is reversed. While the headline US unemployment figure did not tick lower, there is a clear downward trend across demographic groups \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a factor in the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking. The key question for investors is whether wage growth will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster. Kully Samra, vice president at Charles Schwab, said: October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data shows the labour market is tightening even further. Significant wage growth since last month, combined with high consumer confidence, underpins our belief that the US will see solid economic growth into next year. However, despite a growing economy, there are signs that volatility is returning. Companies, especially tech giants, are reporting mixed earnings and the market still expects ongoing trade wars to hit stocks further. The chance of a rate rise in December has slipped slightly, but concerns remain that too many interest rate hikes too soon could impact domestic growth as the cost of borrowing increases. Inflation pressure building? Wage growth came in at 3.1%, the first time it has topped 3% since 2009. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the US economy added 250,000 jobs in October, far above consensus estimates of 190,000. The unemployment rate remained steady at 3.7%. US non-farm payrolls are due shortly, at 12:30 GMT The US jobs gauge will be closely watched by economists and investors for signs of lower unemployment, which could spur the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at a quicker pace. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 poll of forecasters shows that economists believe the US economy added 190,000 jobs in October. The unemployment rate is expected to stay steady at 3.7%, although some economists believe it could fall to 3.6%. Cold water on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trump bounce? US president Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s optimism on a trade deal with China at the end of the month may be overdone, according to CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Washington correspondent, Eamon Javers. Remember, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Republican party has mid-term elections imminent. European markets remain well into positive territory, however. Two people stabbed at Sony Music\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s London HQ Two people are believed to have been stabbed in an incident at Sony Music\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s London headquarters, with armed police on the scene. The incident at the High Street Kensington offices is ongoing. More details here. FTSE 100 hits three-week high London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip index hit its highest point since 10 October this morning, having gained just shy of 1%. Approaching midday in London, Standard Chartered is leading the FTSE 100 risers, with shares up by 4.7%. No danger of Italy leaving the EU says Juncker Amid the risk-on mood on European markets, it is worth remembering that significant political uncertainty is hanging over the EU in the form of the dispute between Italy and the European Commission. Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker today told Austrian radio station ORF that there is no danger of Italy leaving the euro. Manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) data from the Eurozone earlier showed the Italian sector contracted during October, amid a broader economic slowdown. Claus Vistesen, chief Eurozone economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, described the PMI data as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grim\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd reading. The alarming decline in in the Italian index is the stand-out detail to the downside, raising further downside risks for the economy amid an already stalling economy in Q3. An outright GDP contraction is now well within the realms of possibility in coming quarters. Apple concerns after earnings report While stock markets on the whole are still enjoying positive momentum from the Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s optimism on trade with China, Apple is the unlikely outlier giving investors pause ahead of the open of US indices. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch have downgraded their rating of the stock from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153neutral\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153buy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, after Apple reported lower shipments of iPhones than expected. The firm will also stop disclosing unit shipments in future, a warning sign for analysts. Jordan Chalfin, a technology analyst at US research house Creditsights, said the move will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153make it harder to analyse operating trends, and we are disappointed with the reduced transparency.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Apple shares fell by as much as 7% in after-hours trading, setting it up for a steep fall when the Nasdaq stock exchange opens in New York. The last note to be launched was the plastic tenner featuring Jane Austen, the author. She was chosen after a public campaign to nominate a woman. In money news of a different variety, the Bank of England today launched its campaign to nominate the new face of its \u00c2\u00a350 note. Governor Mark Carney wants a scientist (and a dead one at that) to grace the new notes, which will be the latest to get a plastic makeover. Computing pioneer Ada Lovelace is one possible contender, alongside Stephen Hawking and Nobel prize-winning chemist Dorothy Hodgkin, write the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Patrick Collinson and Ian Sample. Midway through the morning, European indices are holding on to most of their early gains. Crossrail chief executive to leave Simon Wright, the chief executive of Crossrail, will be replaced by the head of the London Underground following the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a3350m bailout of the struggling project. The giant Crossrail project, officially known as the Elizabeth line, has been plagued by delays, meaning it will miss its scheduled opening in December by almost a year. Wright has only been in the role since March, after Andrew Wolstenholme stepped down. Crossrail initially said Wright would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153see out the remaining phase of our work through to the handover of completed assets to Transport for London\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Transport for London and Crossrail have announced that Mark Wild will become chief executive, starting on Monday 19 November. Wild is currently managing director of London Underground. He will return to the role once the Elizabeth line has opened through the central London stretch. The construction PMI reading remains \u00e2\u20ac\u0153above the magic 50 mark\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c indicating a continued expansion in output \u00e2\u20ac\u201c says Max Jones, global corporates relationship director for infrastructure and construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. The October reading was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fairly modest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153neither racing ahead nor stuck in the doldrums\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The commercial segment appears to be being sustained by urban-focused developers responding to the still-buoyant growth of many regional cities, while the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insatiable appetite for online shopping is driving the construction of distribution space in and around key transport hubs. However, the possibility of Brexit disruption still looms, and the big construction firms who make up the survey (and the majority of UK building work) are also going to have to adapt to the end of the private finance initiative, after chancellor Philip Hammond announced its end at the budget on Monday. The current output figures look fairly solid for the construction industry \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least in comparison to the last two years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the second-strongest expansion in the last 16 months. Civil engineering \u00e2\u20ac\u201c big infrastructure projects like roads and railways \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was the biggest driver of the output increase, after weakness earlier in the year, IHS Markit said. But the forward-looking indicators \u00e2\u20ac\u0153paint a less rosy picture for the sector\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said Trevor Balchin, the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics director. New contracts increased at only a modest pace, and firms were the least optimistic regarding the 12-month outlook for nearly six years. Construction companies again linked uncertainty to Brexit negotiations, which influenced delays to final decisions at clients. Breaking: UK construction output rises but outlook weak The construction purchasing managers index (PMI), which is closely followed by economists, rose from a six-month low in September to a reading of 53.2 points for October, according to data firm IHS Markit. However, the index measuring business expectations fell to its weakest since December 2012. Sterling is on course for its second best week of the year so far in the wake of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest interest rate decision. The pound had its best day of 2018 so far on Thursday thanks to a combination of positive reports on Brexit talks and a relatively sanguine Bank of England. Against the US dollar sterling edged up by around 0.2% this morning, hitting its highest since 23 October at $1.3037. Against the euro sterling was flat. The new optimism on Brexit followed a Times report that a deal on financial services trade between the UK and the EU had been agreed, although the reports were swiftly downplayed by the government. Some City economists think the Bank of England, meanwhile, is laying the groundwork for further rate hikes next year, provided there is a smooth Brexit transition. MUFG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Derek Halpenny, European head of global markets research, and Fritz Louw, currency analyst, wrote: Given [signs of wage growth] and resilient household confidence and momentum, the BoE maintained that gradual rate hikes were appropriate but that they could quicken the pace of hikes in the event of an orderly Brexit. Bank deputy governor Ben Broadbent, Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number two, did not reveal much further about the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans in an interview on the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme this morning. He reiterated the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s line that faster wage growth is coming, while saying that the European outlook may be less negative than recent weak GDP data might suggest. US president Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Twitter feed has set the tone for early trading. He said his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153long and very good conversation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with Chinese president Xi Jinping last night had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a heavy emphasis on Trade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with a capital T. Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, said Trump wants to reach a trade agreement with China at the G20 meeting in Argentina, scheduled for the end of November. He has asked officials to start drafting possible terms, the report said. Markets across Europe appear to have welcomed the news, with synchronised index rises. The Stoxx Europe 600, which tracks the biggest firms (including London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100), rose by 1%. However, the economists are doing their job and playing Cassandra. Paul Donovan, global chief economist at UBS Wealth Management, said: Before breaking out the beautiful chocolate cake, it is worth remembering that China would also have to agree, and has the capacity to hold out against current sanctions. The US has also been sending somewhat mixed messages, with the US Department of Justice accusing a Chinese state-owned firm of stealing semiconductor trade secrets. Trump has told rallies he wants the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153right\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd deal with China. As Sue Trinh, head of Asia FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets, wrote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It all comes down to your definition of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcright\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Note his comments came as the US Justice Department is stepping up actions against China in cases of suspected economic espionage and as trade dove [Larry] Kudlow cautioned that Trump would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153aggressively\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pursue his agenda against China. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth taking a look at just how much Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchanges gained overnight. A thawing in the relationship between the US and China could give investors a reason to get back into Asian equities after a punishing year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Hang Seng is still down by 11% in the year to date. Tai Hui, chief market strategist for Asia Pacific at JP Morgan Asset Management, said: While we are still cautious over a full resolution of recent tensions in the medium term, resumption of dialogue between Washington and Beijing would be good enough to investors for now. Combined with the prospects of more economic stimulus from China and reasonable valuations in Asian equities, investors could use this opportunity to reload on emerging market and Asia assets. The US dollar is still edging higher but Asia has been more resilient on handling greenback strength than other emerging markets. The FTSE 100 has taken its cue from Asian trading at the open, bouncing by more than 1% in its first few minutes before retreating to a 0.8% gain. The positive sentiment is spreading across Europe, with Italian shares up by 1.2%. Investors in Sweden, Poland and even Russia are having a good time. The agenda: Donald Trump trade deal hint Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. US president Donald Trump has already fired up stock markets this morning after showing optimism on the trade relationship with China. Trump spoke to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, appearing to give hope of progress at the G20 meetings at the end of this month. Asian markets have risen across the board. The CSI 300 index, which tracks stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen, rose by 3.56%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong gained 3.79%. However, investors are not quite popping the champagne corks just yet. Robert Carnell, chief economist at ING, said: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not entirely sure what to make of this. But it feels too big a change of direction following the [vice president] Mike Pence speech some weeks ago to be taken literally. It certainly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in synch with the latest charge of a Chinese company for conspiring to steal trade secrets. Whether Trump has set the tone for the day will in large part depend on the outturn of US employment data, which is closely scrutinised by traders across the world for signs of inflationary pressure in the American economy. The non-farm payrolls will be published at 12:30pm, with average hourly earnings and the unemployment rate the key data. In the UK the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top officials are busy doing the media rounds to explain why they held back from raising interest rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and warned they could go both ways in the event of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit. Bank deputy governor Ben Broadbent today told the BBC that faster wage growth will help real household incomes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a welcome sign for Britons after one of the worst decades for wage growth in the last century. In Europe, meanwhile, investors will be eagerly awaiting the results of the European Banking Authority\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest stress tests of the banking sector, to be published at 5pm in London, where the watchdog is based (for now). Some 48 banks have been put under the microscope, with the regulator looking at how risky the assets held by the lenders are \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and how they would withstand a shock. Italian banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 results will be particularly scrutinised amid political uncertainty over the prospects for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances. The agenda \u00e2\u20ac\u00a29am GMT: Eurozone manufacturing report for October \u00e2\u20ac\u00a29:30am GMT: UK construction report for October \u00e2\u20ac\u00a212:30pm GMT: US employment data for October \u00e2\u20ac\u00a25pm GMT: European Banking Authority stress tests",

                "bodyText":"European stock markets never threatened to get anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blood pressure soaring today. So after a subdued day, the FTSE 100 has closed 9 points higher at 7,103, a gain of 0.14%. The German DAX finished 24 points lower, a loss of 0.2%, at 11,494, while the French CAC closed almost exactly where it started. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB shed 0.5%, as Rome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clash with the EU over its budget worried traders. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. GW Over in Brussels, eurozone finance minister are urging Italy to compromise in the row over its 2019 budget. My colleague Jennifer Rankin reports: Several eurozone finance ministers have come out to back Brussels in a row with Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s populist government over a budget that has been deemed to break the rules of the common currency bloc. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, warned that the future of the euro was at stake as he urged the Italian government to reach an agreement with the European commission. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The wise path is the path of dialogue, exchange of views, to find the best solution for the eurozone as a whole, for the Italian government and for our common currency,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said on Monday as he arrived at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For what is at stake now is our common currency.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Economist Rupert Seggins has pulled together a neat Twitter thread on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK data: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics on the strong US service sector growth: October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading was above the consensus forecast of 59.3. The modest decline was driven mainly by the business activity index, which fell from 65.2 to 62.5, and the employment index which dropped from 62.4 to 59.7. That said, the latter remains at a strong level by past standards and goes some way to explaining the 250,000 surge in non-farm payrolls last month. Encouragingly, the new orders index held up relatively well. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector has posted another month of strong growth. The monthly US Services PMI report, from the US Institute of Supply Management, came in at 60.3, indicating output rose sharply again. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 61.6, but still much better than the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector (which only managed a PMI of 52.2). Energy company Chevron (+3.65%) is leading the Dow risers in New York, followed strong results last Friday. IBM are next in line, up 3.1%. Earlier today the tech firm reported that CEO Ginni Rometty recently bought $3m worth of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock; a sign of confidence in its prospects? The US market has made a mixed start to trading. While the Dow gained 75 points (0.3%) at the open, the Nasdaq dippped by 0.3%, as Apple shed 2%. Global markets are on edge today as investors brace for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Midterm US elections. With Donald Trump and Barack Obama both in full-on campaign mode, turnout is likely to be high. Pollsters are pretty confident that the Democrats will take back control of the House of Representatives, while the Republicans will hold onto the Senate. But politics has a habit of springing surprises.... What might it all mean for the markets? Well, a Democrat-controlled House could start fresh investigations into Trump, and block further tax cuts and the unpicking of Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legacy. Mark Appleton, global head of multi-asset strategy at Ashburton Investments, thinks this could weaken the dollar, and the US stock market (something Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s critics would see as a small price to pay!). Appleton says: Should the Democrats make significant gains in the House of Representatives, there is a high possibility recent US dollar strength will abate. Democrats are not proponents of President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low-tax regime and would likely frustrate plans for further cuts and deregulation, which have been recent drivers of the strong economy and currency. While a weaker US dollar would provide much needed relief for emerging markets, US equities may encounter some headwinds. Some economists, of course, think this is the wrong moment to be giving the US economy a sugar rush anyway. A quick recap. Growth across Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector companies has hit a seven-month low. Firms say new orders are drying up, as Brexit uncertainty hits confidence. In another blow, UK car sales declined in October too. Diesel sales slumped again. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector also stumbled in October, with growth hitting its weakest in over two years. Economists fear that the trade war with America is now biting. Eurozone investors are getting gloomier too. Confidence has fallen in November, for the third month in a row. A runaway train has forced mining giant BHP Billiton to suspend rail operation in Western Australia. Any readers have a bad day at work can take comfort - at least you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lost control of a massive train full of iron ore. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what happened to one poor driver employed by mining giant BHP Billiton in Western Australia. All was well, until the driver apparently got out of the train to check one of its 268 wagons. Next moment, the train was chugging along again, without human supervision.... After 92 kilometres, the train was deliberately derailed. BHP has now suspended rail operations in the region while it works out what went wrong.... UK insurance group Hiscox have fallen to the bottom of the FTSE 250 this morning, following its latest financial results. Hiscox disappointed investors by predicting that growth will slow in the next few months, following a challenging year dominated by US hurricanes, typhoons in Japan, and higher UK subsidence claims following the dry summer. Hiscox also revealed that it has spent $15m setting up a new European subsidiary, so it is prepared for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. It says: Our preparations for Brexit are well advanced.... Our plans have always assumed a worst-case scenario \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and we are prepared, irrespective of the outcome of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiations. Hiscox shares dropped by 6.9% this morning, to \u00c2\u00a315.32. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the slowdown at Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector companies last month: European stock markets have shrugged off this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s procession of bad news. The main indices remain flattish, while Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market is stuck in the red as the budget standoff between Rome and Brussels fizzles on. Overnight, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy prime minister insisted Rome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending plans will become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a recipe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for reviving European growth, in a sign that Italy won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back down. David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, says investor sentiment has been shaken by those heavy losses in Asia overnight, and the slowdown in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. The Caixin survey of Chinese service sector slipped to 50.8 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its lowest reading in one year. This adds weight to the argument that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is cooling. Overnight, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Xi Jinping talked about boosting global trade, and warned about the downside of protectionist policies, but the update failed to boost investor sentiment. The standoff between Italy and Brussels continues. The anti-establishment coalition in Rome are showing no signs of backing down regarding their plans to raise the budget deficit, and this is playing on investors mind\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too. In another blow, eurozone investor confidence has fallen to a two-year low. Sentix, the German research group, reports that its eurozone investor morale index has dropped to just 8.8, from 11.4 in October. This is the third monthly decline in a row, and the lowest reading since November 2016. Manfred Huebner, managing director of Sentix, blames a range of factors. They include the US-China trade war, and the slowdown in car production as manufacturers scramble to meet new emissions tests. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The reasons for this development are manifold. There are external factors such as the U.S. president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade policies as well as European issues. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The discussion about the future of the car industry in Germany, the weakness of the banking sector and the budget issue in Italy come to mind.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economist Sam Tombs of Pantheon on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI report: Britain isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only economy which found October tough. Factories around the globe reported a slowdown in activity last month: Economists predict that the eurozone service-sector PMI (due tomorrow) will confirm that European firms struggled in October. The drop in UK service sector growth last month is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thoroughly disappointing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says economist Howard Archer of EY Item Club. The slowdown in new business growth (to a 27-month low) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bodes ill\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for future growth, Archer says, adding: Brexit uncertainties and concerns over the UK and global economies weighed on demand for business services. Additionally, demand for consumer services was reported to be subdued, which ties in with other signs that consumers reined in their spending at the start of the fourth quarter after splashing out over the summer Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at foreign exchange firm WorldFirst, says Brexit delays and wider fears over the global economic outlook are hurting UK service sector firms. He fears the situation will get worse, until the UK and EU reach an agreement. In another blow, business confidence across the services sector is its lowest since July 2016, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI report shows. Firms are growing increasingly anxious about the risk of Brexit-related disruptions (predictions of long queues and delays at the ports if Britain leaves the EU without a deal) Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, blames the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcambiguity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and lack of clarity around Brexit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A reluctance to commit was the message coming through loud and clear from service providers in October as the sector checked in with its worst performance since March and lowest optimism since July 2016. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many of the respondents attributed this poor performance and the biggest softening in new order growth since July 2016 to continuing ambiguity around the Brexit negotiations. There were also concerns over the weakness in the UK and global economies which affected client confidence and consumer spending. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says UK services companies are suffering badly from Brexit uncertainty. UK manufacturing growth hit a 25-month low in October (we learned last week), indicating the UK is only expanding sluggishly. Williamson explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The disappointing service sector numbers bring mounting evidence that Brexit worries are taking an increasing toll on the economy. Combined with the manufacturing and construction surveys, the October services PMI points to the economy growing at a quarterly rate of just 0.2%, setting the scene for GDP growth to weaken sharply in the fourth quarter. Brexit isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only problem, though... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trade wars, heightened geopolitical uncertainty and tightening financial market conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are also weighing on the UK economy, Williamson adds. NEWSFLASH: Growth across Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector has slowed to a seven-month low. Service sector companies have reported that new business growth weakened in October, as nervous clients have cut back, according to data firm Markit. Consumer-facing sectors such as hotels, restaurants and leisure reported the weakest performance. A number of companies also cited Brexit-related uncertainties, and worries that the global economic outlook is deteriorating. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Services PMI, which measures activity in the sector, fell to 52.2 in October from 53.9 in September -- the lowest reading since March. More to follow! Newsflash: British car sales have fallen again. Just 153,599 vehicles were registered in October, down 2.9% compared with a year earlier, according to figures released today by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). That follows a 20% plunge in October. The SMMT says sales were hit by new, tougher, pollution rules introduced in Europe this summer. This has led to shortages of some models, as testing centres are fighting their way through a backlog of vehicles needing certification. Drivers continue to shun diesel, with sales down 21.3% year-on-year. Petrol sales rose 7%, while alternatively fuelled cars (electric) jumped by 30.7%. The big picture, though, is that UK car sales are 7% lower this year than in 2017. The pound has hit a two-week high against the US dollar, as the Brexit talks approach a climax. Britain is hoping to make progress on the thorny issue of the Northern Ireland Backstop this week, so that an emergency summit could be called before the end of November. Yesterday the Sunday Times claimed that PM Theresa May has a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153secret plan\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to keep the whole of Britain in a customs union, avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland. But EU sources have told the Guardian that the two sides are still divided on crucial issues, meaning there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a \u00e2\u20ac\u015350-50\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd chance of an agreement. Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson is also weighing in, calling May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposals \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an absolute stinker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He predicts MPs would vote them down, rather than agree to abide by EU rules during a post-Brexit transition period. City traders seem slightly more optimistic, though, sending the pound up by 0.25% to $1.30 against the US dollar, and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.142 against the euro. European stock markets have started the new week in a subdued mood. The FTSE 100, German DAX and French CAC are all basically unchanged this morning. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX has risen by 0.35%, but Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB has dipped a little. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: Further evidence that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is starting to wilt under the trade war pressure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest private sector-assessing Caixin PMI dropped to a 28 month low following a services sector slump \u00e2\u20ac\u201c led to a pretty muted open in Europe this Monday. Over in Shanghai, President Xi has vowed that America cannot sink China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. The Chinese president told a major trade fair that the days of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153winner takes all\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trade policy is at an end - a non-too-subtle jab at Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach to negotiations. Xi also pledged to keep opening up his country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, painting himself as a defender of globalisation. My colleague Lily Kuo reports: Xi Jinping has promised to lower import tariffs and improve access to the Chinese market in remarks meant to portray his country as a champion of globalisation as it remains locked in a trade war with the US. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Protectionism and unilateralism is rising. Multilateralism and the free trade system are under threat \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 China will not close its door to the world and will only become more and more open\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the Chinese president said on Monday at the beginning of a trade fair in Shanghai. The speech, ahead of a meeting between Xi and US president Donald Trump at the end of the month on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in Argentina, signalled little improvement in trade ties before that meeting. Xi claimed China had entered a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new round of high-level opening up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but did not make any concrete concessions likely to satisfy the White House. The Chinese leader reiterated a pledge to enforce intellectual property rights, as well as open up the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s educational, cultural and telecommunications sectors, something officials have been promising for years, with little action taken. Anxiety over the US-China trade war ripped though Asian stock markets again today. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CSI 300 index fell by 0.8%, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei shed 1.5%, and Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng has slumped by 2.3% in late trading. Traders are concerned by the slowdown in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, and the lack of progress between Beijing and Washington over the trade war. Over the weekend, president Trump told reporters that the two sides are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153getting much closer to doing something.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A breakthrough could come at this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G20 meeting, but nothing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guaranteed. The tumble in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services PMI suggests that the escalating trade war with the US is taking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a massive bite out of the economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Stephen Innes of foreign exchange firm OANDA. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more reaction: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy are swirling today, as growth in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector stumbles. New figures from data provider Caixin shows that growth across China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services companies fell to a 13-month low last month, as new orders dried up. Service companies reported that new business had stagnated for the first time in almost a decade, with many saying that demand was weak this quarter. This dragged the Caixin China General Services Business Activity Index (which measures growth) down to just 50.8 in October, sharply down from 53.1 in September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest reading since September 2017, and worryingly close to stagnation. Chinese manufacturers also had a sticky October, with costs jumping sharply thanks to the tariffs imposed on US imports. Caixin says: The slowdown was broad-based by sector, with both services and manufacturing noting weaker performances compared to the previous month. Notably, manufacturing production stagnated, following increases in each of the preceding 27 months. This dragged Caixin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wider measure of Chinese private sector growth down to a 28-month low of 50.5, from 52.1 in September. Here are the key points from the report: Services activity growth weakens to 13-month low, while manufacturing production is broadly unchanged Total new orders edge closer to stagnation Increase in service sector staff numbers largely offsets fall in manufacturing employment Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong, director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, warned that Chinese companies are losing confidence, in the face of the trade war triggered by Donald Trump. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Caixin China Composite Output Index dipped to 50.5 in October from the previous month, reaching its lowest level since June 2016, indicating mounting downward pressure on China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. The subindex for new orders fell, pointing to softening overall demand conditions. The employment subindex edged up despite staying in negative territory, which could possibly be due to government efforts to stabilize the labor market. The subindex for input costs remained unchanged from the month before, while the one for output charges inched up, indicating easing pressure on company profit margins \u00e2\u20ac\u201d though upward price pressure remained. The subindex for future output edged down, reflecting weakening confidence among companies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Later today we discover if Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector did any better.

That dominance had meant the Republican presidents such as Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon had lacked a majority on Capitol Hill.</p> <p>But surprisingly, this situation hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been bad for asset prices. Quite the reverse. Shares often rise during times of political deadlock -- after all, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reassuring certainty if politicians can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get anything done. </p> <p><strong>Hussein Sayed, </strong>Chief Market Strategist at <strong>FXTM</strong>, has crunched the numbers, and explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The combination of a Republican President and a split Congress have produced an average return of 15.7% on the S&amp;P 500 in the 12 months following every mid-term election since 1950. These strong returns suggest that investors prefer a gridlock, a situation when different political parties control the two legislative houses. While such anomalies are difficult to explain, investors may find that a gridlock produces more predictable political outcomes to model and value equities against. In the case of a gridlock, Democrats cannot roll back recent tax cuts, neither they can tighten the Dodd-Frank banking rules. It may just mean that Trump will face more difficulties in passing new laws. </p> <p>However, in the current tense environment it seems Wall Street will prefer Republicans to retain both legislative houses. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s simply because a new tax cut will be expected to take place, further deregulation, and probably additional fiscal stimulus. While such measures are not necessarily good for the longer run as deficit and debt may get out of control, many investors will take advantage of these policies in the shorter run.

                "bodyText":"European stock markets have closed lower tonight, as investors await news from the US elections. FTSE 100: down 63 points or -0.9% at 7,040 German DAX: down 10 points or -0.1% at 11,484 French CAC: down 26 points or 0.5% at 5,075 The Footsie was held back by the stronger pound, which makes overseas earnings of multinationals less valuable. In New York, the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are both up almost 0.5% though. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says the midterm results will swing the markets tomorrow: Surprisingly London traders have been more cautious than their US peers who are awaiting the results of the midterm elections due later tonight. The vote will decide on whether the two US legislative houses remain Republican, like the President, or turn Democrat. The first results for the key swing states are expected around 10pm Eastern time and will colour the trading day Wednesday. For all of President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threats to his foreign trading partners his domestic economic decisions have injected the US stock markets with some vigour, particularly the massive tax cutting programme. A change in the texture of Congress would hamper his capacity to push through decisions that require legislative approval, causing concerns for businesses. However, some dark clouds are already gathering on the economic horizon, as seen by the massive selloff in stocks and bonds in October. Goodnight! GW You can keep up to date with all the US midterm election action in our liveblog: Over in New York, the US stock market has opened cautiously as midterm voting gets underway. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 50 points, or 0.2%,. The S&amp;P 500 has gained 0.3%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq index has gained almsot 1%. Despite Brexit secretary Raab\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheeriness, the British cabinet still haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually agreed the terms of the Irish backstop. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman told lobby reporters that an agreement won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be reached \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at any cost\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The key issue is how long the backstop would last (Brexiteers say it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be indefinite), and who could end it (Brexiteers want the power to end it). The spokesman said (via our Politics Live blog): [The PM] said that while 95% of the withdrawal agreement had been concluded, on the Northern Ireland backstop there are a number of issues that we still need to work through and these are the most difficult. This includes ensuring that, if the backstop is ever needed, it is not permanent and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mechanism to ensure that the UK could not be held in the arrangement indefinitely. The pound has also nudged a five-month high against the euro, trading as high as \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1465. Bloomberg is impressed by the power of Dominic Raab\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thumb to move markets: The responsiveness of the pound to headlines may be well documented, but its sensitivity reached new highs Tuesday as it rallied on a mere hand gesture. Investors had been waiting for news on progress in the Brexit divorce talks with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May gathering her Cabinet Tuesday morning. When BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg tweeted that the Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab had said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thumbs up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the way out of the meeting, it was enough to send the U.K. currency to the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it wonderful to be working in a market where a simple thumbs-up moves a currency by 40 pips?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jordan Rochester, an analyst at Nomura International Plc. The pound has jumped to a two-week high as Brexit speculation swirls. Somewhat astonishingly, the rally came after the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Laura Kuenssberg tweeted that Brexit secretary Dominic Raab had given reporters a verbal \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthumbs-up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 following a crunch cabinet meeting. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no more detail about exactly what Raab meant -- whether he means progress on the Irish backstop, or simply that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still optimistic. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough to send sterling up to $1.3090, up half a cent against the US dollar, at its best position since 22 October. The pound had earlier lost ground after DUP chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson predicted that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we are heading for no deal.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This rapid rebound suggests the City is extremely anxious for signs that London and Brussels could reach an agreement to avoid the UK crashing out of the EU at the end of March. Rachel Winter, senior investment manager at stockbrokers Killik &amp; Co,isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced that a Democratic-controlled House would force peace in the trade wars. She writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The President uses the stock market as a barometer of his own success and is clearly keen to keep it at a high level. His plans for further expansionary fiscal policy, for example additional tax cuts and more infrastructure spending, would also have positive consequences for the stock market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is concern that a Democrat majority in the House would cause governmental gridlock, making it difficult to pass further legislative changes. Further tariffs on China might be difficult to implement, which would potentially be good for emerging markets. That said, Democrats have long been critical of the trade imbalance between the US and China, and many leading Democrats applauded Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The New York stock exchange is expected to drop when trading begins in under two hours, as America heads to the polling booths. The futures market is calling the Dow Jones industrial average down around 50 points, or 0.2%. Yesterday it gained 190 points, so that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a major reversal. Cautious traders will be sticking to the sidelines until we have some idea of how the midterm elections have played out. Given recent political shocks, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be treating opinion polls warily. As my colleague Tom McCarthy explains, many scenarios are possible: Election night could end with the Republicans retaining their majority in the House of Representatives and strengthening their majority in the Senate, despite a historic exodus of Republicans retiring from Congress, widespread disapproval of Trump and the customary strength of the opposition party at this stage in the elections cycle. Yet some prominent Democrats \u00e2\u20ac\u201c starting with the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are predicting a blue \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wave\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that will deliver a strong Democratic majority to the House. (Predictions of the Senate flipping blue are notably fewer.) It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth remembering that Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interests don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always run parallel to Main Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Indeed, the two thoroughfares can diverge widely when it comes to the state of America, and the global economy. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for The Market isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always good for The People. As analysts at FX Pro put it: Wall Street has its own interest. Financial institutions fear that a full control by the Democrats over both houses (the House of Representatives and the Senate) could lead to the restoration of the Dodd-Frank Act, which restricts the activities of banks and the abolition of recent tax cuts. Dodd-Frank imposed new rules on the banking sector to avoid a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, ending the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcToo Big To Fail\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scandal. It was partly repealed earlier this year, despite warnings that this would increase financial risks. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reforms dramatically slashed the corporation tax rate from 35% to 21%, alongside temporary tax cuts for individuals. That helped to drive stock prices up (as firms became more profitable), but has also pushed America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit higher. US wages are now rising faster, finally clearing the 3%/year mark for the first time in almost a decade. But while the economy is still growing robustly, business investment actually declined in the last quarter, suggesting the tax windfall isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being pumped into new equipment, machinery and infrastructure. European stock markets are falling deeper into the red as lunchtime approaches. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is now down 43 points, or 0.6%, at 7060. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX and the French CAC are both off around 0.2%. Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx blames midterm jitters, as investors wonder whether the Democrats will claim a majority in the House of Representatives: A tentative start turned resolutely negative as Tuesday went on, investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 midterm election nerves perhaps becoming more pronounced as voting gets underway. Brexit worries are also weighing on traders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds, as Theresa May struggles to reach an agreement over the Northern Ireland backstop that will satisfy Brussels and her own cabinet. A senior member of the DUP (who are supporting May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government) has predicted that Britain would leave the EU without a deal. Many Americans have already made their choice of senator, congressman or woman, or governor, of course. Early voting has been particularly brisk, suggesting the overall turnout at these midterms could be sizzling high as both sides push hard to get the vote out. The polls are open, meaning early-rising Americans on the east coast can cast their ballots. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be hours until we get any exit polls, though. Most polling stations stay open until at least 7pm local time (so midnight onwards for UK readers). Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade disputes are being blamed for a slowdown across eurozone companies last month. Data firm Markit has reported that private sector growth in the euro area slowed to a two-year low in October. Manufacturing and service sector companies both reported weaker growth, with some blaming \u00e2\u20ac\u0153global protectionist measures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd such as Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on EU steel. Germany is particularly exposed to trade wars, thanks to its strong export sector. Its private sector growth slumped to a 5-month low and the joint lowest in over two years, The widerIHS Markit Eurozone PMI Composite Output Index dropped to 53.1 in October, down from 54.1 in September, showing a notable slowdown. Analyst Emanuele Canegrati of BPPrime says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bad start to the final quarter of 2018: Investors are also speculating whether the midterms could intensify the legal pressure on the White House. For the last 18 months, special counsel Robert Mueller has been investigating whether there was collusion between Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential campaign and the Russian government to affect the 2016 election, and whether obstruction of justice has taken place There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been little news from Mueller recently, but analysts believe the probe could burst back into the headlines after the elections. Many US newspapers have reported that Trump advisor Roger Stone is in Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cross-hairs. In August, Stone himself suggested he might soon be indicted. As The Hill reported last weekend: Robert Mueller continues to zero in on Roger Stone as speculation builds that the special counsel could take a major overt step in his Russia investigation following the midterm elections next week. Stone, a longtime adviser to President Trump who briefly worked on his campaign, is viewed as central to the question of what, if anything, members of the Trump campaign knew in advance about Democratic emails hacked by Russian operatives and then released by WikiLeaks. Stephen Innes of foreign exchange trading firm OANDA says investors should keep a close eye on the Mueller probe: The markets are understandably fidgety given the next 48 hours of headline risk.... However, flying under the radar is that these midterm elections carry a sizable legal risk for the GOP which could dent investor confidence as we will likely hear much more from Robert Mueller sooner rather than later. Asia-Pacific stock market have closed higher tonight, apart from China which lost ground. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AFP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Asian markets mostly rose Tuesday as focus turned to the US midterm elections, which could impact Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency, while Apple suppliers suffered on reports the tech titan had cancelled plans to ramp up output of its new iPhone. All eyes are on the US mid-term elections today, says currency expert Kit Juckes at French bank Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale. He writes: Opinion polls point to policy gridlock with a GOP Senate and DEM House, limiting the scope for further fiscal stimulus as the support from current measures fades. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the corner-stone of what feels like a consensual view that growth will slow, and rate speak (near 3%) in late 2019, supporting the dollar now, but pointing to a turn in its trend in the second half of 2019. Juckes says there are two scenarios which would really rock the markets [reminder, the Republicans currently hold the upper and lower houses of Congress] DEM Senate and DEM House: This would be the most dollar bearish scenario, trigger fears of a lame duck presidency and potential impeachment proceedings. While the Fed would continue the tightening path, political confrontation in Washington would weigh on the dollar. GOP Senate and GOP House (least likely): An all-Republican Congress is the scenario would elicit the strongest market reaction, with the dollar rallying on expectations of further fiscal stimulus. As Donald Trump never tires of pointing out, the US stock market has surged by around 40% since his shock election win two years ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largely due to the tax cuts which the president pushed through last year, which boosted company profits. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s catnip to Wall Street (other Trump policies, such as his anti-immigration rhetoric, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t move the markets) That fiscal stimulus is also inflationary, meaning the US Federal Reserve is under pressure to keep raising US interest rates. So, a strong night for the Democrats could spark a dollar selloff, explains Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group: Dollar bulls are looking for a Republican win, which will supportive of more of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expansionary fiscal policies being pushed through. A Democrat win, and the resultant political deadlock is considered more bearish for the US dollar and US equities although we expect this to be a short-term reaction. The unexpected result of a blue wave with Democrats taking both the Senate and the House would likely shock the markets resulting in an aggressive selloff in the greenback and US equities. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that the stock market also had a good run under president Obama: Subdued trading this morning has seen London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main stock index, the FTSE 100, dip into the red It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accompanied by most other European markets, as traders ponder whether today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US elections will embolden or restrict president Trump. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our guide to the midterms: The midterm elections have been a bruising experience for many presidents over the years. Losing the House of Representatives in 2010 was a major blow for Barack Obama, for example, making it rather harder for him to push his agenda. Bill Clinton had a similarly bad night in 1994, as the Democrats lost control of the House for the first time in 40 years. That dominance had meant the Republican presidents such as Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon had lacked a majority on Capitol Hill. But surprisingly, this situation hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been bad for asset prices. Quite the reverse. Shares often rise during times of political deadlock -- after all, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reassuring certainty if politicians can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get anything done. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, has crunched the numbers, and explains: The combination of a Republican President and a split Congress have produced an average return of 15.7% on the S&amp;P 500 in the 12 months following every mid-term election since 1950. These strong returns suggest that investors prefer a gridlock, a situation when different political parties control the two legislative houses. While such anomalies are difficult to explain, investors may find that a gridlock produces more predictable political outcomes to model and value equities against. In the case of a gridlock, Democrats cannot roll back recent tax cuts, neither they can tighten the Dodd-Frank banking rules. It may just mean that Trump will face more difficulties in passing new laws. However, in the current tense environment it seems Wall Street will prefer Republicans to retain both legislative houses. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s simply because a new tax cut will be expected to take place, further deregulation, and probably additional fiscal stimulus. While such measures are not necessarily good for the longer run as deficit and debt may get out of control, many investors will take advantage of these policies in the shorter run. Given that the polling industry got it wrong in 2016 and Trump became President, history may repeat itself this time again. It would be more surprising if Democrats managed to win both houses. This will be a nightmare for Wall Street, as the Trump impeachment threat will become more real, but still, this would require help from some Republicans. Even if he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get impeached, the President will no longer have the power to pass bills and probably lead to pulling back some of his deregulatory actions, which definitely is not liked by corporate America. The Chinese stock market lost ground today, as traders worried that the midterms won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blunt Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war instincts. The CSI 300 closed 0.6% lower today, back towards the four-year lows hit last month. Other markets were in better mood, though, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei ending 1% higher and Hong Kong up 0.6%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a buzz of election fever in the markets, as Americans prepare to head to the polls in the midterm elections. As usual, the midterms are partly a referendum on the White House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance, potentially strengthening or loosening a president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grip on the levers of power. Investors around the globe are watching nervously to see whether the Democrats can seize control of the lower House of Representatives. Polls suggest they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a good chance. Republicans, though, will probably maintain their grip on the Senate. A good night for the Democrats could allow them to block Trump from further tax cuts and other fiscal stimulus. They could also try to restrict his ability to launch destabilising trade wars with other nations (although the president has plenty of unilateral powers here too). That could weaken the dollar (as it removes some pressure to raise interest rates), bringing relief to emerging market currencies. A Democrat-controlled House could (and surely would) also launch fresh investigations into the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conduct, casting the shadow of impeachment over the White House. That could send stocks sliding on Wall Street. But if the Republican vote holds up, Trump would be re-energised to continue pushing his America First strategy - creating more volatility in the markets, and possibly intensifying the trade dispute with China. So currencies, stocks and bonds around the world will be affected by where millions of Americans put their cross today. Tom Fitzgerald, co-manager of the Amity International Fund at EdenTree Investment Management explains: So far, Republican control of the legislative powers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the House of Representatives and the Senate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has made possible President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s large fiscal package and his deregulation agenda, as well as protected him from various ongoing investigations. An election outcome favourable to the Republicans, maintaining both the House and Senate, could set the global economy and markets on a very different path at a time when both Europe and China are showing signs of weakness. In such a scenario, President Trump would have broader policy options, including on the fiscal front and the ability to carry on with his deregulation agenda. The market could perceive this scenario as the most pro-growth, as it would raise the chances of larger tax cuts and additional spending. In contrast, in a scenario of favourable election results to the Democrats, giving them control of the House and Senate, President Trump would have very limited policy options for the rest of the legislature. As further fiscal easing may not be possible, President Trump might focus policy efforts on the trade war against China or implement trade threats against the EU. Europe would therefore be negatively affected by such shocks, given the large impact of car tariffs on Germany and Europe. Also coming up today New surveys of purchasing managers at service sector companies across the eurozone are released. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expected to confirm that growth slowed in October, matching the slowdown at UK services firms that was reported yesterday. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better news from Germany this morning; factory orders rose by 0.3% in September, stronger than expected.

Of course, the broader macro-economic outlook and US growth story is more important, but we must remember that the US boom is largely a function of Trumponomics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c anything that curtails this will be at least mildly risk-off.</li> <li><strong>A split Congress will, in all likelihood, not stop Trump from doubling down on tariffs with China. </strong>This could result in us getting all the anti-growth measures of Trump without more of the pro-growth reforms.</li> <li><strong>Market impact may be relatively muted,</strong> although with a slight risk-off tone initially due to uncertainty about what it will mean vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis economic policy, tax cuts and deregulation. A lot would depend on how the Trade War progresses and how tax cuts 2.0 do in the face of a split Congress and use of executive orders.</li> <li><strong>Likely bearish for the US dollar</strong> and so far seen some slight hints that this is playing out but for now the market reaction is not terrifically strong.</li> <li><strong>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be harder for Trump to pass more tax cuts</strong>, and it may be that reform of Dodd-Frank will die.

                "bodyText":"European stock markets have closed solidly higher tonight, as a wave of relief sweeps through trading floors. In London, the FTSE 100 has closed 76 points higher at 7117, up 1.1%. The German Dax gained 0.8%, the French CAC rose by 1.1%, and the Spanish IBEX jumped by over 2%. Gridlock, it seems, is good for stocks today. As David Madden of CMC Markets puts it: Historically, equity markets have performed well out of a divided Congress as traders feel the government finds it difficult to get new laws passed, and therefore not much changes. The US economy had positive momentum going into the midterms, and that is likely to continue. The rise in popularity of the Democrats could be construed as a vote against Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tough trade stance, and perhaps the White House might soften its position regarding China. There is speculation the Democrats are keen to improve infrastructure, and we are seeing a rally in Caterpillar. Mr Trump has set his sights on tech giants like Amazon, and the outcome of the midterms might make it more difficult for him to go after tech titans. The Dow is still 1.1% higher, the S&amp;P 500 is 1,3% higher, while the Nasdaq is now 2.2% up. Donald Trump is due to discuss the election results shortly, at a Washington DC press conference. My US colleague will cover it here: Goodnight! GW Wall Street is pushing higher, after the Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Senate leader suggested the next Congress could take a bipartisan approach. If that happened (and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big if, given the last two years) it could help to get tax reform and infrastructure legislation passed. Reuters has the details: U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday infrastructure and healthcare would be on the U.S. Senate agenda in 2019, after Republicans widened their majority in the Senate but lost control of the House of Representatives in Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elections. Speaking to reporters, McConnell said senators would likely tackle Obamacare fixes and prescription drug prices, but that changes to Medicare and Social Security were unlikely. Additionally, any new tax legislation would need bipartisan support, he said. This is neat: The US dollar is still under pressure, maintaining its earlier losses against the British pound, the euro, the Japanese yen, and other major currencies. The dollar index is currently down 0.5% today, close to the two-week low hit earlier. This is a clear reaction to the Democratic wins in the House of Representatives last night. Investors are concluding that Donald Trump won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to get another big tax cuts package through Congress, meaning less inflation and consequently less pressure to raise US interest rates in 2019 and 2020. Jameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy &amp; market research at FXTM, says: One of the more interesting trends to have monitored in the aftermath of the mid-term results is the acceleration in near-term Dollar weakness. This suggests that investors are descaling away from heavy US dollar buying positions and have potentially been put off holding onto their positions because of the consensus that the Liberal Democrats taking control of the House provides a potential roadblock to President Trump introducing further fiscal stimulus. Duncan Weldon, of UK investment firm Resolution Group, suggests that the midterm election results could trigger a heightened trade war with China: The Wall Street rally shows investors are relieved that the Democrats have control of the House of Representatives, and can block Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda. Candice Bangsund, vice president and portfolio manager at Fiera Capital says investors would welcome a bit of gridlock, after two wild years in Washington: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As widely expected, the US midterm elections have enabled the Democrats to take control of the House of Representatives, while the Republicans retained control of the Senate. This gridlock scenario has ramped-up the challenge for policymakers in seeking to pass major legislation. That said, investor sentiment should be positive in general as a split Congress suggests that Democrats will be unable to roll back tax cuts or reinstate financial regulations, while the status quo for both the economy and the markets should ultimately prevail. As such, global equities are mainly higher this morning as the passage of last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s events has likely removed an element of uncertainty from the marketplace. The Wall Street opening bell is ring-a-dinging.....and shares are rising. The Dow Jones industrial average, the broader S&amp;P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq index have all posted solid gains, as traders react to the midterm elections. My US colleagues have launched a new liveblog covering all the reaction to the midterms.... including this typically presidential threat from Donald Trump: The US stock market is expected to rally when trading begins in around 70 minutes time. The Dow is being called up around 215 points, or 0.8%, as investors take the midterm results in their strides. Geoffrey Yu of UBS Wealth Management says investors may move money into riskier assets, now the US election is over. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153US stock futures edged up this morning, signalling the market sees Republicans as having marginally outperformed. For once, the polls were pretty much on track, but the pundits have been careful to manage expectations after 2016\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s miscalculations, which on balance is probably a healthy development. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153From an economic standpoint, the more gridlock can be avoided the better. We will be interested to see whether certain sectors can benefit from this outcome, such as infrastructure. Investors around the globe are relieved that the Republicans lost their grip on the lower House of Representatives, says Jake Robbins, fund manager at Premier Global Alpha Growth Fund. A divided government has some positives for markets in that the more extreme policies of the Trump presidency will certainly see some push back which financial markets are clearly seeing as a positive. The great fear was a surprise hold by the Republicans in congress which would have allowed Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s combative foreign and trade policies that have so unnerved markets to escalate further. Financial markets are breathing a sigh of relief that this is not the case. Those sectors hit hardest by tariffs such as basic materials, semis and industrials should see some respite, particularly given their underlying growth prospects have remained pretty good and after the selloff these sectors look attractively valued. Political gridlock also means there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little chance that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original tax reforms are reversed. Democrats on the Hill might want to repeal those tax cuts, but the Republican-controlled Senate surely won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow it. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another reason that shares are rallying today [the cuts to corporate tax boost company profits]. Mickey Levy and Roiana Reid of Berenberg explain: Financial markets are expected to take comfort with the split power in Congress: it was widely expected and will be perceived to allow for additional checks and balances on President Trump. The decent election results for Republicans in the Senate should lessen perceptions of a shift to the hard-left in the 2020 elections and ease concerns about a roll-back of pro-business policies. They also believe we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see a lot more political rancour in Congress, but rather less meaningful legislation: We expect even more Congressional dysfunction \u00e2\u20ac\u2018 if that is possible \u00e2\u20ac\u2018 to lead to more convolutions in the already dysfunctional budget process and more threats of government shutdowns. Just in: The MSCI All-Country World Share Index, which tracks global stocks, has hit its highest level since 22 October. Paras Anand of Fidelity International has an optimistic take - Donald Trump could work with the Democrat-controlled House to push through a new infrastructure-spending package. He writes: During the 2016 Clinton election campaign, infrastructure spend was high on the Democrat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy agenda (as it was for Trump). It is possible that with a bi-partisan focus on the pent-up need for domestic infrastructure investment, the Democrat view on the budget deficit may change from opposition (to tax cuts) to accommodation (spending on roads, hospitals, airports). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any development in this direction would further spur the overall economy, continue to push wages in an already tight labour market, and potentially challenge the current expectations around the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activity for next year. Most political events have an underwhelming economic impact - could the US midterms prove the exception?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The outcome of the US midterms has been met with relief by financial markets. says Silvia Dall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Angelo, Senior Economist at Hermes Investment Management. However, it may not last long.. Equities and bonds rallied, while the US dollar weakened. Following the correction in equities markets in October, the lift of the uncertainty surrounding the US mid-term elections paves the way for a solid performance of financial markets into year-end. But that could change in 2019 as fundamentals look less supportive and prospects are more uncertain. She also reckons Donald Trump will face a tougher task getting reelected in 2020, as a Democrat-controlled House may launch new probes into the president: The most significant consequences of the US mid-term elections concern the domestic political landscape. Indeed, a divided Congress means President Trump will have a hard time to get his domestic policies approved; in particular, his promised new round of tax cuts will probably never see the light. In addition, Democrats controlling the House will probably use subpoena powers to widen investigation into issues such as Russian interferences in the 2016 elections. All this will make for a challenging environment for President Trump to operate in, lowering his chances of winning a second term in 2020. In the run-up to this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elections, Donald Trump floated the idea of a new tax cut for America. The idea looked highly speculative at the time, and has now been washed away by the Blue Wave of votes for Democratic candidates. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, says the tax cut simply won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for US fiscal stability, and means Treasury bonds are rallying today (a tax cut would widen the deficit, meaning more government borrowing). If Donald Trump doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t play ball with Congress, America could find itself facing another government shutdown. So warns Andrew Hunter, US economist at Capital Economics. He told clients this morning the risk of a shutdown has risen. Trump has issued plenty of threats to shutter the government in order to extract funding for his border wall or to rein in non-defence spending, and the risks are surely higher now that he can blame the Democrats. The first flashpoint could come in early December, Hunter explains, when the current government funding bill is due to expire. The big clash could arrive in early 2019, if Congress can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree to raise the debt ceiling. Hunter says: The big risk would be a failure to raise the federal debt ceiling when the current suspension expires next spring, which would raise the possibility of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153technical\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd default. Mike Dolan of Reuters has created a neat chart, showing how asset prices have moved since America went to the polling booths yesterday. As you can see, global stock markets (in yellow) are higher, as are European shares (green) and most emerging market currencies (in orange). The dollar (blue) and US bond yields (red) are both down since Tuesday morning. This chart shows how the US dollar is the clear loser in the financial markets today, dropping against all major rivals: The US dollar is extending its earlier losses, and now down 0.6% against other major currencies as a new 12-day low. Bloomberg says: With Democrats winning the House of Representatives majority and Republicans clinching control of the Senate, President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s party loses full control of Congress. The results dim chances for any major fiscal initiative from the administration that might have triggered yield gains and hence a stronger greenback. Mining giants are driving the London stock market higher, with Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton both up almost 3%. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re benefitting from the weaker dollar, explains Russ Mould, investment director at stockbrokers AJ Bell: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A decline in the dollar following the US midterm elections has given a welcome boost to the mining sector as it will be cheaper for many foreign companies to buy dollar-denominated commodities. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also some optimism that Donald Trump might show us the Art of the Deal, and reach a trade agreement with China soon. Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at wealth manager Quilter Cheviot, argues that the White House will want to boast about another win soon: Tariffs implemented in September are due to rise from 10% to 25% on the 1 January 2019, and the President has also raised the possibility of putting tariffs on the remaining $250bn of Chinese imports that he has so far left untouched. It may be that Trump adopts a softer stance in an attempt to get a deal on trade, thus allowing him to proclaim that he has \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsolved\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the China trade issue ahead of his 2020 re-election campaign. You can keep track of all the midterm election results here: Here are five lessons for investors from the midterm elections, from Neil Wilson of Markets.com: Gridlock tends to be good for the stock market, but in this case, it may not be as positive. To a degree the recent selloff in the stock market could be viewed as nervousness ahead of the mid-terms. Of course, the broader macro-economic outlook and US growth story is more important, but we must remember that the US boom is largely a function of Trumponomics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c anything that curtails this will be at least mildly risk-off. A split Congress will, in all likelihood, not stop Trump from doubling down on tariffs with China. This could result in us getting all the anti-growth measures of Trump without more of the pro-growth reforms. Market impact may be relatively muted, although with a slight risk-off tone initially due to uncertainty about what it will mean vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis economic policy, tax cuts and deregulation. A lot would depend on how the Trade War progresses and how tax cuts 2.0 do in the face of a split Congress and use of executive orders. Likely bearish for the US dollar and so far seen some slight hints that this is playing out but for now the market reaction is not terrifically strong. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be harder for Trump to pass more tax cuts, and it may be that reform of Dodd-Frank will die. Pharma stocks may well do well as a divided house probably makes reform of drug pricing off the agenda. Aaron Anderson, senior vice-president for research at wealth manager Fisher Investments, argues that the prospect of political gridlock is actually good for shares. Legislation was hardly flying through Congress before midterms. Now with Democrats controlling the House of Representatives, the GOP increasing its majority in the Senate and President Trump in the White House, it will be nearly impossible to pass anything remotely controversial. That will drive many people crazy, but markets love it. We should now have a long stretch where political risks go way down, which should be good for stocks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares are roaring ahead in early trading in Europe, as investors react to the midterm election results. In London the FTSE 100 has gained 80 points, or over 1%, to 7,119. The French CAC and German DAX are both also up around 1%. Some traders are concluding that gridlock on Capitol Hill could actually be good for America, if it stops Donald Trump driving up the US deficit. Simon French, chief economist at stockbrokers Panmure Gordon, argues that the midterm result is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as good as you could hope\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Having the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wings clipped by losing control of the House is helpful for avoiding the most obvious \u00e2\u20ac\u0153end of cycle policy mistakes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - which in our view is pumping more deficit spending and protectionism into the economy, forcing the Fed to tighten at a faster rate. With the US dollar weakening fast, the pound has gained half a cent to $1.314 - a three week high. The euro has been lifted to a two-week high, at $1.147. Bart Hordijk, market analyst at Monex Europe, says the prospect of Trump and Congress acting like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bickering inmates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the next two years is hurting the US dollar. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nevertheless, domestic political unrest may throw a spanner in the works for the dollar, as Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relations with the Democrats will be essential in the coming months to determine the course of politics. Potentially Trump, who was once a member of the Democratic Party, may manage to come together with the Democrats and agree on broad tax cuts for the middle class. This could be a boost for the economy and the dollar, assuming markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t start to fret about the increasing government deficit. Chances are higher that the Democrats will seize the opportunity to use their new control of certain commissions in the House to step up the investigations in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax dealings, relations with Russia and claims of hush money payments. The menacing club of government shutdowns will be the Democrats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to yield every time Trump goes too far out of line to their taste in the coming months. The dollar may, in the end, get the biggest whack from this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the global economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The US dollar is in retreat this morning after the Democrats won control of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s House of Representatives in a gripping night of election drama. The midterm elections saw a Blue Wave sweep through Congress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lower chamber, giving the Democratic party fresh power to control president Trump. Checks and balances are back -- although the Republicans did put up a better show in the Senate races, increasing their majority. My colleague David Smith reports from Washington: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We rebuked Trump and Trumpism at a critical moment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ilya Sheyman, executive director of the grassroots organisation MoveOn wrote in a celebratory email. Many Democrats will be tempted to see the glass as half empty, engaging in self-flagellation over narrow defeats for some of its rising stars and a worse-than-expected loss of ground in the Senate. But the truth is that in the face of gerrymandering, voter suppression and an economy that continues to stay in the strong shape that Barack Obama bequeathed, the party reclaimed the House majority for the first time in eight years. That is no small achievement. Opinion polls had predicted that the Democrats would have a good night, so these results shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shake the financial markets. But the US dollar is already coming under pressure, dropping by 0.4% against a basket of other major currencies to a two-week low this morning. Investors are calculating that there will now be gridlock on Capitol Hill; the House will be free to oppose Trump policies which Democrats don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree with. This could prevent the White House forcing tax cuts and new spending on infrastructure such as transport and water systems. So if Trump can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give the US economy another jolt of fiscal stimulus, the economy may slow...meaning US interest rates might not rise as fast as feared. James Knightley, economist at ING, says president Trump will be feeling blue this morning: While not a great outcome for President Trump, it could have been worse. He clearly had plans to press on with infrastructure spending and further tax reform in the second half of his presidential term and while the policies are not dead, they are likely going to be curtailed or heavily revised by a Democrat-controlled House. Bi-partisanship will be required for progress to be made and for President Trump to generate a strong platform to defend his Presidency in 2020. However, the US economy will face an increasing number of challenges over the next couple of years as support fades from the fiscal stimulus and weaker global growth (contributed to by President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade protectionism), a stronger dollar and higher interest rates provide increasing headwinds. A weaker economy and potentially falling asset prices and household wealth would compound the problems for President Trump. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be mopping up financial reaction through the day.

                "bodyText":"Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Richard Partington on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EC growth figures: The UK will sink to the bottom of the European economic growth league next year to join Italy as the slowest-growing economy in the EU, before falling further the year after to anchor the table alone, according to European commission forecasts. The EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy predictions are based on a soft Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning Britain is expected to lag behind all its EU peers even if Theresa May can reach a deal with Brussels before 29 March. The commission forecasts that consumer spending growth will remain weak, continuing a subpar performance since the EU referendum in June 2016. It said business investment would stay subdued, while external demand for UK goods will dwindle. The commission predicted the result would be GDP growth of 1.2% in 2019 and 2020. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today.... The latest US jobs data shows its labor market remains historically strong. Just 214,000 people filed new claims for unemployment benefit last week, not far from the lowest level ever. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped by 8,000 to just 1.62 million, the lowest level since July 28, 1973. With such strong data, the Republicans might have been expected to put up a stronger fight in defending the House of Representatives.... Economists at HSBC have bad news for Germany: they believe its economy probably shrank over the summer. The first estimate of German GDP in the third-quarter of 208 is released next Wednesday. HSBC believes it will show the economy contracted by 0.1%, down from a previous forecast of +0.4%. In a new report, they say: After thirteen consecutive quarters with positive quarterly growth rates, the German economy seems likely to have taken a breather in Q3 2018. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to the slump in exports in September, in the face of trade conflicts (as covered earlier this morning). HSBC explain how this could mean net trade dragged on growth: The headwinds from the slowdown in world trade might also have been weighing on German export activity, which could have affected GDP negatively on the expenditure side. At the same time, import growth remains quite strong, resulting in the trade surplus hitting its lowest level since March 2014 in July. New European car emission tests have also hurt vehicle production in recent months, a key area of the German economy. Set your alarm clocks for 7am GMT next Wednesday, when the German growth figures are released. Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has just weighed in on the EU-Italy budget row, backing Brussels. In a new report, the IMF predicts that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth will sink to just 0.9% in 2020 (worst than the UK). It also says Rome should focus on cutting its debts, rather than borrowing more to spur growth.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independent Office for Budget Responsibility is less gloomy about growth prospects. Last week the OBR forecast UK growth of 1.3% in 2018 (matching the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view). The fiscal watchdog then spies growth accelerating to 1.6% in 2019, dipping to 1.4% in 2020. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significantly better than the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prediction of just 1.2% growth each year. And the OBR has an advantage: It knew about Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgiveaway budget\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 when it produced its number. The EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts were inked in on 22 October, a week before the budget. So Britain might not be in as much peril as the EC believes. Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ed Conway has tweeted this point too: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth forecasts have also escalated the row between Brussels and Rome over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. The Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast that Italy will grow by only 1.2% in 2019 is below the 1.5% predicted by its new government. That means the EC believes Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit will hit 2.9%, not the 2.4% predicted by Rome (which Brussels has already rejected). Brussels insists that Italy submits a new budget by next Tuesday, which would mean dropping some of the spending plans which its coalition government promised in this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. EU commissioner Moscovici has told reporters in Brussels that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There cannot be a sort of negotiation on this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shown signs of backing down, arguing that the economy needs stimulating, and that a fiscal boost will pay for itself in higher growth. You can read the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Autumn economic forecasts online here. The UK section starts on page 140 (p152 of the pdf). The EC is keen to point out that its forecasts are based on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153purely technical assumption\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that the EU and UK maintain their current trading relationship after Brexit. In other words, Britain is expected to lag behind Europe in the event of a soft Brexit, rather than a hard Brexit that causes significant disrupion to trade. On that basis, the EU predicts that: Consumer spending growth will be weak in 2019, as real wage growth will be modest. Business investment growth will rebound in 2019, but remain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153relatively subdued following a prolonged period of heightened uncertainty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Net trade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contribution to growth will continue to dwindle, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153alongside slowing external demand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That adds up to growth of just 1.2% in both 2019 and 2020. But the EC also warns there are large, downside risks to these forecasts - if Brexit is less benign, growth will be slower, it fears. In ANOTHER gloomy warning, credit rating agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has predicted that global economic growth was likely to slow in the next two years. Reuters has the details: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect global growth to slow to under 3.0% in 2019 and 2020, from an estimated 3.3% in 2017-18\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the agency said in a new report. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also fears that the US-China trade war will intensify in 2019, hurting the wider global economy. It wasy: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In both countries, the overall direct macro impact on growth will be manageable. However, persistent and broadening tensions between the two largest economies globally are increasingly likely to have widespread negative implications by undermining investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The UK is expected to be the third slowest-growing EU member this year (at +1.3%), behind Italy (+1.1%) and Denmark (1.2%). Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EC forecasts show the UK sinking to joint last place with Italy in 2019, at +1.2%. In 2020, the UK is expected to underperform every EU member with growth of 1.2%, while Italy creeps up to 1.3%. These forecasts are inevitably speculative, as the Commission simply doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how Brexit will pan out. It also can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be sure what policies Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new populist government will follow. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a great outlook for either country.... The European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest assessment of the UK economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t terribly encouraging, as Britain prepares to leave the EU next year. The EC expects growth to remain weak, and unemployment to rise: UK GDP growth is currently subdued and expected to remain so over the forecast horizon. Private consumption growth is forecast to remain weak as real wages grow modestly and households look to maintain savings. Heightened uncertainty means that business investment growth is likely to remain constrained. The net trade contribution to growth is projected to decrease in-line with a moderation in external demand. Employment growth is expected to slow significantly, leading to a modest rise in unemployment. Inflation should ease as the impact of sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2016 depreciation unwinds. The Commission is optimistic that unemployment will keep falling over the next couple of years. The eurozone jobless rate is already at a 10-year low, dropping to 8.1% in September. The EC hopes it will fall to 7.5% in 2020 -- if so, it would still be much higher than in the UK (4%) and the US (3.7%). The EC predicts that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy faces a tough few years. UK growth is forecast at just 1.3% this year, and 1.2% in 2019 and 2020. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the joint lowest for any (current) EU country next year, alongside Italy. Germany, in contrast, is expected to grow by 1.7% this year, 1.8% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2020. The UK growth forecasts are based on the assumption that Britain and the EU maintain the current \u00e2\u20ac\u0153status quo\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in their trading relationship after Brexit. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not guaranteed, given the slow progress in agreeing a withdrawal agreement... Valdis Dombrovskis, Vice-President for the Euro and Social Dialogue, says Europe needs to take precautions before the next down: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All EU economies are set to grow this year and next, which will bring more jobs. However, uncertainty and risks, both external and internal, are on the rise and start to take a toll on the pace of economic activity. We need to stay vigilant and work harder to reinforce the resilience of our economies. At EU level, it means taking concrete decisions on further strengthening our Economic and Monetary Union. At national level, there is even a stronger case for building up fiscal buffers and reducing debt while making sure that the benefits of growth are also felt by the most vulnerable members of society.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The EC is hopeful that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153barring major shocks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Europe should be able to sustain above-potential economic growth, robust job creation and falling unemployment. However, this baseline scenario is subject to a growing number of interconnected downside risks, from a possible oil spike to the risk of an intensified trade war. Newsflash: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy will slow steadily over the next few years as trade wars, geopolitical tensions and higher oil price all bite. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest projections from the European Commission, just released. They show that growth in the euro area is forecast to ease from a 10-year high of 2.4% in 2017 to 2.1% in 2018. It is then seen dropping to 1.9% in 2019, and 1.7% in 2020. The wider European Union is expected to growth by 2.2% this year, slowing to 2.0% in 2019 and 1.9% in 2020. The Commission blames three factors, saying Rising global uncertainty, international trade tensions and higher oil prices will have a dampening effect on growth in Europe. More to follow! Germany isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only European country hitting a soft patch. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial output shrank by 0.1% in September, official data shows, the first drop since July 2016. Separately, French manufacturers have slashed their investment plans. They now expect to spend 1% less this year than in 2017, not 4% more. European stock markets have shrugged off Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s export slowdown. The Stoxx 600 index has risen by 0.6%, as shares benefit from the prospect of the Democrats keeping Donald Trump in check. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale says: There is very little going on, and yet there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot happening. US election uncertainty removed, equity markets hope they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found the ideal combination of slightly less fiscal easing and slightly less monetary tightening that a more restrained president Trump will have to deliver. An outbreak of glee has hit markets.... But in the longer run, US political deadlock will lead to slower growth from mid-2019 onward, Juckes adds. German factory chiefs will be hoping for a breakthrough in the US-China trade dispute soon, before the slump in exports deepens. And overnight, a top Chinese diplomat has suggest that presidents Trump and Xi could make progress at the G20 world leaders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 meeting in Argentina in three weeks time. Politburo member Yang Jiechi told U.S. national security adviser John Bolton that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China is committed to working with the U.S. to achieve a no-confrontational, conflictless, mutually respectful co-operation in which both sides win. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Both sides should seek an appropriate solution through equal and mutually beneficial negotiations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments were released by China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Foreign Ministry, suggesting Beijing is keen to get its message out. Carsten Brzeski of ING agrees that Germany exporters are suffering from slowing world trade. He also blames new car emissions tests; production has suffered as automakers scramble to meet these tough new rules. Brzeski fears next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s German GDP figures for July-September could be a stinker: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade data ends a disappointing week for German industry. Available monthly data suggests that the economy had its worst quarterly performance in 3Q since the beginning of 2015. The first GDP estimate will be released next week on Wednesday. The 0.8% drop in German exports in September is the biggest since February. The FT reckons it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could be another sign that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy is feeling the effects of a slowdown in global trade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Monthly data can be volatile, but German exports have looked underwhelming for several months now: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Germany has suffered a drop in exports as the trade tensions swirling around the globe hit Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. German exports shrank by 0.8% in September, statistics body Destatis reported this morning, dashing expectations of a 0.3% rise. Imports declined by 0.4% (against expectations of a 0.8% rise). This shrank Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus to around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac17.6bn, from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac18.2bn in August, on a seasonally adjusted basis. Alarmingly, exports were actually lower than in September 2017, even though the world economy has expanded over the last year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details, from Destatis: Exports, September 2018 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac109.1bn -0.8% on the previous month (calendar and seasonally adjusted) -1.2% on the same month a year earlier Imports, September 2018 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac90.7bn -0.4% on the previous month (calendar and seasonally adjusted) +5.3% on the same month a year earlier It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest sign that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has slowed sharply this year. Third-quarter GDP figures due next Wednesday may confirm that growth stalled over the summer. German exporting powerhouse seems to be suffering badly from America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protectionist stance on trade. The tariffs imposed on EU steel, and a swathe of Chinese products entering the US, are creating new frictions and dampening demand. Also coming up today Asian stock markets have rallied, as investors continue to welcome the US election results. Last night, the Dow jumped by 545 points (or 2.1%), the best day post-midterm rally since 1982, as Wall Street anticipated gridlock in Congress now the Democrats have control of the house. European markets are likely to gain ground at the open too, with the FTSE 100 called up 20 points: The European Commission issues its latest forecasts for the European economy this morning, and may confirm that growth is slowing. Investors will also be waiting to hear from the US Federal Reserve, when it sets monetary policy tonight. The Fed isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected to raise rates until December, but its views on the US economy may move the markets The agenda 10am GMT: European Commission 1.30pm GMT: US weekly jobless figures 7pm GMT: Federal Reserve interest rate decision",

The outturn was slightly lower than the 0.7 per cent monthly GDP forecast that we published last month for the same period and the error is partly because of back data revisions. <strong>Building on the official data, our monthly GDP Tracker suggests that the economy will expand by 0.4 in the final quarter of this year. </strong><strong> </strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li>The apparent strength in third quarter growth masks a loss in momentum in industrial production as well as services output in the latter part of the third quarter.

                "bodyText":"And finally.... a UK thinktank has predicted that UK growth will slow to 0.4% in the final three months of 2018 The National Institute of Economic and Social Research\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest GDP tracker predicts that the UK economy expanded by 0.4% in August-October, down from the 0.6% growth racked up in the third quarter. NIESR also believes the economy will run at a similar rate until the end of 2018, and cautions not to get carried away by the stronger growth this summer. It says: In our view, UK economic growth peaked in the third quarter of this year and will settle at a rate that is close to its post-crisis average in the final quarter. According to new ONS statistics published this morning, the UK economy expanded by 0.6 per cent in the third quarter (three months to September) after growing by 0.4 per cent in the second quarter (three months to June). The outturn was slightly lower than the 0.7 per cent monthly GDP forecast that we published last month for the same period and the error is partly because of back data revisions. Building on the official data, our monthly GDP Tracker suggests that the economy will expand by 0.4 in the final quarter of this year. The apparent strength in third quarter growth masks a loss in momentum in industrial production as well as services output in the latter part of the third quarter. There are a number of factors at play, including Brexit-related uncertainty. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good point to wrap up for the day, and the week. Thanks for reading and commenting. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. GW Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a round-up of how the UK growth figures are being reported: Reuters: UK economy grows strongly in third quarter, with hints of tougher times ahead Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy kept up healthy momentum during the third quarter, but this may prove a high watermark ahead of Brexit, official figures showed on Friday. Gross domestic product in the three months to September was 0.6 percent higher than in the previous quarter, matching the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed. Compared with a year earlier, the economy stood 1.5 percent larger. But in September alone, it stagnated for a second month running, compared with forecasts for a rise of 0.1 percent. Financial Times: UK economy grows at fastest rate since 2016 The UK economy accelerated to its fastest quarterly growth rate in almost two years over the summer but economists warned that with Brexit uncertainties curbing spending, the performance would soon decline. Daily Telegraph: Strong summer sales fade as economy slows into autumn Economic growth hit its highest pace since 2016 as GDP surged 0.6pc in the third quarter of the year on stronger manufacturing and construction growth. Annual growth accelerated to 1.5pc, up from 1.2pc three months ago. But there are already signs the acceleration has faded, with most of the improvement coming in July and growth petering out by September. The Times: Sunny summer helped economy to fastest growth for two years The British economy grew by a perky 0.6 per cent in the third quarter, its fastest for two years, but the positive number was soured by a third successive quarter of falling business investment. The Office for National Statistics said that the growth in total output compared to the second quarter was the fastest performance since the first quarter of 2016, when the economy surged by 0.7 per cent. Cheerfulness fuelled by England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s showing in the World Cup and the sunny weather pushed up retail sales and a recovery in construction in July produced a surge in the economy in the first month of the period. August and September were both flat, however, confirming concerns that the impetus has been fading. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures: Andy Scott, associate director at independent financial risk management consultancy JCRA, also fears the UK is now slowing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest GDP figures show that the unexpectedly hot and sunny Summer has encouraged consumers to spend more on eating and drinking out, while Sterling weakness has helped to boost trade. By contrast, investment contracted sharply, suggesting that companies are preparing for a weaker economy by scaling back on spending, with implications for GDP growth as well as the labour market. With a Brexit deal still hanging in the balance, we expect the economy to slow in the current quarter, as businesses and consumers brace themselves for the eventuality that no solution is found for the Irish border issue. The overall picture of the UK economy is however, one of resilience. With unemployment at multi-decade lows and wages accelerating, the robust levels of household spending should continue to act as a buffer against weakening sectors such as manufacturing, preventing the economy from stalling or worse, contracting. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official: the government can organise a photo op in a brewery..... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the ONS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on the growth figures: The UK can claim to have been one of the faster-growing advanced economies this summer. The eurozone, for example, only expanded by 0.2% in July-September, with Italy not managing any growth at all. Even France, which should have enjoyed its own World Cup boost, only grew by 0.4%. We get German GDP next Wednesday; some economists fear Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy may have shrunk due to trade war tensions, and a slowdown in its car sector. Japan is also predicted to have contracted, partly due to earthquake and typhoon disruption. Britain hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t caught up with America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong growth, though.. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we know so far: US: +0.9% quarterly growth in Q3 (or 3.5% on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcannualised\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 basis used in America) UK: +0.6% quarterly growth France: +0.4% quarterly growth Eurozone: +0.2% Italy: Stagnation Canada: 0.2% growth in July, and 0.1% in August TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady has called on the government to help stop the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worrying fall\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in business investment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government should set up a National Investment Bank to upgrade Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure. This would help raise productivity, giving a boost to growth and wages. Business investment would also benefit from a Brexit deal that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gum up Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade links with the EU.... Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunderlying strength\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 really doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t match the steady slide in UK business investment this year. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures show the UK economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s underlying strength. Speaking on a trip to Fuller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brewery in London (nice work if you can get it!), the chancellor hailed the GDP report - even though several economists are warning that the economy is slowing. Hammond says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive growth of 0.6% is proof of the underlying strength in our economy. We are building an economy that works for everyone with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade. Now our focus is on locking in this progress and ensuring people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wages can continue to rise. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That is why my Budget supports hardworking families by cutting taxes for 32 million people, provides more funding for public services \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including a record-breaking funding increase for our vital NHS \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and invests in our future with more money for transport and digital technology.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The CBI also fears that the UK economy is weakening, despite its sparkling summer. Their principal economist, Alpesh Paleja, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sun shone on the UK economy over the summer, boosting economic growth relative to the second quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But as the impact from the warm weather and World Cup fades, we expect subdued growth ahead. Indeed, our surveys for October already paint a picture of weaker momentum. Will Hobbs, head of investment strategy at Barclays Smart Investor, is also concerned that storm clouds are gathering over the UK economy: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We should not be lulled into a false sense of security by a third-quarter that was propped up by a bounce in consumption. Incoming private sector confidence surveys tell us very clearly that the sky is darkening a little for the UK as the realities of a hard Brexit start to weigh more visibly on short term private sector decision making. Brexit is clearly to blame for the slide in UK business investment, says analysts at Danke Bank This pick-up in UK growth won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last, according to Ana Boata, senior economist at Euler Hermes. She fears that growth could halve in the current quarter: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The rebound in UK economic growth in Q3 was triggered by a number of temporary factors including contingency planning in light of the uncertainty on the Brexit deal by March 2019. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect GDP growth to fall to 0.2-0.3% in Q4 as tightening financial conditions, weaker consumer confidence and more fragile business profitability take their toll on the UK economy. The drag on growth from the Brexit related uncertainty will remain and will hinder investment opportunities. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation that the sun and the soccer helped drive the UK economy in July. Better news: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exporters helped to drive growth up over the summer. The ONS says that net trade made the largest positive contribution to GDP growth in the last three months, thanks to a 2.7% rise in exports. Imports were flat. Another blow: business investment fell by 1.2% between Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 2018. This is the sharpest decline since the first quarter of 2016 and marked the third consecutive quarterly fall \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which has not been seen since the global financial crisis, the ONS says. This is likely to be due to the impact of Brexit uncertainty, as firms are reluctant to commit to new factories and offices until they have more clarity. Update: here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the chart: Once again, Britain relied on consumer spending for its growth. Household spending grew by 0.5% in the last quarter, the ONS says. On an annual basis, the UK economy grew by 1.5% in July-September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best result in a year. But the ONS isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed, saying that the UK continued \u00e2\u20ac\u0153its relatively subdued performance over the last year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Oh dear. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report also shows that the UK economy didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t post any growth in September, or in August. Economists had expected GDP to rise by 0.1% in September, so this is a blow. One month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sizzling growth (thank you July!) isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough. The ONS says: Real GDP growth in Quarter 3 was driven by growth of 0.3% in July 2018, which stemmed from strong retail sales boosted by warm weather and the World Cup, as well as a low base reflecting the weaker start to the year. Month-on-month growth in real GDP has been flat in both August and September 2018. Confirmation that the UK economy just racked up its best quarter since the end of 2016: All four sectors of the UK economy - services, industry, construction and agriculture - grew in the last quarter. The ONS says: All four sectors of output contributed positively to growth in Quarter 3 2018, with the largest contribution from the services industries at 0.3 percentage points. NEWSFLASH: The UK economy grew by 0.6% in the third quarter of this year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fastest growth in a calendar quarter since the last three months of 2016. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 0.4% in the second quarter of 2018, the Office for National Statistics says. More to follow.... Here we go... Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures could be the high point of 2018... The prospect of UK growth hitting its highest level since the end of 2016 hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cheered the London stock market. Shares are down across Europe this morning, as the rally following this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US elections fizzles out. This has knocked 0.7% off the Stoxx 600, which tracks the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest companies. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Just as it looked like the US midterm election results would give a boost to markets around the world, momentum has been quickly lost. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A falling oil price has troubled investors and shifted their focus back to concerns about a slowdown in global economic growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Treasury have tweeted a short (and simple) video clip to explain what GDP means: If today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-quarter GDP report is indeed strong, then July can take much of the credit. A consumer spending surge helped to drive growth at the start of the last quarter, but it is likely to have faded by the end. As Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services puts it: The story for the UK economy in Q3 was a strong start which had fizzled out almost completely by the end of the quarter, indeed monthly GDP and the Index of Services for September are seen at just 0.1% m/m after flat readings in August. Q3 Business Investment is projected to rebound modestly to 0.2% q/q, which would be an improvement on Q2\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s -0.7% q/q, but is obviously heavily encumbered by Brexit related uncertainties Good morning. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sizzling summer is, alas, behind us. The barbecues have been put away, and World Cup wall charts have been taken down, as the country braces for Storm Deirdre to give us an autumnal blast. But we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll always have the memories. And this morning, we discover just how well the economy performed in July-September - and whether Brexit uncertainty and global trade conflicts took the shine off the sizzling summer. New UK GDP data is expected to show Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy expanded at its fastest rate in almost two years over the summer, with growth of around 0.6%. That would be much better than the measly 0.1% growth recorded in Q1, or the 0.4% in Q2. To be honest, it would be a surprise if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP reading wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good. Under the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new monthly GDP reporting system, we already know that July was strong (with growth of 0.6% in that month alone). August seems to have been flat, but growth probably picked up a little in September. Royal Bank of Canada predict that household spending and building activity boosted growth over the summer: The good summer weather boosted consumer spending and construction activity. This first release of quarterly GDP now comes with an expenditure breakdown which we expect to show household consumption and investment being the major contributors to third quarter growth. Amid a blizzard of data at 9.30am, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also learn how well Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories and service sector firms and exporters fared in September. But a strong performance won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fix all Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic challenges. The City fears that growth is slowing in the current quarter, as firms slash investment plans ahead of Brexit. Yesterday the European Commission predicted Britain would tumble to the bottom of the European growth league next year, even after a soft departure from the EU.

It means the economy has met the Reserve Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definition of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153full employment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for two months in a row, despite the existence of a large cohort of workers who say they want to be working more hours. However, the strong figures come as the RBA deputy governor, Guy Debelle, warns the recent decision by major banks to clamp down on lending to residential property developers risks overshooting and contributing to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153protracted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd downturn in the housing market. Debelle has told a business audience in Melbourne that he thinks the tightening in lending to developers is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a higher risk to the economic outlook\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than the clampdown on lending to homebuyers, which has ameliorated risk. It means news of the strength of the labour market must be weighed against the risks in the housing market, which are many. New figures show Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate remained steady at 5% in October, matching September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate which was the lowest level in six-and-a-half years. The unemployment rate was 5.3% in August. In seasonally adjusted terms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a statistical technique that removes the effects of seasonal variation in employment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the number of employed persons increased by 32,800 last month, after full-time jobs increased by 42,300 and part-time jobs decreased 9,500. Economists say labour market conditions are clearly robust, with the bulk of the jobs growth coming from fulltime positions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c since October 2017, fulltime employment has increased by 238,800 persons, while part-time employment has increased by 69,400 persons. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fulltime roles have accounted for 83% of employment growth throughout 2018, after accounting for three-quarters of growth last year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd economist Callum Pickering said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Australia is creating high-quality roles and that, more than anything, is eating into labour market slack across the country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The vast majority of jobs growth is coming from New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of the 20,300 average monthly increase in employed fulltime persons over the past 25 months, New South Wales contributed 35.9%, Victoria 30.5%, Queensland 16.5% and Western Australia 12.1%,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the ABS chief economist, Bruce Hockman, said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The contribution of the other states and territories was largely flat.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, even though the headline unemployment rate is a relatively low 5%, the level of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153underemployment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is still stubbornly high, at 8.3%. It brings the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153underutilisation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rate (unemployment rate + underemployment rate) to 13.3% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c revealing the degree of spare capacity in the labour market that is keeping wage pressures contained. Economists say the level of underutilisation will need to decline significantly, and the headline unemployment will need to fall closer to 4%, before wage pressures build. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The still large amount of labour market slack means wage inflation pressures will remain weak,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the AMP Capital chief economist, Shane Oliver, said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Meanwhile, the Australian consumer continues to face headwinds due to the ongoing housing market correction and a savings rate that is already extremely low. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As result we remain of the view that the RBA won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t start raising interest rates until 2020 at the earliest and given the housing related downturn there is a significant chance that the next move could turn out to be a rate cut \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although this would be unlikely before second half next year as it will take a while to change the RBA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relatively upbeat thinking on the economy and rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In Melbourne, Debelle noted that Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property prices had fallen by almost 5% from their late 2017 peak, while the pace of housing credit growth had slowed over the past couple of years. He said the fall in housing prices was a combination of multiple factors, including the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very large increase\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the supply of houses and apartments both now and in prospect. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It also reflects a reduction in foreign demand, which has been affected by a tightening in the ability to shift money out of China and an increase in stamp duty in some states,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some have attributed the slowing in housing credit solely to a tightening in the supply by banks in response to regulatory actions. Others have suggested there has been a weakening in housing demand and so demand for credit, including because of the high level of and weaker outlook for housing prices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To me, reductions in both the demand and supply of credit have been at play and it is hard to separate their effects.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, Debelle said recent regulatory measures had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significantly reduced the riskiness of new housing lending\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The available evidence suggests [recent regulatory measures] have meaningfully reduced vulnerabilities associated with riskier household lending and so increased the resilience of the economy to future shocks,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.",

He built his reputation as the man who turned around first Renault and then Nissan. This helped to maintain the trust between the two companies as their fortunes wax and wane, usually in a way that balanced each other out. His keen eye for cost-cutting underpinned the alliance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success in combining supplier networks, vehicle development and other central tasks in order to generate synergies. Ghosn also made it his personal mission to bring AvtoVAZ and Mitsubishi into the alliance, and had made (some) progress in turning them around too.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153In an interview with The Economist Intelligence Unit in mid-November, Mr Ghosn seemed confident that this combination of diversity and synergy could survive his departure - that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just based on what he called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the human factor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

He or she may also be under pressure to show how the alliance can stop Tesla and GM from eroding its early lead in electric vehicles - and how the somewhat sporadic recent investment in mobility and connected car technology can be harnessed to help the alliance as a whole.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5bf2a19ce4b0bb700a72fd3b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-11-19T12:08:38.350Z\">12.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Economics professor Thomas Piketty (an expert in inequality) has tweeted that Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged misconduct shows the perils of granting top bosses pay \u00e2\u20ac\u0153without limits\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PikettyLeMonde/status/1064478487489204224\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"fr\" dir=\"ltr\">Voici \u00c3\u00a0 quoi conduit l&#39;id\u00c3\u00a9ologie des premiers de cord\u00c3\u00a9e et des r\u00c3\u00a9mun\u00c3\u00a9rations sans limite...

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest take: Carlos Ghosn, the chairman of Nissan and one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful automotive executives, has been arrested by Japanese prosecutors in a move that sent shockwaves through the industry. The 64-year-old French-Brazilian is suspected of having understated his income on financial statements and was exposed by a whistleblower. Nissan said it will fire him this week as the company admitted it had left him in control for too long. Ghosn is regarded as one of the leading figures in the global car industry, having forged an alliance between France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi that created the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest car manufacturer. As well as chairing Nissan, Ghosn is chief executive and chairman of Renault and chairman of Mitsubishi. In a statement, Nissan said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153over many years\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ghosn and another senior executive, Greg Kelly, had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reporting compensation amounts in the Tokyo Stock Exchange securities report that were less than the actual amount, in order to reduce the disclosed amount of Carlos Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s compensation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... Goodnight! GW Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more reaction to the Ghosn story: Renault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares never really recovered from the shock of Carlos Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest and imminent dismissal from Nissan. After a wild day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading, they have closed down over 8% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac59.06, as traders worry that the Nissan-Renault alliance could be in jeopardy. Tim Hubbard, assistant professor of management in the University of Notre Dame\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mendoza College of Business, argues Nissan has learned the perils of giving one executive too much power: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Carlos Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest and, soon to be, dismissal over financial misconduct is yet another\u00e2\u20ac\u201dall too frequent\u00e2\u20ac\u201dexample of a top executive being dismissed for misconduct in the executive suite. Ghosn was one of the car industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most prominent executives who has been responsible for breathing life back into Nissan. Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest complicates a highly interconnected set of relationships between Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors. The equity stakes that they have between each other may be at risk. This has widespread implications for a large portion of the auto industry as these alliances have become more critical in the increasingly interconnected design, manufacturing, and support of auto customers worldwide. Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest is another unfortunate example of the perils of having too much power concentrated in one individual within\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand across\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcorporations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd My colleague Jasper Jolly has written a neat profile of Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ghosn, and his sudden fall from grace. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Carlos Ghosn was, until Monday, a titan of the global car industry. The first person to lead two Fortune 500 companies at the same time, he also enjoyed an almost unique position as a foreign chief executive of a major Japanese company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even gaining the honour of a manga comic book version of his life and rice sculptures of his face in bento lunchboxes sold to Japanese businessmen. Yet in a remarkable development which has shocked the automotive industry, Ghosn will now be dismissed by Nissan on Thursday after alleged financial irregularities. Nissan did not hold back in its statement on Ghosn, accusing him and a senior colleague of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant acts of misconduct\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd including understating his pay to regulators and misusing company assets. Renault and Mitsubishi Motors, both of which Ghosn also chairs, have yet to respond. The ousting leaves the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the maker of one in every nine cars manufactured worldwide last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c without its totemic leader as the electric and autonomous car revolutions threaten to upend the business models of established car manufacturers. Born in Brazil in 1954 to Lebanese immigrants, Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ascent to the pinnacle of the global car industry began in France, where he studied at the prestigious \u00c3\u2030cole Polytechnique in Paris before joining Michelin, the French tyre manufacturer. At 27 he was manager of a Michelin factory in France; at 36 he was chief executive of the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s North American operations. In 1996 Ghosn (which rhymes with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) was poached by Renault, where he made his mark with a deep restructuring \u00e2\u20ac\u201c earning a reputation for a sleek but ruthless management style, and a nickname, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Le Cost Killer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... More here: Update: Nissan President and CEO Hiroto Saikawa did give the media a bow as he exited today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference, as these photos show: The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Peter Campbell watched Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference, and was stuck by the way that Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa deeply criticised chairman Carlos Ghosn: Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dramatic press conference in Tokyo ended with another apology from Saikawa, this time for not being able to answer many of the media\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s questions. However, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe he gave the traditional bow of contrition, which we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in previous Japanese corporate scandals. Over in France, a union official has welcome the news that Ghosn is in hot water over his pay and alleged misuse of Nissan assets. Associated Press have the details: Ali Kaya, who heads the CGT union at a Renault factory in Flins outside Paris, said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the most shocking thing is that these people were not arrested well before this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He lamented that the public has grown inured to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153astronomical sums\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd paid to Ghosn and other executives. The powerful, hard-left CGT has long campaigned to cap executive pay. Nissan CEO Saikawa is still being quizzed by Japanese reporters, desperate for more details about Carlos Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impending sacking. He says that Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s internal investigation into the misconduct is almost complete, but won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on whether any other people are involved. Saikawa also explains that representative member Greg Kelly was a close advisor to Ghosn. Saikawa is really putting the boot into Carlos Ghosn now, claiming that the chairman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long reign had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negative impact\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on business operations He does concede, though, that Ghosn had implemented valuable reforms and restructuring in his early days at Nissan. Some instant reaction to the Nissan press conference: The Nissan press conference is getting increasingly tense. One reporter tells CEO Saikawa that people who love Nissan cars will be shocked by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news. Another asks whether Nissan has actually carried out a coup to remove chairman Ghosn. Saikawa says he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on whether chairman Carlos Ghosn and board member Greg Kelly will face criminal charges. Journalists in Toyko are demanding more details about Carlos Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s serious misconduct. Nissan CEO Saikawa, though, is refusing to give much away. He does say that Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top executives only learned about the the probe earlier today. Saikawa also suggests that the misconduct went on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for a long period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, before an unnamed whistleblower brought it to light. Nissan are now questions from the media in Tokyo: Q: Is it correct that Carlos Ghosn was arrested when he arrived at an airport in Japan today? Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa confirms that Ghosn had been due to arrive in Tokyo today, but he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give any more details about the investigation. Carlos Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious misconduct\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd fell into three parts, according to Nissan: He misrepresented his compensation (pay) in the report to the Tokyo Stock Exchange He misrepresented the purpose of spending the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment He used the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets for personal use. Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa says too much power was concentrated in one executive (as explained earlier, Carlos Ghosn has been the driving force at both Nissan and Renault for almost 20 years) He pledges that efforts will be made to prevent the Ghosn scandal hurting the Renault-Nissan alliance (easier said than done, I fear) An emotional-sounding Hiroto Saikawa adde that he is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disappointed and frustrated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the actions of Chairman Ghosn and Representative Director Kelly. On behalf of the company, we offer a deep apology to shareholders, Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO says. Saikawa also apologises to Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employees and suppliers around the world for causing them \u00e2\u20ac\u0153commotion and anxiety\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nissan are holding a press conference in Toyko now. President and chief executive Hiroto Saikawa says that his understanding is that chairman Carlos Ghosn and Representative Director Greg Kelly have both been arrested today. Saikawa says he cannot give full details of the pair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions, due to the ongoing investigations underway by the Japanese prosecutors office. He says auditors discovered a series of misconducts by Ghosn and Kelly; Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153specialist evaluation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is that the act is a serious misconduct that merits dismissal Nissan will organise a board meeting later this week to formally propose the removal of Ghosn as chairman, says Saikawa, who also calls Greg Kelly the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mastermind\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the scheme. More to follow..... French president Emmanuel Macron has now weighed in, saying the state will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremely vigilant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the stability of Renault, and its alliance with Nissan. During a trip to Brussels, Macron told reporters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to comment on the reality or materiality of the accusations, about which I have no further information. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a shareholder, however, the French government will remain extremely vigilant regarding the stability of the alliance, the group and ... its employees, who have the full support of the state.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clip: The French government owns a 15% stake in Renault, making it the largest shareholder, and providing significant leverage over the alliance. Earlier this year it was pushing Nissan and Renault to integrate their operations more closely. It has also put pressure on Ghosn to invest more in France and create more jobs. Indeed, Macron and Ghosn visited a Renault plant in Maubeuge, Northern France, earlier this month to announce plans to build new vans there. Ana Nicholls, analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, says Carlos Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock ousting puts the entire future of the Nissan-Renault alliance under question. The strong bond between the French and Japanese carmakers depends partly on cross-shareholdings but even more on Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge personal influence. He built his reputation as the man who turned around first Renault and then Nissan. This helped to maintain the trust between the two companies as their fortunes wax and wane, usually in a way that balanced each other out. His keen eye for cost-cutting underpinned the alliance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success in combining supplier networks, vehicle development and other central tasks in order to generate synergies. Ghosn also made it his personal mission to bring AvtoVAZ and Mitsubishi into the alliance, and had made (some) progress in turning them around too. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In an interview with The Economist Intelligence Unit in mid-November, Mr Ghosn seemed confident that this combination of diversity and synergy could survive his departure - that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just based on what he called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the human factor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Even so, his successor will face questions about whether to invest money in increasing the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cross-shareholdings in order to cement the relationships, or risk the alliance falling apart. He or she may also be under pressure to show how the alliance can stop Tesla and GM from eroding its early lead in electric vehicles - and how the somewhat sporadic recent investment in mobility and connected car technology can be harnessed to help the alliance as a whole.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Economics professor Thomas Piketty (an expert in inequality) has tweeted that Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged misconduct shows the perils of granting top bosses pay \u00e2\u20ac\u0153without limits\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s massive media interest in Japan over the crisis gripping Nissan tonight. Journalists have gathered outside the Tokyo Regional Prosecution Office in Tokyo, awaiting fresh details on the investigation into Carlos Ghosn . Rumours of Carlos Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcserious misconduct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 are flying around Japan. The Kyodo newswire is reporting that Ghosn is suspected of understating income by 5 billion yen over five years -- that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost \u00c2\u00a335m. Renault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are continuing to be pummelled; now down 14%. The news that Carlos Ghosn has ben arrested on suspicion of violating financial trading has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rocked investor confidence in the Paris-listed stock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says David Maddon of CMC Markets. The news that Carlos Ghosn is being ousted from Nissan is causing massive shockwaves in the car industry. For years, Ghosn has managed the seemingly impossible job of running one carmaker in Japan, and another in France. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s known for a ferocious work ethic, and charismatic leadership style that has helped him to turn Nissan and Renault around over the last two decades He was initially known as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccost-killer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the 1990s, cutting tens of thousands of jobs and closing factories in Japan and Europe. That made him understandably unpopular, but over time his reputation in Japan swelled as Nissan returned to profitability. The Nissan-Renault alliance now makes one in nine cars sold worldwide. As Fortune magazine wrote in 2014, the Brazilian-Lebanese-French business chief was seemingly indispensable: Ghosn seems to be built for the job: He has the ability to connect with strangers instantly and to compartmentalize, no discernible private life outside his family, and a willingness to travel 300,000 miles a year (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 11 circumnavigations). The question is, Who will run this leviathan, which he calls the Renault-Nissan Alliance, after the 60-year-old retires, or if, God forbid, something happens to him? It is such a demanding, bone-crunching job that Ghosn himself has said that after he leaves no one person should replace him. In fact, on numerous occasions he has said to a close former colleague: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Who would want this job?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He was even paid the rare accolade of having his face represented in sushi, in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Carlos Ghosn bento lunchbox\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The FT explained: It is a measure of the extraordinary rise of Mr Ghosn in Japan that he should be deemed worthy enough to eat. The Japanese take their food seriously and do not welcome foreign intrusions. As such, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ghosn bento\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could be seen as a Japanese way of bestowing acceptance upon him. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve only interviewed Ghosn once, at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2016. Well I say interviewed -- I basically grabbed him walking in a corridor. Some CEOs aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prepared to chat like that, but Ghosn was happy to explain how Nissan would cope with Brexit if it happened, without breaking stride as he marched briskly to his next meeting. Japanese newspaper Yomiuri is now reporting that Carlos Ghosn has been arrested by prosecutors in Tokyo. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been confirmed yet (obviously it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fast-moving story...) Nissan has now issued a statement, accusing chairman Carlos Ghosn and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrepresentative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Greg Kelly of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcserious misconduct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The carmaker says the two men both under-reported Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s salary, and also accuses its chairman of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153numerous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd other acts of misconduct, including using Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets for personal use. Nissan has confirmed that it proposes removing both men from their positions, and has been working with Japanese prosecutors. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement: Regarding serious misconduct by Nissan Chairman and one representative director Based on a whistleblower report, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (Nissan) has been conducting an internal investigation over the past several months regarding misconduct involving the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Representative Director and Chairman Carlos Ghosn and Representative Director Greg Kelly. The investigation showed that over many years both Ghosn and Kelly have been reporting compensation amounts in the Tokyo Stock Exchange securities report that were less than the actual amount, in order to reduce the disclosed amount of Carlos Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s compensation. Also, in regards to Ghosn, numerous other significant acts of misconduct have been uncovered, such as personal use of company assets, and Kelly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deep involvement has also been confirmed. Nissan has been providing information to the Japanese Public Prosecutors Office and has been fully cooperating with their investigation. We will continue to do so. As the misconduct uncovered through our internal investigation constitutes clear violations of the duty of care as directors, Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Executive Officer Hiroto Saikawa will propose to the Nissan Board of Directors to promptly remove Ghosn from his positions as Chairman and Representative Director. Saikawa will also propose the removal of Greg Kelly from his position as Representative Director. Nissan deeply apologizes for causing great concern to our shareholders and stakeholders. We will continue our work to identify our governance and compliance issues, and to take appropriate measures. Ghosn and Kelly are two of the three members of Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrepresentative board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, alongside president Hiroto Saikawa. Blimey: Renault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have now plunged by over 10%. Traders in France are understandably shocked by the news that chairman Ghosn faces arrest in Japan for allegedly under-reporting his income. That wiping some \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2bn off Renault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market capitalisation, taking its value down from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac19bn to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac17bn. Newsflash: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting more details from Japan about the shock investigation into Nissan/Renault chairman Carlos Ghosn. According to Japanese press agency Jiji: The Nissan Board will propose that Ghosn is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terminated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from its chairmanship. Nissan say Ghosn has used company money for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal use\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and committed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153several other serious acts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nissan says it has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153investigating possible improper practices\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for several months, and has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fully cooperated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with investigators: Boom! Shares in Renault are sliding following a report that auto magnate Carlos Ghosn faces arrest in Japan. According to the Asahi newspaper, Ghosn is being probed by prosecutors for allegedly violating Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial instruments and exchange act. Ghosn is apparently suspected of understating his own income on financial statements and had agreed to voluntarily speak to prosecutors. He is chairman of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nissan, and also chairman and chief executive of France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Renault. A Nissan spokesman said the company was making checks on the report, and will hold a press conference later today. The news has rocked the car sector, sending Renault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares sliding by almost 6% to their lowest since 2015. Shares in UK builders are dropping this morning, following a report that house prices have fallen 1.7% this month. Online estate agent Rightmove reported that the average house price fell by \u00c2\u00a35,000 in November, with wealthy parts of the South East suffering the biggest reversal. It appears that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcripple effect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of rising prices flowing outward from London is now reversing, as Brexit worries hit the economy. Miles Shipside of Rightmove says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Higher-end, former hotspot towns are now among the biggest annual fallers with Rickmansworth (-7.1%), Esher (-6.4%) and Gerrards Cross (-6.0%) now cold spots following price rises of nearly 40% over the seven preceding years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This has sent housebuilders into the list of FTSE 100 big fallers. Barratt Developments are down 1.4%, followed by Berkeley Group (-0.7%) and Persimmon (-0.6%). The pound has risen in early trading, shaking off some of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Sterling is up 0.25% at $1.287 against the US dollar, as Theresa May continues to show impressive sticking power. Despite widespread criticism of her Brexit deal, Conservative MPs haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet mustered the 48 letters of no confidence needed to trigger a leadership contest. One critic, Simon Clarke MP, is trying to persuade fellow Brexiteers to demand a new leader, arguing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is absolutely the day at which we stand at the bar of history on this..... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is quite clear to me that the captain is driving the ship at the rocks. However, other members of the European Reform Group - who demand a clean break from the EU - seem reluctant to do the deed, even though there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unhappiness about the terms of the transition deal and backstop negotiated between London and Brussels. Our political editor Heather Stewart says the ERG rebellion could fizzle out, unless they get to the 48-letter mark soon.... Despite the war of words between the US and China, European stock markets have opened higher. In London, the FTSE 100 is up around 0.5%, with similar gains in other major markets: Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, warns that trading will probably be volatile, thanks to trade war worries and Brexit upheaval: U.S. Vice President Mike Pence didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give the bulls what they wanted over the weekend. At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit, Pence said there would be no end to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods until China changes its ways. His comments suggest that a deal between President Trump and President Xi is unlikely to see the light when the leaders meet at the G20 Summit later this month. Given that we are near the end of the earnings season and the U.S. economic calendar has only tier 2 data to release, expect markets to trade on thin volumes. Political headlines will likely dominate, and thus expect volatility to remain high. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Global Times, the state-sponsored newspaper, is often a good guide to Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking. And today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s editorial argues that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not a big deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that the APEC summit ended without a joint communique for the first time in a quarter of a century. It also takes a pop at the White House, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delusional of some US elites to think that China is the largest beneficiary of the international system since they mistakenly blame China for the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 own problems. China has realized its development through hard work, not by taking advantage of the international system.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Analysts at ING are also concerned that Mike Pence and Xi Jinpeng failed to mend any fences, saying: The risk to global economies and markets from the Sino-US trade war is elevated after an impasse between two countries at the APEC summit The discord between America and China over trade loomed over last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s APEC gathering in Papua New Guinea, says Royal Bank of Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sue Trinh: She writes: The Sino-US discord was palpable at the APEC Summit in PNG, so much so that the confab ended with members unable to agree on a communiqu\u00c3\u00a9, for the first time ever. Aside from this being further evidence of a growing anti-China alliance in the APAC region (watch out for Taiwan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum this Saturday to remove \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the Olympic team name), the rhetoric is sharpening between the key players. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of an escalating US-China trade war are weighing on the markets this morning, after the two powers clashed at a major summit over the weekend. US vice-president Mike Pence challenged Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade practices at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in Papua New Guinea, criticising China for engaging in forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft. He told delegates that: The United States . . . will not change course until China changes its ways. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have great respect for President Xi and China, but as we all know, China has taken advantage of the United States for many, many years and those days are over.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chinese President Xi Jinping was equally combative, criticising Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aggressive actions on trade. He argued: Unilateralism and protectionism will not solve problems but add uncertainty to the world economy. History has shown that confrontation, whether in the form of a cold war, a hot war or a trade war, produces no winners.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But in an unprecedented move, the APEC leaders actually failed to sign off the traditional end-of-summit communique; a sign that cooperation was in short supply. One insider told CNN that Chine baulked at a line in the statement that read \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We agree to fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, taking it as a deliberate attack at China. Economists has hoped that the APEC meeting might have thawed relations between the two major powers. That could have helped to de-escalate the trade wars, paving the way for a formal breakthrough at this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G20 meeting of world leaders. Instead, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a growing risk that president Trump imposes further tariffs on Chinese exports to America, which would have a further chilling impact on trade and global growth. Also coming up today Investors will be glued to the latest developments in Westminster, as Theresa May continues to face down critics of her Brexit deal. The PM is due to speak at the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual conference today, where UK business leaders may warn of the perils of leaving the Eu without a transition arrangement. The agenda All day: CBI conference in London 10:00am GMT: Eurozone construction output for September",

morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong></p> <p>Japanese carmaker Nissan is reeling today after its chairman Carlos Ghosn was dramatically detained by prosecutors for allegedly under-reporting his salary and misusing the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets.</p> <p>Shares in Nissan have plunged in heavy trading in

                "bodyText":"The closing bell has rung out on the New York stock exchange, and we can see the damage: The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 555 points, or 2.2%, at 24,462.32 The S&amp;P 500 lost 49 points or 1.8% to end at 2,641.63 The Nasdaq shed 117 points, or 1.67%, to end at 6,911 Retail, energy and technology stocks all played their part in the selloff. Retailers were hurt by weak results from Target, while the 6% drop in the crude oil price dragged energy producers down. Goodnight. GW The tech-focused Nasdaq index is down 1.6% in late trading. The Dow is now flirting with a 600-point loss, down 2.3% today. Apple is now down 4.8%, as the tech selloff gathers pace. Microsoft has lost 3.1%, as has construction equipment maker Caterpillar. More reaction to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses: With barely an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading to go, Wall Street is bobbing listlessly in the red. The Dow is currently down 529 points, or 2.2%, at 24,487. Many analysts are suggesting that Wall Street is entering a bear market, but David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree. He reckons we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going through a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd correction. Kelly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think America is heading for recession, as the slowdown in the economy, and the trouble in the market, will deter the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates. It may also encourage the White House to stop the trade war with China too. Mohamed El-Erian of investment group Allianz believes Donald Trump has helped push the oil price down today. A little while ago, the US president offered Saudi Arabia some support over the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi last month. Trump also questioned whether crown prince Mohammed bin Salman knew about the killing -- despite the CIA concluding that he ordered it. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention will infuriate those pushing for justice for Khashoggi, but it also cuts the chances that Saudi Arabia hit back at the US by slashing oil production (thus the drop in the oil price). Jim Cramer of CNBC reckons the selloff is partly due to margin calls - demands for investors to put up money to cover losses. That can often trigger further selling, if investors need to find the cash to hold those existing positions. Oil is also suffering from fears that the US-China trade war will escalate. Hopes are fading that US president Donald Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping could make a breakthrough at the G20 meeting at the end of November. Last weekend, US vice-president Mike Pence and Xi swapped barbs at a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders. Ashley Kelty, oil and gas research analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, says this has worried the markets: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In terms of the collapse today, the wider selloff in equities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sparked by weak retail and tech performance - has further exacerbated fears of weakening global demand amid a weaker economy and the spectre of escalations in the US-Sino trade war. The hopes that the US and China may be closer to a rapprochement were dashed at the APEC summit at the weekend, with expectations growing that a deal will not be struck at the G20 later this month, and subsequently new tariffs will be applied in the New Year. Rising US crude inventories are also pushing crude prices down, Kelty adds, even though oil producers have hinted at production cuts soon. While the news that OPEC+ said it would cut 1.4 million barrels of oil per day from production, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looking likely that the cuts will have to be deeper in order to stabilise the price. We would anticipate further weakness until the reaction from OPEC+ and the G20 summit is clearer.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The oil price has now slid by over 5% today, thanks to oversupply fears and worries about slowing economic growth (which equals less demand). Brent crude has dropped to just $63.23 per barrel, a drop of over $3 per barrel today. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, points out this takes oil deeper into a bear market (more than 20% off its recent peak). Fears of slowing global growth are fuelling concerns over global demand, just at a time when Saudi Arabia, Russia and the US continue to ramp up production The most recent Baker Hughes rig count increased by 2 last week, taking the number of rigs to 888, the highest number since March 2015. With oil trading heavily lower, the energy sector pipped tech stocks as the worst performer on the S&amp;P. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wall Street wobbles: Every stock on the Dow is in the red today, as the gloom sweeps across trading floors. Apple is the biggest faller, down 3.7%, followed by Goldman Sachs (-3.2%) and Microsoft (-2.6%). Energy stocks are also dropping, tracking the lower oil price today. Chevron is down 2.5%. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no cheer on Wall Street this afternoon. The Dow is still deep in the red, down 439 points at 24,577, a drop of 1.7%. The S&amp;P 500 is down 1.4%, while the Nasdaq has lost 1.26% - dragged down by Apple, amid ongoing worries about iPhone sales. In London, the FTSE 100 has closed 53 points lower at 6948 points, down 0.75%. Other European markets were worse hit; Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX lost 1.6% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC finished 1.2% lower. A cocktail of worries are hitting stocks, as US investors take cover ahead of Thanksgiving. Fears over global growth, trade disputes, and the prospect of higher interest rates are all factors. Marketwatch explains: These doubts have accumulated to induce fears that we are growing nearer to the end of the current economic expansion, strategists say. Investors are particularly gloomy about technology companies. Tech stocks extended a decline that led the market lower Monday, with reports from China adding fuel to the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selling after officials in Beijing uncovered widespread evidence of anticompetitive behavior by Korean rivals. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout has dragged the US stock market back to its October lows, and rattled Europe too. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: As a taster of the alarming tech trouble, Apple was down 4.6%, tumbling to a near 7 month low of $177 having been at $230 around 7 weeks ago; Microsoft fell by the same amount, with their Dow sibling Alphabet slipping 2.2%. Investors are concerned that sooner rather than later the sector is going to be fully embroiled in the US-China trade battle, exacerbating the softness caused by reports of a slowdown in iPhone demand. Obviously this caused the already moody European indices to have a fit. The CAC found itself the wrong side of 4900 as it lost 1.6%, with the DAX hitting a near 2 year nadir after dropping 200 points. The FTSE, meanwhile, slid 90 points, slumping back towards the 6900 lows seen during October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nightmare. Ouch! Wall Street has opened with heavy losses. The Dow has tumbled by 586 points, down to 24,430, erasing its gains for this year. Tech stocks are getting hit again, with Apple down 4.5%. Retailer Target is down 10% after posting disappointing results today. European stock markets are generally in retreat today, as traders worry about economic growth prospects, the US-China trade war, and Brexit. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed around 0.7%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has dropped by around 1.5% to a two-year low. With the oil price down 2%, and Bitcoin sliding, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no shortage of nervousness in the markets. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says: With equities (and cryptocurrencies) tumbling, volatility is clearly there, even if this week will be a quieter one for economic data. But can volatility remain elevated, especially towards the end of the week with the Thanksgiving holiday being observed on Thursday in the US (and on Friday in Japan)? Clearly some market participants would rather enjoy a long holiday break and await better opportunities next week. However, this time it may be different, and traders may actually hang around as volatility has not been at these elevated levels for prolonged periods in a while. Mark Carney refused to be drawn today on whether interest rates might rise or fall after Brexit, saying it all depends on the outcome. But Professor Costas Milas of Liverpool University argues that borrowing costs are unlikely to rise in 2019, due to its habit of under-estimating UK inflation. Professor Milas explains: The BoE targets inflation 2 years into the future. Look at the attached plot where I put together: (a) the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2-year inflation forecast based on constant interest rates, (b) the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2-year inflation forecast based on market expectations of interest rates and (c) the actual inflation outcome. Unfortunately, both forecasts move in opposite direction to the actual outcome (correlation is negative) which is a real worry. Nevertheless, under constant interest rates, the Bank has under-predicted CPI inflation by an annual average of 0.38%. Under market expectations of interest rates, however, the Bank has under-predicted CPI inflation by much more, that is, by an annual average of 0.54%. This is telling me that with/without hard-Brexit, it is more likely than not that the policy rate will remain at 0.75% in the next 2 years. Concerns over Brexit might be assuaged by the latest healthcheck on UK manufacturing. British factory orders bounced back in November after falling sharply in October, according to the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly survey. The balance of companies reporting above-average order books, rather than weaker, rose to +10 this month, up from -6 in October. That suggest UK goods are still in demand, despite the uncertainty over trading conditions after Brexit. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Chief Economist, warns that UK firms still need the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153right\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit deal: The overwhelming message from business to the Government is to make progress, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go backwards. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need frictionless trade for our world-beating manufactured goods and a transition period which draws us back from the cliff edge. Anything less than that and jobs and investment could suffer.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In other news, cryptocurrencies are having a bad day, again. Bitcoin has slumped by around 7% to below $4,500 - a blow to anyone who piled in when it was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 almost $20,000 last December. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets blames the recent trend of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcforking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cryptocurrencies into competing flavours, and the threat that regulators clamp down on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinitial coin offerings\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Fundamentally speaking, the current sell-off is due to two main reasons; regulatory pressure and disagreement within the coin developer community, one of the biggest threats. The SEC reminded the crypto world that it has the final say over anything that smells like a security. The department issued civil penalties against two cryptocurrency companies because they failed to register initial coin offerings as securities. Investors will be given their refund and the firms will have to face fines. The fear is that the SEC may not stop here and might take similar action against several companies that adopted a similar path. The community needs to stick together and work towards a more meaningful fork. This is because, developers, on the one hand, try to convince the world that the supply is limited and, on the other hand, they keep looking at ways of triggering another kind of forks. Forking has become so common that it puts at risk the notion of limited supply altogether. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hearing showed that the Bank of England remains very worried about a no-deal Brexit, says Hinesh Patel, portfolio manager at Quilter Investors. Patel explains this would leave the Bank \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbetween a rock and a hard place\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, with falling demand and rising inflation to balance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153From the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perspective the biggest concern above all else is the threat of a disorderly Brexit. A tumultuous departure would leave the Bank in the impossible position of trying to manage the risk of rising imported inflation if the pound were to fall further, while also trying to create conditions that are supportive of growth through a difficult period for the economy. The Bank has been really clear and consistent in pointing out its view that Brexit uncertainty has stunted business investment, a key driver of growth. Therefore in the event of a disorderly Brexit, Carney and his colleagues would likely anticipate a further shrinkage in business investment and would be tempted to respond with stimulus, but that in turn makes it difficult for them to keep inflation down. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why Mark Carney felt free to welcome Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan, as a transition deal would remove some of the unpredictable risks facing the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic and financial system.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The committee hearing is over, so here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick recap. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has given Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s draft Brexit deal his backing. Speaking to the Treasury Committee this morning, Carney argued that a transition agreement would provide stability and confidence, and would be better for economic growth than the alternatives. Carney said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have emphasised from the start the importance of having some transition between the current arrangements and the ultimate arrangements. So we welcome the transition arrangements in the withdrawal agreement ... and take note of the possibility of extending that transition period.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a great surprise, of course; the Bank has long been warning that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy would suffer from a hard break with the EU. But the timing is significant, just days before EU leaders decide whether to back the plan, teeing up a vote in Parliament before Christmas. MPs demanded to know whether the Bank was more likely to riase, or lower, interest rate if Britain left the EU without a deal. Carney, though, refused to commit, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This would be a very unusual situation. It is very rare to see a large negative supply shock in an advanced economy. You would have to stretch back at least in our analysis until the 1970s to find analogies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bank policymakers also warned that UK firms aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready for Britain to crash out without a deal or a transition agreement. Chief economist Andy Haldane said that firms are increasingly worried about a no-deal Brexit. This is now hurting investment, and likely to drag on growth this quarter. Michael Saunders, an external member of its Monetary Policy Committee, said that few businesses have drawn up contingency plans; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also too late for many to make plans before 29th March 2019. Deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe told the committee that the Bank would ensure that Britain didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suffer a financial meltdown, as we saw in 2008. However, the big decision on Brexit must be taken by MPs, not the Bank. Saunders also warned that the Bank doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the tools to magically fix the problems caused by a no-deal Brexit: If you have queues at Dover, the answer is not lower interest rates. Andy Haldane then gives a pithy explanation of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity crisis. He says that Britain has a longer tail of unproductive firms than other advanced economies. This has become worse since the financial crisis, such that even relatively productive firms in the second decile (the top 10%-19%) have been dragged down. Firms that were once the dog have joined the tail, Haldane says, to some laughter. Haldane does love a canine metaphor - in 2012, he compared setting financial regulation to a dog pursuing a frisbee. Q: Given all the talk about a no-deal Brexit, would it really be a shock if it happened? Mark Carney says there has been an expectation since the referendum that there won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a disorderly Brexit. The fact is that a substantial proportion of companies, in a wide range of sectors, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have contingency plans for a hard Brexit next spring. Onto wages, and the impact of migration on pay growth. Bank officials says earnings growth has firmed in recent months, over 3% per year. Michael Saunders argues that migration has been a source of growth, as workers coming into the UK have been better educated (on average) and brought skills that businesses need. A drop in inward migration would mean lower potential growth, and could mean lower actual growth too from lower consumer spending and a lack of staff, he warns. Q: But isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there also a link between falling migration and recent pay growth? Pay is rising because the labour market is tight, Saunders insists. On business investment, BoE governor Mark Carney says he believes there is more downside risk from a no-deal Brexit than upside risk from a smooth deal. BoE chief economy Andy Haldane agrees, but also argues that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153investment fundamentals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are bright for many companies. The potential return on investment is in low-double digits, while the cost of Capex is 2-3%, he explained. Q: Do businesses have enough time to put credible Brexit contingency plans in place? BoE committee member Michael Saunders says financial firms have done a lot of work already. But non-financial firms are very uncertain how they should prepare, and unwilling to spend large amounts on things that turn out to be unnecessarily. He doubts whether contingency plans could now be drawn up in time. The risk of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit is uncomfortably high, Carney says -- reiterating a point he made in August. Q: What is the long-term impact of a no-deal Brexit? Carney says that short-term supply disruption includes queues at Dover, people being confused about how the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grandfathering\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of contracts works. The Bank must distinguish between that, and long-term issues such as impact on demand, and labour supply. Mary Carney is now taking more questions about a no-deal outcome. The Bank needs to be in a position to support the UK if we ended up with no deal and no transition, by design or by accident, the governor says. He warns that some workers and capital could be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stranded\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There would also be an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic shock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Europe, particularly in Ireland, he adds - this wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just be a problem for the UK. Carney also agrees with Michael Saunders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 earlier point; most businesses haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t got contingency plans for no-deal Brexit. The main news line from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hearing is that Bank of England governor Mark Carney has backed the Brexit deal unveiled by Theresa May last week. Carney told the Treasury committee that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have emphasized from the start the importance of having some transition between the current arrangements and the ultimate arrangements. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So we welcome the transition arrangements in the withdrawal agreement ... and take note of the possibility of extending that transition period.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney also declared that this should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153support economic outcomes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; ie, avoiding the disruption and uncertainty of a no-deal Brexit. He also told MPs that the Bank will provide its assessment of the proposal, and a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 outcome next week. However, it will not include the option of staying in the EU (something Theresa May said was possible last week). Carney explained: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not intending to look at providing additional analysis on the third scenario which is no Brexit at all.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Q: Won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t extending the transition period push up the cost of the Brexit divorce bill (from its current \u00c2\u00a339bn)? Mark Carney notes that any extra cost should be weighed against the economic benefits. Q: Would a longer transition provide businesses with enough confidence to invest? Business investment has been falling for several quarters, he replies. An agreement with transition, and with some expectation of a deep economic partnership in the fullness of time, would provide more clarity for business..and one would expect that to support investment over time, he adds. Q: The [Brexit] text agreement suggests that the transition agreement could be extended until 20xx. Does that concern you, governor? It narrows it down, replies Mark Carney wryly. He then explains that this highlights just how long it would take to negotiate all the aspects of the economic partnership, and implement it. Monetary Policy Committee member Michael Saunders then reiterates his warning about a no-deal Brexit: Most businesses are not prepared for a no-deal Brexit, and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know really how to prepare. Over the last month or two, as the risk of a no-deal outcome has become more visible, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen business confidence weaken and rising uncertainty. And that may have a some negative effect on near-term economic activity. Deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe warns MPs that the Bank of England can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t solve Brexit for them. Cunliffe tells the Treasury Committee: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not for us to say which is the right outcome. Parliament and government will take that forward. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our job to be prepared for the worst,...and to provide parliament with information relevant to our mandate that is useful. Whatever the outcomes, people in the UK can have assurance that they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see a financial sector meltdown of the sort as they say in 2008. That means people can have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trust in the institution doing its job\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and delivering its inflation, Cunliffe explains, concluding: But how the outcomes will play out, and the choices, are down to parliament and government. Mark Carney reminds the committee that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic forecasts have a range of outcomes -- and the upper end of those forecasts are based on the economy looking somewhat similar to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the status quo\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after Brexit. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another hint that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal is better than a no-deal outcome. Rushnara Ali MP takes up the questioning, and accidentally calls Mark Carney \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rather than \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgovernor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. She then asks whether Britain is stuck between \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a rock and a hard place\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when choosing between Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal and a no-deal Brexit. Carney doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u0153subscribe to that characterisation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Instead, he says there is value in the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transition deal, all depending on what the UK is actually transitioning too. That means the political declaration about the final arrangement is very important. Q: Will interest rates be higher or lower after a no-deal Brexit? Honestly, it all depends, Mark Carney reiterates. Specifically, on whether it is more of a shock to demand (which might merit a stimulus from lower borrowing costs), or to supply (which could be inflationary, requiring higher rates) Carney explains that no-deal Brexit would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real economy shock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Central banks have a role, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on a sidelines, he adds. BoE committee member Michael Saunders then weighs in, warning that moving to WTO rules quickly (if Britain left without a deal) would be a major supply shock. If you have queues at Dover, the answer is not lower interest rates. So you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t assume that the Bank would cut interest rates, as it did in 2016 after the referendum. Q: If Britain leaves the EU without a deal, will the Bank boost its stimulus programme (to support the market) or raise interest rates (to support the pound)? It depends, Carney replies. There are very few previous examples of an advanced economy suffering a big supply shock, so the Bank doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much evidence to go on. Charlie Elphicke MP asks Mark Carney about last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cabinet meeting on Brexit. Elphicke says that the pound jumped after Theresa May announced she had cabinet backing for her plan, but plunged the next morning when Brexit secretary Doninic Raab resigned. Elphicke claims that Raab had told the chief whip of his plans that night -- so shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t this information have been immediately released, as it was market sensitive? Carney points out that sterling volatility is already very high, showing that investors expect plenty of Brexit drama. He believes May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement was appropriate. Political resignations aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite the same as corporate ones, he continues. The important thing is that anyone who has inside knowledge of events (such as Raab\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans) don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trade on them. Q: Governor, do you still believe that a no-deal Brexit is unlikely? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out relatively soon, Mark Carney grins. He explains that the Bank has been preparing for such an outcome since June 2016, to protect financial stability. So even if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very low probability, the financial stability committee has been getting ready. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Andy Haldane, then warns that Brexit uncertainty is causing more economic damage. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are seeing somewhat greater impact, particularly on the behaviour of companies,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Haldane. That means growth will probably be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhat weaker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to the previous quarter (when growth rose to 0.6%). The Treasury committee begins the hearing by asking the Bank of England about Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s draft Brexit withdrawal agreement. Governor Mark Carney reminds MPs that the Bank has emphasised the important of a transition deal after Britain leaves the EU. He believes the withdrawal agreement would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153support economic outcomes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd -- central banker speak for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood for the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (at least compared to other outcomes...) Q: Will your advice to parliament (due next week) look at three scenarios -- the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal, no deal, and no Brexit? Carney says he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning to provide additional advice on the idea that Brexit will not happen. Instead, the Bank will examine the withdrawal agreement, versus a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 outcome. This assessment will include the political declaration on the likely eventual relationship between the UK and EU \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as far as it can\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the governor adds. Over in parliament, the Treasury Committee have begun quizzing the Bank of England. In the hot seats, we have: Dr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, Sir Jon Cunliffe, Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, Bank of England, Andy Haldane, Chief Economist and Executive Director, Monetary Analysis &amp; Statistics, Michael Saunders, Member of the Monetary Policy Committee, Bank of England Back in the UK, the Bank of England has announced it will publish its assessment of the monetary and financial effects of Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s draft withdrawal agreement for Brexit next week. This will give MPs the chance to read and digest the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views, before they vote on the deal. It will include a comparison with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal, no transition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd scenario. Given the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well-publicised views on Brexit, we can safely assume that it will conclude that May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal is better than a disorderly exit from the EU. The report, alongside the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest stress test, will be published on Wednesday November 28th. Carlos Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest is an early test of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new plea-bargaining system, brought in this year to target corporate wrong-doing. Under these rules, potential suspects can negotiate deals with prosecutors in exchange for information on another party. On Monday, Nissan explained that a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhistle-blower\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 had brought Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s misconduct to light, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give more details. According to the Asahi newspaper, this referred to a company employee gave prosecutors information on Ghosn in return for lighter treatment. Deutsche Bank analysts have warned there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high likelihood\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that Carlos Ghosn will lose his leadership role at Renault (where he is CEO and chairman), plus the chairmanships of Nissan and Mitsubishi. Forbes reports that Carlos Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ex-wife, Rita, has also weighed in: A scandal that brings down powerful people like Ghosn brings with it catcalls from people they have left in their wake. Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ex-wife, Rita Ghosn, posted this message to social media on Monday: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All narcissists are hypocrites. They pretend to have morals and values that they really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possess. Behind closed doors, they lie, insult, criticize, disrespect and abuse. They can do and say whatever they want, but how dare you say anything back to them or criticize them. They have a whole set of rules for others, but follow none of their own rules, and practice nothing of what they preach.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rita and Carlos Ghosn have four children, all now grown-up. Following the couple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s split, Carlos married his second wife Carole in 2016 - a union celebrated with a party at Versailles. My colleague Nils Pratley predicts that Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest will trigger an almighty battle between Japan and France for control of the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also struck by Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s willingness to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trash\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ghosn, as if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d already been found guilty in the courts.... They do corporate scandals differently in Japan. The downfall of Carlos Ghosn over alleged under-statement of income and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153numerous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd acts of misconduct was spectacular in its own right, but the accompanying press conference by Nissan chief executive Hiroto Saikawa was an event in itself. Saikawa did not merely report the allegations against his chairman, which is what you might expect on day one in equivalent circumstances at a European and US company. He also trashed Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legacy, criticised his decision-making and speculated as to how the alleged misdeeds could have happened. That content would normally be reserved for the full corporate post-mortem, or at least until the legal process had run its course. More here: More details of the allegations against Carlos Ghosn have emerged today. Public broadcaster NHK reported that Nissan paid \u00e2\u20ac\u0153huge sums\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to buy luxury houses for Ghosn in four cities around the globe. The properties, in Rio de Janeiro, Beirut, Paris and Amsterdam, were acquired \u00e2\u20ac\u0153without any legitimate business reason\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it claimed. NHK also reported that Ghosn received some compensation due to other executives (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear how this could have happened, though). More developments: Mitsubishi will hold a board meeting next week to decide whether to dismiss Ghosn as chairman. [reminder: Mitsubishi is partly owned by Nissan, making it the smallest member of Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auto alliance]. Newsflash: Renault says it will hold a board meeting later today to discuss the situation. Just in: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister has declared that Carlos Ghosn is no longer currently fit to lead Renault. Speaking on French radio, Bruno Le Maire also called for Renault to set up an interim management structure, following Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s detention in Japan. He told France Info Radio that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Carlos Ghosn is no longer in a position where he is capable of leading Renault.... Renault has been weakened, which make it all the more necessary to act quickly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Le Maire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention is significant as the French government owns a 15% sake in Renault. Le Maire also said he had asked French tax authorities to examine Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s affairs and that they had found nothing of particular note (thanks to Reuters for the quotes!) Renault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has dropped 3.3% at the start of trading in Paris, adding to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 8% slide. Traders are worried that its alliance with Nissan could be threatened by Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anticipated dismissal from the Japanese carmaker. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff has driven Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price down to its lowest level since July 2016. As you can see, it was already trading at a two-year low before Carlos Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock arrest: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Japanese carmaker Nissan is reeling today after its chairman Carlos Ghosn was dramatically detained by prosecutors for allegedly under-reporting his salary and misusing the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets. Shares in Nissan have plunged in heavy trading in Tokyo, ending down almost 5.5%, as the Japanese capital was gripped by Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dramatic fall from grace. This pulled the Nikkei down to a three-week low. Staff at Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s HQ in Yokohama are also in shock, after hearing that their board plans to dismiss Ghosn on Thursday for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious misconduct\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. At a gripping press conference late on Monday night, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa, laid into Ghosn, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel a strong sense of indignation and despair.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Astonishingly, Saikawa said he hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t decided whether Ghosn was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a charismatic figure or a tyrant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding critically: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have to say that this is a dark side of the Ghosn era which lasted for a long time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Earlier today, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prosecutors confirmed that they are investigating whether Ghosn and Representative Director Greg Kelly conspired to understate Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s compensation over five years starting in fiscal 2010 - as Nissan claim. The pair are accused of only reporting half of Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true salary, of almost 10 billion yen (\u00c2\u00a369m) over the period. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a shocking development, which threatens the whole future of the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance created and led by Ghosn over many years. Renault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares slumped to a three-year low on Monday, and may be under further pressure today. But the dramatic turn of events has also left some observers wondering if Ghosn is being unceremoniously shoved out of the door (and into the hands of the authorities) in a palace-style coup. Also coming up today MPs will be quizzing top officials from the Bank of England on the state of the UK economy this morning. Governor Mark Carney can also expect fresh questions about the Brexit negotiations, as Theresa May strives to get her draft deal past MPs. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets suspects Carney would rather not be probed about Brexit issues at such a sensitive time. At such a politically sensitive moment Bank of England Governor Mark Carney is probably cursing the fact that he will have to not only answer questions on the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outlook for the UK economy to the Treasury Select Committee later this morning, but he will also probably find himself dragged into the cross hairs of the current merits of the deal that the Prime Minister has cooked up with the EU, against the risks of leaving without a deal. His answers will inevitably invite scrutiny from both sides of the political divide.

That would make a no-deal Brexit more likely, with damaging consequences for the economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c reflected in the fall in the value of sterling. The pound dropped below $1.28 against the dollar while also losing value against the euro. Sterling is now worth about 14% less than it was on the eve of the EU referendum, having never recovered its peak in the last two years.</p> \n<h2>Brexit woes drag down the FTSE 100</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"ftse250\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;ftse250&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"ftse100\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;ftse100&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Although a weak pound is usually positive for the FTSE 100 because many firms in the index of the biggest UK companies earn the bulk of their profits abroad, the share index dropped in value last month. Analysts said concern over Brexit was acting as a drag on equities, amid fears that a no-deal scenario could trigger an economic shock. Global financial markets have also been rattled by fears over slowing growth in the US economy and higher interest rates, as well as the impact of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war with China. Technology stocks have sold off sharply, while there are also fears for the strength of the eurozone amid a standoff between Italy and the EU.

City economists had forecast a rise to 2.5% on the consumer prices index but a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/14/uk-inflation-steady-in-october-after-food-price-war\">price war on the high street</a>, especially among food retailers, drove down the cost of the weekly shop. The rate of inflation still remains above the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target set by the government.</p> \n<h2>Better than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Car exports boost international trade</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"trade\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;trade&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Car exports helped to narrow the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit in September to the lowest level in five years, almost entirely eliminating the gap between overall imports and exports to zero. City economists had forecast a deficit of about \u00c2\u00a31.5bn. <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/bulletins/uktrade/september2018\">Official figures</a> show that car exports to non-EU countries jumped by \u00c2\u00a31bn, while imports fell by \u00c2\u00a31.7bn, in the three months to September. Despite the weakness of the pound, which should help to boost demand for British goods, there are mounting worries for the future of UK trade as the world economy slows and Trump imposes trade barriers on China and the EU.</p> \n<h2>Worse than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Business surveys show stalling growth</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"pmi\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;pmi&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The risk of a disorderly Brexit and a slowdown in the world economy combined to act as a drag on business activity last month, in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/05/uk-services-growth-slows-brexit-new-car-sales\">disappointing start to the fourth quarter</a> for the UK economy. The latest monthly reading on the IHS Markit/Cips purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index showed that the services sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which includes retail, hotels and transport and makes up 80% of the economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c dropped to 52.2 from 53.9 on a scale where anything above 50 indicates expansion.

Although the unemployment rate still remains among the lowest since the mid-1970s, City economists had forecast the rate to stay unchanged at 4%. Pay growth did, however, rise at the fastest rate for almost a decade, in line with expectations. Employers are growing increasingly concerned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/13/workers-eastern-europe-uk-eu-employment-pay-growth\">skills shortages are holding back the economy</a>, amid the biggest fall in the number of workers from eastern Europe since modern records began.

Annual growth in sales volumes slowed to 2.2% from 3.3% in September.

                "bodyText":"Sterling slides after cabinet resignations The resignations of the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, and work and pensions secretary, Esther McVey, triggered a sharp sell-off for the pound, as City traders speculated that Theresa May would fail to get her Brexit deal through parliament. That would make a no-deal Brexit more likely, with damaging consequences for the economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c reflected in the fall in the value of sterling. The pound dropped below $1.28 against the dollar while also losing value against the euro. Sterling is now worth about 14% less than it was on the eve of the EU referendum, having never recovered its peak in the last two years. Brexit woes drag down the FTSE 100 Although a weak pound is usually positive for the FTSE 100 because many firms in the index of the biggest UK companies earn the bulk of their profits abroad, the share index dropped in value last month. Analysts said concern over Brexit was acting as a drag on equities, amid fears that a no-deal scenario could trigger an economic shock. Global financial markets have also been rattled by fears over slowing growth in the US economy and higher interest rates, as well as the impact of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war with China. Technology stocks have sold off sharply, while there are also fears for the strength of the eurozone amid a standoff between Italy and the EU. The FTSE 100 has dropped by more than 2% in the past month. Better than forecast Retail price war keeps inflation steady Inflation unexpectedly remained steady at 2.4% in October, despite expectations that the higher global oil price pushing up the cost of petrol would drive up the measure of the rising cost of living. City economists had forecast a rise to 2.5% on the consumer prices index but a price war on the high street, especially among food retailers, drove down the cost of the weekly shop. The rate of inflation still remains above the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target set by the government. Better than forecast Car exports boost international trade Car exports helped to narrow the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit in September to the lowest level in five years, almost entirely eliminating the gap between overall imports and exports to zero. City economists had forecast a deficit of about \u00c2\u00a31.5bn. Official figures show that car exports to non-EU countries jumped by \u00c2\u00a31bn, while imports fell by \u00c2\u00a31.7bn, in the three months to September. Despite the weakness of the pound, which should help to boost demand for British goods, there are mounting worries for the future of UK trade as the world economy slows and Trump imposes trade barriers on China and the EU. Worse than forecast Business surveys show stalling growth The risk of a disorderly Brexit and a slowdown in the world economy combined to act as a drag on business activity last month, in a disappointing start to the fourth quarter for the UK economy. The latest monthly reading on the IHS Markit/Cips purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index showed that the services sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which includes retail, hotels and transport and makes up 80% of the economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c dropped to 52.2 from 53.9 on a scale where anything above 50 indicates expansion. Economists forecast that GDP growth will slow to 0.2% in the final quarter of the year from 0.6% in the third quarter. Worse than forecast Unemployment unexpectedly rises Unemployment unexpectedly rose in the three months to September from the same period a year ago, edging higher to 4.1%, as slowing job creation failed to keep up with a rising number of jobseekers in Britain. Although the unemployment rate still remains among the lowest since the mid-1970s, City economists had forecast the rate to stay unchanged at 4%. Pay growth did, however, rise at the fastest rate for almost a decade, in line with expectations. Employers are growing increasingly concerned that skills shortages are holding back the economy, amid the biggest fall in the number of workers from eastern Europe since modern records began. The figures showed that the number of workers from the EU in Britain dropped by 132,000 in the past year. Worse than forecast Retail sales drop as high street suffers Retail sales dropped in October, compounding the problems facing the high street as major retailers close stores across the country to shore up profits. Sales dropped by 0.5% from September, missing City economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts for a rise of 0.2%. Annual growth in sales volumes slowed to 2.2% from 3.3% in September. Analysts said shoppers reined in their spending after a bumper summer spree, while consumers held off winter clothing purchases due to mild weather. Worse than forecast Public finances deteriorate after Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgamble\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 After the IFS thinktank accused Philip Hammond of taking a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gamble\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the future strength of the public finances in last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn budget, the latest figures showed a bigger than expected budget deficit in October.

Analysts said the latest figures suggest the chancellor may now miss his tax and spending targets set by the Office for Budget Responsibility for the current financial year, while warning that a no-deal Brexit could further damage the public finances. Worse than forecast Property market hits weakest level in six years The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market fell to the weakest level since September 2012 last month, with prices flat or falling across half of Britain according to the latest snapshot from the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official surveyors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 body.

This is a crucial factor when you consider that the bumper budget intended to stimulate the economy will require increased government borrowing. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite the nervousness this stand-off may cause in financial markets, it is worth remembering that the European Commission has these controls and governance capabilities over member states for a reason. At the height of the European sovereign debt crisis 24 countries were under Excessive deficit procedures, a burden which France, for instance, has only just been able to shake off. While it is a surprise that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve reached this impasse, the European Commission is ultimately just delivering on its mandate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5bf5519ce4b07e5fcd49f1da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-11-21T12:40:57.809Z\">12.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"baf643c976532df2e27cbbaba0282d8c4758e390\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/baf643c976532df2e27cbbaba0282d8c4758e390/0_0_3948_2632/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tiziana Fabi/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The head of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition government, prime minister Giuseppe Conte, has hit back.</strong></p> <p>Conte insists that his country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excellent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd budget should go ahead, and hope to persuade the EC of his case this weekend.</p> <p>Reuters has the details:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Italian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excellent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and in the interests of both Italy and Europe, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Wednesday.</p> <p>Earlier in the day the European Commission took its first step towards disciplining Italy over the budget, setting up a confrontation that could last months and eventually lead to fines. </p> <p>Conte reiterated he would hold talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Saturday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Obviously during the course of the conversation we will finally have the chance to talk in detail and fully explain this budget,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5bf54827e4b0772932e24410\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-11-21T12:31:46.993Z\">12.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Analyst <strong>Emanuele Canegrati</strong> of City trading firm<strong> <a href=\"https://bpprime.com/\">BP Prime</a></strong> says the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling is blow to Italy (although not an unexpected one...) </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ECanegrati_BPPr/status/1065198333273214976\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EU_Commission?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@EU_Commission</a> just rejected Italy&#39;s 2019 budget law and made the first step to open the procedure for excessive debt.

Government borrowing of \u00c2\u00a38.8bn last month (consensus \u00c2\u00a36.2bn, CE \u00c2\u00a37.0bn) was up from \u00c2\u00a37.2bn in the same month last year and marked the largest October deficit for three years.

The expectation that a Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbounce\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 would deliver a spike in business and investment following an agreed deal gave the Chancellor the room to put off the hard decision on putting up taxes.

Brexit is still doing the rounds in the news, but traders are unlikely to take any notice until there are new developments. The autumn of volatility continues. European stock markets have closed higher tonight, recovering Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses, but doing little to help traders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 blood pressure. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has gained 102 points or 1.5% to 7050, while Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB jumped 1.4%. Trade wars, Brexit and the Italian budget row remain unsolved, of course, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not weighing on stocks quite as heavily. Bart Hordijk, Market Analyst at Monex Europe, suspects the Italian budget row will bubble on into 2019: \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdThe fact that there are no easy compromises for both parties involved is for us an indicator that this conflict will continue to simmer in the background for the coming months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A mass of US economic data has landed on the markets, ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Thanksgiving break. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just learned that: US home sales rose slightly in October, by 1.4%. That end a six-month run of declines, but the annual rate (5.22m per year) is still lower than this time last year. Orders for durable goods sank by 4.4% in October, the biggest drop since July 2017. It was mainly due to weaker demand for aircraft (a volatile factor) The number of Americans signing on for unemployment benefit rose to 224,000 last week, a four-month high (but still low in historical terms) US consumer confidence has dropped; the University of Michigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s morale index fell to 97.5 this month, down from 98.3, and weaker than expected. All in all, a fairly underwhelming picture. DING DING! Trading is underway in New York, as traders return to the fray after Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turmoil. And shares are rising in early trading; the Dow has gained 160 points or 0.6% to 24,625 points. That takes a small chunk out of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 550-point tumble. Technology shares are among the risers, with Apple up 1.5%. It could be a calmer session, as traders get ready for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Thanksgiving festivities. A top bond expert reckons there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small chance that Italy ends up defaulting on its debts. PIMCO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief investment officer for global fixed income, Andrew Balls (brother of former-politician-and-occasional-dancer Ed) also suggested that Rome could issue a parallel currency, or even return to the lira. Reuters has more details: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Italian sovereign default is unlikely but it is not a zero probability. The more plausible scenario is a combination of issuing a parallel currency or even redenomination,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Balls said at a conference in London. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153California issued a parallel currency in 2008 so if it could happen there it is not obvious it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen in Italy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Short-term Italian debt is also strengthening, presumably on hopes of an eventual resolution between Italy and Brussels. If Italy refuses to cut its spending plans, it could ultimately be fined 0.5% of its GDP. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of a long process, though, as this chart shows: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP in 2017 was around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.7trillion, so a fine could reach almost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8bn. Readers may well wonder how that would improve Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal position. Deputy PM Matteo Salvini has declared he is ready to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153confront Juncker, Moscovici or whoever\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget plans. The leader of the right-wing League party defended the proposals, saying they would deliver growth, and thus eventually cut Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mountain of debt. Salvini says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Over five years the debt increased by \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300 billion on the basis of budgets that some applauded. If the country doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t grow, then the debt goes up, if it grows, it goes down.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He also called on Europe to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153respect the Italian people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding on Twitter: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6since we pay at least 5 billion more than what comes back. Job rights, healthcare and education rights, less taxes and more security: we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re moving forward!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meanwhile, Antonio Tajani, president of the European parliament and vice-president of Forza Italia, the centre-right party led by Silvio Berlusconi, Salvin\u00c3\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition partner before general elections in March, said he is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very worried\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment of the budget. Tajani says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In addition to violating the rules, the budget does not stimulate growth or investment. We are isolated, the spread [between German and Italian bonds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122] is firmly above 300 points, the stock exchange is at its lowest since 2016, we have already lost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300 billion, and the mistrust among entrepreneurs is growing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little reaction to the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rejection of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget in the markets. Italian bonds are holding onto their earlier gains (driven by hopes of a compromise), meaning 10-year debt is trading at a yield of 3.52% (from 3.6%). Hinesh Patel, portfolio manager at Quilter Investors, says investors expect a reconciliation: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In some respects this is a win for the populists, who will use this decision to fuel criticism of the EU policymakers they cast as the enemy of the Italian electorate. But Italy is at risk of divorcing itself from economic realities if it presses ahead despite this ruling from the European Commission. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The immediate reaction from markets suggests that reconciliation is expected. Although Italian bond yields have been increasing for several months, a clear signal that the bond market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confidence in Italy is fragile. The result is that the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to borrow diminishes and the credit they can obtain comes at a higher cost. This is a crucial factor when you consider that the bumper budget intended to stimulate the economy will require increased government borrowing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite the nervousness this stand-off may cause in financial markets, it is worth remembering that the European Commission has these controls and governance capabilities over member states for a reason. At the height of the European sovereign debt crisis 24 countries were under Excessive deficit procedures, a burden which France, for instance, has only just been able to shake off. While it is a surprise that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve reached this impasse, the European Commission is ultimately just delivering on its mandate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The head of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition government, prime minister Giuseppe Conte, has hit back. Conte insists that his country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excellent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd budget should go ahead, and hope to persuade the EC of his case this weekend. Reuters has the details: The Italian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excellent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and in the interests of both Italy and Europe, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Wednesday. Earlier in the day the European Commission took its first step towards disciplining Italy over the budget, setting up a confrontation that could last months and eventually lead to fines. Conte reiterated he would hold talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Saturday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Obviously during the course of the conversation we will finally have the chance to talk in detail and fully explain this budget,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Analyst Emanuele Canegrati of City trading firm BP Prime says the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling is blow to Italy (although not an unexpected one...) Danske Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Aila Mihr points out that European ministers will have their say next month: The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mehreen Khan reckons the EC pulled its punches today, and any knock-out blow probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come for some months: EC Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis has told reporters in Brussels that the Commission had no choice... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With regret, that today we confirm our assessment that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s draft budget plan is in particularly serious non-compliance with the Council recommendation of 13 July.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We conclude that the opening of a procedure for excessive deficit based on the debt is thus warranted.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European commissioner Pierre Moscovici says the door is still open for Italy to change it budget plans to meet EC rules.... NEWSFLASH: The European Commission has again rejected Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s draft budget for 2019. In an escalation of the row between Brussels and Rome, the EC has ruled that Rome has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seriously violated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd debt rules, and will begin disciplinary procedures. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s populist government has refused to succumb to pressure to change its deficit target of 2.4% of GDP as it seeks to move forward with election campaign promises, such as introducing a universal basic income, cutting taxes and lowering the retirement age. In response to the news of disciplinary action, Matteo Salvini, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy prime minister and leader of the far-right League, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A letter from the EU? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m also waiting for one from Father Christmas.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More details and reaction to follow... Despite October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rising deficit, the UK government argues that the public finances are on a firmer footing: A HM Treasury spokesperson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is our best year-to-date borrowing performance since 2005, thanks to people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard work and the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s careful management of the public finances Our balanced approach is getting debt falling while supporting our vital public services, keeping taxes low, and investing in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More retail pain: Furniture group Ikea has said 350 UK jobs are at risk, as part of a shake-up of its global business. In total, Ikea is planning to shed 7,500 jobs world wide, as it strives for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a greater focus on adding value to its customers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But....Ikea is also planning to create 11,500 new jobs in the next few years - by opening 30 new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153touchpoint\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ikea stores in city centres, and by investing in its digital and logistics operations. The OECD has also weighed in on Brexit, by backing Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s draft withdrawal agreement. It has also called for Britain to force \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the closest possible relationship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the EU after the divorce - something Theresa May will be discussing with EC president Juncker tonight. America and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war has force the OECD thinktank to slash its forecasts for global growth. The OECD now believes the world economy will only grow by 3.5% in 2019, down from a previous forecast of 3.7%. Much of the blame is being pinned on the tit-for-tat tariffs on US and Chinese trade, and the threat of more being imposed next year. The OECD believes the world economy is now heading for a soft landing, but an escalated trade war could turn it into a hard one. As Laurence Boone, the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not talking about a plateau [of growth] any more, but a slowdown.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details: Matt Whittaker of the Resolution Foundation has dug into today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances, and shows how the UK is making little impact on its debt mountain: The jump in UK borrowing last month may show that the government is, as promised, easing the chains of austerity (a little), as the economy slows. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, explains: Public borrowing in October 2018 was \u00c2\u00a31.6 billion higher than in October 2017, reflecting rapid growth in government spending last month but only a modest rise in tax receipts. This is consistent with indications from business surveys and the latest retail sales data that the economy slowed markedly as we moved into the autumn, due in large part to increased uncertainty around Brexit. The rise in UK borrowing last month will worry chancellor Philip Hammond, says Andrew Wishart of Capital Economics. He writes: The first public finances figures released since the Budget bucked the recent trend of improvement. Government borrowing of \u00c2\u00a38.8bn last month (consensus \u00c2\u00a36.2bn, CE \u00c2\u00a37.0bn) was up from \u00c2\u00a37.2bn in the same month last year and marked the largest October deficit for three years. The increase in borrowing compared to last year was due to a \u00c2\u00a32.2bn rise in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153other\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (most likely departmental) spending. This leaves borrowing in the fiscal year to date down by 30% compared to last year. While this is still the lowest since 2005, it is above the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s October Budget forecast for a 36% reduction over the year as a whole. This could be a worrying sign for the Chancellor. If this trend continues, the giveaways in the October Budget could see him breach his near-term fiscal targets. And if there is a no deal Brexit, the resulting economic slowdown would probably cause the public finances to deteriorate further. Admittedly, this could be offset to some extent by the UK not paying part of the financial settlement. Ross Campbell, ICAEW Public Sector Director, points out that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances depend on a good Brexit deal: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the most recent Budget, the Chancellor pledged further investments into the NHS, roads and schools, and again loosened his target for deficit reduction. It looks like Hammond and May have bet on a positive outcome from Brexit, assuming a deal would be struck and pass parliament. The expectation that a Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbounce\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 would deliver a spike in business and investment following an agreed deal gave the Chancellor the room to put off the hard decision on putting up taxes. With no clear support in Parliament for the deal, this is a high risk strategy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to remember that if the Government is not able to get its deal with the EU through parliament then all such bets are off. In his budget speech, the Chancellor admitted as much. If the deal doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get through then even if negotiations continue, it is more than likely that the budget will need to be revisited.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Economist Philip Shaw of Investec says the big picture is that UK public finance are improving, despite October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stumble. The surprise jump in UK borrowing last month erodes some of the year-on-year improvement in the public finances: However, the government is still on track to borrow less in 2018-19 than in 2017-28. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit swelled to \u00c2\u00a38.8bn last month because the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s income didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep pace with spending. The Office for National Statistics explains: Central government receipts in October 2018 increased by 1.2% compared with October 2017, to \u00c2\u00a359.9 billion; while total expenditure increased by 7.7% to \u00c2\u00a365.4 billion. Much of this annual growth in central government receipts in October 2018 came from Value Added Tax (VAT), Income Tax and tobacco duties; while interest and dividend receipts (largely dividend transfers from the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund) (BEAPFF) have fallen on October 2017. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ran up a much larger budget deficit than expected last month. The UK borrowed \u00c2\u00a38.8bn last month, \u00c2\u00a31.6bn more than in October 2017. This is the highest October borrowing for three years. On a happier note, Britain has borrowed \u00c2\u00a326.7bn in the current financial year-to-date, \u00c2\u00a311.2 billion less than in the same period in 2017. This is the lowest annual deficit at this stage of the year since 2005. More to follow... European stock markets are clawing their way back from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. The main indices are all higher, partly due to hopes of detente between Rome and Brussels over the Italian budget. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excitement in the bond markets this morning, following reports that Italy might compromise over its 2019 budget plans. According to the La Stampa newspaper, deputy PM Matteo Salvini could be open to revising its budget, by cutting planned spending on a new basic income scheme, and unwinding a pension reform. If so, that might help ward off a clash with the European Commission, which will give its judgment on the Italian budget later today (possibly 11am GMT). However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear if Italy is actually prepare to lower its planed deficit from 2.4% of GDP, or accept that its growth forecasts may be too optimistic. Still, bond traders are hopeful - the yield (or interest rate) on Italian 10-year debt has dropped from 3.6% to 3.51%. That shows they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seen as a safer option today. Despite Kevin Hassett\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax policies are working, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit with China has actually grown this year. The gap hit $375bn in 2017, and is on rack to exceed this level in 2018 thanks to rollicking imports of China-made technology, electrical equipment, machinery and clothes. Analysts at JP Morgan have warned that the US-China trade war will hurt economic growth. They told clients: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We forecast that the US imposes an additional 25% tariff on virtually all goods imports from China early next year. This will drag materially on activity in China and could accelerate the decline in global business confidence now underway.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One of President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic advisers has suggested there could be a case for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153evicting China\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Kevin Hassett, chairman of the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Council of Economic Advisers, told the BBC that China had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153misbehaved\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as a member of the WTO, claiming: We never really envisioned that a country would enter the WTO and then behave the way that China has. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new thing for the WTO to have a member that is misbehaving so much. He also claimed that the WTO was failing the US, as it takes so long to rule on trade disputes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it takes five or six years and then the damage is done\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Hassett also claimed that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardball strategy on international trade is working. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s questionable, when the US Trade Representative has ruled that China hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change its policies.... Hopes of a ceasefire in the US-China trade wars are fading today, after America launched a fresh salvo of criticism at Beijing. In a new report, US Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer rules that China has not changed its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unfair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unreasonable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd practices, despite pressure from America and the imposition of tariffs on $250bn of Chinese sales to the US. The move raises tensions ahead of the G20 meeting of world leaders later this month, where presidents Trump and Xi are expected to discuss the issue. Lighthizer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments came in an update of the U.S. Trade Representative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Section 301\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd investigation into China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intellectual property and technology transfer policies. The USTR declared that China had not responded \u00e2\u20ac\u0153constructively\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the initial section 301 reports. In particular, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unhappy that the Chinese government has persisted in using foreign investment restrictions to push US companies to share technology and intellectual property with Chinese entities. Lighthizer says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We completed this update as part of this Administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strengthened monitoring and enforcement effort. This update shows that China has not fundamentally altered its unfair, unreasonable, and market-distorting practices that were the subject of the March 2018 report on our Section 301 investigation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global markets are extremely edgy today, as investors fret about global growth prospects, the US-China trade war, Brexit, and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s row with the EU over its budget plans. Last night, Wall Street suffered one of its shakiest days of the year. The Dow Jones industrial average slumped by 551 points, or 2.2%, to 24,465 points, wiping out its gains for 2018. Technology shares continued their recent losses, with Apple shedding almost 5%. But other sectors also suffered, with retailers Target and Lowe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s both disappointing investors with their latest results. This followed a rough day in Europe, which saw Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX hit a new 52-week low. Economic growth fears also savaged the oil price on Tuesday, sending crude sliding by over 6%. The trading floor chatter is that the long bull market may be fizzling out. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA says: Another troubling start to the week in financial markets is further denting investor sentiment as we approach the open on Wednesday, with futures currently stable but vulnerable to another tumble. US tech stocks are once again leading the way, plunging on the back of a combination of individual concerns \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Apple iPhone sales for example \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and general weaker risk appetite. The FAANG stocks extraordinary performance in the first half of the year has put them front and centre once the market turned and some now find themselves in negative territory for 2018, with others not far behind. While many would argue a correction has been on the cards for some time due to the growing list of risks to the outlook, be that rising US interest rates, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aggressive trade agenda, Brexit, Italy or one of a number of other headwinds, how bad it will get is difficult to say. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re already near the October lows and in correction territory, even close to bear market in some cases such as the DAX, if this is just a corrective move, I would expect investors to start eyeing up some bargains soon. Also coming up today There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lots in the economic calendar, particularly from America as they clear the decks before Thanksgiving. New home sales and durable goods orders will give a picture of the strength of the US economy. City traders will scrutinise the latest UK public finance figures to see if the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal plans are on track. However, that will be overshadowed by Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trip to Brussels to discuss the Brexit deal with Jean-Claude Juncker. In the eurozone, the Commission is expected to confirm that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t acceptable. That paves the way for the EC to launch an excessive deficit procedure which could lead to Italy being fined (although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a long process). The agenda: 9.30am GMT: UK public finances for October 10am GMT: OECD releases its latest economic outlook 1.30pm GMT: US durable goods orders and weekly jobless figures 3pm GMT: US home sales, Michigan sentiment survey 3.30pm GMT: US oil inventory figures",

                "bodyText":"It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a good day across European stock markets, despite the waves of political risk out there. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB has closed 2.7% higher, as the suggestions from Rome that it could compromise over its budget reassured traders (even though they were rather vague hints). In London, the FTSE 100 ended 83 points higher at 7,036, a gain of 1.2%. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says a dollop of Brexit optimism helped UK shares rise. Optimism was the name of the game in trading on Monday as the FTSE joined its European peers rallying higher. As shoppers were taking advantage of Cyber Monday discounts, bargain hunters were also scouring global markets. On the FTSE, rebounding oil prices, boosting oil majors and a strong showing from financials overshadowed a drop in base metal prices dragging on the miners. Banks put in a noticeably strong performance with the likes of HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays dominating the upper reaches of the FTSE. Banks surged thanks to a double whammy of Brexit optimism, following the signing off the Brexit deal by EU leaders, and the spill over effect from Italy potentially avoiding disciplinary procedures from Brussels. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX gained 1.5%, while the French CAC rose by 1%. Italian bonds have also strengthened, as Capital Economics explains: Markets have responded positively to conciliatory comments from Italian government officials over the weekend and on Monday which suggest that the government might change its budget deficit target for 2019. On Monday, the ten-year government bond yield in Italy fell by around 20 basis points from its close on Friday, leaving it just above 3.2%. The spread to German Bunds fell below 300 basis points, to its lowest level in around two weeks. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. GW Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the GM job cuts, which are deeper than I first suggested: Shares in GM have jumped 5% as Wall Street welcomes its plan to close factories and cut jobs. Back at the European Parliament, Mario Draghi has urged MEPs to learn the lessons of the last eurozone crisis: The US car industry has been hit with a blow - General Motors is cutting over 5,000 jobs, and closing three factories. Bad news for workers, and hardly a sign that Donald Trump is bringing jobs back to America.... The Detroit Free Press has details: General Motors will close three assembly plants by the end of 2019, it said Thursday, including Detroit-Hamtramck, Lordstown in Ohio and Oshawa in Ontario. Approximately 5,600 jobs are at stake: roughly 1,500 in Hamtramck; 1,600 in Lordstown; and about 2,500 in Oshawa. The Hamtramck plant makes the Chevrolet Volt and Impala, the Cadillac CT6 and the Buick LaCrosse. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153GM is continuing to take proactive steps to improve overall business performance, including the reorganization of its global product development staffs, the realignment of its manufacturing capacity and a reduction of salaried workforce,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the company said in a news release Monday. Over in New York, shares have opened higher after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s truncated sessions (due to Thanksgiving). The Dow has gained 1.3%, or over 300 points, in early trading. I think we can read between the lines here.... Mario Draghi has also called for eurozone government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to respect the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccommon rules\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an unsubtle hint to Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government to adjust its 2019 budget, to avoid breaching EC deficit targets. Newsflash: the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central bank has warned that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is slowing. Testifying to MEPs, Mario Draghi, president of the ECB, flagged up that recent data have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhat weaker than expected\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [reminder: growth in the eurozone has slowed to just 0.2%]. He is pinning some of the blame on trade conflicts, a hint that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on European steel, and his clashes with China, are hurting the global economy. Draghi also blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some country and sector-specific factors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd -- which probably includes the slowdown in Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car sector following new emission tests. The ECB chief isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panicking though; he argues that such as slowdown is to be expected, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is good reason to be confident that underlying inflation will gradually rise in the period ahead. Recent developments confirm the Governing Council\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier assessments of the medium-term inflation outlook.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not heard anything from Carlos Ghosn since he was arrested a week ago after landing in Japan. But these photos give a glimpse of life at the Tokyo Detention Center where he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spent the last week, being questioned about claims he misused Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s funds and deliberately under-reported his salary to the Tokyo stock exchanges. Newsflash: Israel has raised interest rates, for the first time since 2011. We have some grim, but unsurprising news for UK workers -- they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve suffered the weakest real wage growth of any advanced economy in the last decade. According to the International Labour Organization, Britain ranked bottom of a group of nine wealthy nations for its pay performance since 2009. Real wages (stripping out the impact of inflation) have shrunk by 5% in the UK since the financial crisis. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slightly worse than Italy and far behind other major G20 nations such as the US and Germany. South Korea had the strongest real wage growth at 15%. Carlos Ghosn was a uniquely powerful business chief - chairing three car companies under the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance. Indeed, he was hailed as a popular hero in Japan before his arrest last week. Professor Konstantinos Stathopoulos, professor of accounting and finance at Alliance Manchester Business School, says this shows the perils of putting too much faith in a single leader: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mitsubishi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move to dismiss Carlos Ghosn as chairman is the result of another significant corporate governance failure under the watch of a super boss. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It follows his arrest and subsequent firing as chairman of Nissan and raises important questions over board oversight in companies that operate across different jurisdictions and, importantly, use unconventional corporate structures. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure is one in a number of high-profile business leaders who have been removed from their positions in recent months. But this idea of the super boss won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go away any time soon, since it serves \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and is fuelled by \u00e2\u20ac\u201c societal norms rather than corporate needs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Shareholders are likely to have a good understanding of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153true\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd value of a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boss, but as a society we seem to prefer associating failures or successes to individuals, rather than the business as a whole. The hero and villain stories will always be more appealing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in the UK, the search for the face of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new \u00c2\u00a350 note has moved forwards (a little). The Bank of England has released a lengthy list of suggestions from the public, since it invited nominations for a worthy, deceased scientist. Some famous names are on the list -- from Ada Lovelace and Alan Turing (the godparents of modern computing) to Francis Crick and Rosalind Franklin (who cracked the structure of DNA). Physicist James Clerk Maxwell, chemist Dorothy Hodgkin and engineers Isambard Kingdom Brunel and John Logie Baird are also on the list. So are some more obscure names, and a few remarkable ones -- including Margaret Thatcher (who studied under Hodgkin and worked as a chemist before making more of a splash in politics) and comedy actor Will Hay (who was a successful amateur astronomer when not entertaining the public with classics like Oh! Mr Porter) You can still nominate worthy candidates here. While Mitsubishi was meeting to dismiss Carlos Ghosn, Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new interim chairman was updating staff on the situation. Hiroto Saikawa told employees in Japan, and around the globe, that he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shocked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at his former mentor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged misconduct. AFP has more details: At a 45-minute meeting attended by hundreds of staff at the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Yokohama HQ and broadcast internally to other sites, Saikawa stressed that the scandal should not affect day-to-day operations. Saikawa, who rose through the Nissan ranks under Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wing, has already spoken of his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great resentment and dismay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the allegations. According to Japanese media, Nissan formed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153secret\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd cell within the firm to look into the alleged financial misdeeds. Christian Stadler, professor of strategic management at Warwick Business School, has predicted that more heads may roll... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is not surprising that Mitsubishi has followed Nissan in sacking Carlos Ghosn, he may not be the only person to lose his job over this scandal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It will be interesting to see whether any Nissan executives are forced to resign as well. It seems implausible that they did not know about his incredibly lucrative financial arrangements. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The executives probably know this could jeopardise their own positions. Therefore I am inclined to think it was not them who exposed Mr Ghosn, despite speculation that the leak was an attempt to get rid of him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A more plausible interpretation is that Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement of shock was an attempt to protect himself after being surprised that this became such a scandal.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mitsubishi have released a statement to the Tokyo stock market, confirming that Carlos Ghosn has been dismissed as chairman. They say that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it is considered difficult\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Ghosn to do the job, following the allegations of financial misconduct at Nissan. Ghosn retains a seat on Mitsubishi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board, though -- as only a shareholder vote can remove a serving board member. Losing two chairmanships in a week is bad enough, but Carlos Ghosn also face the possibility of a decade behind bars -- IF the allegations of financial misconduct are proved in court. Our Japan correspondent Justin McCurry explains: Carlos Ghosn has been sacked as chairman of Mitsubishi Motors, a week after the disgraced auto tycoon was arrested over allegations that he underreported his income by millions of dollars \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a crime that carries a possible 10-year prison sentence. Seven of the eight members of the board of Mitsubishi, part of an industry alliance created by Ghosn that also includes Renault, held an extraordinary meeting on Monday to decide his fate, days after Nissan sacked him as chairman. Ghosn, who allegedly also abused company assets for personal use, remains in detention in Tokyo but has reportedly denied the allegations, according to Japanese media. Mitsubishi said its chief executive, Osamu Masuko, will become temporary chairman. Ghosn, 64, was once hailed as a visionary after saving Nissan from bankruptcy in 1990s by spearheading its alliance with Renault. Nissan then took a 34% stake in Mitsubishi, which employs more than 30,000 people, in 2016. The group grew to be the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top-selling car company, with some 10.6m vehicles rolling off the production line last year. It employs about 450,000 people worldwide. While Nissan vowed to retain its ties to Renault, reports in Japan claimed Nissan executives were disturbed by Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to turn the alliance into a full-blown merger. More here: Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case is an early test of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new corporate whistle-blowing laws. These laws are meant to make it easier to tackle crimes such as tax evasion and bribery, by offering more lenient sentences to insiders who report such crimes. But there are already concerns over Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest, as Magdalena Osumi of The Japan Times reports: Nobuo Gohara, a former prosecutor and now lawyer at Gohara Compliance and Law Office in Tokyo, believes the legal grounds for Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest are murky. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a common procedure for prosecutors to collect enough hard evidence and consult with legal authorities, but this time around it was not clear what the hidden payment was,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gohara said at a news conference at the Foreign Correspondents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Club of Japan in Tokyo. He called the investigation that led to Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest \u00e2\u20ac\u0153violent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153haphazardly done.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Associated Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dismissal from Mitsubishi today: The board of Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motors, which is allied with Renault and Nissan, voted Monday to dismiss Carlos Ghosn as its chairman after his arrest last week, citing a lack of trust. Prosecutors arrested Ghosn on Nov. 19 on suspicion of under-reporting his income by $44 million over five years. Nissan Motor Co. ousted him as its chairman last week, saying an internal investigation found Ghosn abused company money and assets. Mitsubishi said its current CEO, Osamu Masuko, will serve as both acting chairman and CEO pending a general shareholders meeting. It said Ghosn had lost the trust of Nissan and would find it difficult to continue to act as chairman. Masuko told reporters the board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision was unanimous. Seven of Mitsubishi Motors Corp.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eight-member board attended Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, the company said. Motoko Rich of the New York Times points out that Carlos Ghosn hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually been charged by the authorities, after a week of questioning. Journalists Peter Hoskins flags up that Ghosn still has one job left - chair and CEO of Renault. Over the weekend, more allegations of financial misconduct by Carlos Ghosn appeared in the newspapers. Insiders claimed that Nissan had made donations to a foreign university attended by one of his daughters, and also funded family trips. There are also claims that Nissan paid for several luxury homes around the world for their former chairman, who is also accused of misstating his salary by 5 billion yen (\u00c2\u00a334m) over several years. Ghosn insists that he is innocent. Japanese newspaper The Mainichi explains: Ghosn has been telling investigators that he did not commit any wrongdoing. His close aide Greg Kelly, who is also under arrest in the same case, has told an individual who met him in detention that Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153executive remuneration was properly listed in the financial statements\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd submitted to the authorities. Kelly is also quoted as saying that he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153did not receive illicit instructions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from Ghosn, according to those related to the case. Mitsubishi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO (and new interim chairman) Osamu Masuko has told reporters that sacking Ghosn was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an agonising decision,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but a necessary one to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153protect the company\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The decision to remove Ghosn from the chairmanship was unanimous, Mitsubishi says. Newsflash: Japanese automaker Mitsubishi has sacked chairman Carlos Ghosn, a week after the car magnate was arrested over allegations of financial misconduct. Mitsubishi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board acted four days after Nissan also voted to remove Ghosn, who is accused of misusing company funds and under-declaring his salary. Ghosn, who is currently locked up in a Tokyo detention centre, became Mitsubishi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman two years ago when he added the company to his Nissan-Renault alliance. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 early take: Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ouster marks the end of his chairmanship of Japanese automakers, just two years after he was praised for bringing a steadying hand to Mitsubishi Motors following a cheating scandal in 2016. CEO Osamu Masuko will become temporary chairman, the automaker said. The move comes amid discontent over French partner Renault SA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in the 19-year alliance of which Ghosn was the driving force. Sealed in 1999 when Nissan was rescued from near-bankruptcy, it was enlarged in 2016 to include Mitsubishi and enabled the members to jointly develop products and control costs. The alliance vies with Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp for the ranking of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest automaker. More to follow! Just in: German business morale has fallen again, for the third month running. IFO, the Munich-based thinktank, reports that its business morale index dropped to 102.0, from 102.9 in October, and lower than expected. IFO chief Clemens Fuest warned that storm clouds are gathering: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sentiment among German businesses weakened further this month. Companies scaled back their assessments of the current business situation albeit from a high level. Their business expectations also clouded over.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd IFO also fears that the German economy could be facing an economic turnaround, having contracted by 0.2% in the last quarter... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of a Brexit Bounce in the City this morning, after EU leaders signed off the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal agreement yesterday. The pound is still bobbing in the $1.28 zone against the US dollar, as traders ponder whether Britain will avoid crashing out of the block without a deal in four months time. With the parliamentary maths still against Theresa May, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear what will happen if MPs reject the proposal later this month. Some analysts expect a second vote, remembering the row over America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s TARP bailout programme a decade ago. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, has argued this morning that the process could be extended - giving more time to negotiate a new deal. But with EU leaders insisting yesterday that no other deal is possible, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much to cheer investors this morning. Shorter-dated Italian government debt are strengthening sharply this morning. The yield (or interest rate) on Italian two-year bonds has fallen to 0.7%, from 0.95% on Friday. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big move, suggesting Italy is seen as a less-risky investment. European stock markets are roaring back! Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB has jumped by 3%, following Matteo Salvini\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conciliatory comments on the budget, led by financial stocks. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 75 points, or over 1%, to 7026 points. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says investors are cheered by the prospect that relations between Italy and the EU are thawing. Comments from Italian deputy PM Matteo Salvini on Sunday, hinting that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s controversial 2.4% budget deficit could be lowered, came after reports of a meeting between Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Saturday night. These signs of progress were like catnip for good news-hungry investors, explaining the over-sized reaction of the European indices. A junior Italian government minister has also hinted that the 2019 budget could be tweaked, to address Brussels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 concerns. Armando Siri, a transport ministry undersecretary, told the Il Messaggero newspaper that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In order to save the budget and avoid an increase in market turbulence ... a small fine-tuning (of the deficit target) could be considered,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Italian banking shares have surged by almost 5% in early trading, as relief ripples through trading floors in Milan. Italian bonds are rallying this morning, on hopes of a breakthrough in the long-running budget battle with Brussels. Yesterday, deputy PM Matteo Salvini appeared to signal that Rome could lower its borrowing targets, which would calm the storm with the EU. The comments came just days after the EU again rejected Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget, over plans to run a 2.4% deficit to meet its government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending promises. Salvini hinted that there is room to negotiate, telling newswire AdnKronos: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think nobody is fixated on this, if there is a budget which makes the country grow, it could be 2.2 percent or 2.6 percent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Clearly a 2.6% deficit would only prompt more ire from Brussels! But the idea that the deficit could be trimmed is cheering investors. This has driven the yield on Italian 10-year bonds down to just 3.2%, a two-month low, and narrowing the spread with German debt: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Political drama is looming over the financial markets again, as traders watch events from Westminster to the Crimean sea. The news that EU leaders have backed Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit deal isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t giving the pound a lift. Sterling is bobbing around the $1.28 mark, where it ended last week, as investors ponder whether the agreement can possibly get through parliament. As David Madden of CMC Markets says: Theresa May has a difficult task ahead of her as she has to sell the withdrawal agreement to her own party. The EU over the weekend made it very clear that it is a take it or leave it situation in relation to the deal. Prime Minister May will struggle to get fellow Conservatives to support her as many pro-Brexit and anti-Brexit MPs don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the deal she struck. There are questions about what would happen in the event of the deal being voted down \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it would open up the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. Investors are also concerned by the latest military tensions between Moscow and Kiev. Last night, Russia fired at several Ukrainian ships and captures three vessels off the coast of Crimea. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest clash since the invasion of Crimea four years ago, and another geopolitical risk to worry the markets. Oil could also be volatile today, after plunging to its lowest level in over a year on Friday. Also coming up today It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cyber Monday, so retailers will be doing their best to dip into our pockets. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is testifying to the European Parliament lawmakers; expect questions on Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget, Brexit, and weakening growth in the eurozone.

                "bodyText":"And finally, the Dow has closed 108 points higher, or 0.44%. Worries over the prospect of a deeper US-China trade war were tempered by Larry Kudlow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion that Donald Trump could cut a deal with president Xi. But Wall Street still felt nervous, with traders worrying what might happen at the G20 meeting. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose tariffs on hundreds of billions more Chinese imports has worried investors - as it would hurt companies such as Apple. General Motors shares ended in the red, down 2.5%, after being roasted by the president on Twitter. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. GW It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looking like a quiet finish to trading in New York. With 15 minutes to go, the Dow is up 75 points or 0.3% at 24,715, the S&amp;P 500 is 0.2% higher, and the Nasdaq is flat. Donald Trump is right to criticise Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deal, according to a former UK cabinet minister. Peter Mandelson, who also served as an EU trade representative, says the US president was talking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perfect sense\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when he said the UK would struggle to sign a trade deal with America. If we enter the transition period immediately after Brexit on 30 March next year, we will still be bound by all EU rules \u00e2\u20ac\u201c without having a say over them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for a period of at least 21 months. The prime minister herself has begun to suggest that this transition period will need to be extended and article 132 of the withdrawal agreement says this extension could last until 31 December 2022. This would mean that for almost four years, the UK would have to follow all EU trade rules and stay inside the customs union. While it may be possible to begin negotiating a new trading relationship with some countries if they were interested during the transition, nothing could be implemented before the transition period had expired. Nor is it clear that there would be anything to negotiate beyond that point, if there is no solution to the Irish border question. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the backstop is deployed in the absence of a solution, so the UK remains in the customs union indefinitely. None of this would make negotiating a notional trade deal with the UK a high priority for other countries, including the US. CNBC have more details of Larry Kudlow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on trade, and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s willingness to make a deal with China: Washington and Beijing have re-engaged about a path toward a trade agreement, and the summit offers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an opportunity to break through what has been disappointing discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in recent months, Kudlow told reporters on Tuesday. At the G-20, Trump will focus on issues including alleged Chinese theft of intellectual property, ownership of American companies in China and tariffs and non-tariff barriers, the National Economic Council director said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re having now a lot of communication with the Chinese government at all levels,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kudlow said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were at a total standstill. Nothing was going on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders has been asked about president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweets about GM. However, she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give more details about any withdrawal of subsidies, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that there is a specific timeline.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares in GM are now down 3% following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blast. Newsflash: Donald Trump has just threatened to withhold government subsidies from General Motors. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s furious that the company announced plans to close plants and lay off thousands of staff (plunging its workforce into uncertainty but boosting GM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares). Trump, though, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t addressing that fact that his tariffs on imported steel have driven up GM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s costs, and probably contributed to CEO Mary Barra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision President Donald Trump is open to reaching a trade deal with China but is prepared to go ahead with more tariffs if one isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t struck, National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow has said, via Marketwatch. Apple shares are still under pressure, down 1% at $173.31. The threat of fresh US tariffs is worrying traders, as UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri explains: Apple is a significant employer in China and this administration has urged the company to move more manufacturing to the U.S.,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd . \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This could simply be a negotiating tactic ahead of the G20 Summit later this week, though we do note that this administration has proven a willingness to push forward with such actions. David Madden of CMC Markets UK sums up the day: Stock markets are in the red following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bullish move. Fears regarding, US-China trade, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget and Brexit all play into the mix. President Trump warned that that levy on Chinese imports might be increased, and further tariffs could be announced. This dampened investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hopes about a deal being struck at the G20 summit. European stock markets have closed, with small losses across the board. The FTSE 100 ended 19 points lower at 7,016, a small reversal on Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally. Well, this might be awkward. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Ivanka Trump, the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daughter and advisor, are visiting schools in Idaho together on Tuesday. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be dropping in on Idaho\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wilder School District, which has signed up to Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ConnectEd program. That means all students at two schools, Wilder Elementary and Wilder Middle-High School, receive iPads as part of a $100m grant from Apple. Teachers received MacBooks and iPad minis. Ivanka sounds excited about it; perhaps a bright pupil might ask about trade wars?.... The global economy could suffer badly over the next decade if the US-China trade war escalates, according to new research from Rabobank. The Dutch financial services group has calculated that the global economy would lose out on 0.7 percentage points of growth by 2030, unless the two sides reach a ceasefire. And if further tariffs are imposed, as Donald Trump is threatening, the impact would be much worse -- wiping out 2 percentage points of growth. And there are no winners in this scenario, Rabobank says. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details: Escalating trade war could see global GDP growth drop 2 per cent meaning hundreds of billions of dollars in lost growth by 2030, compared to a no-trade-war scenario China would be hit hardest with the economy losing $2,100bn by 2030, with US incurring a $370bn hit Euro area to feel knock-on effect with combined economy seeing a $60bn shortfall by 2030 Hugo Erken, senior economist at Rabobank, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our analysis demonstrates the stark reality that an ongoing trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies has much broader ramifications that transcend their own borders. It shows that in a globalised economy, there are no real winners from such policies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Capital Economics has spotted some worrying signs in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US consumer confidence report: Although they have generally picked up over the past couple of months specifically, the shares of respondents planning to buy a home, motor vehicle or major appliance remain lower than their 2017 peaks. That shift in sentiment is already showing up in weaker housing activity, and we suspect it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be long before that weakness starts to spread to other rate-sensitive sectors of the economy. Wall Street is recovering some of its early losses, in choppy trading. The Dow is now down 100 points, having been 200 points south just after the open. Just in: US consumer confidence has dipped, but remains high by historical standards. The Conference Board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer confidence index slipped to 135.7 this month, down from 137.9 in October. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bigger fall than expected. According to the Board, Americans are a little less optimistic about future business conditions and their own wage growth. More positively, consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment of current conditions increased slightly, with job growth the main driver of improvement. The trade war jitters could see Apple lose the crown of being America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most valuable company. Its market capitalisation has dropped to around $815bn in early trading, I reckon. That takes it below Microsoft, which is currently worth some $817bn. Less than four months ago, Apple was celebrating becoming the first US company to be worth one trillion dollars. Recent stock market volatility has taken a big chunk out of its value. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst City Index, explains why Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are vulnerable to trade war fears: Preparing the ground for the talks with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping this Saturday President Trump has laid out his threats. He plans to increase tariffs to 25% on $200 billion in Chinese-made goods if a deal is not reached and potentially bringing in tariffs on imports of iPhones and Macbooks made in China. While China is not budging on the tariff front \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is responding in kind to any US tariff increases\u00e2\u20ac\u201c the country has been addressing the issue of opening up to foreign investments and companies. Ding ding. The New York stock exchange is open, and traders are giving their verdict on the US-China trade spat. The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen by 209 points, or 0.84%, to 24,437 points. Apple has dropped by 1.5%, following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose tariffs on another $267bn of Chinese imports, including iPhones made in China. Some reaction to the US house price data: Just in: US house price growth has slowed to a near two-year low. The closely-watched Case-Shiller index shows that US house prices only rose by 5.5% year-on-year in September, down from 5.7% in August. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest rate since January 2017, and may show that recent US interest rate hikes are making mortgages less affordable. Global stock markets are weakening, as investors digest Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose more tariffs on China unless Beijing backs down over trade. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index has lost around 0.5%, with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100, German DAX and French CAC all losing ground. Wall Street is now expected to drop when trading begins in an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. The Dow is called down 150 points, or 0.6%. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says investors should brace for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153potential fireworks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between the US and China. Markets will be keeping a very close eye to see whether both sides are able to find some middle ground. While a breakthrough deal seems highly unlikely following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent threats, any display of friendship and interest for further discussions will be welcomed by the financial markets. However, if talks descend into arguments with trade relations between the two nations deteriorating further, risk aversion may reign as fears mount over a full-blown trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies becoming reality. Theresa May has just hit back against Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of her Brexit plans. The PM has insisted that the UK will be able to sign a new trade deal with the US. The political declaration [with the EU] makes clear that we will have an independent trade policies. We will be able to strike trade deals across the world. May added that Britain already has a team of trade experts talking to the US about a possible deal. However, this raises the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchlorinated chicken\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 question; how can Britain stay closely aligned to European rules, while also signing deals with other countries whose standards are different, and still minimise trade frictions? Harvard economist Jeffrey Frankel agrees that the US-China trade war is hurting the global economy....and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helping either! He writes: The trade war appears to be among the reasons for a renewed slowdown in China. The Chinese slowdown, in turn, will have spillover effects on other countries, especially commodity exporters. The European economy has also slowed in 2018, with Germany even reporting a surprising contraction in the third quarter. Trade is among the reasons: reduced demand from China, unprecedented uncertainty about US trade policy and the looming prospect of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit in which the United Kingdom leaves the European single market and customs union. Frankel argues that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war is rebounding on the US -- the trade gap with China has actually widened this year, even though Americans are paying more for Chinese goods. Brexit is also making people poorer (due to the slump in the pound after the 2016 vote) he adds: Current trade policies are working to reduce real incomes in the US, Britain and many other countries. But monetary policy cannot counteract the effects. Only voters can do that. The full piece is worth a read, and online here: Donald Trump launched his trade war with China back in March, by proposing tariffs on $60bn of imports. This was followed with 10% tariffs on another $20bn of goods (which Trump is now threatening to increase to 25% in January). Beijing retaliated both times, making US goods more expensive. Worryingly, there are now signs that these tit-for-tat moves have hurt China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. Bloomberg has spotted that several indicators of business conditions and market sentiment have weakened -- including stock market valuations and small business confidence. Their chief Asia economist Chang Shu warns: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Early indicators point to further weakness in the Chinese economy. The economies of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major trading partners continued to decelerate. The weakness in the equity market would not only impact sentiment, but also constrain firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 liquidity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Just in: UK retail sales have been stronger than expected this month, but shopkeepers are anxious about the future. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdistributive trades\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey from the CBI. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the main findings: 36% of respondents reported that sales volumes were up in the year to November, while 17% said they were down, giving a balance of 19% Retailers expect sales volumes to pick up next month (+22%), with 34% expecting them to rise and 12% to fall Sales were poor for the time of year in November, with a balance of (-10%), an improvement on October (-22%) The volume of orders placed upon suppliers recovered in November, with 36% of survey respondents reporting a rise and 21% reporting a fall, giving a balance of +15%. Firms anticipate that orders will grow at a similar pace next month (+15%) Retailers expect their overall business situation to deteriorate over the next three months (-9%) Look who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Beijing today.... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not seen much of David Cameron since he quit Downing Street shortly after the 2016 EU referendum, and took delivery of a new \u00c2\u00a325,000 shed in which to write his memoirs. Last December he got a new job, running a \u00c2\u00a3750m fund to improve transport links between China and its trading partners, as part of the Belt and Road initiative. So perhaps that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the Chinese capital today, for talks with premier Li Kequiang. The trade war is a major headache for China, as it tries to manage its economic transformation while avoiding a sharp economic slowdown. With US relations looking ropey, Beijing needs allies in other parts of the world. So it may be significant that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Xi has just landed in Spain for an official visit, ahead of the G20 meeting in Argentina. Xi is expected to meet with King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia for an official palace reception, followed by talks with prime minister Pedro Sanchez. Spanish newswire EFE says the visit is aimed at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strengthening strategic ties between the two countries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It will also give Spanish firms a chance to invest in Chinese infrastructure projects such as the Belt and Road Initiative. EFE adds: Xi will also visit the Senate, the City Hall of Madrid and end his visit with a gala dinner at the Royal Palace hosted by the Spanish royal couple. A business forum with the executives of major Spanish and Chinese companies is also scheduled to be held to promote investments in both countries. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war threats have taken the shine of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets today. After a strong rally on Monday, the trading floors are more subdued today. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has dipped back into the red, as Thomas Cook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning dampens the mood. Shares in banks and oil producers are also down, while utilities (a classic defensive stock) are up. Russ Mould of stockbrokers AJ Bell says the markets are in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153limbo\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, awaiting developments on the US-China trade dispute. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Interestingly investors didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem troubled by a new warning from US President Donald Trump who said he is likely to go ahead with a hike on tariffs on Chinese goods. The Shanghai composite index was barely changed and Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng index only dipped 0.17%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market is perhaps waiting for Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping to see whether the current talk simply amounts to scare tactics or whether he is serious about targeting additional Chinese goods with tariffs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in the City, shares in holiday firm Thomas Cook have plunged by a third after another profits warning. Thomas Cook surprised investors by rushing out its financial results this morning.

The company has also suspended its dividend, which helped to send shares slumping to a six-year low. Thomas Cook blamed this summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heatwave, which encouraged Brits to stay at home. More here: Baird analyst William Power says Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threatened tariffs on Apple products are another blow to the tech giant, on top of existing worries about iPhone demand. Yesterday afternoon President Trump alluded to possible tariffs on iPhones and other Apple products, which is likely to create fresh demand concerns following recent supply chain rancour. While we take the negative supply chain comments with the proverbial grain of salt, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little question that higher iPhone prices due to potential tariffs would likely negatively impact demand and profitability at some level. We certainly acknowledge the near-term risk, but remain positive on the long-term position and would buy on weakness. Donald Trump has also managed to weaken the pound, by shoving a spanner into Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit plans. Last night, the US president declared that the agreement on the table looks like a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great deal for the EU\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that would stop the UK trading with the US. These comments have infuriated the UK government, as May tries desperately to persuade MPs to back the plan. Her effective deputy, cabinet minister David Lidington, has claimed that Trump is incorrect, and said he \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcregrets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 them (Westminster code for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI wish he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d shut up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122). Lidington told the Today Programme that a UK-US trade deal is achievable: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The United States is a tough negotiator. President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always said very plainly \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI put America first\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Well, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect the British prime minister to put British interests first.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd City traders,though, believe Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention is significant -- the pound is down almost a cent to $1.2745 vs the US dollar. The president of Indonesia is growing increasingly pessimistic that China and the US could resolve their trade dispute, when they met at the G20 summit later this week. Joko Widodo told business leaders that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m hoping for a miracle during the G20 meeting, that they will come together, but my feeling is they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Widodo has already seen the animosity between the two sides, when US VP Mike Pence clashed with President Xi at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) gathering last week. Co-operation was in short supply, Widodo told a forum of Indonesian CEOs... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is the first time in 29 years of APEC that an APEC meeting produced no communique.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Beijing have responded to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters that presidents Trump and Xi had agreed to reach a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmutually beneficial\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 arrangement on trade earlier this month. Commodity prices have also been hit by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to hike existing tariffs on China, and possibly extend them to all Chinese imports. Traders are calculating that a full-blooded trade war will hurt demand for metals such as zinc, nickel and aluminium Shares in UK tech firm Dialog Semiconductor, a key Apple supplier, have dropped 2.2% in early European trading. Apple shares fell over 2% in after-hours trading, following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to escalate the trade war. Wall Street is clearly concerned that the dispute with China could escalate in 2019, hurting sales of iPhones. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology industry has hit out at Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose steeper tariffs on goods from China, such as iPhones. Jose Castaneda, spokesperson for the Information Technology Industry Council, has warned that consumers will suffer the consequences: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite the pain Americans have felt in communities across the United States as a result of tariffs, the president has signalled he wants to continue this short-sighted trade war. Imposing a new round of tariffs would cause a shock that will reverberate across America and the globe. It would further threaten global supply chains, leading to higher prices for the electronic devices people rely on every day and even the loss of American jobs. It is deeply disappointing the president wants to undermine his opportunity to create meaningful progress before the discussions even begin. ITI urges him to give negotiations a chance and work toward an agreement that resolves this growing trade dispute.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Trade war fears are rippling through the markets again today, after Donald Trump threatened to impose fresh tariffs on goods from China. The US president undermined hopes of a ceasefire with Beijing, by declaring it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly unlikely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d accept an offer from Chinese president Xi Jinping, to avert new levies coming into force next January. There had been optimism that Trump and Xi could reach an agreement, perhaps at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G20 summit, that would deter America from imposing steeper tariffs on more Chinese imports. Bu speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Trump dashed those hopes by predicting that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably raise the existing tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports in January, from 10% to 25%. Trump also raised the stakes further, by threatening to slap tariffs on another $267bn -- meaning virtually all Chinese imports into America would be more expensive. He declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a deal, then I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to put the $267 billion additional on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This could includes tariffs on Apple products imported from China, the president added -- something that hit iPhone and MacBook users in the pocket. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insisted that Beijing needs to heed the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns over trade, saying: China has to open up their country to competition from the United States.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tariffs are effectively a tax on consumers (unless the importer swallows the cost themselves). Trump thinks Americans can cope with pricier goods, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can make it [the tariff] 10 per cent, and people could stand that very easily.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The folk on Main Street may disagree, so Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Xi at the G20 summit this weekend will be closely watched. Also coming up today Brexit, and the Italian budget row, will both be on investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds today.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap: The Bank of England has warned that a no-deal Brexit would trigger the worst UK downturn since the Great Depression. In a new scenario drawn up for MPs, the BoE outlined how: GDP would fall by as much as 8% next year House prices would fall by 30% the unemployment rate would increase from its current level of 4.1% to about 7.5%, The pound would plunge by a quarter, driving inflation up to 6.5%. Interest rates would be hiked sharply to curb rising prices and support sterling Bank of England governor Mark Carney told reporters that the Bank would have limited powers to cushion Britain from a supply shock, if trade with the EU was suddenly disrupted. Lowering interest rates isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to open a port,lowering interest rates is not going to allow a bank in London to continue to operate in the continent if passporting has been taken away.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney also warned that some UK businesses are unprepared for a cliff-edge Brexit, or simply can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t protect themselves from new trade barriers. The level of preparedness of businesses and infrastructure,infrastructure such as ports, customs systems and transportation operations, will be important determinants of how well the economy adjusts to new trade barriers. Evidence from surveys and other UK authorities suggests that the country is not yet fully prepared for a cliff-edge Brexit. The governor denied scaremongering, insisting: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our job is not to hope for the best but to prepare for the worst.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have looked at a potential no-deal, no-transition Brexit... the reason we do that is to be prepared for all eventualities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Labour Party have said the report shows the perils of a no-deal Brexit. They want Theresa May to rethink her plan, before it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too late. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysis has been criticised, though, with top economist Paul Krugman saying its assumptions were questionable. Carney was also savaged by Brexit supporting MPs; Jacob Rees-Mogg dismissed him as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsecond-tier failed politician\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 who had damaged the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation. The Bank also reported that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector could survive whatever Brexit throws at it. HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group, Santander, Standard Chartered and Nationwide Building Society all passed this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress tests. Carney said the public should take comfort in the strength of the UK financial system: The purpose of what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve released today... is not supposed to make people scared, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supposed to provide reassurance that even if this happened, which is not likely, the system is more than ready for it. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. Guy Bradshaw, Head of Residential at UK Sotheby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s International Realty, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts either: He says US citizens are already eyeing up UK property, which becomes more affordable if the pound weakens: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To claim house prices will fall by a third is highly unrealistic, this is almost double the downturn in prices we saw in 2008. It is unlikely we will be walking away from the EU without a deal so this scaremongering is doing nothing to help a market which is already stagnating under punitive stamp duty costs as well as political and economic uncertainty. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The biggest driver for London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime property market next year will undeniably be foreign investment by individuals looking to hedge their bets with the good currency play. Already this evening we have spoken to a handful of American investors who have proactively reached out to us following the BOE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement. With the exchange rate potentially offering US buyers a 25% discount on properties this could be one of the smartest times to invest in London. These buyers are predominately from Miami and New York and are unphased by the proposed foreign buyer tax as they know they will recover these costs when the market bounces back. Henry Zeffman of The Times has a mischievous idea..... The Financial Times says the Bank of England is warning of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchistoric\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economic downturn: A cliff-edge Brexit where the UK crashed out of the EU with no deal and no transition could lead to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP dropping by its sharpest ever levels, according to a new Bank of England analysis. UK GDP could fall by as much as 10.5 per cent over a five-year period in the severest of Brexits, compared to its pre-referendum levels, while house prices could plummet by 30 per cent, the BoE said on Wednesday as part of its semi-annual scan of threats to financial stability. That compares with respective drops of 6.25 per cent and 17 per cent during the financial crisis. But the central bank concluded that the financial system could withstand even the most severe of Brexit risks, with UK lenders all passing the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual stress tests, the results of which were also published on Wednesday. It added that securing an implementation period would mitigate the worst financial-stability risks. The Telegraph takes a similar line: A disorderly Brexit could wipe 8pc off UK economic output within a year, creating the worst slump since World War II, according to the Bank of England. This would result in the Bank having to hike interest rates to 5.5pc in order to compensate for the sudden shock. Unemployment would almost double, from the current rate of just over 4pc to 7.5pc, despite a fall in net migration of 100,000. The pound would lose 25pc of its value against the dollar under a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal, no transition scenario\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and could be worth less than a dollar. Bloomberg has summarised the key points in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disorderly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit scenario: GDP drops 8% House prices fall 30% Commercial property prices plunge 48% Sterling falls 25% to below parity with the dollar Unemployment rises to 7.5% Inflation accelerates to 6.5% BOE benchmark rate rises to 5.5% and averages 4% over 3 years Britain goes from net immigration to net outflow, reducing labor supply Ouch. A Nobel-prize winning economist is questioning whether the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysis really stacks up. Paul Krugman, an expert on trade, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced that the UK economy would actually shrink by 8% (a really massive contraction) in a no-deal Brexit. Krugman isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t castigating the Bank ala Rees-Mogg; but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politely questioning the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic logic - and how it thinks trade disruption would hurt productivity. Another Brexiteer MP has criticised the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work: Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at City firm FXTM, believes the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysis strengthens the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hand, as she tries to force MPs to back her deal: On the bright side, the Bank of England stated that a close economic relationship with the EU could boost GDP growth by 1.75% over the next five years. It seems investors are focusing on the positive aspects of the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report to push the Pound higher. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report may offer Theresa May some ammunition when she sells her Brexit deal to parliament.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Breaking away from Brexit, the New York stock market is surging after America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker hinted that US interest rates won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise as fast as expected. My colleague Phillip Inman explains: The outlook for economic growth in the US has grown uncertain, the US central bank chief Jerome Powell said on Wednesday as he signalled a slower pace of interest rate rises over the next two years. Powell, who has angered Donald Trump this year with his determination to raise rates, said the Federal Reserve would pause to assess the impact of higher borrowing costs on US households and businesses. Analysts were divided over whether the Fed chief had buckled to complaints by the president or had become worried about rising distress in the housing market following eight rises since 2015. Powell said there were mixed signals from recent economic data despite the economy growing at more than 3% and the jobs market showing a slight lift in wages. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the light goes out you move cautiously,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. US traders aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t moving cautiously, though. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve sent the Dow Jones industrial average surging by over 2%, or 550 points, as fears that the Fed might hike too fast melt away. We shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget that the BoE is confident that the banking sector can cope with whatever Brexit throws at it. Rob Smith, banking partner at KPMG UK, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress tests have shown UK banks in a good light: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank of England is keen to paint a positive picture as we head into Brexit. The EBA put UK banks on the naughty step earlier this month whereas the Bank of England is clearly keen to emphasise their robustness. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, on the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit forecasts: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank has confirmed what other independent reports this week have been telling us: a No Deal Brexit could be even worse than the financial crisis of ten years ago, and the country would be much worse under Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Instead of ploughing on with this discredited deal the Government should set new priorities that would protect jobs and the economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Two leading Brexiteer MPs have attacked the Bank of England for its gloomy assessment of a no-deal Brexit. Jacob Rees-Mogg, head of the European Reform Group of backbench Conservative MPs, blasted Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is unusual for the Bank of England to talk down the pound and shows the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to understand his role. He is not there to create panic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rees-Mogg has also got personal on Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PM programme, calling Carney: A second-tier failed Canadian politician who unfortunately we have running one of our most distinguished institutions who has trashed its reputation by his succession of hysterical and wrong forecasts. Former cabinet minister Priti Patel also criticised the BoE: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank of England is undermining its credibility and independence by giving such prominence to these extreme economic forecasts and scenarios.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Andrew Sentance, a former Bank of England policymaker, is also unimpressed: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full quote from Mark Carney tonight, on how a no-deal Brexit could hit the UK economy hard: In both scenarios, tariffs and other trade barriers are introduced suddenly next spring. The UK recognises EU product standards but the EU does not reciprocate. In the more severe, or disorderly scenario, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s border infrastructure does not cope smoothly with new customs requirements for some time There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pronounced increase in the return investors demand for holding sterling assets. By the end of 2023, GDP is more than 10% lower in the disorderly scenario compared to that May 2016 trend. And that also means a plunging pound, a surge in inflation, and a slump in house prices: If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that a no-deal Brexit would cause economic turmoil: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our piece on the UK bank stress tests (which are being overshadowed by Brexit, but still important). Q: In your scenario, would a UK recession in 2019 be less severe if interest rate were cut to zero? Deputy governor Ben Broadbent says it all depends on Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on the supply side of the UK. Carney weighs in too -- saying lower interest rates wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep a UK port open, or give a City bank access to the EU markets. In other words, the usual rules (that you ease monetary policy in a recession) don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t apply. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the press conference. Q: Do you feel happier talking about Brexit risks now you have a UK passport, after becoming a UK citizen this month? Mark Carney breaks into a grin, and reveals he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually have a passport yet (\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe Home Office is busy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122), but he does have citizenship. The governor adds that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great privilege to have this role, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153testament to UK openness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that he was hired. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a picture of Carney at his citizenship ceremony: Carney declines to say whether he outlined these dire no-Brexit scenarios when he brief the cabinet about the issue in September. But he repeats that these are scenarios, not forecasts (scenarios of plunging house prices, a slumping pound and a deep recession). Q: If your worst-case scenario came true, and there was an 8% decrease in the UK economy, would that be the worst year for the economy ever? Apparently no! Britain suffered a 20% plunge in output after it rejoined the gold standard (in 1925), says deputy governor Ben Broadbent. Governor Mark Carney jokes that the BoE learned its lesson: That was the last time the Bank gave advice to the government, to go back on the gold standard. On a cliff-edge Brexit, Carney says: It is a possibility that we will have a no-deal Brexit with no transition.... The probability has increased with time. And our job has been to get the system ready. Q: Your worst-case Brexit scenario suggests that UK interest rates rise to 5.5% as the economy crashes, which is the absolute opposite of what happened in the 2008 crisis. So is it really likely? Carney says that a no-deal Brexit would indeed be the opposite of the financial crisis. It was a demand shock. But if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would be a supply shock, which would then hurt demand as well. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to assess exactly how that supply shock would strike the UK, and how long it would last (there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little historical precedent - perhaps the oil shock of the 1970s?). A sharp supply shock, plus an exchange rate adjustment (a plunging pound), equals inflation -- which the Bank would typically tackle with higher interest rates. Q: Aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you effectively endorsing government policy with this no-deal Brexit warning? And doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that undermine the independence of the Bank of England? Mark Carney says the Bank of England is accountable to parliament, and parliament asked it to examine the impact of Brexit on the economy. He repeats that the Bank has developed scenarios, not forecasts. It has to do this work to ensure financial stability.... so when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done it, and parliament has asked for it, you have to publish it. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of Mark Carney discussing the impact of a no-deal Brexit. Q: What would happen to your growth forecasts if Britain didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave the EU? Carney says you can \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmechanically extrapolate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate at 2016, when the UK was running at 2% growth per year. He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go further... but the UK only grew by 1.8% in 2017. It is expected to only grow by 1.3% this year, 1.6% in 2016, and then 1.4% in 2020 and 2021. Mark Carney has warned that some British firms are unprepared for a no-deal Brexit, or simply can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prepare. The proportion of businesses that have drawn up, or activated contingency plans, are a fraction of the whole, the governor says. In some cases it is very difficult for those businesses to plan for border frictions. The logistics of that happening is very difficult. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why it is important to more seamlessly to the new relationship between the UK and EU, whatever it takes, he adds. Mark Carney has warned that the UK is not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fully prepared\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a cliff-edge Brexit. Q: Are you part of Project Fear? The governor replies that the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job is not to hope for the best, but to prepare for the worst. And he insists that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153core of the financial system\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is ready for Brexit, however it plays out. The Bank of England is ready for Brexit, whatever form it takes, governor Mark Carney says. But he also warns that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s powers are limited. Monetary policy can do little to offset the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153potentially significant hits to productivity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that Brexit could bring. The Bank has also releases its Brexit analysis - and warned that crashing out of the EU without a deal would worst than the 2008 financial crisis. My colleague Richard Partington reports from the Bank: Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal would trigger a deep and damaging recession with worse consequences for the UK economy than the 2008 financial crisis, the Bank of England has warned. Raising the stakes as Theresa May battles to win support in parliament for her Brexit deal, the central bank said that failure to reach a deal with Brussels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with no transition period to a new trading relationship - would spark an immediate economic crash. GDP would fall by as much as 8% next year, exceeding the depth of the recession that followed the financial crisis in one of the worst-ever peacetime capitulations for the economy. House prices would fall by 30% and the unemployment rate would increase from its current level of 4.1% to about 7.5%, while interest rates would be forced to rise as inflation increased to 6.5%. In sharp contrast, the Bank said that May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit deal had the potential to encourage a bounce for economic growth over the next five years, relative to its current forecast, although only if Britain maintains the closest possible trading ties with the EU. As this chart shows, the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress test is actually more testing than the 2008 financial crisis. Governor Mark Carney is speaking to reporters now, explaining that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit scenarios show \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhat could happen, not what is going to happen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. And they are certainly testing. As the Press Association explains: In the event of a disorderly no deal, no transition Brexit, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP could fall by 8% from its level in the first quarter of 2019, according to analysis of a worst case scenario by the Bank. The unemployment rate would rise 7.5% and inflation would surge 6.5%. House prices are forecast to decline 30%, while commercial property prices are set to fall 48%. The pound would fall by 25% to less than parity against both the US dollar and the euro. The Bank of England says it has tested whether UK banks could survive a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworst case\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assumptions about the challenges the UK economy could face in the event of a cliff-edge Brexit. That includes: the sudden imposition of trade barriers with the EU; loss of existing trade agreements with other countries; severe customs disruption; a sharp increase in the risk premium on UK assets; and negative spillovers to wider UK financial markets. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key messages from the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress tests of the UK banking sector. Stress testing Our stress test shows that UK banks could continue to lend in a scenario more severe than the financial crisis. Bank resilience UK banks are prepared and strong enough to continue to serve UK households and businesses even through a disorderly Brexit. Brexit checklist The UK government is making sure the financial services UK households and businesses get from EU providers won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be disrupted. BREAKING: All seven of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major lenders have passed the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress tests, meaning they are strong enough to withstand a disorderly Brexit. That means HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group, Santander, Standard Chartered and Nationwide Building Society are all strong enough to ride out a no-deal departure, without needing to raise more funds. The BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee says it has reviewed a scenario whereby Britain crashes out of the European Union in four months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time with no deal or transition period. The FPC says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Based on a comparison of this scenario with the stress test, the FPC judges that the UK banking system is strong enough to continue to serve UK households and businesses even in the event of a disorderly Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No bank needs to strengthen its capital position as a result of the stress test.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd City economists are getting impatient.... Hold your horses.... there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small delay. Due to technical problems, the stress tests will be released at 4.40pm, along with the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report and its analysis on the impact of Brexit David Madden of CMC Markets says the City is keen to see the stress test results: UK banks will be in focus as the Bank of England stress test results will be announced after the closing bell of the London session. Traders will be interested to find out how British bank would cope in the various different Brexit scenarios. UK banks have beefed up their balance sheets since the credit crisis, and now they could face additional tough times, depending on the terms of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit of the EU. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly time for the Bank of England to release the results of its latest stress tests. This annual exam will show whether Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest banks can handle a major downturn, or a disorderly event such as a no-deal Brexit. HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group and Santander are all being put through their paces, along with Standard Chartered (which has more of an international focus) and the Nationwide Building Society. The BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scenario is pretty brutal, modelling: a 33% fall in property prices a 40% fall in commercial property prices UK unemployment more than doubling, to 9.5% UK GDP falling by 4.7% World GDP falling by 2.4% UK interest rates rising to 4%, from 0.75% at present. The BBC has a good preview, here: How healthy are Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks? The results are due at 4.30pm sharp, followed by a press conference with governor Mark Carney. BoE is also releasing its Brexit impact assessments, so it could get busy.... America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has identified Brexit has one of the key threats to US financial stability. In a new report, the Federal Reserve warned that a wide range of economic and financial activities could be disrupted if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. It says: An intensification of sovereign debt concerns or unresolved uncertainty about the implications of Brexit could lead to market volatility and a sharp pullback of investors and financial institutions from riskier assets, as occurred following the June 2016 Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom and earlier during the European debt crisis. The Fed adds: Because London is an important international financial center, U.S. banks and broker-dealers participate in some of the markets most likely to be affected by Brexit. The Fed also flags up the Italian budget row, and the slowing Chinese economy as potential risks [something Tiffany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has already confirmed today]. Heads up: Donald Trump has just dropped a loud hint that he will impose new tariffs on car imports. The president has tweeted that such a measure would protect US jobs, following GM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to close several factories. There are already rumours that the president could slap a fresh 25% customs duty on car imports from all countries except Canada and Mexico. These tweets suggest something is brewing.... Tiffany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, Alessandro Bogliolo, has told analysts that Chinese tourists have cut their spending in both the US and Hong Kong. Explaining last quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s underwhelming sales growth, he explained: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we have clearly seen in the quarter has been a shift in Chinese tourism and spending,. So we have seen spending of Chinese jewelleries going down in important markets outside of China and we have seen strong sales in mainland China. This is a clear pattern that we have seen now since few months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US luxury jewelry vendor Tiffany &amp; Co has been hit by a drop in Chinese tourists visiting America, sending its shares sliding. Tiffany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has missed Wall Street expectations by only reporting a 4% rise in revenues for the last quarter. It blamed weaker spending by Chinese tourists, who have been cutting back as China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate has slowed. That rather suggests that Tiffany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is the latest US company to been hurt by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war. Those tariffs on Chinese imports are rebounding nastily on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. As Associated Press puts it: Chinese economic growth declined to a post-global crisis low of 6.5 percent in the quarter than ended in September. A trade fight with the Trump administration is pressuring communist leaders to energize economic activity that has weakened since Beijing clamped down on bank lending last year as it tries to rein in surging debt. Shares in the company have plunged by 9% in New York, as investors fret. Wall Street is open....and shares are rising in early trading. The Dow has jumped by 150 points, or 0.5%, as investors hope that Donald Trump and Xi Jinping might agree a trade breakthrough when they sit down for dinner on Saturday. Technology companies and industrial firms are leading the rally. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bob Burgess has spotted that the US trade gap in goods has actually hit a record high.... Balraj Sroya, sales trader at Foenix Partners, thinks Donald Trump will welcome today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US GDP figures, confirming another solid quarter of growth: The print surprisingly saw business investment pick up pace last quarter, while corporate profits bolstered to 6-year highs with the assistance of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax bill. The stellar print strengthens Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiating hand ahead of trade talks with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping this weekend, as the US economy is proving resilient to recent pressures while the Chinese have not fared so well. Ouch! America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit has swelled, despite Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to close the gap between imports and exports. The U.S. Census Bureau has reported that the international trade deficit jumped by $1bn in October to $77.2bn, as Americans bought more from overseas while selling less the other way. Exports of goods for October were $140.5 billion, $0.8 billion less than September exports. Imports of goods for October were $217.8 billion, $0.2 billion more than September imports. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew faster than other advanced economies in the last quarter. The second estimate of US GDP for Q3 has confirmed that it expanded at an annualised pace of 3.5%, matching the initial estimate. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the equivalent of almost 0.9% quarterly growth, faster than the UK (+0.6%), the eurozone (+0.2%) and Germany (-0.2%). However, this is a slowdown on previous quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth, of 4.2% (again, annualised). The data also shows that consumer spending rose by 3.6%, down from a first estimate of 4.0%. Business investment was faster than first thought, at +2.5% (up from a first estimate of 0.8%). Even Bitcoin is joining in the rally today. The cryptocurrency has leapt by over 10% today, to $4,157 - its highest level since Sunday. Some relief for crypto-enthusiasts. However, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost 80% below its record high last December. Thought For The Day: on the question of how central bankers extract themselves from their stimulus programmes. The US stock markets are expected to open higher in a couple of hours, following Asia and Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead. Central bankers need a host of skills these days. Intellectual heft to deal with the data, and communication abilities - with the markets hanging on your every word - is a must. But apparently, it also helps to be tall. According to the Washington Post, Donald Trump fretted that Janet Yellen was too short to lead the Federal Reserve, before deciding not to reappoint her. He may now be regretting ditching Yellen (5 foot 3 inches) in favour of the rather taller Jerome Powell. Trump has admitted he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not even a little big happy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance, given the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate hike plans. Heads-up: Donald Trump has declared he is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153totally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd willing to see the US government shut down, unless it funds his border wall with Mexico. In an interview with Politico, the president demanded that Congress sends him a bill approving $5bn for his wall on the US-Mexico border. In classic Trump-speak, insisted that he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want the wall \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just for political gain,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before immediately adding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153politically speaking, that issue is a total winner.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Talk of a shutdown might worry Wall Street; it would hamper efforts to push infrastructure spending programme into law. A prolonged shutdown could even lead to worries about a default; back in February, President Trump signed a bill suspending the debt ceiling until March 1, 2019. Newsflash: President Xi has pledged to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sharply widen\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the door to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy for foreign investors. During a pre-G20 trip to Spain, Xi also pledged to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstep up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the protection of intellectual property rights. That might go some way to assuaging America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns... Xi also told the Spanish senate that China planned to import $10 trillion worth of goods over the next five years, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China will make efforts to open, even more, its doors to the exterior world and we will make efforts to streamline access to markets in the areas of investment and protect intellectual property.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asia-Pacific stock markets have closed, with most indices higher (but Australia ended flattish). Uh oh..... World stock markets have hit a one-week high this morning, on hopes of a thaw in U.S.-China trade relations, Reuters reports. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thanks to the rally in Asia, where markets in China, Japan and India all made gains, following a late rally on Wall Street. Bernd Berg, global macro strategist at Switzerland-based Woodman Asset Management, warns that the rally could unwind, if Trump and Xi don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hit it off at dinner: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An expectation is being priced into markets ahead of the G20 meeting that we will see some deal or at least a framework for a deal between Trump and (Chinese President) Xi Jinping. But if they come out with nothing this weekend, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be very bad.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Donald Trump and Xi Jinping will have plenty of choices for their dinner date. Argentinian authorities are putting Buenos Aires into a security lockdown tomorrow, ahead of the G20 summit, and encouraging residents to leave the City. With protests expected, the government has decided to divert flights away from the capital, and cancel public transport services. Some 22,000 police and security agents will be involved in a vast security operation, which will see several \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no-go zones\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd created to prevent protestors getting close to world leaders. The flurry of quotes, headlines, and tweets from @realdonaldtrump in recent weeks about trade have left investors jittery, says Kit Juckes of Societe Generale. He explains: The impact of these \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tape bombs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on short-term foreign exchange price action definitely seems bigger in recent months. Market participants are more high-strung amid the downturn in global equities, credit, emerging markets and commodities. Also, much is riding on the Trump-Xi meeting this weekend. So tape bombs can shake things up in this febrile atmosphere, at least temporarily. (The term \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tape bombs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd refers to the old ticker tape that brought news to the trading floors, before the days of terminals and the web.) European stock markets have also opened positively, with small gains across the board. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says traders are taking their cue from Larry Kudlow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s optimistic comments about a US-China trade deal. His comments that US officials were having discussions at a number of levels of government has raised expectations about some form of agreement, though these comments were caveated with the proviso that China needed to do more for that to happen. Equity markets have chosen to focus on the positive with Asia markets also pushing higher ahead of the key meeting on Saturday with President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trump and Xi. Hopes of a trade war breakthrough at the Trump-Xi dinner date has lifted shares in Asia today. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CSI 300 index jumped by 1.3%, with Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng close behind. Stephen Innes of trading firm OANDA says investors are cautiously optimistic, following Larry Kudlow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments last night: As the market prepares for the dinner date of the century, regional equity investors are expressing a sense of relief that there may be light at the end of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war tunnel despite the ideological differences that were on full display at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. But last nights heavy -metal headline assault should be a clear-cut reminder that when worlds leading free economy and the worlds best example of state-directed capitalism meet face to face, things can go sideways in a hurry. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fancy dinner for two, in an exclusive setting in Buenos Aires? It sounds delightful, especially when the bill shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a problem. But this particular Saturday night date will have a difference - when Donald Trump and Xi Jinping sit down in a few days time, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have a chance to kiss, make up, and calm the trade war that is worrying the global economy. Larry Kudlow, the director of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Economic Council, revealed last night that Trump and Xi will meet for a formal dinner at the G20 meeting this weekend. Kudlow told reporters that the two presidents could \u00e2\u20ac\u0153turn a new page\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in their bilateral economic relationship....but only if Xi makes concessions on trade policy. Kudlow said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153President Xi has an opportunity to change the tone and the substance of these talks. This is a big opportunity. President Trump has indicated he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open. Now we have to know if President Xi is open.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is their only scheduled meeting before January, when the US is set to hike its tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports from 10% to 25%. So it really does matter. Trump had raised the stakes on Tuesday by floating the idea of imposing tariffs on pretty much all Chinese goods sales to America. This trade war could easily get a lot worse.... Investors, though, will hope that China will give ground on issues such as intellectual property transfers. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find our later today if Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs are having effect on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade gap, when the latest import and export figures are released. Also coming up today Federal reserve chair Jerome Powell, is giving a speech this afternoon. Wall Street will watch for signs that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of the Fed over interest rate policies has had any effect. The Bank of England is publishing the results of its annual stress tests on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest lenders this afternoon. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll show if UK banks can cope with an economic shock, or a recession. The stress tests will probably be overshadowed by the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysis of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit withdrawal agreement, also released at 4.30pm, and likely to warn against a no-deal scenario. The agenda 1.30pm BST: US trade figures for October 1.30pm BST: Second estimate of US GDP for Q3 2018 4.30pm: Bank of England publishes 2018 bank stress tests, and no-deal Brexit analysis 5pm: Fed chair Jerome Powell gives a speech",

                "bodyText":"Time for a quick recap UK consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 confidence in the economic outlook has fallen to the lowest level since July 2016. Market research group GfK blamed Brexit uncertainty, which is turning the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcseason of goodwill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 into \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe season of uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned that the UK isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready for Brexit. With more than half of firms yet to active contingency plans, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important there is a transition period, Carney says. Carney also defended the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest Brexit analysis, which predicts a huge economic crisis if Britain leaves the EU without a deal next March. Brewer Greene King says Brexit fatigue is driving some people to the pub. Its sales and profits have risen. Brexit is also driving some people away. Net EU migration has fallen to its lowest level in six years. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also been a dramatic day in Germany. Deutsche Bank has been raided, as part of a probe into money-laundering, and Bayer has just announced a swathe of job cuts. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today.... Is the US labor market cooling? New figures show that the number of Americans who filing new claims for unemployment benefits last week hit a six-month high, up 10,000 at 234,000. That might be a blip due to Thanksgiving, or it may show some weakness in the economy.... Newsflash: German pharmaceutical and life sciences group Bayer is planning to slash 12,000 jobs -- or over a tenth of its workforce -- as part of a restructuring. Howard Archer of the EY Item Club is concerned by the drop in consumer confidence: Newsflash: Britons are the most pessimistic about economic prospects since the Brexit vote. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to market research group GfK. Its latest healthcheck shows that expectations for the General Economic Situation over the next 12 months has fallen, to -32 on its index. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest level since July 2016 -- when the UK was digesting the implications of the EU referendum. GfK also found that UK consumer confidence has fallen to its lowest level in December 2017, down from -10 to -13 on its monthly scale. Joe Staton, client strategy director at GfK, says consumers are nervous about Brexit, and reluctant to make major purchases. The next few weeks are highly unlikely to inject any festive cheer, especially if Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit deal doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t win backing from MPs. The denouement to more than two years of bewildering Brexit wheeler-dealing looks like it will be enacted precisely when many consumers would prefer to be thinking of a well-earned Christmas break, filled with family get-togethers, warmth and festivity. Brexit appears to be turning this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcseason of goodwill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 into \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe season of uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Donald Trump is tweeting some tough words on trade....and suggesting he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how his own tariffs work. Factcheck: The US tariffs on Chinese goods aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t paid by China, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paid by the companies importing products from China. So they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re either passed onto US consumers in higher prices, or swallowed by the company from its profits. So the only dollars \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pouring into the coffers of the U.S.A\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are coming from the U.S.A itself. Having said that.....the recent depreciation of the yuan will have made Chinese goods cheaper, cushioning the blow. The nonstop chatter about Brexit is driving many Brits to the pub for a pint, according to UK chain Greene King. Greene King (the company behind Old Speckled Hen and Abbot Ale), posted a 3.2% jump in pre-tax profits for the 24 weeks to October 14th. The World Cup was a factor, as was the warm weather. But chief executive officer Rooney Anand believes that fatigue over the EU is also significant: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are bored from Brexit and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually translating to pubs benefiting, our like to like sales are up 2.9%, so not all consumer facing businesses are suffering in the run up to Brexit. Greene King isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t immune to the issue, though. It has begun contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit (unlike half of all businesses, according to Mark Carney). That includes: Working closely with its supply chain partners to safeguard the supply of goods to its pubs and breweries Supporting employees who are non-UK EU nationals through \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this period of uncertainty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Deutsche Bank has confirmed it has been raided by the police, and that it relates to the Panama Papers (the expose of offshore tax avoidance) The economics team at Royal Bank of Canada have made a valiant attempt at mapping the various Brexit scenarios. The big crunch is the parliamentary vote on 11th December - current forecast suggest the government could lose by over 100 votes (but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of time for arm-twisting yet). But as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see, even the smoothest Brexit means lower growth than staying in the EU.... Over in parliament, prime minister Theresa May has denied that chancellor Philip Hammond and Bank of England governor Mark Carney are trashing the future of the country as part of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpropaganda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exercise. That is not what is happening, the PM insists. Our politics liveblog has full details of the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance before the Liason Committee (the heads of various parliamentary committees): Back in the UK, migration from the EU has slumped to its lowest level in six year. This will worry British companies reliant on overseas staff to fill skills shortages. The Offie for National Statistics has reported that 74,000 more EU citizens came to the UK than left, in the year to June 2018. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest estimate for EU net migration since 2012 and the lowest immigration level since 2014. The ONS also found that non-EU net migration was the highest since 2004, with 248,000 more non-EU citizens arriving than leaving the UK. Dr Phillip Lee MP, who resigned from the government over its Brexit strategy this year, warns that UK public services will suffer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a Brexodus. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing EU nationals leaving public service on a scale never before witnessed in this country. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EU nationals are the pillar which support fundamental public services in this country. We cannot sit back and watch vital public services like our NHS be damaged by Brexit. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not what Leave voters were promised in 2016. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clear case for the people being given the final say over Brexit, with the option to compare what we currently have with the hope of a deal being offered by this government.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While Mark Carney was speaking on Radio 4, police were piling into the headquarters of German\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest lender, Deutsche Bank. According to local reports,prosecutors are searching Deutsche Bank premises including its headquarters in Frankfurt as part of a money laundering probe Bloomberg says some 170 officials and police were involved in the raids, adding: A probe into the so-called Panama Papers exposed evidence Deutsche Bank helped clients set up off-shore accounts, prosecutors said. Deutsche Bank allegedly failed to report suspected money laundering when criminally obtained funds were transferred to accounts with the bank, the statement says. Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have fallen 3%, making them the worst-performing stock on Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX index. For a man apparently peddling \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcProject Hysteria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Mark Carney sounded remarkable reasonable on the Today programme. It helps that the UK banking sector passed the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress tests yesterday -- meaning at least one part of the economy can handle a disorderly Brexit in March. Unfortunately, as Carney pointed out, the rest of the country isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in such good shape. The Bank is clearly deeply worried that more than half British firms haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken precautions for a no-deal -- either because they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t face it, or because they face insurmountable obstacles if there are suddenly new customs checks and long delays at the ports. This has left Carney walking a tricky balancing act -- arguing for a transition arrangement in one breath, and insisting it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not up to him to say what flavour of Brexit is best in the other. As Carney puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is in the interests of the country to have some time to transition to whatever relationship there is. Carney verged close to the limit of central bank independence at one point, when he seemed to suggest that Britain might need to extend the implementation period (in the current withdrawal agreement) to give the UK enough time to prepare. That would not please Brexit-supporting MPs, who want a clean break as soon as possible. And what about the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apocalyptic predictions that Britain might suffer the worst economic carnage (Carney-age?) in decades? The governor seems to suggest we treat it cautiously: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most likely to happen but what could happen if everything goes wrong. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These are very low probabilities \u00e2\u20ac\u201d this type of worst-case scenario.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Predictably, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mixed reaction to Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest comments. James Duddridge, Conservative MP for Rochford and Southend, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a fan -- arguing that the governor is failing to be impartial. Some Today listeners were more impressed, though: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an audio clip of Mark Carney warning that many UK firms simply aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready for what Brexit may throw at them: Update: to be clear, Carney is talking about firms not being ready for a no-deal Brexit. Q: Are you worried that if Brexit goes belly up, people might blame you for sounding so incredibly gloomy and scaring everyone? No, Mary Carney replies, returning to his key point -- that Britain needs to be ready for Brexit (and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not yet) The issue is preparedness. The thing that people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to worry about is the financial system - it will be there for them. They can focus on what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more important. [reminder: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest lenders all passed the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2018 stress tests yesterday, meaning they could survive a disorderly Brexit] Carney ends his interview by insisting that the Bank is only a sideshow in the Brexit drama. The financial system is just a servant of the economy, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been far too centre state for far too long. What happens to this economy, [those] very important decisions are being made by others. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the interview. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll wrap up some reaction now. Q: What is so good about Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit deal? Mark Carney plays a straight, technocratic bat, saying it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not up to him to choose between various options: Brexit is a unique situation, where there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a potentially substantial change in the trading relationship with our largest trading partner. In that situation, the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job is to make sure the financial system is prepared, the governor says. Q: 10 years ago, Congress voted down the US bailout, the markets plunged, and then they quickly passed it (this is the TARP drama of 2008). Could that happen again? Carney insists he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speculate on what might happen in parliament. But he repeats that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy needs more time to get ready for life outside the EU, saying: Parliament will determine the type of Brexit, and the path we take to get there. It is advisable to have a transition to whatever form of Brexit parliament chooses Q: So the reality is that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not ready, so what happens when MPs vote down Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit deal on December 11? Carney declines to discuss hypothetical scenarios (!), but repeats that a lot of work still needs to be done to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Best as we can tell\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s businesses and infrastructure aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready yet. Carney says there needs to be an objective view taken about how much time is needed, in an implementation period after Brexit. He points out that the deal agreed last weekend allows the implementation period to be extended Q: Is that a good idea? From a financial system perspective, an 18-24 month period is sufficient, Carney replies (ie, the base case in the Withdrawal Agreement). For the economy as a whole... it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up for others to say, he adds. It is sensible to take a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sober, objective view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about how much time we need to get to where we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going with Brexit, Carney adds. Q: But your critics say you are playing politics, trying to scare people....Andrew Sentance, a former Bank policymaker, says your analysis is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchighly speculative and extreme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Carney denies it, saying: We have a broad responsibility to get the system ready for whatever happens, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been doing it since the referendum. Parliament demanded this analysis, but it is analysis with a purpose - to get the financial system ready for whatever form of Brexit the country takes. Q: Aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you trying to scare people into accepting the sort of Brexit you want? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a preference, Carney insists. But he does agree that the Bank \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prefers a transition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd period (as under Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan) It is in the interest of the country to have some time to transition to whatever relationship there is. We know from our contacts with business that less than half of the businesses in this country have intiated their contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit. Q: But a company boss, maybe the CEO of Nissan, could hear your apocalyptic scenarios and say \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmy god, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to get out of here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122? Carney says company bosses are also responsible for preparing for the worst case scenarios. They understand what the Bank is saying, and they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t misinterpret it. Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interview with John Humphrys is on the Today Programme now. Q: What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the difference between a forecast and a scenario? The governor says its the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job to look at what could go wrong with Brexit - tariffs, problems at the ports, financial markets fall. It then puts these \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very negative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd outcomes into a scenario, to determine what would happen to the banking sector, and then ensure the banks have more than enough capital to absorb those losses. Then we know, they know, and the public knows, that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re able to cope. As Carney puts it: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most likely to happen. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what could happen if everything goes wrong, and we use that to help make sure things go better. Mark Carney insisted several times yesterday that his Brexit analysis was a scenario, not a forecast (although this fine distinction gets lost). Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: The Bank is not actually saying that the economy is going to shrink by 8% in a single year. For that to occur, three conditions would need to be fulfilled: the UK would need to leave the EU without a deal next spring; that departure would come as a bolt from the blue; and it would prompt punitive action from Brussels. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is what could happen,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most likely to happen.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But even so, this could be a final attempt to spook MPs into backing Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit deal, Larry adds: In the weeks leading up to the EU referendum in June 2016, both the Bank and the Treasury issued warnings of the bad things that would happen in the event of a vote to leave, none of which came true. This time the constituency is much smaller: the 600-odd MPs who will vote on May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU agreement early next month. It looks like the last roll of the dice. Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit analysis is all over the UK front pages today. The Telegraph leads the coverage of the criticism of the governor, saying he has unleashed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcProject Hysteria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mark Carney has been accused of undermining the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcindependence and credibility\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 after publishing an analysis of the economic impacts of no deal so bleak it has been dubbed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcproject hysteria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a full round-up: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is in the eye of a political storm today after warning that a no-deal Brexit could plunge Britain into the worst recession since the second world war. Analysis released last night warned that the economy will shrink by an eye-watering 8%, house prices would plunge by a third, sterling would slump to parity with the US dollar, and interest rates will soar if Britain left the EU without a deal. Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message was clear - the economy would suffer badly from a no-deal scenario, and many companies simply aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Evidence from surveys and other UK authorities suggests that the country is not yet fully prepared for a cliff-edge Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In sharp contrast, the Bank also provided Theresa May with some support -- arguing that her deal would be better for economic growth. However, it also predicted that GDP would have been at least 1% higher in five years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time if the UK had voted to remain; a boost to those pushing for a People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vote on the final deal. Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s critics (and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attracted a few since joining the Bank in 2013), have accused him of undermining the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence and credibility. One (alas unnamed) minister has told the Daily Telegraph that the analysis is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mad, bonkers and b------s\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcb\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is for Brexit...) Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg went particularly low, dubbing Carney a failed second-tier Canadian politician -- a jibe that attracted some stinging rebukes over his attempts to overthrow Theresa May. Justice secretary David Gauke has also weighed in: Anyway, Carney can defend himself - and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to this morning. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due on Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme shortly to discuss the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts.
