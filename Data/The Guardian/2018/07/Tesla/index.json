                "bodyText":"Time for a recap. Worries over a potential trade war have weighed on market today, as factories report that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent move towards protectionism is hurting. Asian stock markets tumbled by around 2% overnight, triggering a selloff in Europe. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has just closed, down 89 points or nearly 1.2%. The French CAC shed 0.9%. The losses came after Donald Trump claimed that Europe was as bad as China when it came to trade. That has fuelled concerns that the US could impose tariffs on EU car imports. Europe has already fired a warning shot to Washington, saying it would impose retaliatory tariffs on $300bn of US sales into the EU. The US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, has defended the White House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions, insisting that the global trade system needed to be reformed. Ross also declared that the recent stock market volatility wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t force the administration to change its policies. David Madden of CMC Markets explainsays : The ongoing trade standoff between the US and China has triggered a wave of selling, as traders are fearful the tarifffs could hurt economic growth and bring about a slowdown. There are already signs that the prospect of a trade war is hurting growth. European factory growth slowed last month, with many bosses blaming uncertainty over tariffs for a drop in confidence. Data firm Markit reported that output and new order growth eased in June, while business optimism hit the lowest level this year. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on steel and aluminium, and the prospect of action on Chinese imports, is also having an effect on American manufacturing. US factory bosses have reported a drop in confidence, and a big jump in input prices, as they await the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next move. Back in the UK, UBS have warned that the pound could slide against the euro in the coming weeks, as the Brexit negotiations come to the boil. The US stock market is recovering some ground, but the Dow is still down 100 points (0.45%) today. ISM have also reported that every commodity got more expensive for US factories last month. That suggests that firms were scrambling to lay their hands on raw materials before a trade war breaks out. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to retaliate against America if Trump delivers on his threat to impose 20% tariffs on EU car imports. Donald Trump will put a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tax on the American people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if he goes ahead with a threat to hit European carmakers with punitive tariffs, the European Unionhas warned. In a hard-hitting paper, the European commission said Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self-defeating and would weaken the US economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, estimating that almost $300bn (\u00c2\u00a3228bn) worth of US goods could be hit by countermeasures. The warning comes in the commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first detailed response to the US department of commerce following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to hit imports of European cars with tariffs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The European Union is possibly as bad as China, only smaller,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the US president told Fox News on Sunday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They send a Mercedes in, we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t send our cars in,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he claimed. The EU imposes a 10% tariff on US-built cars, while the US levies a 2.5% tariff on cars assembled in Europe and a 25% tariff on European-built vans and pick-up trucks. More here: The US Institute of Supply Management has also reported that tariffs are having a negative effect on American factories. ISM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey of US manufacturing found that factories are finding it harder to get supplies delivered on time. That suggests that recent curbs on steel and aluminium imports are already having an effect (echoing what Markit reported a few minute earlier) Timothy Fiore, chairman of the ISM Business Survey Committee, says that trade war fears are weighing on the sector. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lead-time extensions, steel and aluminum disruptions, supplier labor issues, and transportation difficulties continue. Demand remains robust, but the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment resources and supply chains continue to struggle. Respondents are overwhelmingly concerned about how tariff related activity is and will continue to affect their business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite these concerns, ISM reports that American manufacturing grew at the fastest pace in four months in June. Newsflash: American factories are also feeling the impact of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade dispute. Data firm Markit has just reported that US manufacturing growth hit a four-month low last month. New order growth slowed to the lowest rate since November 2017, which American factory bosses blamed on recent tariffs. US purchasing managers also reported that input prices kept climbing last month. This was due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153greater global demand for inputs and the effects of recent tariffs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Markit says. This pulled the US manufacturing PMI down to 55.4 in June, down from 56.4 in May (so showing slower growth). Donald Trump has argued that US manufacturing will benefit from his actions, as companies will be encouraged to seek domestic alternatives to imported goods (once they incur an extra tariffs). But Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says tariffs are having a negative effect on the sector: Business optimism about the year ahead also fell to the lowest since January, with survey respondents worried in particular about the potential impact of trade wars and tariffs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tariffs were widely blamed on a further marked rise in input costs, and also linked to worsening supply chain delays \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which hit the highest on record, exacerbating existing tight supply conditions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd DING DING: Wall Street has joined the global selloff at the start of trading in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 180 points, or 0.75%, at the open to 24,085 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 is also down around 0.7%. US traders are concerned that the trade dispute between the US and Europe appears to be deepening, with president Trump claiming that the EU was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as bad as China\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The big concern is that Trump may decide to impose tariffs on imports of cars from Europe (as he threatened last month). The news that the EU has threatened to retaliate with tariffs on $300bn of US imports suggests that tit-for-tat tariffs could hurt economic growth. The US commerce secretary has insisted that market volatility won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deter Donald Trump from shaking up the global trade system. In an interview with CNBC, Wilbur Ross said the US president was determined to push through changes - even if it creates uncertainty that drags stock markets down. Ross argued that the US economy is in good shape, with strong capital expenditure and employment growth - and more jobs available than unemployed people to fill them. All these claims that the sky is falling are at least premature and probably inaccurate. Q: But, the markets have fallen in recent weeks as the trade disputes have gathered pace.... Ross suggests the White House isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t concerned -- especially as US stocks have risen so sharply since Trump won the 2016 presidential election. The stock market hates uncertainty, business hates uncertainty, everyone hates uncertainty. The worst fear is the first of the unknown. But in the end arithmetic prevails, facts prevail, and fears are either realised or they go away. Q: What if the stock market fell 20% from its highs (the definition of a Bear Market)? Ross is adamant that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bright line level\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that would force a change of policy. The president is trying to fix long-term problems that should have been dealt with a long time ago. Obviously there will be some pushing and tugging as we try to deal with very serious problems. There will be some hiccups along the way. Ross also played down reports that Trump might yank America out of the WTO. He argues that the WTO itself understands that some reforms are needed, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153premature\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to talk about withdrawing from the whole agreement. Over in Athens the Bank of Greece has released its much-awaited monetary policy report on the state of the economy following last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key debt-relief package. The report - handed to the Greek parliament this morning - says the agreement reached with euro zone creditors on June 21 offers debt sustainability in the medium term but over the longer term only further reforms and more relief would guarantee it continued. The warning echoed similar concerns expressed by the International Monetary Fund last week. But while the Bank insisted that Greece should take stock of a precautionary credit line once it exits its last international rescue programme in August, it also said the debt relief deal would facilitate the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s return to the capital markets from which it has been excluded for the best part of a decade. Accessing markets again would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the last and decisive indication that the Greek economy had surpassed the crisis,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it said. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leftist-led coalition is bitterly against agreeing to a credit line that would be perceived to compromise the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclean exit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from bailout oversight. In the report, the Bank of Greece governor, Yiannis Stournaras, said he foresaw growth rates of 2% and 2.3% for this year and next. The pound is flat against the euro today, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.13, meaning one euro is worth around 88.5p. But Brexit uncertainty is still swirling, as Theresa May tries to devise a customs deal which her cabinet can support (and which the EU will accept). UBS Global Wealth Management have advised clients to buy the euro against the pound, predicting that sterling will slide in the weeks ahead - especially if negotiations with Brussels fail to make progress. Dean Turner, their UK economist, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve long been advocates that economics not politics should drive markets. However, the current stalemate between the UK and Europe on a Brexit deal cannot be overlooked. In the near future, it is not just events in Threadneedle Street that will matter. Downing Street will be equally important in the minds of markets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Businesses have been fairly resilient in the face of Brexit uncertainty, but they may not stand for much more. If the negotiations drag on we expect confidence in a transition deal to wane. This poses a tangible risk to the economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect there to be a drag on sterling in the coming months as the Brexit back and forth continues.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of a big breakthrough yet. Instead, Brussels officials say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unimpressed by the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest efforts to maintain close ties to the EU while also restricting migration. More here: Worries over trade wars are pushing many currencies down today, as traders seek the safety of the US dollar. The pound is down half a cent against the dollar at $1.315, while the euro has lost a similar amount to trade around $1.163. Emerging market currencies are also suffering; the Indian rupee hit its lowest level since 2013 against the dollar today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a bad year for many emerging market currencies; the rupee, the ruble and the yuan are all down in 2018 (the Turkish lira and the Argentinian peso have really slumped, but partly for non trade-war reasons....) Over in California, Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employees should have enjoyed a good night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep after finally hitting their production targets. The electric carmaker succeeded in churning out 5,000 of its Model 3 model last week, after a major push which saw founder Elon Musk spend his birthday on the production line. It was all worth it, though, as Musk told staff that : \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We did it! What an incredible job by an amazing team.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Musk also tweeted about his jubilation.... ...and found himself gently teased by the European boss of Ford: Ford do have rather a headstart in car production, of course... The price of copper has hit its lowest level since late March, as investors fear that tariffs are hurting economic growth. Reuters has the details: Benchmark copper was down 0.5% at $6,585 a tonne at 1040 GMT from an earlier $6,550 a tonne, its lowest since March 26. Prices of the metal used widely in power and construction have tumbled 10 percent since June 7. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors are taking risk off the table because of trade tensions, which threaten Chinese exports to the United State sand also their profit margins,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said SP Angel analyst John Meyer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Industrial metals rely on China.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The selloff is partly due to this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory data, showing that Chinese factories suffered a drop in export orders last month. The US stock market is expected to drop when trading begins in three and a half hours, following the lead from Asia and Europe. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is being called down 167 points, or 0.7% while the S&amp;P 400 is expected to drop 16 points or 0.5%. Back the markets, shares continue to be buffeted by trade war worries. The main European indices are all in the red, after Donald Trump and the EU both raised the ante in their ongoing tariff dispute. This follows those heavy losses in Asia, where major markets lost over 2% Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the damage: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100: down 77 points, or 1%, at 7,558 French CAC: down 53 points or 1% at 5,270 German DAX: down 55 points or 0.5% at 12,250 Fiona Cincotta of City Index says markets are also suffering from the news that Canada has slapped tariffs on US imports (in retaliation for Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier actions). She explains: From Sunday Canada started imposing trade tariffs on $12.6 billion worth of American goods including iron, orange juice and whiskey in response to the US tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium which were introduced on 22 June. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s northern neighbour joins the ranks of the EU and Mexico, both of which have also hit back against US import tariffs with tariffs of their own, with Mexico penalising imports of US pork, steel, cheese and apples and the EU levying duties on whiskey, motorcycles and orange juice. Amid the trade whirlwind investors are now increasingly looking for stocks that will be the least effected by the tariff tit-for-tat although it is difficult to say what these stocks may be given that Donald Trump has already said he intends to respond with another set of trade tariffs in response to his trade partners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reaction. Finally, some good news. Unemployment across the eurozone is its lowest since the financial crisis began a decade ago. The euro-area jobless rate was 8.4% in May, statistics body Eurostat reports, matching April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest reading since December 2008. In the wider EU, unemployment was a healthier 7.0% - the best since August 2008, shortly before the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered a global downturn. Encouragingly, unemployment has fallen in every eurozone country in the last 12 months. But there are still wide disparities in the region. Eurostat says: Among the Member States, the lowest unemployment rates in May 2018 were recorded in the Czech Republic (2.3%) and Germany (3.4%). The highest unemployment rates were observed in Greece (20.1% in March 2018) and Spain (15.8%). Economists are concerned by this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory growth figures from the UK and the eurozone. Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst says there is weakness at the heart of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector: Growth is lower as manufacturing business rely on backlogs and inventory building to keep machines working, something that cannot continue for too much longer. Similarly, businesses are passing on higher costs to customers but there will be a limit as to how much those customers can or will take. Risks for the sector remain in everything from the weakness of sterling, the threat of trade tariffs and more difficult international trade terms, Brexit and those higher input prices from commodity markets. The trend in UK manufacturing is one of weakness and this figure confirms that fact.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ms Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturing group EEF, is concerned that factory growth slowed across Europe last month: With the rest of the EU being a dominant source of growth over the past year this slowdown, in part driven by fears about global trade tensions, could be a further signal of more weakness to come.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lee McDarby, Corporate IP Managing Director at moneycorp, thinks Brexit is making companies too nervous to invest right now: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In normal times we would expect the weak pound, especially against the Dollar, to have translated into higher manufacturing growth. These are not normal times, however. The weakness of sterling is reflective of investor concern about Brexit and the strength of the UK economy and it could be that these same concerns are holding back manufacturers from investing in growth Newsflash: factory growth in Britain remained steady last month, but bosses are getting gloomier. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK manufacturing PMI has come in at 54.4 this morning, slightly up on May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 54.3 (reminder, any reading over 50 shows growth). But the survey also found that new order growth remained subdued, meaning companies relied on existing business and inventory building to keep their staff busy. Markit says: Although the rate of increase in new business edged up to a three-month high, it remained among the weakest registered over the past year- and-a-half. Business optimism also dropped last month, to a seven-month low, Markit adds. Some firms expressed concerns about input price increases, possible future trade tariffs, the exchange rate and Brexit uncertainty. Newsflash: eurozone factory growth has slowed to an 18-month low - another sign that trade war fears are hurting the economy. Data firm Markit reports that output and new order growth at European firms has slowed this year, and that factory bosses are more pessimistic about future business. This has dragged Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone manufacturing PMI, which tracks activity in the sector, down to 54.9 from 55.5 in May. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the weakest reading since the start of 2017, and closer to the 50-point mark that shows stagnation. According to Markit, factory production grew at the slowest pace since November 2016 while new business growth was the weakest since August 2016. This pulled business optimism down to its lowest level in over two-and-a-half years. The survey also found that France is lagging behind other eurozone nations: Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, is particularly concerned that exports orders remain subdued: The biggest concern is the extent to which export order book growth has cooled since the start of the year, and could soon go into decline. The survey reveals mounting worries from companies relating to the impact of tariffs and trade wars, suggesting firms are bracing themselves for the potential for further export losses. Not surprisingly, business expectations for future production deteriorated in June to the lowest November 2015. City economist Paul Donovan of UBS isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that Europe is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as bad as China\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when it comes to trade. He says: US President Trump sounded upset about Europeans selling Americans things Americans want to buy. The Financial Times reports the EU is threatening to tax a fifth of US exports if the US imposes taxes on consumption of EU autos and auto parts. That would be a trade war. US carmakers are lobbying against the proposed US taxes, showing that tariffs are an outdated concept. July has started in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153troubled mood\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx, as he watches the main European markets slide into the red. Campbell blames the trade war fears that are rippling through trading floors today: Trump kicked off July by targeting the EU, not China, saying that the region was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpossibly as bad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as Beijing in how it treats the US, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjust smaller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This has sent the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous threat of tariffs on EU car imports back to the top of investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTo Fear\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lists, with the added spice of a report from the Financial Times suggesting the European Union could respond in kind with tariffs of $300 billion on US products. Financial stocks are also having a bad morning. The Stoxx 600 banks index, which tracks Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest banks, has dropped by 1.9% in the first few minutes of trading. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has fallen by 72 points, or almost 1%, at the start of trading. That takes the blue-chip index of top shares down to 7574 points. Mining companies are leading the selloff, with Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton both down over 2%. That reflects the fact that demand for iron ore, coal, nickel, copper and oil will all fall if Europe and America hit each other with tit-for-tat tariffs. Other European markets have also opened in the red, with the German DAX shedding 1.3% at the open. Konstantinos Anthis, Head of Research at trading firm ADSS, says Investors are worried about the stalemate in discussions within Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Germany coalition government and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intention to slap China with more tariffs. In a worrying sign, Chinese factories are suffering from falling export orders. Data firm Caixin has reported that new export sales at Chinese manufacturing firms shrank last month, for the third month in a row. That may be a signal that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs are already hurting global trade. Caixin also flagged up that Chinese factories are shedding jobs, as some don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough work lined up. Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, explains: The index for new export orders fell to a low for the year so far and remained in contraction territory, pointing to a grim export situation amid escalating trade disputes between China and the U.S., which led to weak demand across the manufacturing sector. Asian stock markets are a sea of red today, as traders fret about the prospect of a global trade war. Every major share index is in the red, and many emerging market currencies are sliding against the US dollar again. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim yesterday that Europe was treating the US unfairly has helped to drive markets down. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose fresh tariffs on American goods has also alarmed investors: A ramping up of trade war headlines over the weekend, such as a strong warning of retaliation from the EU and a potential currency war with China (US), will ensure that the fear of an all out global trade war is central in trader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind, as the session begins on Monday. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The second half of the financial year is beginning where the first half left off, with rising anxiety over a trade war. Overnight, Donald Trump has launched a fresh attack on the European Union, claiming it treated the US very badly and was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153possibly as bad as China, just smaller\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Speaking on Fox News, the US president declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Look what they do to our farmers, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want our farm products. In all fairness they have their farmers so they want to protect their farmers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t protect ours and they protect theirs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments raise the prospect that the US could impose further tariffs on EU imports - possibly on car imports (something he threatened last month). Europe isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taking Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sledging lying down, though. According to the Financial Times, the EU has threatened to retaliate with tariffs on up to $300bn of US products, if the US does indeed penalise EU carmakers. The threat of retaliatory tariffs on US imports into Europe came in a written submission to the US Department of Commerce, outlining how the bloc would respond to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threats. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jim Brunsden explains: Brussels said that an American investigation into whether foreign cars and parts posed a national security risk could plunge the global economy into a full-on trade war, harming employment in the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auto sector, which accounts for more than 4m jobs. In a sign of the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exasperation at Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confrontational trade policy, which has already stoked tensions over steel and aluminium, the document said the move \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could result in yet another disregard of international law\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the US. It said imposing the car tariffs would not be accepted by the international community and would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153damage further the reputation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the US. This has already sparked a selloff in Asia, where Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CSI 300 index have both shed 2%. European markets are set for losses at the open too, with the FTSE 100 called down 50 points. Also coming up today Data firm Markit is publishing its latest Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) reports, showing how manufacturing companies across the world fared last month. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll show whether the threat of a global trade war has hurt factories. And in Germany, Angela Merkel is still locked in battle with her CSU coalition over migration. Last night, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interior minister reportedly announced his intention to resign - a move that could bring down the Chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasingly shaky coalition. Merkel and Horst Seehofer are due to hold fresh talks this afternoon, so the great survivor of European politics could yet see off another crisis. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9am BST: Eurozone manufacturing PMI for June 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI for June 10am BST: Eurozone unemployment figures for May 3pm BST: US manufacturing PMI for June",

                "bodyText":"Fitch could also downgrade some US companies if they are hurt by the trade dispute with China. It already has a negative outlook on the Alabama State Port Authority, due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncertainty over trade policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and the likely impact on revenues. Fitch explains: The largest portion of the port\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade value with China is made up of wood pulp and other agricultural products, but it is also exposed more broadly to the metallurgical coal and steel markets. The port has relatively high exposure to commodities, particularly coal and steel, which comprise over 50% of revenues and nearly 50% of overall tonnage. Ratings agency Fitch has identified the US states most vulnerable to a trade war with China. Fitch says that Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and Indiana all exported more than $1.2bn of plant products, such as soybeans, to China in 2016. However, plant-based exports to China made up a bigger percentage of the state economies of South Dakota, North Dakota, Iowa and Nebraska. Fitch explains: Exports to China make up more than 20% of the total agricultural output in both South and North Dakota and in excess of 10% in Iowa and Nebraska. While Illinois is the largest producer of soybeans in the US, the state is likely to be less affected by a fall in demand for US soybeans due to its more diversified, larger economy. Total plant product exports to China as a percentage of the economy of Illinois was less than 1% 2016. Global stock markets are recovering from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff, despite anxiety over a US-China trade war. In London, the FTSE 100 is up 50 points, or 0.66%, at 7642. The French CAC is 0.7% higher while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has gained 0.3%. That follows a stronger day in China, where the Shanghai market clawed back yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. This positive mood has extended to Wall Street, where the Dow has jumped over 100 points in early trading. Artjom Hatsaturjants, Research Analyst at Accendo Markets says: The FTSE has staged a strong rebound, retracing nearly all of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off. All the while Donald Trump continues to play the disruptive \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 amongst the rest of NATO \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpigeon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 allies. Sentiment improved despite continued uncertainty on whether US and China still have each other in trade cross-hairs, or if negotiators are ready to sit down again. US washing machine prices have surged by over 13% in the last year, in another sign that protectionism can drive up the cost of living. Donald Trump imposed new tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels in January, saying he wanted to protect US jobs. But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report shows that the move has hit shoppers in the pocket. Core US inflation (stripping out volatile factors) also rose last month, from 2.2% to 2.3%. Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics predicts it will keep rising, especially if new levies are imposed on Chinese imports (as tariffs are paid by consumers, not producers). with the labour market exceptionally tight and activity expanding strongly, we think that core inflation has further to rise. The prospect of further tariffs on Chinese imports will only add to that upward pressure. The US economy is heating up, says James Knightley of ING, and that makes future interest rate rises more likely. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on the jump in American inflation to 2.9% last month. The US has an economy that probably grew 4% in the second quarter, has an inflation rate rapidly heading to 3% at the same time as arguably experiencing the strongest labour market for 50 years. This suggests that even with the uncertainty generated by trade protectionism the Federal Reserve should continue tightening monetary policy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gradually\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This is certainly the line that we expect the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s semi-annual monetary policy report to take on Friday. We continue to look for two further rate rises this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one in 3Q and one in 4Q18. The jump in US inflation to 2.9% means that American real wages are falling. Average earnings only rose by 2.7% in June, last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report showed. That means that pay isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keeping pace with rising prices. Economist Joseph Brusuelas thinks a trade war would make that situation even worse: Newsflash: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has struck a six-year high, as US citizens are hit by higher prices in the shops. The US Consumer Price Index rose by 2.9% in June, compared to a year earlier. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s te highest rate since 2012. On a monthly basis, prices rose by just 0.1% compared to May, compared to 0.2% a month ago. Fuel prices rose by 0.2% in June, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says, driven by pricier dairy, cereal, fruit and vegetable products Gasoline prices rose by 0.5%, and housing costs were 0.1% higher. The tariffs outlined by America yesterday would push up the cost of many food products and consumer goods from China, potentially pushing inflation up. The European Central Bank is worried that the increase in trade protectionism in recent months is hurting the European economy. The minutes of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last meeting, just released, show that policymakers believe that trade tensions have become a greater threat,. They cite Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium from Europe, and the threat of tariffs on car imports. The minutes say: While the expected upward impact of fiscal stimulus in the United States remained in place, geopolitical risks had not abated and trade tensions were considered to have become more likely. In particular, concerns were expressed about the possibility that such tensions could lead to a more general decline in confidence throughout the global economy, beyond any direct effects from the imposition of tariffs. Against this background, the balance of risks to the global economic expansion continued to be assessed as tilted to the downside. The ECB points out that a trade war can affect the economy in various ways. 1) Tariffs and trade barriers can drive up prices, fuelling inflation 2) Protection leads to falling exports, which hurts economic confidence and weakens demand. The ECB adds: In this context, risks associated with heightened volatility in global financial markets were also highlighted more broadly. Newsflash: The UK government has given Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox the green light for its attempted takeover of Sky. This clears the way for a proper takeover battle between 21CF (which raised its offer to \u00c2\u00a314 per Sky share yesterday) and US media group Comcast (which hit back with a \u00c2\u00a314.75 per share bid last night). Sky shares have risen today, to \u00c2\u00a315.37 each, showing that the City expects another bid.... Valdis Dombrovskis, Vice-President for the Euro, says Europe needs to protect itself against the threat of a global trade war: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153European economic activity remains solid with 2.1% GDP growth forecast for the euro area and the EU28 this year. Nevertheless, the downward revision of GDP growth since May shows that an unfavourable external environment, such as growing trade tensions with the US, can dampen confidence and take a toll on economic expansion. The growing external risks are yet another reminder of the need to strengthen the resilience of our individual economies and the euro area as a whole.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: The European Commission has cut its growth forecast for Europe this year, and blamed the rising threat of a trade war. The EC now expects the eurozone and the EU to both only grow by 2.1% this year, down from 2.3% predicted three months ago. It reckons that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic momentum has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moderated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after more than a year of strong growth. It has slashed its forecast for German growth to 1.9% in 2018 (down from 2.3%) and also 1.9% in 2019 (down from 2.1%). Britain is now expected to only grow by 1.3% this year (down from 1.5% in the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spring forecasts) and by 1.2% in 2019 (unchanged). That would make the UK the joint-slowest growing EU economy this year, along with Italy. Pierre Moscovici, Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs, says the threat of a trade war is hurting Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Growth in Europe is set to remain resilient, as monetary policies stay accommodative and unemployment continues to fall. The slight downward revision compared to the spring reflects the impact on confidence of trade tensions and policy uncertainty, as well as rising energy prices. Our forecast is for a continued expansion in 2018 and 2019, although a further escalation of protectionist measures is a clear downside risk. Trade wars produce no winners, only casualties.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in Beijing, China has hit out at America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose tariffs on $200bn of its goods -- and called on US companies to help. The Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng warned that the escalating trade dispute between the two countries would hurt the global economy, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China resolutely opposes such behaviour and will have to take the necessary countermeasures. However, we still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know exactly how China plans to hit back (as it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t import enough from America to simply impose reciprocal tariffs). Gao suggested that US firms with operations in China could put pressure on the White House to change course. He cited industrial group GE, Qualcomm and carmakers Ford, BMW and Tesla as examples of companies who have recently increased production capacity in China. Trade war fears have forced South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank to cut its growth forecast today. The Bank of Korea has trimmed its growth outlook for South Korea to 2.9%, from 3%. Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol told reporters that the tit-for-tat tariffs imposed between America and other nations are a serious concern. He added that South Korean exports could be hit (echoing the trade ministry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier warning). Ju-yeol said (via Associated Press): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Uncertainties in growth path are higher than ever and the major source of the uncertainties is global trade conflicts. At first we thought the trade conflicts among major economies would not grow further, but as they deepen day by day, now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very difficult to tell where they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re headed to.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at Yale University, also thinks America will lose out if it keeps slapping tariffs on Chinese imports. He told CNBC this morning that trade wars are not easy to win (something Donald Trump claimed earlier this year). They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re easy to lose, and the U.S. is on track to lose this trade war. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is live ammunition. This is not just rhetorical discussion any more,. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the early stages of fighting skirmishes in a real, live trade war. The question is, how far does it go? And how significant will the ammunition be in the future?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wayne McCurrie of South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s First National Bank fears that global growth will be damaged if the US-China trade dispute keeps escalating. Tom Rafferty of the Economist Intelligence Unit points out that China could cushion the blow of tariffs if it allows its currency to weaken. Naeem Aslam of City firm Think Markets expects Beijing to retaliate soon: Trump is serious about punishing China, he is picking up the areas where it would hurt the most. Although, market participants still aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t factoring in a full trade war. The hope is that China and US would be able to resolve this matter through bilateral agreement. But uncertainty around this matter has anchored up. The sad aspect is none of the parties are ready to throw in the towel yet which makes me think that there is no resolution in insight yet. Beijing has threatened for retaliation action against the current measures. Therefore, over the coming days, I would expect a tit-for-tat reaction from China-unless the bilateral discussions resume between the two parties. The alarming area is if China chooses to go after the multinational companies which are operating in China. Certainly, that is the area where it would create more wounds. We think that the odds are high that China would specifically pick on US firms or at least it would shift the grounds in such a way that other foreign firms would have more privileges being in China on relative perspective. After all, China isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to sit on its hand and see its GDP dragging lower by another 0.2% if the new tariffs become effective. The car industry is also worried by America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s belligerent stance on trade. The labour union of South Korean manufacturer Hyundai warned that tens of thousands of US jobs could be lost if China and the US don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t step back from a trade war. Hyundai employs around 20,000 workers at a factory in Alabama, and also operates plants in China, India, Russia, Turkey, Brazil, and the Czech Republic, as well as in South Korea. In a statement, the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s union warned that overseas factory could be the first to close if sales are hit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If South Korean car exports to the U.S. get blocked and hurt sales, the U.S. factory in Alabama that went into operation in May 2005 could be the first one to be shut down, putting some 20,000 American workers at risk of layoffs. The South Korean trade ministry is worried that demand for its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcintermediary goods\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will be hurt, if America imposes tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods. These are products which are assembled to create a final product (for example, memory chips and hard drives used to build a computer). The ministry explained: As Chinese electronics, computers and communications equipment were included in the additional list of tariffs, Korean companies are worried their exports of intermediary goods used in those items could decrease if the tariffs are imposed. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. City traders will be trudging wearily to their desks this morning after last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gripping World Cup drama, and worrying about the impact of a US-China trade war. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose tariffs on an extra $200bn of Chinese imports is causing rising anxiety. South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government has weighed in this morning, warning that its exports could be hurt by the escalating dispute between Washington and Beijing. South Korea is a major producer of technological products -- such as components used in electrical devices, computers and mobile phones. It fears that demand for these exports could slide if the global trade systems gums up. Deputy Minister for Trade Kang Sung-chun told Reuters that Seoul is watching the situation closely: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have detailed analysis (on which products will be affected by the U.S.-China trade war),\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The impact will be mixed. There will be both positive and negative effects. Some Korean exports could replace Chinese goods to be slapped with tariffs, for example. Global stock markets fell heavily yesterday after the US Trade Representative outlined plans for a 10% tariff on other 6,000 individual Chinese imports (everything from meat and vegetables to stamps and baseball mitts). The FTSE 100 lost 1.3%, or 100 points, while the Dow Jones industrial average ended down 219 points or 0.9%. Shares are rising a little this morning, but any fresh retaliations between the two sides could undermine the rally.

                "body":"<p>Who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s afraid of Jeremy Corbyn? The board of John Laing Infrastructure Fund (JLIF), which invests in trains, hospitals, schools, police stations and so on, seems to be. It is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153minded to recommend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a takeover offer at 142.5p, or \u00c2\u00a31.45bn, a price it surely would have rejected without a second thought last September when JLIF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares stood at 139p.</p> <p>JLIF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to smile upon the joint approach from Dalmore Capital and Equitix Investment Management owes much to the political heat around PFI projects, which comprise the bulk of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s portfolio. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/25/john-mcdonnell-labour-would-bring-pfi-contracts-back-in-house\">described</a> PFI as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153waste of taxpayer money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s party conference last year and said he wanted to nationalise. JLIF said soon afterwards that it would expect to get only 86% of book value if all of its 57 PFI contracts were taken back into public control. Confidence in PFI was further dented when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/carillion\">Carillion collapsed</a> in the new year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/16/senior-executives-face-clampdown-selling-share-awards\">Senior executives face clampdown on selling share awards</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In this unpromising climate, JLIF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares fell as low as 110p in April and were only 118p at the end of last week. That explains the board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s willingness to talk to Dalmore and Equitix. On a bald calculation, the bidders are offering a 20% premium to the share price. They are also offering more than the book value of the assets \u00e2\u20ac\u201cabout 130p, according to City analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 latest estimates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which will have been a key consideration. If the stock market is not willing to shoulder the political risks, the scope to raise equity for expansion is limited. Thus the decision to talk to the would-be bidders looks simultaneously timid and logical.</p> <p>The interesting question is why Dalmore and Equitix spy value where others see danger. Perhaps they think Corbyn will never reach Downing Street. Perhaps, as big investors in projects such as the Thames Tideway \u00e2\u20ac\u0153super sewer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the HS1 rail link, they think they are too big to be pushed around.

                "bodyText":"Who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s afraid of Jeremy Corbyn? The board of John Laing Infrastructure Fund (JLIF), which invests in trains, hospitals, schools, police stations and so on, seems to be. It is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153minded to recommend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a takeover offer at 142.5p, or \u00c2\u00a31.45bn, a price it surely would have rejected without a second thought last September when JLIF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares stood at 139p. JLIF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to smile upon the joint approach from Dalmore Capital and Equitix Investment Management owes much to the political heat around PFI projects, which comprise the bulk of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s portfolio. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, described PFI as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153waste of taxpayer money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s party conference last year and said he wanted to nationalise. JLIF said soon afterwards that it would expect to get only 86% of book value if all of its 57 PFI contracts were taken back into public control. Confidence in PFI was further dented when Carillion collapsed in the new year. In this unpromising climate, JLIF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares fell as low as 110p in April and were only 118p at the end of last week. That explains the board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s willingness to talk to Dalmore and Equitix. On a bald calculation, the bidders are offering a 20% premium to the share price. They are also offering more than the book value of the assets \u00e2\u20ac\u201cabout 130p, according to City analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 latest estimates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which will have been a key consideration. If the stock market is not willing to shoulder the political risks, the scope to raise equity for expansion is limited. Thus the decision to talk to the would-be bidders looks simultaneously timid and logical. The interesting question is why Dalmore and Equitix spy value where others see danger. Perhaps they think Corbyn will never reach Downing Street. Perhaps, as big investors in projects such as the Thames Tideway \u00e2\u20ac\u0153super sewer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the HS1 rail link, they think they are too big to be pushed around. Or perhaps, since they are managing money for a lot of pension funds and local authorities, they think a future Labour government wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bite too hard in practice. Whatever the explanation, this situation is odd. Stock markets are giving up on infrastructure and anything vaguely related to PFI. Yet private pools of capital, including pension fund money, are gung ho for more. Even allowing for different investment horizons, both camps can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be right. Wishy-washy formula The UK corporate governance code, it could be said, is an exercise in pointing out to boards what should have been obvious to them in the first place. Still, we should raise a small cheer that the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the guardian of the code, is introducing what could be called a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Persimmon clause\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that would give remuneration committees powers to override \u00e2\u20ac\u0153formulaic outcomes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. If such an arrangement had been in place at the housebuilder, the chief executive Jeff Fairburn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a3100m jackpot via a share-based scheme could have been cut down automatically to a less ridiculous size. As it was, Persimmon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board had failed to put a cap on potential rewards and found itself begging Fairburn and a couple of his colleagues to be less greedy. The chairman and the chair of the pay committee resigned in shame or embarrassment. The FRC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new stricture may prevent similar fiascos in future. Other reforms to be welcomed include the command that boards \u00e2\u20ac\u0153should take into account workforce remuneration\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that executive directors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pensions contributions \u00e2\u20ac\u0153should be aligned with those available to the workforce\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

The relationship between Fiat and Italy, as well as its hometown of Turin, has changed, including from a legal and fiscal point of view, being FCA a Dutch company with fiscal domicile in the UK.</p> <p>The evolution of the company under its guidance is easily summarised in a few numbers: in 2004 when Marchionne took over, Fiat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenue was close to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac47bn, today its exceeds \u00e2\u201a\u00ac140bn. The company profit trebled from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.5bn in 2004 to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.4bn in 2017, while the stock market capitalization of the FCA universe spiralled from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.5bn to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn.</p> <p>After just a weekend to absorb the news markets are now dealing with its consequences. The importance of Marchionne as a leader emerged from the very first minutes after the bell, with FCA, Ferrari and the holding Exor (all these 3 stocks belongs to the FTSE MIB 40, the main basket of the Italian market) opening with heavy losses. Even more under pressure was Ferrari, where Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency should have continued beyond 2019. But after the initial shock the titles of the Fiat galaxy have started to regain some ground: another sign of Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talent: he managed to grow Fiat thanks to his personality, but building a future for the company independent from himself. A future that starts with Jeep, one of the brands that grew the most in recent years, from which the new CEO, Brit Michael Manley, comes from.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b55b40be4b0f7abbc8f153c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-23T11:18:42.982Z\">12.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fiat shares slide after Marchionne steps down</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a04c78319a60cc726471003f98ece221ec7c8882\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a04c78319a60cc726471003f98ece221ec7c8882/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fiat Chrysler Automobiles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Piero Cruciatti/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Italian-US carmaker Fiat Chrysler is facing a very uncertain future today following the shock resignation of long-serving CEO Sergio Marchionne over the weekend.</strong></p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sad tale - Marchionne had run Fiat for over a decade, masterminding the rescue of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chrysler after the financial crisis.

                "bodyText":"And finally, European stock markets have closed down a little, after a quiet session. The FTSE 100 lost 23 points, or 0.3%, to finish at 7,655. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC shed 0.5% while the German DAX dipped by 0.1%. Geopolitical anxiety is weighing on shares, says David Madden of CMC Markets. Stocks are broadly lower as dealers remain nervous about the state of global trading relations. European equities have lost ground as the prospect of a full-blown trade war is weighing on investor confidence. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today... US home sales - the other economic data of note today - are out. And they show that sales fell in June for the third month running, down 0.6% to an annual rate of 5.38 million units, from 5.41 million in May. House prices rose, though - with the average price up 5% year-on-year to $276,900. This suggests a shortage of properties on the market is keeping prices up, leaving some potential buyers unable to get on the housing ladder. Just in: there was no pick-up in consumer confidence across the eurozone in July, according to the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly healthcheck: Having blasted president Rouhani, Donald Trump has turned his attention to another adversary - Jeff Bezos. Trump has tweeted that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Amazon Washington Post\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (er, what?) has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gone crazy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in its recent coverage of him, and repeated his claim that the e-commerce giant isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t paying the postal service enough. Over the weekend, the Washington Post (owned by Amazon-founder Bezos) reported that Trump was privately frustrated with the slow progress in negotiations with North Korea. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack has knocked Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price down by almost 2%: Incidentally, that Supreme Court ruling cited by Trump should allow states to collect more sales tax from e-commerce companies. But it could actually be a win for Amazon, analysts say, as the company already collects sales tax on products it sells directly to US citizens. Wall Street has opened cautiously, as traders wait for Alphabet (Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company) to report its results tonight. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average have both dipped by around 0.1%, following the G20\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning against a trade war. In other auto news, Tesla shares have fallen over 3% in pre-market trading in New York, following reports that it had asked supplies for a financial helping hand. The Wall Street Journal says Tesla has asked some of its suppliers to refund some of its previous spending, as it strives to reach profitability. The WSJ wrote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Silicon Valley electric car company said it is asking its suppliers for cash back to help it become profitable, according to a memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal that was sent to a supplier last week. Tesla requested the supplier return what it calls a meaningful amount of money of its payments since 2016, according to the memo.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd CEO Elon Musk has now confirmed that Tesla is seeking cost reductions from suppliers. Tesla has been burning through its cash pile as it strives to hit its production targets, particularly for its Model 3 vehicle ActivTrades\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 chief analyst Carlo Alberto De Casa says Sergio Marchionne \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs dramatic resignation from Fiat Chrysler has caught everyone by surprise, even insiders at the auto firm. He explains how Marchionne rebuilt Fiat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fortunes, cutting costs (controversially) and boosting revenues Loved or hated Marchionne is the man who made FCA as we know it today. It is difficult to imagine FCA and Ferrari without the man and his unique style. He wore a sweater rather than the traditional suite and a tie as his every day business attire and with is unconventional leadership style he managed to turnaround one of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and often most troubled--industrial realities. Chosen by Umberto Agnelli on his deathbed, Marchionne took the helm of a an almost bankrupt Fiat 14 years ago and turned it into an international powerhouse. This required sacrifices and controversial decisions, including job cuts and an unpopular \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdenationalization\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the company. The relationship between Fiat and Italy, as well as its hometown of Turin, has changed, including from a legal and fiscal point of view, being FCA a Dutch company with fiscal domicile in the UK. The evolution of the company under its guidance is easily summarised in a few numbers: in 2004 when Marchionne took over, Fiat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenue was close to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac47bn, today its exceeds \u00e2\u201a\u00ac140bn. The company profit trebled from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.5bn in 2004 to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.4bn in 2017, while the stock market capitalization of the FCA universe spiralled from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.5bn to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn. After just a weekend to absorb the news markets are now dealing with its consequences. The importance of Marchionne as a leader emerged from the very first minutes after the bell, with FCA, Ferrari and the holding Exor (all these 3 stocks belongs to the FTSE MIB 40, the main basket of the Italian market) opening with heavy losses. Even more under pressure was Ferrari, where Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency should have continued beyond 2019. But after the initial shock the titles of the Fiat galaxy have started to regain some ground: another sign of Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talent: he managed to grow Fiat thanks to his personality, but building a future for the company independent from himself. A future that starts with Jeep, one of the brands that grew the most in recent years, from which the new CEO, Brit Michael Manley, comes from. Italian-US carmaker Fiat Chrysler is facing a very uncertain future today following the shock resignation of long-serving CEO Sergio Marchionne over the weekend. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sad tale - Marchionne had run Fiat for over a decade, masterminding the rescue of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chrysler after the financial crisis. Its share price surged on Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s watch, as he rebuilt Chrysler and also successfully spun off Ferrari, Fiat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultra-luxurious brand. But his stint has ended too soon; complications following shoulder surgery forced Marchionne to step aside over the weekend. Fiat Chryster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board have moved quickly, promoting Michael Manley, the head of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeep brand, as their new CEO. Manley, aged 54, was born in London and trained as an engineer. Jeep is one of Fiat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success stories of the last decade. But Fiat shares have fallen 3.3% today, as investors fret about how the company will cope without Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experience, wisdom, and work ethic. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tommaso Ebhardt has written a touching account of his time trying (and usually failing) to get an interview with Marchionne. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: It was not easy for Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aides and for everyone at the the Italian-American company. He demanded full dedication and had a constant sense of urgency. That cost him some talented executives. Marchionne could also be brutal, which hurt his relationships with CEOs in the industry and with political leaders. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time for BS,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he used to tell me. The son of a policeman, who moved with his family from Italy to a suburb of Toronto at the age of 14, he joined Fiat in 2004 with no experience in the car industry. Marchionne had planned to retire next year, Ebhardy adds: At the dinner in Michigan, the night before his last Detroit auto show, he acknowledged the time was coming to spend more time with his partner. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This business, if you want to do it at least the way I think it should be done, it is all -consuming,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, describing 14- and 16-hour days doing everything from approving Super Bowl commercials to deciding on electric cars. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now I am tired, I want to do something else.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In another blow to Fiat, there are reports that its European chief, Alfredo Altavilla, has stepped down. He was seen as a possible candidate to replace Marchionne, before Manley got the job.... Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is perking up, despite the threat posed by trade tariffs to its export base. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the Bundesbank, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, in its monthly assessment of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. It says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The economy has likely showed better momentum in the spring than at the start of the year. Although it is unlikely that the high growth rates of the past year will be repeated, manufacturing was once again the key economic driving force.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Germany would welcome a pick-up in growth. GDP only rose by 0.3% in the first three months of this year, down from 0.6% in the final quarter of 2017. The oil price is creeping higher, following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blast towards Iranian president Hassan Rouhani a few hours ago. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly modest rally, though; Brent crude is up almost 1% at $73.72 per barrel, which doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suggest the markets are pricing in a new conflict in the Middle East. Arnaud Masset of Swissquote Bank says investors are remembering how Trump tackled North Korea - furious tweets were followed by encouraging noises, and an all-smiles summit with Kim Jong-un. Masset explains: Market participants appeared not too concerned: they are used to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exaggerations. Last summer he promised \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fire and fury\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to North Korea: a year later Kim and Donald are best friends and North Korea has not shut down nuclear production Ryanair is dragging the European markets down, after the budget airline posted a 20% drop in profits. Worryingly for passengers, Ryanair also warned that recent strikes will probably continue this summer, due to an ongoing dispute over pay and conditions with its pilots and cabin crews. Ryanair also warned that the risk of a hard Brexit is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 being underestimated.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, helping to send its shares down over 5% this morning. Rival airline easyJet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are down almost 2%, leading the FTSE 100 fallers in London. European stock markets are solidly in the red this morning, as traders digest the G20\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning on trade tensions. In London the FTSE 100 has lost almost 50 points, or 0.6%, at 7629. Commodity prices are also dipping, reflecting worries that a trade wars will hit demand for agricultural goods. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says investors are focusing on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unsurprisingly inconclusive G20 meeting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of the US Federal Reserve for raising interest rates. In other geopolitical development, Donald Trump has launched a late-night, CAPS-LOCKED blast at Iran: Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ire was sparked after Iranian president Hassan Rouhani warned that the US would regret getting into a conflict with Iran, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mr Trump, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t play with the lion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tail, this would only lead to regret.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd America should know that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace, and war with Iran is the mother of all wars.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The financial markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be taking the war of words too seriously, though, says Paul Donovan of UBS: US President Trump sent out a tweet threatening Iran with all sorts of dire consequences if Iran is mean about the US. The tweet used lots and lots of capital letters. The oil market, understandably reacted \u00e2\u20ac\u201c oil prices fell a tiny bit. It is possible that US President Trump is unfamiliar with Aesop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fable of the boy who cried \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wolf.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After North Korea, markets are less inclined to take the US president seriously. Newsflash: China has fired a warning shot towards Donald Trump after he threatened to slap tariffs on all its exports to America. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters that threats and intimidation on trade won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. He added that China didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to devalue its currency to aid its exports. The yuan strengthened a little today, and is trading around 6.778 to the US dollar, up from 6.81 on Friday. Anti-austerity demonstrators held protests against the G20 and the International Monetary Fund, outside the meeting in Buenos Aires. There was clear anger about Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to seek a $50bn loan from the IMF, with strict promises to cut spending to bring its deficit down. Unions fear the plan will cost thousands of public sector jobs, and recreate the suffering seen in Greece since its debt crisis began. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To jaw-jaw is always better than to war-war\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as Churchill put it. But the talking at the G20 meeting hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yielded a breakthrough in the Washington-Beijing trade row. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reports there had not been any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantive discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with China about trade during the gathering in Argentina. He also argued that the ball is now in their court, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anytime that they want to sit down and negotiate meaningful changes, I and our team are available.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mnuchin also denied that America was being protectionist, insisting that it simply wants trade to be conducted on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fair and reciprocal terms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The G20 meeting has provided fresh evidence that America and her allies (or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfoes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as Donald Trump sometimes sees them) remain split over trade policies. EU financial affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici hit out at president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent tariffs, warning that no-one would win from a trade war. He told a press conference after the meeting that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Protectionism, I want to insist on that, is good for no one. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trade wars are not easy ... they create no winners, only casualties.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moscovici also warned that trade disputes could get worse, given the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery challenging\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 state of global relations. As he put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These meetings have been taking place in an international context which is very challenging. ... Trade tensions remain high and they threaten to escalate further. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Anxiety over a trade war continues to build, after finance ministers and central bankers warned that the risks facing the global economy are risking. After a sometimes bruising G20 meeting in Buenos Aires, finance chiefs from the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advanced economies cautioned that growth is becoming \u00e2\u20ac\u0153less synchronised\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. With inequality rising and geopolitical tensions bubbling away, the G20 fear that the risks to the financial recovery are rising. The G20 meeting ended with a call for more dialogue to prevent trade disputes -- just a few days after US president Trump rattled the markets by threatening to impose tariffs on all Chinese imports. The communique declared that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Global economic growth remains robust and unemployment is at a decade low,. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, growth has been less synchronised recently, and downside risks over the short and medium term have increased.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The G20 cited a series of risks... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These include rising financial vulnerabilities, heightened trade and geopolitical tensions, global imbalances, inequality and structurally weak growth, particularly in some advanced economies. We ... recognize the need to step up dialogue and actions to mitigate risks and enhance confidence.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd These stern words from the G20 are unlikely to deter Trump from pushing his America First agenda, though. So, the threat of a trade war continues to weigh on investors Asian markets are having a mixed day, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Topix down 0.35% and the Australian S&amp;P/ASX 290 down almost 1%. Shares are also dipping in early trading in London, with the FTSE 100 down 0.35% or 26 points at 7652. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: No progress at the G20 over trade issues means trade jitters are being sent through the markets. Asian equity markets dropped lower as traders took risk off the table, whilst flows into safe haven assets were once again on the increase. Safe haven Japanese yen was seen extending Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.9% gain versus the dollar, whilst gold followed a similar pattern. European futures are also pointing to a lower start after the opening bell. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much economic data to distract the City today, apart from US house sales and eurozone consumer confidence data this afternoon. The agenda 3pm BST: Eurozone consumer confidence for July 3pm BST: US house sales for July 6pm BST: Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent speaks to the Society of Professional Economists, London.",
