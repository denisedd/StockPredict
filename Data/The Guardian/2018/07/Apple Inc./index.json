About 180 orchard owners, mostly based in Herefordshire, supply the fruit. Improved productivity, an oversupply of UK-grown apples and a shift among drinkers to sweet fruit ciders has resulted in a glut of the bittersweet apple varieties that make up the backbone of traditional mass-market fare, such as Heineken\u2019s Strongbow. Heineken, the biggest cider producer in the world, is negotiating compensation packages to buy some growers out of their long-term contracts, leaving a question mark hanging over the future of their trees. Grove Farm, at Kimbolton, Herefordshire, has been supplying Bulmers\u2019 cider presses with apples for almost 60 years, recently contributing an annual 50 tonnes.
