Tesco was long ago forced to abandon its go-it-alone approach to global expansion after flopping in the US and China. Getting cosy with Carrefour, a company with which it competes only in eastern Europe, sounds safer from the point of view of shareholders.</p> <p>The open question is who loses from the process of organising food sourcing into a handful of leading global chains. Big consumer goods companies such as Nestl\u00c3\u00a9, Coca-Cola, Unilever and Kraft Heinz are the official targets, since they achieve 15%-plus profit margins while the supermarket trade gets by on about 3%, which is the nub of why Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinks it should be allowed to combine with Asda. Yet the share prices of big branded companies are not obviously trembling in fear of a retailers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 revolt. The market thinks Unilever et al will be perfectly able to look after themselves if the fighting over prices turns rougher.</p> <p>If so, the worries should be for small suppliers and providers of own-label products. Selling to a retailer that sees itself as a part of supranational alliance, created to find supply chain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153efficiencies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, sounds like a very tough gig for them. Tesco, like Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda, swears blind that local producers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in its sights and that small businesses should think fondly of the opportunities to sell to a bigger customer. Treat that claim with scepticism. Life has rarely worked out pleasantly for the little folk when the squeeze is on.</p> <h2>McDonnell has got his wish over Vedanta</h2> <p>Goodbye Vedanta Resources, you will not be missed. The Indian-owned mining company arrived on the London stock market in 2003, a low point in the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rush to welcome all-comers and not ask too many tricky questions about corporate governance.</p> <p>The early years were unproblematic since it was hard not to make good money in the boom years for commodity producers. For the past eight years, however, Vedanta has disappointed its minority shareholders, whose frustrations have not been eased by a tangled corporate structure. Aside from most of a copper mine in Zambia, the London-listed entity owns 50.1% of the Indian-listed Vedanta Ltd, causing endless quarrels over the fair allocation of debt and dividends.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for\u00c2\u00a0Business\u00c2\u00a0Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anil Agarwal, the Indian commodities billionaire whose family trust owns 66.5% of Vedanta Resources, is offering to buy out the minorities at 856p a share. The price looks superficially decent in the sense that it is 27.6% above Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. On the other hand, the premium is only 13.6% if you take a three-month average.</p> <p>The key event in that period was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/28/india-copper-plant-sterlite-vedanta-shut-down-deadly-protests\">killing by Indian police</a> of 13 people protesting against the extension of a copper smelter in the Indian town of Tuticorin, which prompted Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s John McDonnell to call for Vedanta to be delisted to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prevent further reputational damage to London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets from this rogue corporation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>McDonnell has got his wish, although the timing is entirely dictated by Agarwal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desire to simplify the corporate structure.

Big consumer goods companies such as Nestl\u00c3\u00a9, Coca-Cola, Unilever and Kraft Heinz are the official targets, since they achieve 15%-plus profit margins while the supermarket trade gets by on about 3%, which is the nub of why Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinks it should be allowed to combine with Asda. Yet the share prices of big branded companies are not obviously trembling in fear of a retailers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 revolt. The market thinks Unilever et al will be perfectly able to look after themselves if the fighting over prices turns rougher. If so, the worries should be for small suppliers and providers of own-label products. Selling to a retailer that sees itself as a part of supranational alliance, created to find supply chain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153efficiencies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, sounds like a very tough gig for them. Tesco, like Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda, swears blind that local producers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in its sights and that small businesses should think fondly of the opportunities to sell to a bigger customer. Treat that claim with scepticism. Life has rarely worked out pleasantly for the little folk when the squeeze is on. McDonnell has got his wish over Vedanta Goodbye Vedanta Resources, you will not be missed. The Indian-owned mining company arrived on the London stock market in 2003, a low point in the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rush to welcome all-comers and not ask too many tricky questions about corporate governance. The early years were unproblematic since it was hard not to make good money in the boom years for commodity producers. For the past eight years, however, Vedanta has disappointed its minority shareholders, whose frustrations have not been eased by a tangled corporate structure. Aside from most of a copper mine in Zambia, the London-listed entity owns 50.1% of the Indian-listed Vedanta Ltd, causing endless quarrels over the fair allocation of debt and dividends. Anil Agarwal, the Indian commodities billionaire whose family trust owns 66.5% of Vedanta Resources, is offering to buy out the minorities at 856p a share. The price looks superficially decent in the sense that it is 27.6% above Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. On the other hand, the premium is only 13.6% if you take a three-month average. The key event in that period was the killing by Indian police of 13 people protesting against the extension of a copper smelter in the Indian town of Tuticorin, which prompted Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s John McDonnell to call for Vedanta to be delisted to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prevent further reputational damage to London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets from this rogue corporation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. McDonnell has got his wish, although the timing is entirely dictated by Agarwal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desire to simplify the corporate structure. But the shadow chancellor is basically right in his analysis: Vedanta and London was always a poor mix.",

                "bodyText":"European markets have closed higher, as traders welcomed a day without trade war escalation. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 gained 45 points or 0.6% to close at 7953, while the German DAX gained 0.9% and the French CAC picked up 0.75%. The reassuring noises out of Beijing today helped to calm nerves (although perhaps only temporarily), as did the German coalition deal on migration. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Stocks are higher as improved political relations in Germany and constructive trade comments from China has lifted investor sentiment. Angela Merkel has brokered a deal with Horst Seehofer which will keep their alliance intact. The positive mood might not last long though, as the Social Democrats need to inspect the agreement. An official from the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China announced they will not use the yuan as a tool in the trade spat with the US, and traders are taking this as a step in the right direct for global trading relations. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. GW Time for a quick recap. Chinese central bankers have vowed not to use their currency as a weapon in the trade conflict with the U.S. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China has pledged to keep the yuan stable, after seeing it slide to its weakest level in almost a year. PBOC insisted that Beijing is committed to upholding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153multilateralism, globalization, free trade and rule-based global guidelines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a roll-call of causes under threat from America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protectionist moves. Sun Guofeng, head of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial research institute, told Bloomberg: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recently the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate has shown some weakness. This is entirely due to changes in market expectations as external uncertainties rise rather than intended guidance of the central bank. China upholds multilateralism, globalization, free trade and rule-based international guidelines, and will not make the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate a tool to cope with trade conflicts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd PBOC also pledged to maintain the yuan at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reasonable, equilibrium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd level. This has helped to pull the yuan back up; earlier today it tipped below the 6.7 mark against the US dollar. Donald Trump has defended his policy of pushing other countries to reform their trade rules, or be hit with fresh tariffs. European stock markets are recovering from Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. In London, the FTSE 100 is now up 76 points (1%) at 7622. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says European investors are relieved that Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition crisis has been resolved. A day after the German interior minister offered his resignation over Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy on immigrants, a move that had serious implications on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brittle coalition government, Chancellor Angela Merkel managed to pull Germany back from the brink with a last minute deal which has pacified the rebels in her government. There was a collective sigh of relief across European stock markets Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector has posted stronger growth. Housebuilding helped to push activity up last month, but Brexit uncertainty may be restricting big projects. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no wild dramas on Wall Street...yet anyway. The US stock market has opened calmly, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 109 points, or 0.4%. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge not to use the yuan as a tool in the trade conflict with America is providing some reassurance. But, analyst Marc-Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Fongern believes the PBOC may have to back up its words with actions, and prop up the yuan if it falls again. Indian industrialist S.M. Lodha has warned that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to shake up global trade will backfire. Lodha, who chairs UK insulation firm Western Thermal Limited, believes US firms will suffer as the EU, China, Canada and Mexico impose retaliatory tariffs. Lodha explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The trade tariffs imposed by President Trump on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closest allies including Canada, Mexico, European Union and India, are strategically misplaced and self-defeating as it stands to directly weaken the US economy. The US Chamber of Commerce, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest lobbying group which has been historically close to Republican administrations, have themselves gone on record to denounce Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s erroneous idea of putting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153America First\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd though trade wars. As President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel tariff directly affects countries including Canada, EU and India, the EU has already warned that an estimated $300 billion worth of US goods could be hit by countermeasures. Even Canada has vowed to impose punitive countermeasures which can see over $12.6 billion worth of American goods being directly hit. Therefore, it is the American exporters who would be bearing a brunt over something the illogical and politically misguided actions of President Trump. If a country imposes tariffs on another, one can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complain if they retaliate. This is a key \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcArt of the Deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Mr Trump seems to have missed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has promised not to launch a currency war against America. Bloomberg has the details: China is committed to multilateralism, globalization, free trade and rule-based global guidelines, Sun Guofeng, director of the PBOC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial research institute, said in a written response to Bloomberg News. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an interesting pledge, given that the yuan (which is tightly controlled by Beijing) fell to an 11-month low today. Even the PBOC can only have so much effect - if Chinese companies and wealthy citizens try to move capital overseas, the yuan will fall. A weaker yuan also helps Chinese exporters, allowing them to cut prices and cushion the blow of US tariffs. Sun Guofeng\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge seems to be reassuring the markets, pushing the yuan a little higher against the US dollar away from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 6.7 low. The Treasury committee has been quizzing tax experts this morning, and hearing that online giants are still getting an unfair advantage. Charlie Elphicke, Tory MP for Dover and Deal, asked Richard Allen, the founder of group Retailers Against VAT Abuse Schemes, whether recent changes in the Finance Act had been effective in cracking down on VAT fraud by sellers on Ebay, Amazon and other online marketplaces. Allen replied that the measures were not tough enough and that legislation was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more relaxed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than in Germany. Elphicke asked: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Compared to Germany, our taxpayers are still being taken for a ride and Amazon are still in a position where they are not having to hand over information?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Allen agreed, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Small traders get very annoyed when they find themselves being investigated for VAT when big companies don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to get the same kind of attention. I was told by senior officials they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been instructed, HMRC had been instructed not to go too hard on Amazon yet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This has resulted in online firms having an unfair competitive advantage over high street retailers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The regulatory environment in which these online businesses operate is not as tough as the regulatory environment for highstreet retailers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Allen added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sell dangerous products in a shop. You couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t openly sell goods where there is no VAT charge in a shop\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 There is a huge imbalance between online retail and high street retail.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd His biggest concern is that online retailers are unregulated private marketplaces operated by one company. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The owner of a private marketplace online gets to see the sales data of everyone selling on that platform and can use that to their advantage selling products themselves.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This means \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they can manipulate prices on their own marketplace,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Allen said, adding that Amazon sometimes sold lost leaders to maintain its market position. He is backing a VAT surcharge on overseas retailers selling goods in Britain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a similar measure is working well in Australia, he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would introduce an extra cost on these cheap imports that would protect British retailers from an avalanche of cheap stuff\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Exactly 49 days before Greece exits its third and final EU-sponsored bailout programme, the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic and financial affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici is visiting the country \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with a message of hope. Helena Smith reports from Athens: The French have done more to back Greece than any other euro zone member in the nine years since the country almost crashed on the rocks of bankruptcy and as one of Paris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 most prominent politicians, Pierre Moscovici is an embodiment of that support. On a flying one-day visit Tuesday, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics chief insisted there were no ifs and buts to Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ordeal finally being over. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The time has come for Greece to be a normal country,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Moscovici emphasising that oversight of the nation once it exited its last economic adjustment program would not amount to a fourth bailout. He told the Greek parliament: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no more program for Greece. There won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be any more programs for Greece.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meeting the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of state earlier, Moscovici said the agreement euro zone countries had reached last month to reduce the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staggering debt load had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153opened a new road with new conditions and prospects\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Greece. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I know well that the story that we all experienced had tragic aspects and was dangerous for the euro zone and very, very difficult for the Greeks,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said referring to the depression the country had suffered as it applied tough austerity and structural reforms in exchange for rescue funds. Moscovici added he would never forget the pensioners who had had their pensions slashed, workers who had lost jobs, and families who had seen their children leave for wealthier climes. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, who also met Moscovici, praised his supra-nationalism saying he and his team had worked for the good of Europe even if along the way \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we had very big disagreements.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greece exits its third bailout programme on August 20. Another early start for the US president...and a chance to bang the drum for trade reform. I suspect \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmost countries\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 would also rather the president tackled the issue in a more multilateral way, rather than using \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnational security threats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to justify new tariffs on nations that saw themselves as US allies.... Good news from Ireland: the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate has hit a 10-year low. Irish unemployment fell to just 5.1% in June, the central statistics office reports. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been this low since October 2007, just after the credit crunch struck. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate has been falling steadily since its bailout ended in 2013, and is someway below the eurozone average of over 8%. World stock markets are staging a recovery from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slides, after China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank tried to calm the panic. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 32 points or 0.44% to 7580 (it would be more, but for Glencore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump). The other European markets are also up, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX leading the way after Angela Merkel resolved the migration dispute that was threatening to rip her coalition apart. Investors have been cheered by the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to protect the yuan at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reasonable, equilibrium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd level, after it hit an 11-month low toda. Although we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not got details, that feels like a promise not to allow the yuan to plunge alarmingly. Even so, trade war fears still dominate the markets - with America and China set to impose retaliatory tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of exports later this week. Mihir Kapadia, founder of Sun Global Investments, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the end of the Asian trading day, markets in China are in a more nervous state than last week as investors fear the dispute between the United States and other nations will have a significant and serious impact on global growth. The Chinese yuan fell to an 11 month low, unsettling investors and causing the Chinese central bank to pledge to keep the currency stable. Despite similar tensions over tariffs on EU goods, European markets saw some relief on the back of a migration deal that appears to have helped to stabilise Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition government and has allayed fears of German political uncertainty at least for the time being. With President Trump setting an implementation deadline for the extra US$ 200bn of tariffs against China for this Friday, the markets reflect the anxiety and concern of many investors and stockholders with multi-billion dollar tariffs due to hit the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second biggest economy. With the dispute continuing to escalate, it is likely that global markets will feel the force of the tariffs set to be imposed by both nations, with Chinese companies likely to be hit the hardest.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little early, but we should raise a glass to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gin industry, which has enjoyed a bumper year. Sales of UK-produced gin jumped by 32.5% in 2017 to \u00c2\u00a3461m, the Office for National Statistics reports. That follows a spate of new distillery openings across the country, the rise of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccraft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or artisan gins, and even special gin festivals. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food producers were the largest division of UK manufacturing, creating \u00c2\u00a370bn of products sold at home and around the world. Petrol cars were the biggest single product category last year, with sales over \u00c2\u00a320bn. Aircraft parts and diesel cars were also very significant . Beer also shone last year, breaking back into the list of top 10 products. More here. Hold on. Max Jones, global Corporates relationship director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, argues that Brexit is hurting the UK building sector. He points out that large construction projects are being held back, despite the rise in activity last month: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The industry has regained some confidence after the lows of earlier this year. The bounce-back in Q2 appears to confirm that much of the weakness in the first quarter was the result of shutdowns in the wake of the Beast from the East rather than anything more structural. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the sector is hardly motoring, with some large contractors blaming Brexit uncertainty for the delay or cancellation of projects. The London market also looks significantly exposed to any reduction in EU labour. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nevertheless, the announcement of approval for a new runway at Heathrow has boosted sentiment in the sector, if not yet order books and revenue. But with Heathrow, Hinkley Point and HS2 all now given the green light, the focus shifts to the next mega-project that will offer firms comfort and visibility over their long-term pipelines.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector appears to be shrugging off economic anxiety (despite the looming shadow of Brexit), says Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the fastest rise in new orders since May 2017, it appears the brakes are off for the construction sector. Despite being hampered by economic uncertainty, firms reported an improved pipeline of work as clients committed to projects and hesitancy was swept away. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Input prices were a challenge with the biggest inflationary rise since September 2017, so the pressure was on to build up stocks of materials rising in price and becoming more scarce. This resulted in a heavy impact on suppliers unable to keep pace as deliveries became laboured and purchasing managers were at their busiest for two and a half years. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing sector has strengthened, thanks to a pick-up in house-building. Data firm Markit reports that construction activity accelerated last month, at the fastest pace since November 2017. New orders jumped, prompting companies to splash out on new materials - driving prices up. This all propelled Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI (which measures activity) up to 53.1 in June, from 52.5 in May, beating expectations. Encouragingly, optimism in the construction sector picked up in June, from May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seven-month low. Tim Moore, associate director at IHS Markit, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders are getting back to work after the winter slowdown. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest increase in UK construction output marks three months of sustained recovery from the snow-related disruption seen back in March. A solid contribution from house building helped to drive up overall construction activity in June, while a lack of new work to replace completed civil engineering projects continued to hold back growth. I\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdll pull together some reaction now. The DoJ subpoena means problems are mounting up for Glencore. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Thomas Biesheuvel explains: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a tumultuous year for Glencore, mostly due to challenges linked to its business in the Congo, where it operates giant copper and cobalt mines. The Swiss company trader and miner is already facing the possibility of a bribery investigation by U.K. prosecutors over its work with Dan Gertler, an Israeli billionaire and close friend of Congo President Joseph Kabila, people familiar with the situation said in May. Last November, the Paradise Papers expose showed Glencore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s links to Israeli mining billionaire Dan Gertler in Africa, including in the DRC. Wow. Around \u00c2\u00a35bn has been wiped off Glencore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Newsflash: The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest commodity trading firm is caught up in a US investigation. Glencore told the City that it has received a subpoena from the US Department of Justice, asking for documents covering its activities in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela. The investigation relates to US laws covering money-laundering and bribery of foreign officials. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the statement: Glencore Ltd, a subsidiary of Glencore plc, has received a subpoena dated 2 July, 2018 from the US Department of Justice to produce documents and other records with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and United States money laundering statutes. The requested documents relate to the Glencore Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela from 2007 to present. Glencore is reviewing the subpoena and will provide further information in due course as appropriate. Glencore shares have tumbled by 9% as City traders digest the news, hitting their lowest level in almost a year: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker has blamed America for the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness. In a statement, Yi Gang, governor of the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China (PBOC), says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recently, there have been some fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. We are paying close attention to this, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is mainly due to factors such as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and external uncertainties.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yi does have a point - emerging market currencies are all suffering from the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revival. The Vietnamese dong has also been under pressure, hitting an all-time low against the dollar today. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China has launched an attempt to reassure Chinese investors and prevent the yuan falling further. In a statement released a few minutes ago, PBOC says it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153closely watching\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd moves in the foreign exchange markets. Importantly, the Bank is also pledging to keep the yuan \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reasonable, equilibrium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd level. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also promising to maintain prudent and neutral monetary policy. This \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcverbal operation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 seems to be having an effect - the yuan is dragging itself back off the mat, recovering some (but not all!) of its losses today. ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s China economist Iris Pang also blames Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs for causing the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s depreciation is market-driven, reflecting the risks of a trade war. This implies that the central bank is allowing market forces to dictate the speed of the depreciation when there is room to do so.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chinese banks scrambled to prop up the yuan after it fell through the 6.7 level against the US dollar this morning. Bloomberg explains: Chinese banks were seen selling dollars after the yuan weakened past a key level, stoking speculation that authorities were seeking to slow the losses. The yuan was 0.5% lower at 6.6981 per dollar at 11:31 a.m. in Shanghai after earlier falling to 6.7204. Some Chinese major banks sold the dollar in the swaps market, according to four traders. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no escape from trade war fears today. Asian stock markets have fallen to their lowest levels since last autumn, after Donald Trump refused to cave into international pressure over his tariffs. A volatile day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading saw China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite index shed another 1.9% to a 28-month low, before rebounding in a late rally. The Chinese yuan also had a bad day, sliding against the dollar to its weakest level in almost a year. Both the onshore and offshore yuan have fallen through the 6.7 per dollar level for the first time since August 2017. The selloff suggests that Asian investors have been badly shaken by the looming tit-for-tat tariffs between China and America. US tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese products are due to kick in on July 6, with China set to retaliate with duties of its own on the same value of American goods. A trade was could hurt China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy badly, at a time when Beijing is trying to tackle its shadow banking sector and continue the evolution from a manufacturing-driven economy to a services-led one. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, says the sharp depreciation in the Chinese currency is worrying investors. He reminds us that a similar slump three years ago spooked the global markets: In August 2015, USD-CNY appreciated from 6.21 to 6.44, a two-day gain of 3.85%. As a result, global stock markets sold off sharply as investors feared the beginning of a currency war. With trade tensions increasing day by day, Beijing might be playing this game as a tool in its trade war with the U.S. However, such a strategy will be a double-edged sword as it might also lead to a flight of capital which the PBoC is well aware of. Although the Chinese currency depreciated 3.23% in June, it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound quite so alarming, given that the Dollar appreciated against most major currencies in May and June. Going forward it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be about the pace and magnitude of the currency moves that will drive equity markets. CNYUSD traded at 6.70 at the time of writing and will keep a close eye on 6.96, the lowest level reached in January 2017. The White House is pressing on with its plans to penalise trading partners unless they give America a better deal. Yesterday, president Trump insisted that the World Trade Organisation must reform, after \u00e2\u20ac\u0153treating us very badly for many, many years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Also coming up today: A new healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders is published this morning. The construction PMI is expected to show another month of slow growth, as the collapse of Carillion in January continues to ripple through the sector European stock markets are expected to rise, after Angela Merkel reached a deal on migration with interior minister, Horst Seehofer that should prevent her coalition from collapsing. We also get new eurozone retail sales and US manufacturing orders data, which will show whether trade war fears are having an impact. The agenda 9.30am BST: UK construction PMI for June 10am BST: Eurozone retail sales for June 3pm BST: UK factory orders for May",

And nobody has a reliable tally of the independent shops that have disappeared.</p> <p>No retailer has a right to survive and some of the headline-grabbing retreats owe much to outdated formats, lack of investment or bad management. Yet talk of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on our high streets is legitimate. At least 35,000 retail jobs have been lost or put at risk of redundancy this year, which represents a brutal readjustment even at a time of high rates of general employment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/06/uk-high-street-sales-fall-for-fifth-month-running\">UK high street sales fall for fifth month running</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The deeper effect \u00e2\u20ac\u201c harder to measure but more important in the long run \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is the loss to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/09/high-street-crisis-darlington-stores-retailers\" title=\"\">local communities</a>. Hollowed-out town centres with boarded-up premises advertise decline. A sense of community cohesion is lost. Other employers become reluctant to invest. Money gravitates elsewhere. In the US, which has more of a local \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mall\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd culture, they talk about a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153retail apocalypse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, undermining local tax bases and hitting low-income earners hardest.</p> <p>The popular villain of the UK piece is business rates, the property-based tax that raises \u00c2\u00a329bn a year for the Treasury, of which retailers cough up \u00c2\u00a38bn. It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only culprit, but the complaint from bricks-and-mortar shopkeepers is essentially correct: business rates were invented in a pre-internet age and the system is archaic. A useful tax system would help to reverse the damage done to high streets from the 1980s by sprawling out-of-town retail parks. Instead business rates, as currently structured, add to the&#xa0;problem.</p> <p>The most startling statistic was provided by the New West End Company, an alliance of central London retailers, hoteliers and property owners. It calculated that Marks &amp; Spencer, a company with a turnover of \u00c2\u00a39.6bn last year, paid \u00c2\u00a3184m in business rates, whereas Amazon, with slightly smaller revenues in the UK of \u00c2\u00a37.3bn, paid substantially less in rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just \u00c2\u00a314m. Amazon, of course, operates from more lightly taxed warehouses and requires fewer properties. New West End calculated that a 1% sales tax on online businesses could raise more than \u00c2\u00a35bn, which could go some way to levelling the retail playing&#xa0;field.</p> <p>Philip Hammond, however, is not for levelling. Faced with a chorus of calls for reform, the chancellor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/06/uk-high-street-sales-fall-for-fifth-month-running\" title=\"\"> wrote to the Treasury select committee last week</a> to say the 2016 review of business rates was clear. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Respondents agreed that property-based taxes were easy to collect, difficult to avoid, relatively stable compared with other taxes and had a clear link with local authority spending,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.</p> <p>It is probably fair for Hammond to fret about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153distortionary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd effects. If business rates on the high street were to be slashed, the biggest short-term beneficiaries might be landlords, which are desperately trying to resist retailers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 simultaneous pleas for lower rents. But that is not an excuse for ignoring the plainly unfair burden of taxation that is falling on high streets and inner-city shops. If council taxes on high-end residential properties need to pick up some of the slack, so be it.</p> <p>Central government could help by allowing local authorities, better placed to address local crises, to set and collect property-based taxes. The select committee, whose chair, Nicky Morgan, sounded unimpressed by Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intransigence, should keep pushing. The chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plea that he is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153making progress\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with plans to find a better way to tax the digital economy is miserable.

He did so largely because he had no choice. Disgruntled pilots were\u00e2\u20ac\u2039 \u00e2\u20ac\u2039holding his feet to the fire, their hand strengthened by a shortage of\u00e2\u20ac\u2039 \u00e2\u20ac\u2039experienced crews to fly his planes.

                "bodyText":"House of Fraser, Mothercare, Marks &amp; Spencer, Debenhams. The list of major retailing names that have announced plans to close stores this year is long, and will undoubtedly lengthen. That is before you count the chains that have gone the way of Woolworths and packed up altogether \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the likes of Toys R Us and Maplin. And nobody has a reliable tally of the independent shops that have disappeared. No retailer has a right to survive and some of the headline-grabbing retreats owe much to outdated formats, lack of investment or bad management. Yet talk of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on our high streets is legitimate. At least 35,000 retail jobs have been lost or put at risk of redundancy this year, which represents a brutal readjustment even at a time of high rates of general employment. The deeper effect \u00e2\u20ac\u201c harder to measure but more important in the long run \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is the loss to local communities. Hollowed-out town centres with boarded-up premises advertise decline. A sense of community cohesion is lost. Other employers become reluctant to invest. Money gravitates elsewhere. In the US, which has more of a local \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mall\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd culture, they talk about a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153retail apocalypse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, undermining local tax bases and hitting low-income earners hardest. The popular villain of the UK piece is business rates, the property-based tax that raises \u00c2\u00a329bn a year for the Treasury, of which retailers cough up \u00c2\u00a38bn. It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only culprit, but the complaint from bricks-and-mortar shopkeepers is essentially correct: business rates were invented in a pre-internet age and the system is archaic. A useful tax system would help to reverse the damage done to high streets from the 1980s by sprawling out-of-town retail parks. Instead business rates, as currently structured, add to the problem. The most startling statistic was provided by the New West End Company, an alliance of central London retailers, hoteliers and property owners. It calculated that Marks &amp; Spencer, a company with a turnover of \u00c2\u00a39.6bn last year, paid \u00c2\u00a3184m in business rates, whereas Amazon, with slightly smaller revenues in the UK of \u00c2\u00a37.3bn, paid substantially less in rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just \u00c2\u00a314m. Amazon, of course, operates from more lightly taxed warehouses and requires fewer properties. New West End calculated that a 1% sales tax on online businesses could raise more than \u00c2\u00a35bn, which could go some way to levelling the retail playing field. Philip Hammond, however, is not for levelling. Faced with a chorus of calls for reform, the chancellor wrote to the Treasury select committee last week to say the 2016 review of business rates was clear. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Respondents agreed that property-based taxes were easy to collect, difficult to avoid, relatively stable compared with other taxes and had a clear link with local authority spending,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. It is probably fair for Hammond to fret about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153distortionary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd effects. If business rates on the high street were to be slashed, the biggest short-term beneficiaries might be landlords, which are desperately trying to resist retailers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 simultaneous pleas for lower rents. But that is not an excuse for ignoring the plainly unfair burden of taxation that is falling on high streets and inner-city shops. If council taxes on high-end residential properties need to pick up some of the slack, so be it. Central government could help by allowing local authorities, better placed to address local crises, to set and collect property-based taxes. The select committee, whose chair, Nicky Morgan, sounded unimpressed by Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intransigence, should keep pushing. The chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plea that he is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153making progress\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with plans to find a better way to tax the digital economy is miserable. The pain on the high street is happening now. Ryanair has grown to a size that belies its image as an upstart It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impossible to imagine Ryanair without its pugnacious chief executive, Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary, at the helm. For as long as Ryanair has existed O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary has been its public face, warring with rival airline bosses, dishing out tongue-lashings to politicians, even insulting passengers with glee. As regards running an airline, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done a bang-up job. Ryanair pioneered the no-frills model and mastered it, oustripping its rivals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 growth rates to become Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest airline. It is solidly and persistently profitable, with few exceptions, in an industry where traditional carriers have often suffered volatility in financial performance. But something is happening at Ryanair that it has never experienced before. Back in December O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary agreed to recognise trade unions. He did so largely because he had no choice. Disgruntled pilots were holding his feet to the fire, their hand strengthened by a shortage of experienced crews to fly his planes. Cabin staff have also seized the opportunity to seek improvements to pay and conditions. Ryanair now faces a summer of discontent, with pilots based in Ireland striking next week and cabin crew in four countries, including holiday hotspots Spain and Italy, due to follow suit later in the month. So far Ryanair has shown no signs of bowing to the demands of its staff. It does not seem implausible to expect more labour disputes and cancelled flights as a result. That can only go on so long before Ryanair starts to garner a reputation for leaving passengers in the lurch. No-frills customers still want low prices, but they also want to get to where they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going. Airline bosses have faced down trade unions before, but it is a time-consuming business that distracts from operational excellence. Ryanair is no longer a challenger upstart but a mature business with evolving needs. It remains to be seen if the characteristics that have made O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary so effective are the right ones to steer Ryanair through this evolution. That is something investors should start thinking about. Shell foresees an electric future \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite ready to pull the plug on petrol Why would an oil company try to bring forward a ban on cars that burn its products, like Shell did last week? The answer lies in the Anglo-Dutch group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to acknowledge how a low-carbon future might look. Like rival BP, Shell has been buying up and acquiring shares in electric car infrastructure firms, hedging its bets as drivers begin using electrons as well as oil molecules. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just charging infrastructure: explosive electric car growth means more demand for electricity, even if that demand is managed smartly. Who better to provide that power than Shell, either via the gas it sells to power stations or the windfarms it is looking to acquire? The creation of the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s New Energies division in 2016 was the start of a long-term mission to build a huge power generation company. Shell owns windfarms in the Netherlands. It wants sites in the UK, too. The company was part of a consortium that narrowly lost out to EDF Energy in the bidding for a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500m (\u00c2\u00a3440m) offshore windfarm in Scotland. Shell also bought the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest challenger electricity and gas supplier recently, so it stands to benefit if more motorists plug in their cars. Ben van Beurden, Shell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, tells investors that he is not spending up to $2bn (\u00c2\u00a31.5bn) a year on green stuff just for the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every time, I say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to generate a return, because this is a massive investment opportunity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. So straightforward self-interest explains a lot. But have no doubt \u00e2\u20ac\u201c reputation is a big driver here.

The chief executive Mark Newton-Jones\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sermon about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exciting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd plans to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153revitalise the brand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has also been heard many times. The share price has sunk so low there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no point in shareholders throwing a tantrum. The \u00c2\u00a332.5m fundraising, which will double the number of shares in issue, is underwritten, so the company will get its cash whatever happens. But a point to remember is that the company last paid a dividend in 2012. Greater retailing recoveries have happened \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but Mothercare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline is not new. A flicker of fear over Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nationalisation plans The FTSE 100 index rose 1% on Monday, seemingly ignoring the excitement in Westminster. Look beneath the surface, however, and four of the few fallers were companies in Jeremy Corbyn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sights. The water companies Severn Trent and United Utilities were down 3% and 2% respectively. National Grid and Royal Mail also shed a little value. One couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t call it a shudder of fear among investors over Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nationalisation plans \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it was a flicker of worry.",

                "body":"<p>You could have bought shares in Ocado at 960p at 9am on Tuesday and sold them before the close of play at \u00c2\u00a311, a tidy return of almost 15%. What happened? Nothing of substance. Investors merely decided that a couple of unexpected charges in the half-year figures, including \u00c2\u00a39m to cover management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely winnings under an old incentive scheme, was not worth worrying about. Then they returned to the pleasant pastime of imagining how Ocado will become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Microsoft of retail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as one City analyst puts it.</p> <p>Such is the impossibility of valuing Ocado these days. The shares have almost quadrupled in value in the past 12 months. The transformation has happened because chief executive Tim Steiner, ridiculed for years for failing to deliver the promised licensing tie-ups with foreign supermarket chains, has finally delivered in spades. Groupe Casino in France, Sobeys in Canada, ICA in Sweden and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/17/us-deal-boosts-ocados-stock-market-value-above-5bn\">the biggest of the lot, Kroger in the US</a>, have all signed up to use Ocado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s know-how.</p> <p>Trying to decipher what those deals are worth, however, is an exercise in piling assumption upon assumption. It is obviously true that selling smart technology and robots to other people should be many times more lucrative that competing with Tesco, Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s et al in the humdrum business of delivering groceries in the UK.</p> <p>Yet Ocado Solutions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the exciting half of the business \u00e2\u20ac\u201c reported losses of \u00c2\u00a32m on revenues of \u00c2\u00a363m in the half-year. The hard work lies ahead. It will be several years before the financial picture, and the true size of the cash flows, becomes clear.</p> <p>Amazon is living proof that a good retail \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transformation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd story can compound and become huge. And Ocado, which is essentially selling an anti-Amazon kit to frightened grocers, is clearly in a sweet spot. But a \u00c2\u00a37bn-plus valuation already? The company is worth what investors are willing to pay, of course, but that is taking a lot on trust. Ocado has four automated \u00e2\u20ac\u0153customer fulfilment centres\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the UK but is now committed to building 23 overseas. The execution risks must be enormous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Phizackerley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treatment harsh but expected </h2> <p>Rule one for a deal-doing chief executive is never, ever, miss the cost-savings you have promised investors. John Phizackerley initially reckoned \u00c2\u00a360m could be achieved by merging Tullett Prebon and Icap, two of the big names in interdealer broking, but then increased his estimate to \u00c2\u00a3100m. Now, 18 months after the deal, TP Icap reckons only \u00c2\u00a375m is possible and Phizackerley has been fired.<br></p> <p>He sounds unhappy, but can have few complaints. Interdealer broking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c trading interest-rate swaps and so on via telephone deals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is gradually being overtaken by automation.

                "bodyText":"You could have bought shares in Ocado at 960p at 9am on Tuesday and sold them before the close of play at \u00c2\u00a311, a tidy return of almost 15%. What happened? Nothing of substance. Investors merely decided that a couple of unexpected charges in the half-year figures, including \u00c2\u00a39m to cover management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely winnings under an old incentive scheme, was not worth worrying about. Then they returned to the pleasant pastime of imagining how Ocado will become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Microsoft of retail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as one City analyst puts it. Such is the impossibility of valuing Ocado these days. The shares have almost quadrupled in value in the past 12 months. The transformation has happened because chief executive Tim Steiner, ridiculed for years for failing to deliver the promised licensing tie-ups with foreign supermarket chains, has finally delivered in spades. Groupe Casino in France, Sobeys in Canada, ICA in Sweden and then the biggest of the lot, Kroger in the US, have all signed up to use Ocado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s know-how. Trying to decipher what those deals are worth, however, is an exercise in piling assumption upon assumption. It is obviously true that selling smart technology and robots to other people should be many times more lucrative that competing with Tesco, Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s et al in the humdrum business of delivering groceries in the UK. Yet Ocado Solutions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the exciting half of the business \u00e2\u20ac\u201c reported losses of \u00c2\u00a32m on revenues of \u00c2\u00a363m in the half-year. The hard work lies ahead. It will be several years before the financial picture, and the true size of the cash flows, becomes clear. Amazon is living proof that a good retail \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transformation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd story can compound and become huge. And Ocado, which is essentially selling an anti-Amazon kit to frightened grocers, is clearly in a sweet spot. But a \u00c2\u00a37bn-plus valuation already? The company is worth what investors are willing to pay, of course, but that is taking a lot on trust. Ocado has four automated \u00e2\u20ac\u0153customer fulfilment centres\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the UK but is now committed to building 23 overseas. The execution risks must be enormous. Phizackerley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treatment harsh but expected Rule one for a deal-doing chief executive is never, ever, miss the cost-savings you have promised investors. John Phizackerley initially reckoned \u00c2\u00a360m could be achieved by merging Tullett Prebon and Icap, two of the big names in interdealer broking, but then increased his estimate to \u00c2\u00a3100m. Now, 18 months after the deal, TP Icap reckons only \u00c2\u00a375m is possible and Phizackerley has been fired. He sounds unhappy, but can have few complaints. Interdealer broking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c trading interest-rate swaps and so on via telephone deals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is gradually being overtaken by automation. Add the confusion of Brexit and tougher regulatory standards, and tying yourself to firm medium-term guidance is dangerous. Then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the perennial problem in a specialist field of City activity of rivals trying to poach your best teams. TP Icap talks about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153market forces\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd increasing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broker compensation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which sounds suspiciously like a panicky attempt to halt defections. The share price fell 36% as the full tale of missed targets, and higher investment costs, was unveiled. In short, all the post-merger assumptions are being reset. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has become clear that a change of leadership is required to execute our medium-term growth strategy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said chair Rupert Robson. Phizackerley was a big figure in the broking world, but he should not be surprised by the harsh judgment. Most boards would take the same view in such circumstances. Sorrel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absolute control risks discontent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are excited to buy in to the vision of Sir Martin Sorrell to create the next platform for our industry,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd say the bosses at MediaMonks, the Dutch digital advertising company that is the first acquisition for S4 Capital, the former WPP chief\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new venture. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hope these Monks understand fully that their 20% shareholding in S4, the fruit of their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153buy in\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, comes with no real voting rights.

                "bodyText":"Rupert Murdoch has upped his offer for Sky to \u00c2\u00a324.5bn, trumping the offer tabled by rival Comcast and intensifying the bidding war for the broadcaster. The bid worth \u00c2\u00a314 per share means Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox will have to pay \u00c2\u00a314.7bn for the 61% of Sky it does not already own.

Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all-cash bid, which is 30% higher than his original offer and a 12% premium on Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal, has been recommended to shareholders by Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independent committee. In light of Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new bid, Comcast is likely to counter with a new bid this week for Sky, which has assets including Premier League football rights and a production arm responsible for shows such as the dramas Riviera and Patrick Melrose, starring Benedict Cumberbatch. Murdoch has felt emboldened to forge ahead with a new offer as he is finally set to be given clearance by the government to take over Sky. The new culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, will clear the bid in an announcement scheduled to be made by the end of the day on Thursday. Earlier this week, the Guardian revealed that Murdoch would gain clearance to finally take over Sky after 18 months of battling regulatory red tape and political opposition to the deal, and raise his bid. Wright, who has only been in the job days, will deliver the result on a final consultation on plans to make Murdoch sell Sky News to reduce his control of UK news media. The government said on Tuesday it had only had five responses to the consultation. As well as selling Sky News, most probably to Disney, Murdoch must also top up any potential shortfall in funding by the channel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new owner to keep its budget at \u00c2\u00a3100m for the next 15 years. The battle for Sky is playing out against a larger fight between Disney and Comcast to take over most of 21st Century Fox, which owns 39% of Sky as well as assets including the Hollywood studio behind films such as Deadpool and X-Men. Last month, Disney, which has offered to buy Sky News from Murdoch to help him secure clearance to buy Sky, upped its offer for Fox to $71.3bn ($38 a share). Earlier in the month, Comcast had trumped Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first offer for Fox ($55.4bn; $28 a share) with a $65bn, or $35 a share, bid. Fox shareholders are due to vote on Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer on 27 July, unless Comcast ups its bid again as rumoured. The spiralling price tag for Fox has significant ramifications on the ultimate price that will be paid to win the separate battle for Sky. In April, the UK Takeover Panel ruled that if Disney successfully takes over Fox before Murdoch, Comcast or another bidder has taken full control of Sky, then it will be forced to buy out the 61% of the satellite group it does not own. The panel ruled that Disney would have to buy the stake at \u00c2\u00a310.75 a share \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the now 18-month-old bid price tabled by Murdoch. This \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chain principle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is designed to make sure minority shareholders are treated fairly; in this case to ensure Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minority shareholders receive the same amount as 21st Century Fox. The rule would also apply to Comcast if it beats Disney in agreeing a deal to buy Fox. However, after Disney significantly upped its bid for Fox, the UK Takeover Panel is looking at whether it should be forced to pay a much higher price. Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new bid for Fox is 36% higher than its original one, which has led analysts to suggest that premium could be extended to Sky to make Disney pay at least \u00c2\u00a314.62 a share. The battle for Sky should be over in September, with either Fox or Comcast the winner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unless a surprise new bidder emerges. This means it is highly unlikely that whoever is ultimately victorious in the hunt for Fox \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Disney or Comcast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will find itself having to make a move for an unsold part of Sky when the deal completes in the US next year. However, the Takeover Panel ruling, which could also be announced this week, could theoretically set a new, higher, price floor for buying Sky than Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest bid.",

Jenner comes up with ideas for styles, but the products are made by Seed Beauty, a private-label producer which also produces makeup for KKW Beauty, run by Jenner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s half-sister Kim Kardashian West. More than 500 people at Seed Beauty, which owns makeup production company Spatz Laboratories, work on the Jenner-Kardashian brands. </p> <p>Spatz, which is run by siblings John and Laura Nelson, was sued by L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Or\u00c3\u00a9al in 2016 over allegations that L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Or\u00c3\u00a9al patents were used in the creation of Kylie Cosmetic lip products. </p> <p>Jenner does not directly make her products, nor does she sell them.

Those matters are outsourced to her mom or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153momager\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kris Jenner, who manages all her children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial operations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in return for a 10% cut. </p> <p>Jenner, who used her reality TV exposure to secure modelling work with brands like Topshop, said she had struggled to decide what to do with her life. Then her thoughts turned to her most talked about feature: her lips. </p> <p>Until she finally admitted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/jul/11/kylie-jenner-has-removed-her-lip-fillers-is-this-the-end-of-an-astonishingly-popular-procedure\">using fillers</a>, fans tried desperately to ape her full-lipped look by sucking on bottles.

This week, however, Jenner said she has had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/jul/11/kylie-jenner-has-removed-her-lip-fillers-is-this-the-end-of-an-astonishingly-popular-procedure\">all filler removed</a>, after learning to live with the natural look while pregnant with her daughter Stormi, who is now five months old. </p> <p>Jenner trademarked the phrase \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kylie Lip Kits ... for the perfect pout\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd two years before setting up her company with $250,000 of money she had made through modelling and reality TV work.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ever since I was probably 15 I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been obsessed with lipstick.

Though her mother said selling up is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153always something that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re willing to explore\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p>",
                "bodyText":"Kylie Jenner is on track to become the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s youngest ever billionaire thanks to her lips and Instagram. Jenner, 20, the youngest member of the Kardashian-Jenner American reality TV family, is the founder and sole owner of Kylie Cosmetics, the makeup company she runs largely from her black iPhone X, with the help of her mother Kris. Employing just seven full-time staff, Kylie Cosmetics has sold more than $630m (\u00c2\u00a3480m) of lipstick, lip liner and lip gloss and makeup since Jenner founded the business on Valentine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day in 2016. Forbes magazine, which this week featured Jenner on its cover as the face of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the era of extreme fame leverage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, estimated her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153net worth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at $900m. The magazine said Kylie Cosmetics is growing at such a rate that she is likely to become a billionaire at 22 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a year younger than Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Zuckerberg was when he joined the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnine zeros\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 club in 2008. Billionaires are getting younger. Legendary investor Warren Buffett, who is now the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-richest person with an $83bn fortune, did not make his first billion until 1986, when he was 56. Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest person with $145bn, became a billionaire at 35 in 1999. Google co-founder Larry Page made his first billion at 30 in 2004 when the search engine floated. Evan Spiegel, founder of Snapchat, became a billionaire in 2015 at 25. Nearly all of Kylie Cosmetic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales come directly from Jenner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s social media accounts. She has 111m followers on Instagram (77% of whom are aged 18-24, the BBC reports), is one of the most viewed accounts on Snapchat, and is followed by 25m on Twitter. Such is the weight of her influence that when she tweeted that she was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sooo over\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Snapchat earlier this year, more than $1bn was wiped off the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market value. Sales are driven higher by Jenner sparking FOMO (fear of missing out) among her fans with warnings that collections are in very limited quantities. Her initial stock of $29 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lip kits\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - matching lipstick and lip liner - sold out in less than a minute, crashing the website. Jenner, who has been in the public eye since she made her debut on Keeping Up With The Kardashians a decade ago when she was 10, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Social media is an amazing platform. I have such easy access to my fans and my customers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The business is almost totally outsourced. Jenner comes up with ideas for styles, but the products are made by Seed Beauty, a private-label producer which also produces makeup for KKW Beauty, run by Jenner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s half-sister Kim Kardashian West. More than 500 people at Seed Beauty, which owns makeup production company Spatz Laboratories, work on the Jenner-Kardashian brands. Spatz, which is run by siblings John and Laura Nelson, was sued by L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Or\u00c3\u00a9al in 2016 over allegations that L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Or\u00c3\u00a9al patents were used in the creation of Kylie Cosmetic lip products. Jenner does not directly make her products, nor does she sell them. Kylie Cosmetics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 orders and sales are outsourced to Shopify, a Canadian online company that also runs shops for Drake and Justin Bieber. Shopify promotes its success with Jenner to encourage other entrepreneurs to skip the boring things like fulfilling orders and logistics by using their services. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The reigning Queen of Snapchat. Reality TV darling. Makeup mogul. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than just a famous face\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe youngest of the Kardashian clan, Kylie Jenner, has hustled beyond her 19 years, monetising her name and exploding it into a massive cosmetics brand,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shopify says on its site. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kylie Cosmetics entered the IRL (in real life) space for the first time ever, driving lip envy to a fever pitch.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jenner also does not have to worry much about the business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances or the day-to-day management of her 12 staff (seven full-time, five part-time). Those matters are outsourced to her mom or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153momager\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kris Jenner, who manages all her children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial operations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in return for a 10% cut. Jenner, who used her reality TV exposure to secure modelling work with brands like Topshop, said she had struggled to decide what to do with her life. Then her thoughts turned to her most talked about feature: her lips. Until she finally admitted using fillers, fans tried desperately to ape her full-lipped look by sucking on bottles. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kylie Jenner lip challenge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd increases blood flow to the lips, with often unpleasant-looking results. This week, however, Jenner said she has had all filler removed, after learning to live with the natural look while pregnant with her daughter Stormi, who is now five months old. Jenner trademarked the phrase \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kylie Lip Kits ... for the perfect pout\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd two years before setting up her company with $250,000 of money she had made through modelling and reality TV work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ever since I was probably 15 I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been obsessed with lipstick. I could never find a lip liner and a lipstick that were the perfect match. So that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where I thought of the idea that I wanted to create my own product,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jenner said in an interview with Shopify. While she had a huge fan base, Jenner said she was scared that sales might not take off when the website first launched. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I kept calling my mom, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMom, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m so scared. Do you think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to sell?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Because I put all my money upfront. You know, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all my money.

But the evidence is clear that countries that remain open to trade have higher productivity. They have higher incomes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance largely retraced the testimony and questioning from a Tuesday hearing with the Senate Banking Committee.</p> <p>In prepared testimony and an accompanying report Powell depicted a U.S. economy poised for perhaps years more continued growth, with the central bank close to its goals of maximum employment and inflation stable at around 2 percent.</p> <p>But as with senators the day before, House members zeroed in on the possible economic consequences of the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imposition of tariffs, with threats of more to come, in the name of cutting better trade deals with both allies like Canada and rivals like China.</p> <p>Powell has tried to walk a fine line in his responses, at once steering clear of direct criticism of the president who appointed him, while also making the economic consequences clear.</p> <p>Powell said he thought the administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aim was to ultimately lower tariffs worldwide, and if there was disruption in the meantime \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it might be worth paying a bit of a short-term price to get to a better place.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>At the same time, he and other Fed officials have been clear that businesses are telling them that they already are changing spending and investment plans because of the risks and uncertainties around a possible trade conflict.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b4f68e5e4b0afc5fe58276d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-18T16:23:31.204Z\">5.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Troubled UK outsourcer Capita has seen its shares fall around 2.5% after it said its finance director is stepping down.</p> <p>It said Nick Greatorex would stay with the company for the next few months as it searched for a replacement.

Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound tumbled to a 10-month low versus the dollar after inflation in June failed to tick high...</p> <p>These figures could give the BoE reasons to pause for thought over an August rate hike. With inflation steady at a one year low and average wages slipping, the central bank could have problems justifying the need for a rate hike. Policy makers could use the argument of recovering economic growth over the last few months, however the inflation figures show that growth is not at levels where it is starting to push up inflation. From whichever angle you look at this the data so far this week has not been supportive of an interest rate rise. Instead we are in danger of seeing a repeat of May, where weak data leading up to the MPC meeting prevented the widely expected rate hike. The market expectations of a rate hike slipped to 72% from 77% prior to the release.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-07-18T15:52:51.273Z\">at 4.52pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b4f53cae4b0a426f7db4b53\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-18T14:51:33.877Z\">3.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with Google, and Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In a way Google has become a victim of its own success in terms of its search and marketing capabilities, with little in the way of alternative search and browser options available.

The bigger issue here may be the obvious benefits to Amazon (and potentially Apple) from the ruling; first, even though Amazon already generates ~50% of commerce and product-related searches, the EC will require Android users to take another step before they can access an alternative product search engine. Secondly, to force Google to support distribution of forked-versions of Android (which Google does not control) could directly benefit Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fire devices. To use the example cited by Margrethe Vestager in the press conference, the EC argues that Fire smartphones were not commercially successful because Google did not allow manufacturers to pre-install Google apps on those devices (forget the fact that the apps wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work as well, or at all, on a modified OS.)</p> <p>In order to make an anti-trust argument, the EC needed to argue that Apple iOS (25% market share in Europe) is not a direct competitor to Android, and that Amazon is not a competitor to Google in search. In fact, the EC specifically cites Google/Android having 95% mobile OS market share (outside of China.) While convenient for an anti-trust ruling, we think these assumptions do not reflect the reality of the marketplace. In fact, as others have pointed out numerous times, Apple puts far more restrictions on network operators than Google does, including requirements to pre-install at least 3x as many apps as Google does, while Amazon continues to take share of product search. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b4f41a1e4b0afc5fe5824da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-18T13:39:44.912Z\">2.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Google parent Alphabet has said it will accrue the EC fine in the second quarter of 2018, in <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000119312518220240/d552608d8k.htm\">a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</a></p> <p>Meanwhile its shares have edged marginally higher - up 0.18% - after an initial dip.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b4f3f76e4b0a426f7db4a14\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-18T13:25:20.527Z\">2.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Investors will be watching shares in Google parent Alphabet when Wall Street opens shortly.

Reuters reports: Powell, questioned by members of a House congressional committee, repeated on Wednesday that rising world protectionism would over time pose a risk to a U.S. and global expansion that appears largely on track to continue. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If this process leads to a world of higher tariffs on a wide range of goods and services that are traded and those are sustained for a longer period of time, if it results in a more protectionist world, that would be bad for our economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Powell told the House Financial Services Committee. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t up to us to criticise (administration) policies. But the evidence is clear that countries that remain open to trade have higher productivity. They have higher incomes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance largely retraced the testimony and questioning from a Tuesday hearing with the Senate Banking Committee. In prepared testimony and an accompanying report Powell depicted a U.S. economy poised for perhaps years more continued growth, with the central bank close to its goals of maximum employment and inflation stable at around 2 percent. But as with senators the day before, House members zeroed in on the possible economic consequences of the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imposition of tariffs, with threats of more to come, in the name of cutting better trade deals with both allies like Canada and rivals like China. Powell has tried to walk a fine line in his responses, at once steering clear of direct criticism of the president who appointed him, while also making the economic consequences clear. Powell said he thought the administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aim was to ultimately lower tariffs worldwide, and if there was disruption in the meantime \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it might be worth paying a bit of a short-term price to get to a better place.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At the same time, he and other Fed officials have been clear that businesses are telling them that they already are changing spending and investment plans because of the risks and uncertainties around a possible trade conflict. Troubled UK outsourcer Capita has seen its shares fall around 2.5% after it said its finance director is stepping down. It said Nick Greatorex would stay with the company for the next few months as it searched for a replacement. Capita, which is cutting costs as it attempts to cut its debt levels, appointed a new chief executive, Jon Lewis, in December. The pound has pulled back from its lowest levels but is still down on the day. Immediately following the unchanged UK inflation figures, which cast doubt on whether the Bank of England would indeed raise interest rates next month, sterling slid to a 10 month low against the dollar of $1.3011. It is now at $1.3042, still down more than 0.5% on the day. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said: The pound tumbled to a 10-month low versus the dollar after inflation in June failed to tick high... These figures could give the BoE reasons to pause for thought over an August rate hike. With inflation steady at a one year low and average wages slipping, the central bank could have problems justifying the need for a rate hike. Policy makers could use the argument of recovering economic growth over the last few months, however the inflation figures show that growth is not at levels where it is starting to push up inflation. From whichever angle you look at this the data so far this week has not been supportive of an interest rate rise. Instead we are in danger of seeing a repeat of May, where weak data leading up to the MPC meeting prevented the widely expected rate hike. The market expectations of a rate hike slipped to 72% from 77% prior to the release. Back with Google, and Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: In a way Google has become a victim of its own success in terms of its search and marketing capabilities, with little in the way of alternative search and browser options available. In terms of browsing there is Firefox, Opera and Microsoft Edge, however search options are more limited, with Yahoo and Bing the more well-known names. The solution is likely to be something similar to the solution which Microsoft implemented a few years ago when it had to unbundle Internet Explorer from its operating system to comply with similar EU antitrust rules, allowing the user to choose their own search and browse options. With Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit to Nato and Russia hogging the headlines, his trade battle with China seemed to have gone a bit quiet. Now one of his advisors has been talking trade again. Reuters reports: U.S. President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic adviser said on Wednesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153holding up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a deal to resolve a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant trade dispute\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between the United States and China. Larry Kudlow, head of the White House Economic Council, also said that he expects European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to bring a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trade offer to Trump when he visits Washington next week. The comments were made to CNBC: Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell gave his latest testimony to the US Senate yesterday, and shortly he will be up before the House of Representatives. His testimony is the same to both committees and can be found here. On yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: In his appearance in front of the Senate Banking Committee Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was unequivocal in his upbeat assessment of the US economy. [He] continued with the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message to continue raising rates gradually as he sees several years of the jobs market remaining strong and inflation steady around 2%. This was music to the ears of the dollar, providing the greenback a welcome distraction from the trade war noise over recent weeks. Overall US markets have edged ahead in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 19 points or 0.06%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are both showing similar percentage gains. Positive results from United Airlines and Morgan Stanley are helping to support industrial and banking shares. The EC ruling on Google is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bit misguided\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but is likely to be a minor inconvenience in the short and medium term, says Colin Sebastian, senior analyst at investment bank Baird. (Given the muted reaction from the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price, the market seems to agree). Sebastian adds: Longer term, we see modest (but not unexpected) added risk from requirements to support forked versions of Android, and secondly, from the direct and/or indirect benefits of this ruling for Apple and Amazon. Overall, this ruling should have a limited direct impact on Google since it ostensibly does not force a change to the Google search algorithm, and it also seems relatively straight-forward for Google to comply. The bigger issue here may be the obvious benefits to Amazon (and potentially Apple) from the ruling; first, even though Amazon already generates ~50% of commerce and product-related searches, the EC will require Android users to take another step before they can access an alternative product search engine. Secondly, to force Google to support distribution of forked-versions of Android (which Google does not control) could directly benefit Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fire devices. To use the example cited by Margrethe Vestager in the press conference, the EC argues that Fire smartphones were not commercially successful because Google did not allow manufacturers to pre-install Google apps on those devices (forget the fact that the apps wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work as well, or at all, on a modified OS.) In order to make an anti-trust argument, the EC needed to argue that Apple iOS (25% market share in Europe) is not a direct competitor to Android, and that Amazon is not a competitor to Google in search. In fact, the EC specifically cites Google/Android having 95% mobile OS market share (outside of China.) While convenient for an anti-trust ruling, we think these assumptions do not reflect the reality of the marketplace. In fact, as others have pointed out numerous times, Apple puts far more restrictions on network operators than Google does, including requirements to pre-install at least 3x as many apps as Google does, while Amazon continues to take share of product search. Google parent Alphabet has said it will accrue the EC fine in the second quarter of 2018, in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Meanwhile its shares have edged marginally higher - up 0.18% - after an initial dip. Investors will be watching shares in Google parent Alphabet when Wall Street opens shortly. At the moment the pre-market price is showing limited damage from the EC fine, down just 0.25%. Sundar Pichai, Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, has issued a statement decrying the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision, and confirming that the company plans to appeal against its fine. Pichai argues that Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open source model (which allows manufacturers to modify Android to their purposes) has been good for competition. He also accuses the Commission of favouring proprietary rivals (such as Apple, which keeps a tight hold on its own operating system). Significantly, Pichai states that Google offers phone makers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the option of pre-loading a suite of popular Google apps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The EC, though, accuses Google of using \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tying practices\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exclusivity payments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to prevent rivals app-makers getting a foothold on Android. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the heart of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine. Pichai writes: Today, because of Android, a typical phone comes preloaded with as many as 40 apps from multiple developers, not just the company you bought the phone from. If you prefer other apps\u00e2\u20ac\u201dor browsers, or search engines\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto the preloaded ones, you can easily disable or delete them, and choose other apps instead, including apps made by some of the 1.6 million Europeans who make a living as app developers. In fact, a typical Android phone user will install around 50 apps themselves. Last year, over 94 billion apps were downloaded globally from our Play app store; browsers such as Opera Mini and Firefox have been downloaded more than 100 million times, UC Browser more than 500 million times. This is in stark contrast to how things used to be in the 1990s and early 2000s\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe dial-up age. Back then, changing the pre-installed applications on your computer, or adding new ones, was technically difficult and time-consuming. The Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Android decision ignores the new breadth of choice and clear evidence about how people use their phones today. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement. The EC have created this graphic to explain how Google has been unfairly keeping a grip on its Android operating system, hurting rival search engine and browser makers. The French government has welcomed the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move. Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told reporters in Paris that it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexcellent decision\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No-one is above the laws that have been laid down in common for all....Not Google, nor any other entity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US tech entrepreneur Jason Kint has calculated that the EC has basically fined Google 4% of its annual revenues. That happens to be the maximum penalty available under Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new data privacy rules (even though this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a data violation). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of Margrethe Vestager denying she has a vendetta against America during today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference: Our news story about Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record fine for breaking Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition rules is now live. Our Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin writes: Google has been hit with a record \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.34bn (\u00c2\u00a33.8bn) fine by the European Union for abusing its market dominance in mobile phone operating systems. The EU imposed the multibillion-euro penalty after finding that the US tech firm required smartphone manufacturers to pre-instal Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s search and browser apps devices using its Android operating system, otherwise they would not be allowed to use its Google Play online store and streaming service. Margrethe Vestager, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition commissioner, said Google has used its Android mobile phone operating system \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to cement its dominance as a search engine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, preventing rivals from innovating and competing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and this is illegal under EU antitrust rules\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Vestager added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The vast majority of users simply take what comes with their device and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t download competing apps. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Or to slightly paraphrase what [US free market economist] Milton Friedman has said \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthere ain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t no such thing as a free search.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jennifer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling comes too late to affect the mobile phone market, my colleague Sam Gibbs says: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour of his analysis: The EC is demanding that Google cede some control over Android in its licensing. The EC is demanding that manufacturers should be free to use Android and include the Google Play Store without having to pre-install the Google Search app and Chrome. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a similar strategy to that employed by the EC in 2004, when it forced Microsoft to release a version of Windows without Windows Media Player and later offer a browser choice screen, which allowed users to select a web browser other than Internet Explorer. But as with the Media Player-free version of Windows, Windows XP N, for which there was no demand, consumers are unlikely to buy a version of Android without Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance is arguably six to eight years too late,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Geoff Blaber from analyst firm CCS Insight. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Android has already helped establish Google apps and services as essentials for consumers in the western world. More here: Q: Why does Google get fined in Europe, but not in the US and Canada? Commissioner Vestager insists that the EC has been fair - it has investigated complaints and taken evidence in order to reach its decisions. Q: Was today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision really taken outside the context of the political situation? [a reference to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attacks on the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade policies, and threats to impose tariffs on European exports, I think] People more insightful than me say that the world is becoming more and more unpredictable, Vestager replies. That means it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to do predictable things -- so if you breach antitrust rules you pay the penalty, she adds. The press conference is now over. Q: Currently, the mobile phone operating system is dominated either by Android or Apple. Do you really think that is going to change? Commissioner Vestager says she isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to guess how the mobile sector will develop. But she insists that competition will develop, if the market is fair. She says that Amazon developed a fork which they were very keen to roll out to manufacturers, but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possible because of Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s illegal restrictions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Q: This is the biggest fine ever for antitrust violations, so is Google guilty of the biggest ever antitrust breach? Vestager jokes that she loves all her children equally, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not fair to make her choose which company has been the worst sinner against competition in the EU. Q: Wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t breaking up Google address these antitrust concerns? Vestager denies that breaking up a company would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsilver bullet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to deliver competition. Q: Was Donald Trump right when he told Jean-Claude Juncker last week that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Your tax lady really hates the US\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? Vestager says she has fact-checked this statement. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a woman, and that she deals with tax. But after that point, the US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim becomes less accurate. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I very much like the US\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Vestager insists, pointing out that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from Denmark, where people often have American friends and appreciate US culture and travel. Q: Why is today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine twice as big as the one imposed on Google in 2017? The fine reflects the scale of Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very serious illegal behaviour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Vestager replies. Q: Do you think Google needs to be broken up to improve competition? Vestager says she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know whether that would improve the situation. The EC really wants Google to allow proper competition at the mobile phone operating system level. Q: Does the length of time these cases take limit their impact, as the market has moved on by the time the EU acts? Vestager says that the case began in 2015, following a number of complaints. The EC sticks to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdue process\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which limits how fast these cases can be wrapped up, she explains. Q: What remedies will be available to existing Android phone users? Could Google be forced to send out a notification to customers, telling them they can change their search engine or browser? Vestager says the EC is making a classical \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccease and desist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now up to Google to decide how to make amends in the future. [I think that means that existing Android users won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any difference on their handset] Q: Google now has an entrenched position in the mobile sector (with four-fifths of devices), so how can you enforce changes now? Vestager says Google needs to take away the contractual restrictions that have held back competition on Android. Q: Did you examine whether Google blocked rivals from collecting data on Android users? Vestager says that rival search engines \u00e2\u20ac\u0153never really\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd got a foothold on Android, due to Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restrictions (ie, the company didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to actively block its rivals, as they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there in the first place). Q: Could your decision drive up the cost of mobile phone handsets? Vestager says there are still various ways in which Google can monetising the Android operating system, rather than simply hiking prices. Q: What will happen to the money (assuming Google pays up). Vestager says that the fine will be returned to EU member states, based on how much each country pays into the EU budget. But that could take a while, if Google files an appeal. Commissioner Vestager is taking questions about the Google fine now. Q: Could this decision affect next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting between EC president Juncker and US president Trump? Vestager says that the US competition authorities want fair competition, just as Europe does. As such, they expect the EC to do its job. Q: Should Google apologise? We want Google to end its illegal behaviour, Vestager replies. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a moral endeavour - we just want Google to play by the rules. The size of Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine reflects the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seriousness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and sustained natures of its violation of the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s antitrust rules, commissioner Margrethe Vestager tells reporters in Brussels. The company must end its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcillegal conduct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 within 90 days, by ending the restrictions it has imposed on mobile phone makers (as outlined here), Vestager explains. Our decision stops Google from controlling which search and browser apps manufacturers can install, or which android operating system they can use, she says. And if Google doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comply, its parent company Alphabet could be fined up to 5% of its daily turnover each day. Newsflash: Google says it will appeal against the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine. Google spokesman Al Verney argues that its Android operating system [which is used on 80% of phones worldwide] has been good for consumers. Verney says: Android has created more choice for everyone, not less. A vibrant ecosystem, rapid innovation and lower prices are classic hallmarks of robust consequences. We will appeal the Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. The EC says that Google has been abusing its market position for seven years. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling states: Google has prevented device manufacturers from using any alternative version of Android that was not approved by Google (Android forks). In order to be able to pre-install on their devices Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proprietary apps, including the Play Store and Google Search, manufacturers had to commit not to develop or sell even a single device running on an Android fork. The Commission found that this conduct was abusive as of 2011, which is the date Google became dominant in the market for app stores for the Android mobile operating system. Commissioner Vestager is now outlining how Google restricts manufacturers from creating rival \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcforks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of its Android operating system. In theory, a manufacturer can used the Android source code to create their own platform, as Google makes it openly accessible. But in practice, Vestager says, device manufacturers who wish to obtain Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proprietary Android apps and services need to enter into contracts with Google, as part of which Google imposes a number of restrictions. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager adds: Google has used Android as a vehicle to cement its dominance as a search engine. These practices have denied rivals a chance to innovate and to compete on the merits. They have denied European consumers the benefit of effective competition in the very important mobile sphere. And this is illegal under EU antitrust rules. Vestager is outlining the case against Google. She says: Google required manufacturers to pre-install the Google search and browser apps on Android phones, otherwise they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be allowed to use Google Play (its app service)/. Google paid manufacturers and network operators to make sure that only the Google search app was installed on devices Google has restricted the development of competing mobile phone operating systems, which could have provided a platform for rival search engines. Commissioner Vestager says Google must make amends within 90 days, or the company will incur penalty payments. NEWSFLASH: The European Commission has fined Google \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.34bn for breaching EU antitrust rules. The tech giant is being sanctioned for abusing its dominant position in the Android operating system for mobile phones. The EC says Google unfairly took advantage of the popularity of its Android mobile phone operating system, and forced phonemakers to pre-install Google services such as its flagship search product. Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager is outlining the decision now. More to follow! Margrethe Vestager, the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Competition Commissioner for Competition, is about to give a press conference in Brussels. Presumably this is to announce the Google fine. It will be streamed online here. Over in Brussels, antitrust regulators are preparing to hit Google with a multi-billion euro fine. My colleague Jennifer Rankin explains: Google could be hit with a record fine by the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition authorities on Wednesday for abusing its market dominance in mobile phone operating systems. The company risks a multibillion-euro penalty for making the Google search engine the default on most phones using its Android operating system. Citing people familiar with the case, the Financial Times reported that the fine is likely to exceed the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.4bn (\u00c2\u00a32.1bn) penalty imposed by the European commission in 2017 when Google was found to have used its dominant search engine to build its internet shopping service. Google is appealing against that decision. The EU regulator could fine Google up to 10% of its turnover, or some \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11bn. Reuters is reporting that Google could be fined around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.3bn, or $5bn. The decision could be just minutes away.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sector has suffered another blow \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaty restaurant chain Gaucho is expected to file for administration today. The move will threaten around 1,500 jobs, adding to the thousands being cut at high street chains such as House of Fraser, Poundworld, Marks &amp; Spencer and Mothercare. UK house price inflation has hit a five-year low. House prices across the UK rose by 3.0% in the year to May, which is the slowest growth since August 2013. Once again, falling house prices in London dragged the national average down. The Office for National Statistics explains: The lowest annual growth was in London, where prices decreased by 0.4% over the year. London has shown a general slowdown in its annual growth rate since mid-2016. This is the fourth consecutive month that London house prices have fallen over the year. Political uncertainty (ie Brexit) is hurting prices in the capital, says Guy Bradshaw, Director of Central London Sales and Lettings at UK Sotheby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s International Realty: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As annual growth in the UK has continued to decline to the lowest rate we have seen since August 2013, it is unsurprising to see the London market has also followed suit. We were never expecting to see a particularly buoyant market this year, with political uncertainty and stamp duty continuing to dampen sales. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSpring Bounce\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is undeniably modest in comparison to previous years and whilst this may be due to the poor weather we encountered late into the year this may very well be setting the scene for the summer market. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics correspondent Richard Partington on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures: The chances of a rise in interest rates in August have dipped after British inflation remained at a one-year low last month. Confounding expectations for the return of higher rates of inflation in June fuelled by the rising price of petrol, the Office for National Statistics said the consumer price index remained unchanged at 2.4% from the previous month. Although the cost of gas and electricity prices increased and the price at the pump hit the highest level for nearly four years, consumers benefited from the falling cost of computer games and the summer clothing sales. House prices across the UK also rose at the slowest pace in nearly five years. Faced with falling wage growth, the latest snapshot from the ONS poses the Bank of England with limited grounds for raising interest rates next month. Sterling slid to a 10-month low against the dollar on foreign exchanges after the data was released. More here: The Resolution Foundation has warned that inflation could overtake earnings growth soon, which would mean real wages would start falling again: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation data, from Financial Secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster General, Mel Stride: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation has fallen from its peak last year but we recognise the cost of living is still a challenge for some families. That is why we are freezing fuel duty saving drivers \u00c2\u00a3160 a year, cutting income taxes for 31 million people and increasing the National Living Wage to \u00c2\u00a37.83 an hour.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound is acting more like the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGreat British Peso\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 right now, as it is buffeted by political tensions as well as economic data. So says Bart Hordijk, Market Analyst at Monex Europe, who believes sterling is behaving increasingly like an emerging market currency. Hordijk explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As the dust settles on yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWild West\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 style standoff in Parliament, UK macroeconomic data comes back into the spotlight ahead of the Bank of England rate decision in August..... Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knee jerk reaction [to the inflation data], carving lows not seen since September 2017, evidences how over-inflated expectations were on the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upcoming decision. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s soft inflation reading will do little to knock the Bank of England off of their implied course, but tail risk of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 resurfacing has increased. Sterling looks to be in for a bleak day, especially as Theresa May will have to fend off grilling during today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prime Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Questions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool predicts that the Bank of England will hike borrowing next month, even though inflationary pressures are less intense than feared. He thinks the BoE will be keen to get an interest rate rise through before Brexit becomes even more tense. Despite inflation getting stuck at 2.4%, I sense that early August is a very convenient time for the MPC members to hike. Why? UK inflation, at 2.4% in the second quarter of 2018, is fully in line with their 2.43% forecast recorded in the May Inflation report. So no surprises there. This, together with the widespread expectation that GDP growth in 2018 Q2 will be higher than the previous quarter figure will encourage MPC members to raise the policy rate. At the same time, with the Parliament moving in recess in less than a week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government will get a much needed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbreathing space\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in terms of Brexit-related tensions. All this implies a very short \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctime window of opportunity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for MPC members to hike in August rather than kicking the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinterest-rate can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 down the road. Inflation is still taking a big chunk out of UK workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pay cheques. At 2.4% in June, consumer prices are rising nearly as fast as earnings, meaning real wages are only up around 0.3%. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdUK CPI inflation remains steady at 2.4%, but it is still above the 2% target and is likely to be stuck close to 2.5% over the summer. The gap between wage growth (2.7%) and inflation remains narrow - just 0.3%. So consumers are likely to remain cautious while their living standards are still rising very slowly. Tej Parikh, Senior Economist at the Institute of Directors, warns that wages are unlikely to rise sharply this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The unchanged inflation rate offers some reprieve for households at a time when wage growth remains uninspiring. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite higher utility bills and petrol costs, consumers may have benefitted from offsetting seasonal discounts, particularly on clothing. The good news should however be taken with a pinch of salt. With the recent weak performance in pay packets, and high street bargains only temporary, the cost of living still remains high. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The stickiness in prices will reduce pressure on the Bank of England to hike interest rates in August. The decision is certainly not set in stone, particularly as wage growth is a key component of inflation, and the recent data shows little promise of a sustained rise in salaries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd UK inflation is still over the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of 2%, meaning prices are rising much faster than the saving rates on offer from the banks. Kate Smith, head of pensions at life insurance firm Aegon, says household budgets are still being squeezed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Financial pressure created by rising prices will continue to hit people on fixed incomes, such as pensioners, the hardest. As people live longer, with more years spent in retirement, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vital they protect their savings from the erosive effects of inflation. Even at relatively low levels of inflation the spending power of \u00c2\u00a3100 in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money could be halved in 20 years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time. June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unchanged inflation rate is a huge surprise, says Tom Stevenson, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International. Inflation had been expected to bounce back up to 2.6% or even 2.7% on the back of higher fuel and energy prices. While these came through, they were offset by falling prices for clothes and games. Inflation remained at 2.4% for the third month in a row. Faster rising prices would have given the Bank of England cover for an interest rate hike next month. Now it looks odds-on that the MPC will hold fire yet again. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s particularly the case after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage growth data emerged weaker than expected at 2.5% including bonuses. Stevenson suspects that the Bank of England will hold off raising interest rates until November, or maybe until 2019.... Economist Philip Shaw of City firm Investec says the pound is suffering from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpolitical trauma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as well as today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker-than-expected inflation data. Jamie McGeever of Reuters predicts that sterling could fall through the $1.30 mark (which would be a new 10-month low) Simon French of Panmure Gordon says that an August interest rate rise looks less likely, especially after UK wage growth slowed to a six-month low yesterday. The pound has hit its lowest level in 10 months, as traders react to this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpectedly weak inflation data. Sterling has dropped to $1.3011, its weakest level since September 2017. The City is calculating that an August interest rate rise is now less likely, as there is less sign that inflationary pressures are building. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153political shenanigans in Westminster\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are also weighing on the pound, following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s narrow victory for Theresa May over her customs plan (see earlier post). This chart shows how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s household heating bills, and petrol costs, drove the cost of living up last month. Clothing, toys and computer games got cheaper, though, meaning inflation was flat month-on-month (rising by 2.4% year-on-year). Men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothing prices fell sharply last month, also helped to keep inflation pegged last month. The ONS says: Prices of clothing fell by 2.3% between May and June this year compared with a fall of 1.1% between the same two months a year ago. Prices usually fall between May and June as the summer sales season begins, but the fall in 2018 is the largest since 2012. The effect came mainly from men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothing. The Office for National Statistics says that recreation got cheaper last month, making up for more expensive energy and fuel. Rising prices for motor fuels and domestic gas and electricity produced the largest upward contributions to change in the rate between May and June 2018. Falling prices for clothing and games, toys and hobbies provided the largest downward effects. At just 2.4%, UK inflation remains at its joint-lowest level in 14 months. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate remained at 2.4% in June, defying expectations that it would rise to 2.6%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for households, given the slowdown in wage growth in the last quarter. It also takes some pressure off the Bank of England to raise interest rates next month. More to follow! UK engineering group Smiths is having a bad morning. Smiths shares are down 7%, after it told the City that some of its medical products have lost certification under the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Medical Device Regulations. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 35 points in early trading, partly thanks to easyJet. The budget airline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have jumped by 3%, after it reported a 14% jump in revenues in the last quarter and also raised its profit forecast. Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor, says easyJet is benefiting from falling competition: The demise of competitors such as Monarch, Air Berlin and Alitalia has opened up the field, ancillary revenue has increased due to a change in passenger behaviour (increasingly paying for additional baggage and allocated seating) and load factors remain high. European stock markets have hit a one-month high this morning, led by technology stocks. The Stoxx 600 has risen by 0.6% today, with the tech sector gaining over 2%. Semiconductor firm ASML and telecoms equipment maker Ericsson are leading the rally, after both beating analyst forecasts this morning. That follows a solid day in Wall Street yesterday, where the Nasdaq hit another record high. With Amazon hitting new peaks, and Netflix recovering from disappointing results earlier this week, the tech boom doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to have ended yet. The pound has dipped below $1.31 against the US dollar this morning, close to its lowest level of 2018. Sterling slumped yesterday when the unemployment figures showed wages growth slowing, potentially making an August interest rate rise less likely. The pound is also being dragged down by Brexit anxiety, after prime minister Theresa May was forced to threaten her own MPs with a general election to force them to back her Brexit plan. Although May won a crucial vote on the customs union last night, she lost on a separate amendment which demanded that the UK remained under EU medicines regulation after leaving the bloc. Given the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s precarious position, City investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced that May can drive her plans through the Commons. Kallum Pickering of Berenberg Bank says the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s challenge is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Like herding cats\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Once again, the Brexiteers have laid bare how difficult it is for UK Prime Minister Theresa May to hold her Conservative government together. Although May had turned her plan for a semi-soft Brexit into the official line of her Cabinet last week, causing prominent dissenters to quit, Brexiteers led by MP Jacob Rees-Mogg forced her on Monday to accept an amendment that would make it even more difficult for the EU to endorse her proposed customs arrangement. The strongly pro-EU House of Lords will probably reject the amendment. After the House of Commons barely passed it anyway (305 for, 302 against), the amendment may not survive a second vote. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain may be facing a new cost of living squeeze. Inflation figures due out this morning are expected to show that prices rose at a faster rate in June, hitting consumers in the pocket. Economists predict that the consumer prices index rose by around 2.6% in June, up from 2.4% in May, partly due to rising energy prices. Sue Trinh of Royal Bank of Canada says: The rise in petrol prices in June should ensure that the transport category continued to make a strong positive contribution to UK inflation. Added to that, a number of pre-announced utility price increases kicked in last month, including a 5.5% rise from the largest energy provider British Gas which came into effect at the end of May. This comes as UK wage growth slows. Yesterday we learned that basic pay only rose by 2.7% in the three months to May, the weakest in six months. If you include bonuses, then total earnings only rose by 2.5%. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures will help to influence whether the Bank of England feels confident enough to raise interest rates next month. If prices are rising faster, then the hawks at the BoE will push for borrowing costs to be hiked. But dovish colleagues may worry that wage growth isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t strong enough. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also inflation day in the eurozone. Consumer prices in the euro area are expected to have risen by 2% in the last year, up from 1.9% in May. Also coming up today Google is bracing for a record fine from the European Commission today, over claims it has abused its dominant position in the mobile phone operating system market. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker, Jerome Powell, is returning to Capitol Hill later for a second day of questioning. Yesterday he told senators that the US economy was growing strongly, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The unemployment rate is low and expected to fall further.

Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workers, some of whom have reported sleeping in tents to save money or skipping toilet breaks to avoid disciplinary action, may be marginally less delighted. Twitter reports on Friday and will be hoping to rack up its third profit in a row. At some point this year, it is likely to report a steep fall in user numbers after a purge of fake accounts, part of an effort to deal with what some trendy kids are calling \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fake news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. High user numbers tend to support high advertising revenue, so the prospect of a fall caused some jitters in the shares recently, but the effect of the purge won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show up until next quarter, Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief financial officer said earlier this month. No tech company has taken a bigger knock recently than Google, slapped with a record \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.3bn fine by the EU last week for using its Android phone operating system to cement its dominance of internet searches. Hefty as the fine was, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fairly small beer for Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent, Alphabet, which has more than $100bn in cash reserves. While litigation remains a concern, Alphabet has shown that its horizons extend beyond Google by spreading into lucrative areas such as healthcare. Investors will be watching its eye-watering investment figures closely, but it has been a consistent financial performer and no big surprises are expected come half-year figures on Monday. If Google is the sturdy old oak of tech stocks, Spotify is a mere sapling after its unconventional but successful float earlier this year. Despite never having made a profit, its shares have risen ever since, with investors keen on the huge growth potential of music streaming, where Spotify is dominant. Analysts are predicting continued revenue growth at half-year results on Thursday, believing it can emulate the rise of Netflix in the parallel world of film and TV \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as long as it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fall victim to a backlash from major labels.",

They never say anything in class!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Just recently I had a group of big and sulky teenagers who looked like an art gallery was the last place they wanted to be. But one of them was being remarkably observant and very perceptive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c way ahead of me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and made connections that no other student has made in the 24 years I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been there. After the talk the teacher come up to me, thanking me profusely, and told me that he was one of the most disruptive students in her class.

It feels as if the paintings absorb all the conversations that happen in front of them, and our job is to fuel this communication between pictures and people. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll always remember the woman who approached me after a lecture where I had talked about Duccio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s The Virgin and Child with saints Dominic and Aurea to say, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been looking at this picture for over 50 years and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never seen it quite like that before.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 I was only in my mid-twenties and felt so humbled; what a testament to the power of paintings to keep unfolding the more you look.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Richard Stemp, 55, worked at the gallery for 24 years \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you how many times I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a really mouthy kid in a group who just won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop talking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not ideal because you want everyone to contribute. But then afterwards an astonished teacher asks, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How did you get that child to talk? They never say anything in class!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Just recently I had a group of big and sulky teenagers who looked like an art gallery was the last place they wanted to be. But one of them was being remarkably observant and very perceptive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c way ahead of me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and made connections that no other student has made in the 24 years I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been there. After the talk the teacher come up to me, thanking me profusely, and told me that he was one of the most disruptive students in her class. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the power of art.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Linda Bolton, 64, taught at the gallery for 27 years \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I clearly remember turning from my shopping trolley in Woolwich Tesco to look at a small child one day. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hello, do you remember me?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I had a stab. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153From the National Gallery? What did we look at?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Judgment of Paris and one about Bacchus and Ariadne on the island\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a good memory.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We did it later in school assembly. I was Bacchus.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Great! Have you been back there?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes. I took my uncle when he was looking after my sister and me. I told him all about all the paintings we looked at. The Greek and Roman myth ones specially.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I bet he was impressed, at your memory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think he was. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taking me and my cousins there in half term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I said I hoped I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d see him there. I knew I probably wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. And in a sense it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter. Job done. And I was glad to have been part of the very big something. The something that brought art and stories to life, and gave ownership to being alive and engaged in public spaces.",

The relationship between Fiat and Italy, as well as its hometown of Turin, has changed, including from a legal and fiscal point of view, being FCA a Dutch company with fiscal domicile in the UK.</p> <p>The evolution of the company under its guidance is easily summarised in a few numbers: in 2004 when Marchionne took over, Fiat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenue was close to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac47bn, today its exceeds \u00e2\u201a\u00ac140bn. The company profit trebled from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.5bn in 2004 to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.4bn in 2017, while the stock market capitalization of the FCA universe spiralled from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.5bn to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn.</p> <p>After just a weekend to absorb the news markets are now dealing with its consequences. The importance of Marchionne as a leader emerged from the very first minutes after the bell, with FCA, Ferrari and the holding Exor (all these 3 stocks belongs to the FTSE MIB 40, the main basket of the Italian market) opening with heavy losses. Even more under pressure was Ferrari, where Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency should have continued beyond 2019. But after the initial shock the titles of the Fiat galaxy have started to regain some ground: another sign of Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talent: he managed to grow Fiat thanks to his personality, but building a future for the company independent from himself. A future that starts with Jeep, one of the brands that grew the most in recent years, from which the new CEO, Brit Michael Manley, comes from.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b55b40be4b0f7abbc8f153c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-23T11:18:42.982Z\">12.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fiat shares slide after Marchionne steps down</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a04c78319a60cc726471003f98ece221ec7c8882\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a04c78319a60cc726471003f98ece221ec7c8882/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fiat Chrysler Automobiles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Piero Cruciatti/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Italian-US carmaker Fiat Chrysler is facing a very uncertain future today following the shock resignation of long-serving CEO Sergio Marchionne over the weekend.</strong></p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sad tale - Marchionne had run Fiat for over a decade, masterminding the rescue of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chrysler after the financial crisis.

                "bodyText":"And finally, European stock markets have closed down a little, after a quiet session. The FTSE 100 lost 23 points, or 0.3%, to finish at 7,655. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC shed 0.5% while the German DAX dipped by 0.1%. Geopolitical anxiety is weighing on shares, says David Madden of CMC Markets. Stocks are broadly lower as dealers remain nervous about the state of global trading relations. European equities have lost ground as the prospect of a full-blown trade war is weighing on investor confidence. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today... US home sales - the other economic data of note today - are out. And they show that sales fell in June for the third month running, down 0.6% to an annual rate of 5.38 million units, from 5.41 million in May. House prices rose, though - with the average price up 5% year-on-year to $276,900. This suggests a shortage of properties on the market is keeping prices up, leaving some potential buyers unable to get on the housing ladder. Just in: there was no pick-up in consumer confidence across the eurozone in July, according to the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly healthcheck: Having blasted president Rouhani, Donald Trump has turned his attention to another adversary - Jeff Bezos. Trump has tweeted that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Amazon Washington Post\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (er, what?) has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gone crazy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in its recent coverage of him, and repeated his claim that the e-commerce giant isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t paying the postal service enough. Over the weekend, the Washington Post (owned by Amazon-founder Bezos) reported that Trump was privately frustrated with the slow progress in negotiations with North Korea. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack has knocked Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price down by almost 2%: Incidentally, that Supreme Court ruling cited by Trump should allow states to collect more sales tax from e-commerce companies. But it could actually be a win for Amazon, analysts say, as the company already collects sales tax on products it sells directly to US citizens. Wall Street has opened cautiously, as traders wait for Alphabet (Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company) to report its results tonight. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average have both dipped by around 0.1%, following the G20\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning against a trade war. In other auto news, Tesla shares have fallen over 3% in pre-market trading in New York, following reports that it had asked supplies for a financial helping hand. The Wall Street Journal says Tesla has asked some of its suppliers to refund some of its previous spending, as it strives to reach profitability. The WSJ wrote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Silicon Valley electric car company said it is asking its suppliers for cash back to help it become profitable, according to a memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal that was sent to a supplier last week. Tesla requested the supplier return what it calls a meaningful amount of money of its payments since 2016, according to the memo.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd CEO Elon Musk has now confirmed that Tesla is seeking cost reductions from suppliers. Tesla has been burning through its cash pile as it strives to hit its production targets, particularly for its Model 3 vehicle ActivTrades\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 chief analyst Carlo Alberto De Casa says Sergio Marchionne \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs dramatic resignation from Fiat Chrysler has caught everyone by surprise, even insiders at the auto firm. He explains how Marchionne rebuilt Fiat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fortunes, cutting costs (controversially) and boosting revenues Loved or hated Marchionne is the man who made FCA as we know it today. It is difficult to imagine FCA and Ferrari without the man and his unique style. He wore a sweater rather than the traditional suite and a tie as his every day business attire and with is unconventional leadership style he managed to turnaround one of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and often most troubled--industrial realities. Chosen by Umberto Agnelli on his deathbed, Marchionne took the helm of a an almost bankrupt Fiat 14 years ago and turned it into an international powerhouse. This required sacrifices and controversial decisions, including job cuts and an unpopular \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdenationalization\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the company. The relationship between Fiat and Italy, as well as its hometown of Turin, has changed, including from a legal and fiscal point of view, being FCA a Dutch company with fiscal domicile in the UK. The evolution of the company under its guidance is easily summarised in a few numbers: in 2004 when Marchionne took over, Fiat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenue was close to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac47bn, today its exceeds \u00e2\u201a\u00ac140bn. The company profit trebled from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.5bn in 2004 to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.4bn in 2017, while the stock market capitalization of the FCA universe spiralled from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.5bn to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn. After just a weekend to absorb the news markets are now dealing with its consequences. The importance of Marchionne as a leader emerged from the very first minutes after the bell, with FCA, Ferrari and the holding Exor (all these 3 stocks belongs to the FTSE MIB 40, the main basket of the Italian market) opening with heavy losses. Even more under pressure was Ferrari, where Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency should have continued beyond 2019. But after the initial shock the titles of the Fiat galaxy have started to regain some ground: another sign of Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talent: he managed to grow Fiat thanks to his personality, but building a future for the company independent from himself. A future that starts with Jeep, one of the brands that grew the most in recent years, from which the new CEO, Brit Michael Manley, comes from. Italian-US carmaker Fiat Chrysler is facing a very uncertain future today following the shock resignation of long-serving CEO Sergio Marchionne over the weekend. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sad tale - Marchionne had run Fiat for over a decade, masterminding the rescue of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chrysler after the financial crisis. Its share price surged on Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s watch, as he rebuilt Chrysler and also successfully spun off Ferrari, Fiat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultra-luxurious brand. But his stint has ended too soon; complications following shoulder surgery forced Marchionne to step aside over the weekend. Fiat Chryster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board have moved quickly, promoting Michael Manley, the head of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeep brand, as their new CEO. Manley, aged 54, was born in London and trained as an engineer. Jeep is one of Fiat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success stories of the last decade. But Fiat shares have fallen 3.3% today, as investors fret about how the company will cope without Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experience, wisdom, and work ethic. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tommaso Ebhardt has written a touching account of his time trying (and usually failing) to get an interview with Marchionne. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: It was not easy for Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aides and for everyone at the the Italian-American company. He demanded full dedication and had a constant sense of urgency. That cost him some talented executives. Marchionne could also be brutal, which hurt his relationships with CEOs in the industry and with political leaders. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time for BS,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he used to tell me. The son of a policeman, who moved with his family from Italy to a suburb of Toronto at the age of 14, he joined Fiat in 2004 with no experience in the car industry. Marchionne had planned to retire next year, Ebhardy adds: At the dinner in Michigan, the night before his last Detroit auto show, he acknowledged the time was coming to spend more time with his partner. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This business, if you want to do it at least the way I think it should be done, it is all -consuming,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, describing 14- and 16-hour days doing everything from approving Super Bowl commercials to deciding on electric cars. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now I am tired, I want to do something else.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In another blow to Fiat, there are reports that its European chief, Alfredo Altavilla, has stepped down. He was seen as a possible candidate to replace Marchionne, before Manley got the job.... Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is perking up, despite the threat posed by trade tariffs to its export base. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the Bundesbank, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, in its monthly assessment of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. It says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The economy has likely showed better momentum in the spring than at the start of the year. Although it is unlikely that the high growth rates of the past year will be repeated, manufacturing was once again the key economic driving force.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Germany would welcome a pick-up in growth. GDP only rose by 0.3% in the first three months of this year, down from 0.6% in the final quarter of 2017. The oil price is creeping higher, following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blast towards Iranian president Hassan Rouhani a few hours ago. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly modest rally, though; Brent crude is up almost 1% at $73.72 per barrel, which doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suggest the markets are pricing in a new conflict in the Middle East. Arnaud Masset of Swissquote Bank says investors are remembering how Trump tackled North Korea - furious tweets were followed by encouraging noises, and an all-smiles summit with Kim Jong-un. Masset explains: Market participants appeared not too concerned: they are used to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exaggerations. Last summer he promised \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fire and fury\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to North Korea: a year later Kim and Donald are best friends and North Korea has not shut down nuclear production Ryanair is dragging the European markets down, after the budget airline posted a 20% drop in profits. Worryingly for passengers, Ryanair also warned that recent strikes will probably continue this summer, due to an ongoing dispute over pay and conditions with its pilots and cabin crews. Ryanair also warned that the risk of a hard Brexit is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 being underestimated.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, helping to send its shares down over 5% this morning. Rival airline easyJet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are down almost 2%, leading the FTSE 100 fallers in London. European stock markets are solidly in the red this morning, as traders digest the G20\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning on trade tensions. In London the FTSE 100 has lost almost 50 points, or 0.6%, at 7629. Commodity prices are also dipping, reflecting worries that a trade wars will hit demand for agricultural goods. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says investors are focusing on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unsurprisingly inconclusive G20 meeting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of the US Federal Reserve for raising interest rates. In other geopolitical development, Donald Trump has launched a late-night, CAPS-LOCKED blast at Iran: Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ire was sparked after Iranian president Hassan Rouhani warned that the US would regret getting into a conflict with Iran, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mr Trump, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t play with the lion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tail, this would only lead to regret.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd America should know that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace, and war with Iran is the mother of all wars.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The financial markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be taking the war of words too seriously, though, says Paul Donovan of UBS: US President Trump sent out a tweet threatening Iran with all sorts of dire consequences if Iran is mean about the US. The tweet used lots and lots of capital letters. The oil market, understandably reacted \u00e2\u20ac\u201c oil prices fell a tiny bit. It is possible that US President Trump is unfamiliar with Aesop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fable of the boy who cried \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wolf.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After North Korea, markets are less inclined to take the US president seriously. Newsflash: China has fired a warning shot towards Donald Trump after he threatened to slap tariffs on all its exports to America. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters that threats and intimidation on trade won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. He added that China didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to devalue its currency to aid its exports. The yuan strengthened a little today, and is trading around 6.778 to the US dollar, up from 6.81 on Friday. Anti-austerity demonstrators held protests against the G20 and the International Monetary Fund, outside the meeting in Buenos Aires. There was clear anger about Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to seek a $50bn loan from the IMF, with strict promises to cut spending to bring its deficit down. Unions fear the plan will cost thousands of public sector jobs, and recreate the suffering seen in Greece since its debt crisis began. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To jaw-jaw is always better than to war-war\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as Churchill put it. But the talking at the G20 meeting hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yielded a breakthrough in the Washington-Beijing trade row. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reports there had not been any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantive discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with China about trade during the gathering in Argentina. He also argued that the ball is now in their court, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anytime that they want to sit down and negotiate meaningful changes, I and our team are available.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mnuchin also denied that America was being protectionist, insisting that it simply wants trade to be conducted on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fair and reciprocal terms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The G20 meeting has provided fresh evidence that America and her allies (or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfoes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as Donald Trump sometimes sees them) remain split over trade policies. EU financial affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici hit out at president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent tariffs, warning that no-one would win from a trade war. He told a press conference after the meeting that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Protectionism, I want to insist on that, is good for no one. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trade wars are not easy ... they create no winners, only casualties.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moscovici also warned that trade disputes could get worse, given the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery challenging\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 state of global relations. As he put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These meetings have been taking place in an international context which is very challenging. ... Trade tensions remain high and they threaten to escalate further. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Anxiety over a trade war continues to build, after finance ministers and central bankers warned that the risks facing the global economy are risking. After a sometimes bruising G20 meeting in Buenos Aires, finance chiefs from the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advanced economies cautioned that growth is becoming \u00e2\u20ac\u0153less synchronised\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. With inequality rising and geopolitical tensions bubbling away, the G20 fear that the risks to the financial recovery are rising. The G20 meeting ended with a call for more dialogue to prevent trade disputes -- just a few days after US president Trump rattled the markets by threatening to impose tariffs on all Chinese imports. The communique declared that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Global economic growth remains robust and unemployment is at a decade low,. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, growth has been less synchronised recently, and downside risks over the short and medium term have increased.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The G20 cited a series of risks... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These include rising financial vulnerabilities, heightened trade and geopolitical tensions, global imbalances, inequality and structurally weak growth, particularly in some advanced economies. We ... recognize the need to step up dialogue and actions to mitigate risks and enhance confidence.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd These stern words from the G20 are unlikely to deter Trump from pushing his America First agenda, though. So, the threat of a trade war continues to weigh on investors Asian markets are having a mixed day, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Topix down 0.35% and the Australian S&amp;P/ASX 290 down almost 1%. Shares are also dipping in early trading in London, with the FTSE 100 down 0.35% or 26 points at 7652. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: No progress at the G20 over trade issues means trade jitters are being sent through the markets. Asian equity markets dropped lower as traders took risk off the table, whilst flows into safe haven assets were once again on the increase. Safe haven Japanese yen was seen extending Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.9% gain versus the dollar, whilst gold followed a similar pattern. European futures are also pointing to a lower start after the opening bell. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much economic data to distract the City today, apart from US house sales and eurozone consumer confidence data this afternoon. The agenda 3pm BST: Eurozone consumer confidence for July 3pm BST: US house sales for July 6pm BST: Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent speaks to the Society of Professional Economists, London.",

                "bodyText":"European stock markets have closed higher tonight, swept up by Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong performance and optimism over China. Mining stocks led the rally in London, on hopes that Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new stimulus package will protect China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy from a crash. BHP Billiton, Anglo American and Glencore all surged over 5% to the top of the Footsie leaderboard, as commodity prices were lifted. Tech stocks also gained ground in Europe, as traders watched the Nasdaq hit today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record high. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the closing prices: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100: Up 53 points or 0.7% at 7709 German DAX: Up 120 points or 1.1% at 12,689 French CAC: Up 55 points or 1% at 5,434 Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new stimulus package has calmed some anxiety over the trade dispute with America, boostings sentiment across the globe. A package of tax cuts, research spending, special bonds, infrastructure spending and a pledge to use tax policy to stimulate growth shows that the authorities in China are concerned over the impact that the developing trade war will have on growth and are taking measures to counteract a weakening economy. Traders are also hopeful about the Q2 earnings season, which is getting into full swing; Earning season is off to a strong start, of the 21% of S&amp;P firms that have reported, 80.6% has beaten expectations for Q2 earnings, whilst 74% have surpassed expectations on earnings. These are the fundamental figures which are going to keep the equity rally alive given they offer the perfect distraction to trade war headlines. Until those trade war headlines are reflected in the data, these strong fundamentals will keep the bulls in charge. Over in New York, the Nasdaq remains at record levels. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 45 points at 7412. Alphabet is the second-top riser, up 4%, behind biotechnology company Biogen whcih also smashed profit forecasts today. PayPal (+2.1%) and Facebook (+1.3) are also among the top risers. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Newsflash from Lancashire: Shale gas firm Cuadrilla has been given the green light by government to start fracking at a well between Blackpool and Preston. This is the first permit granted under the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new regulatory regime, and comes despite protests from local residents and anti-fracking campaigners. Energy minister Claire Perry said shale gas was an important potential new energy source, and she was satisfied Cuadrilla had met the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conditions for granting a hydraulic fracturing permit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our world class regulations will ensure that shale exploration will maintain robust environmental standards and meet the expectations of local communities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some in the local community, though, fear that injecting liquid at high pressures into the rock to split it and release hydrocarbons could cause earthquakes and pollute the water supply. The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cure for the global economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imbalances includes cutting pensions in countries who are borrowing too much. On the other wide of the coin, it wants saver countries to keep older citizens in the jobs market for longer. Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has warned that the global economy is being destabilised by current account imbalances. In a new report, the IMF flags up that some countries are simply saving too much (such as Germany), while others are running persistent deficits (Britain and America). And over time, this is creating dangerous instability. The Fun warns: From a global perspective, excess surpluses have been especially large and persistent in a small group of countries, most prominently in Germany and China, and to a lesser extent, in Korea, Netherlands, Sweden and Singapore Excess deficits remain mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom, some euro area debtor countries, and a few vulnerable emerging market and developing economies (e.g. Argentina, Turkey). Donald Trump would surely agree, having made \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfair trade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 a key plank of his administration. But the IMF aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t endorsing the White House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war. Instead, it warns that protectionist measures will back fire. Chief economist Maurice Obstfeld says: The persistence of global imbalances and mounting perceptions of an uneven playing field for trade are fueling protectionist sentiment. These impulses are misguided. An escalation of protectionist policies would mainly hurt domestic and global growth, without much of an effect on current account imbalances, as this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also finds. The Fund also warns that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts could make the things worse: The fiscal easing currently underway in the United States is leading to a tightening in monetary conditions, a stronger US dollar, and a larger US current account deficit. In the near term, these trends risk aggravating trade tensions, and the resulting faster tightening of global financing conditions, which could prove even more disruptive for emerging market economies, especially those with weak external positions Most of the famous FAANG stocks are bursting ahead today. Google/Alphabet is leading the way (+4%), followed by Facebook (+2%), Amazon (+1.7%) and Apple (+0.9%). Investors are wagering that Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong results bode well for the current results season (Facebook reports tomorrow, followed by Amazon on Thursday and Apple early next week). Netflix, which missed Wall Street forecasts last week, is lagging behind though. Breaking: The Nasdaq stock index has hit a fresh record high at the start of trading in New York. Tech giant Alphabet is driving the rally, up 4%, after smashing Wall Street forecasts last night. This helped send the Nasdaq Composite Index up 70 points, or, 0.9%, to 7,912 in early trading. Traders are cheered by the strong earnings from its Google operations (see opening post), which delivered earnings per share of $11.75, compared to forecasts of $9.59 per share. The broader S&amp;P 500 index has gained 0.75%, while the benchmark Dow Jones industrial average is 0.6% higher. Investors in Europe are also putting their worries about trade wars behind them, pushing shares up in London, Frankfurt and Paris: Traders are also cheering China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new stimulus measures. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to cut R&amp;D taxes and spur local investment is bolstering optimism in the markets. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, says: European stock markets are higher in the wake of Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to stimulate the economy. The Chinese government unveiled plans to boost domestic demand in the face of heightened trade tensions. The second-largest economy in the world has been slowing down in recent years, and the tariffs imposed by the US are making matters worse. The proactive move by the Chinese authorities has lifted investor confidence around the global. Bitcoin is also on a tear this morning, as cryptocurrencies rally sharply. The Bitcoin price has jumped by 6% this morning to $8,175 on the Luxembourg Bitstamp exchange, extending its recent rally. The digital currency has now surged by a third in the last 10 days, having fallen sharply from around $20,000 at the start of the year. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, suggests that the Bitcoin bulls have been lured out of hibernation, and could push bitcoin towards $10,000 An inflow of positive news over the past few weeks regarding cryptocurrencies has revived investor appetite for Bitcoin and this can be reflected in the bullish price action. Goldman Sachs and BlackRock have expressed interest in the cryptocurrency markets while the Financial Services Board declared that they do not pose a threat to the global financial system. With this renewed sense of optimism over cryptocurrencies attracting investors from all directions, further upside could be on the cards in the near term. Alphabet shares are expected to jump around 4% when Wall Street trading begin in 45 minutes, after the tech giant beat revenue and earnings targets last night. In the old days, world leaders would prepare for a visiting politician by getting the red carpet swept, and perhaps organising a banquet. Times change, though (and not always for the better). So president Trump has limbered up for his meeting with EC president Jean-Claude Juncker tomorrow with another blast about trade. Tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting between Juncker and Trump could be heated. The EC would like to dial down the trade tensions with the US, which has already threatened to impose tariffs on European car imports. But Juncker may struggle to persuade his host that tariffs are counter-productive, and will hurt US consumers and cost jobs. The two sides have already fired shots in the trade wars; America hit Europe with 25% tariffs on steel imports, prompting new levies on US goods such as jeans and orange juice. But despite all the noise, the two sides actually have fairly low trade barriers. As Chris Giles wrote in the Financial Times today: Even though some trade is deterred by specific high tariffs on both sides of the Atlantic, the average weighted tariffs applied by the EU on US goods were 3 per cent in 2015, a little lower than the US equivalent of 3.3 per cent in the same year. City economist Timothy Ash thinks the Turkish central bank blundered today by not hiking interest rates: Yikes! The Turkish lira is tumbling after the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank surprisingly left interest rates on hold. The financial markets had widely expected a rate hike today, of at least one percentage point. Instead, the Turkish central bank left borrowing costs unchanged at 17.75%, despite concerns over high inflation and the weak currency. The move dealt the lira another blow, wiping 3% off its value against the US dollar. The decision will fuel concerns that president Erdogan is undermining central bank independence, as he pushes for lower interest rates. He has just promoted his son-in-law to a top role overseeing the Turkish economy. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taxi drivers have been pushing back against ride-hail app Uber for years, holding protests and demanding for tighter regulation. But now, they are taking their fight to a higher level - considering suing Uber for more than a billion pounds of lost earnings. Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Kleinman has the details: London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army of black cab drivers are drawing up a stunning plot to sue Uber for more than \u00c2\u00a31bn weeks after the ride-hailing app won a 15-month extension to its licence to operate in the capital. Sky News has learnt that the Licensed Taxi Drivers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Association (LTDA), which has 11,000 members in London, has engaged the leading law firm Mishcon de Reya to explore the potential for a massive legal claim against Uber. Sources said on Tuesday that if the case proceeded, the LTDA was expected to argue that all 25,000 black cab drivers in London had suffered lost earnings averaging around \u00c2\u00a310,000 for at least five years as a consequence of failings in the way Uber had operated. At that level, the overall compensation bill could total \u00c2\u00a31.25bn. Last September, Uber learned it was losing its licence after Transport for London concluded it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fit and proper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 operator. That forced the firm to tighten up its practices, including the reporting of criminal offences and carrying out background checks on drivers. TfL then granted Uber a new probationary licence last month, after the firm passed several inspections. Back in the markets, and Chinese stocks have surged after Beijing announced new fiscal measures to stimulate its economy. Overnight, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government rolled out a mixture of tax cuts and infrastructure spending to tackle the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hurting its economy. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China also acted, pumping $74bn into China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking system to prevent credit drying up. Premier Li Keqiang said it was important to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153preserve economic activity within a reasonable range\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as the cabinet agreed tax cuts for company research and development projects. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government will also accelerate the issuance of new bonds to finance local government building projects, and promote privately funded transport, oil and gas, and telecommunications projects. ANZ economists Raymond Yeung and Betty Wang said in a note. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government is sending a clear signal that it is preparing to defend growth, ... Premier Li may be concerned about the negative impact of deleveraging on growth,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The move comes just days after China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate dipped. It follows rising trade tensions with America, and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose tariffs on all Chinese imports. After months of losses, investors hailed the news. Shares jumped in Shanghai, sending the benchmark index up 1.5% - making its best three-day run in two years. Just in: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories kept growing last month, but bosses are slashing some investment plans as trade war and Brexit fears grow. The CBI has reported that UK manufacturing output rose in the last quarter. Around 35% of businesses reported an increase in new orders, and 20% reported a decrease, giving a balance of +15%. Firms reported that new orders continued to expand \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at a brisk pace\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with stronger demand from domestic customers making up for a slowdown in exports. However, firms are cautious; 18% of firms said they were more optimistic about the general business situation than three months ago and 21% were less optimistic, giving a balance of -3%. Tom Crotty, Group Director of Ineos and Chair of CBI Manufacturing Council, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great to see the manufacturing sector firing on all cylinders, with production revving up again after the slowdown earlier this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But rising trade tensions and ongoing uncertainty over our future trade and customs arrangements are clearly taking their toll on manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 confidence and investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With Donald Trump hiking tariffs, and Britain possibly heading for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno-deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exit from the EU, firms are axing their spending on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intangible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd assets, such as product &amp; process innovation and training and re-training. Investment in this area is expected to fall at a pace unseen since the global financial crisis, the CBI warns. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Serious Fraud Office has launched a new attempt to prosecute Barclays bank over its emergency fundraising from Qatar during the 2008 financial crisis. The SFO has applied to the High Court to get charges against Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank (which holds its banking licence to operate in different countries) reinstated. Barclays says it will defend the application brought by the SFO. Two months ago, the Crown Court dismissed charges that Barclays had conspired to commit fraud by false representations, and provided \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unlawful financial assistance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to Qatar over the fund-raising. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone slowdown, from Oxford Economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Angel Talavera: ...and from Piet Christiansen of Danske Bank: Trader Marc-Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Fongern points out how Germany is outperforming the rest of the eurozone this month: Growth across Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector is slowing this month, according to a new survey of purchasing managers across the region. Data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomposite output\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index has fallen to 54.3, from 54.9 in June, due to a slowdown in growth at service sector companies. Its manufacturing PMI index held steady at 54.2, but factory bosses reported the slowest growth in export orders in almost two years. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief business economist, Chris Williamson, says Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has entered July on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153soft footing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - amid worries about trade disputes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given the waning growth of new business and further slide in business optimism, the outlook has also deteriorated, notably in manufacturing, where the surveys saw worries about trade wars intensify markedly in July. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While there are signs that improving domestic demand in many countries is helping drive robust service sector expansion and support manufacturing, a worsening picture for export growth is clearly having an increasingly detrimental effect on manufacturing. Much of the growth came from Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest two members. Markit adds. Growth in the periphery hit its lowest level since autumn 2016, though. By country, faster growth in Germany contrasted with a slight slowing in France. Elsewhere, growth was the weakest for 21 months, slipping lower in both manufacturing and services. The rate of growth of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector economy rebounded from a 20-month low in May to a five-month high, driven by a stronger increase in manufacturing output. But France saw the second- weakest expansion in 18 months, stymied in particular by near-stagnant manufacturing. European stock markets have all opened higher, as Alphabet gives the technology sector a boost. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index has gained 0.4%, with the mining sector up 1% and tech gaining 0.5%. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s love for a (properly mixed) gin and tonic has swept mixer maker Fever-Tree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares to a fresh record high. They surged to \u00c2\u00a339.87 in early trading, up from $34.60 last night, after Fever-Tree posted a 45% jump in revenues this year. The company has also landed a deal with America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest wine and spirits distribution company, leaving it optimistic about the future. CEO Tim Warrillow declared: Given the strong performance in the first half of the year, the Board anticipates that the outcome for the full year will be comfortably ahead of its expectations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Anyone who had the foresight to buy Fever-Tree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares in 2014, when they were worth below \u00c2\u00a32, can afford a cheeky double G&amp;T tonight. Back in the UK, supermarkets are rubbing their hands after enjoying a boost from England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Cup run. Data firm Kantar reports that sales of alcohol at supermarkets surged to \u00c2\u00a3287 million during the week that the England football team played (and beat!) Colombia and Sweden. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a record, if you exclude Christmas and Easter. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153England may not have won the World Cup \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but its journey to the semi-finals not only helped to kickstart the summer, but supermarket sales to boot. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Over the past month, football-frenzied customers visited supermarkets an extra 13 million times as they hurried to stock up on World Cup-viewing essentials, with alcohol in particular the stand-out winner. Supermarkets also saw strong demand for BBQ products and sun cream: McKevitt adds: With the hot and sunny weather showing no signs of letting up, al fresco dining has continued to tempt shoppers. Over the past month, sales of firelighters and fresh burgers rocketed by 47% and 30% as customers honed their barbecuing skills. Meanwhile, sun care products and painkillers were both in demand: sales of sun creams jumped by 38%, while nearly a third of all households picked up pain-killing tablets over the past month. [Those pain killers might have something to do with those alcohol sales....] Financial analysts are impressed by the ability of Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company to keep growing fast, even with an EU antitrust case hanging over it. As Richard Kramer of Arete Research puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was never a question about Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominance of a buoyant digital ads market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd JMP Securities analyst Ron Josey agrees that Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core revenue stream, web adverts, remains strong: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153First and foremost, Google Sites revenue has continued to grow, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fourth quarter in a row of accelerating growth rates. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continued ability to reinvent or launch new ad products that have been adopted by advertisers, and that drives return on investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Forrester Research\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Collin Colburn said the $5bn fine imposed by commissioner Margrethe Vestager last week was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pretty big\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for most companies, but only a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slap on the wrist\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to Google. But Naeem Aslam of Think Markets argues that Google must avoid further financial penalties, for the sake of its reputation: Today, it is all about Alphabet; Google is the king of the advertisement and its ad business is in full throttle. The message is clear for its investors that the company is a monster in this arena and the EU regulatory backlash hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been able to damage its number in any significant way. The internet giant reported its earning number last night and it smashed all the estimates. The crown jewel, its ads business experienced growth of 24% and its second most important lucrative business; cloud services also added a strong number. The growth in the cloud services was 37%. When we look at the Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earning, it makes us comfortable that there is a moderate slowdown in spending. This means that the user acquisition cost is going down. This creates a more efficient environment for revenue growth. Having said this, the company cannot afford to have reputation damage and it still needs to bring fines under-control because eventually this would add go against Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s values. Last night, Google CEO Sundar Pichai reported that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s self-driving car division is making progress. He told investors: Waymo expanded its partnership with Fiat Chrysler with the option to add up to 62,000 Chrysler Pacifica minivans to its self-driving fleet. And lastly Waymo announced that it has driven more than 8 million fully autonomous miles with most of those on city streets. Pichai also revealed that Google Translate got a boost during the World Cup. Pichai told investors he was: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153...extremely proud to see the positive feedback on how useful Google Translate was for people who traveled to Russia\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In these simple moments, when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in an unfamiliar place or you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the language, Google is there to help with the right information at the right time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European investors are in cheerier mood today, after Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company smashed expectations last night. Alphabet shrugged off the impact of its penalty for breaking European competition rules, by posting revenues of $26.24bn in just the last three months, beating expectations of $25.5bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from $20.9bn a year earlier. Profits dipped to $2.8bn from $4.1bn, but they would have been a sparkling $7.8bn but for the $5bn fine imposed by the EU last week. Chief financial officer Ruth Porat declared the company had delivered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153another quarter of very strong performance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Wall Street agreed - Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares jumped by 4% in after-hours trading following the results. This is feeding through to Europe this morning, with shares rising in London: The results showed that Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grip on Web advertising remains extremely strong, with 58% more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclicks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on its mobile and YouTube adverts than a year ago. Non-advertising revenues (such as mobile apps, cloud computing and Google Home speakers) jumped to $4.4bn, up from around $3bn a year ago. Tech shares are expected to be in demand today after Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimpressive set of results\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, says Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group: It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just the headline figures impressing traders, but also a surprise drop in costs reported by Alphabet. Costs had been increasing at a concerning rate over previous quarters as Alphabet played catch up in areas such as developing its cloud business and consumer business. These higher costs had been squeezing margins causing concern particularly among short term traders. Unexpectedly lower costs have eased these fears, boosting demand for the stock in the process. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the results: Also coming up today There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flurry of corporate news today, as companies clear the decks before the summer holidays. Swiss Bank UBS posted a 12% rise in pre-tax profits in the last quarter, thanks to its investment banking arm. European carmaker PSA has reported record earnings, after the takeover of Opel-Vauxhall last year. But UK energy producer Drax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits fell 15% in the first half of the year, following various outages. And among the the smaller companies, tonic and mixer-maker Fevertree has posted another big jump in profits - adjusted earnings rose 35% in the last six months, to \u00c2\u00a334m. More on all hose shortly... On the economics side, we find out how Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies are faring this month when Markit releases its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Purchasing Managers Survey for July.

                "bodyText":"The huge popularity of Love Island and England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Cup campaign drove a 22% surge in ITV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advertising revenues in June and a further 9% rise in July. Carolyn McCall, ITV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, lauded the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fantastic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd viewing figures for the tournament and reality show for helping the broadcaster achieve a strong performance in the first half of the year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[Our] share of viewing [against competitors] was up 9% in the period, with outstanding contributions from Love Island and the World Cup,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd McCall said. The company said the rate of growth was the biggest in ITV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent history and the broadcaster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share of viewers was at a 10-year high. ITV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exclusive coverage of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s semi-final against Croatia peaked at 26.6 million viewers, and the average of 24.3 million viewers for the match was bigger than the audiences for the London 2012 Olympics opening and closing ceremonies. ITV said Love Island, which airs on ITV2, has achieved the second-highest audience on a digital channel. ITV has sold the Love Island format to seven countries, with an eighth major market to be announced soon.

McCall would not rule out job cuts, saying there needed to be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153realignment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of skills in the business, but said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the net impact will probably be positive on people [numbers] over the three years\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is very much a refresh, not a reboot, as ITV is a strong business, no longer solely reliant on UK advertising,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said.

                "body":"<p>Sky posted a forecast-beating rise in annual profits on Thursday, as its chief executive said the results underlined why the company is at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/19/comcast-turns-focus-sky-after-exiting-battle-21st-century-fox-rupert-murdoch\">centre of a \u00c2\u00a326bn bidding war</a> between Comcast and Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox.</p> <p>Sky comfortably beat City expectations with pre-tax profits up 7.6% to \u00c2\u00a3864m in the year to the end of June and revenues rising 5% to \u00c2\u00a313.6bn.</p> <p>The company is proving resilient in the Netflix era, reporting the lowest rate of customers defecting to rivals in a decade.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whether you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re an independent shareholder or part of a larger group, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results clearly show the cultural success that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re buying into,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jeremy Darroch, Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive. </p> <p>Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fox, which is trying to buy the 61% of Sky it does not already own, is mulling making a new bid after being trumped by Comcast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/12/comcast-26bn-offer-sky-rupert-murdoch-bid\">hours after tabling his own improved offer of \u00c2\u00a324.5bn earlier this month</a>.</p> <p>The results come on the eve of Sky making an appeal to the Takeover Panel at a hearing on Friday to try to force Disney, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/20/disney-raises-offer-for-21st-century-fox-to-713bn-and-outflanks-comcast\">paying $71bn to buy Fox</a>, to pay more for the rest of Sky.</p> <p>The regulator has said that under the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chain principle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is designed to make sure that minority shareholders get treated fairly, Disney must offer \u00c2\u00a314 a share for the rest of Sky after taking over Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 39% stake. However, Sky and some shareholders believe this is too low. When Disney <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/20/disney-raises-offer-for-21st-century-fox-to-713bn-and-outflanks-comcast\">tabled a new bid for Fox</a> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to see off Comcast - it raised it by 36%. </p> <p>Sky investors believe that at the very least the Takeover Panel should apply the same premium to what Disney should pay for the rest of Sky, which would force it to offer a minimum of \u00c2\u00a314.62. This would be within touching distance of Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current \u00c2\u00a314.75 bid, which has been recommended to shareholders by Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independent committee.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the Takeover Panel pushes Disney higher then it gives shareholders more leverage to extract a higher price from Comcast,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one Sky investor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It puts a higher floor on the minimum Sky is worth and gives more power to investors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>The most bullish of analysts and Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independent investors, such as Crispin Odey, believe that Sky is worth as much as \u00c2\u00a318 a share, amounting to more than \u00c2\u00a331bn. Sky shares closed up 0.5% at \u00c2\u00a315.15 on Thursday. </p> <p>Because Murdoch has a deal in place with Disney, Fox must ask for consent to make a new bid for Sky. Under UK takeover rules, Disney/Fox has until 8 August to make a new bid to surpass Comcast.

                "bodyText":"Sky posted a forecast-beating rise in annual profits on Thursday, as its chief executive said the results underlined why the company is at the centre of a \u00c2\u00a326bn bidding war between Comcast and Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox. Sky comfortably beat City expectations with pre-tax profits up 7.6% to \u00c2\u00a3864m in the year to the end of June and revenues rising 5% to \u00c2\u00a313.6bn. The company is proving resilient in the Netflix era, reporting the lowest rate of customers defecting to rivals in a decade. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whether you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re an independent shareholder or part of a larger group, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results clearly show the cultural success that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re buying into,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jeremy Darroch, Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive. Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fox, which is trying to buy the 61% of Sky it does not already own, is mulling making a new bid after being trumped by Comcast hours after tabling his own improved offer of \u00c2\u00a324.5bn earlier this month. The results come on the eve of Sky making an appeal to the Takeover Panel at a hearing on Friday to try to force Disney, which is paying $71bn to buy Fox, to pay more for the rest of Sky. The regulator has said that under the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chain principle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is designed to make sure that minority shareholders get treated fairly, Disney must offer \u00c2\u00a314 a share for the rest of Sky after taking over Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 39% stake. However, Sky and some shareholders believe this is too low. When Disney tabled a new bid for Fox \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to see off Comcast - it raised it by 36%. Sky investors believe that at the very least the Takeover Panel should apply the same premium to what Disney should pay for the rest of Sky, which would force it to offer a minimum of \u00c2\u00a314.62. This would be within touching distance of Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current \u00c2\u00a314.75 bid, which has been recommended to shareholders by Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independent committee. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the Takeover Panel pushes Disney higher then it gives shareholders more leverage to extract a higher price from Comcast,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one Sky investor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It puts a higher floor on the minimum Sky is worth and gives more power to investors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The most bullish of analysts and Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independent investors, such as Crispin Odey, believe that Sky is worth as much as \u00c2\u00a318 a share, amounting to more than \u00c2\u00a331bn. Sky shares closed up 0.5% at \u00c2\u00a315.15 on Thursday. Because Murdoch has a deal in place with Disney, Fox must ask for consent to make a new bid for Sky. Under UK takeover rules, Disney/Fox has until 8 August to make a new bid to surpass Comcast. Such a bid could potentially come as early as Friday, following Fox shareholders voting to agree Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover. Earlier this month, Comcast pulled out of competing with Disney for Fox, instead focusing all its efforts on buying Sky. This has led some analysts to believe there may be an asset carve up between Disney and Comcast. Disney would settle for 21st Century Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-Sky assets, which include the Hollywood studio behind films from X-Men to Deadpool and Avatar, and Comcast would get full control of Sky. Sky has huge strategic value to Comcast and Disney, which are looking for customer growth outside their core US markets and control of more content to compete with the rising threat of Netflix, Amazon and potentially Apple and Google as well. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re focused on Sky now.

So some investors think this is a good opportunity to snaffle a stake in Facebook.</p> <p>Jeff Henriksen, Founder and Managing Partner, Thorpe Abbotts Capital, explains why:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First, the bad news. The market seems to be questioning the quality of growth seen in the past as Facebook spends more to address many of the concerns surrounding abuses on its platform and makes changes on the back of the GDPR regulations in Europe. This has had a negative effect on both costs and revenue growth and caused the market to question Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term prospects and the quality of its past performance. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153That said, I think the market is missing the larger picture here. First, even with the lowered guidance, revenue is still most likely to grow in the mid to high 30% range going forward. The guide higher in expenses (and lower in margins) reflects an increase in predominantly fixed costs that will scale nicely as revenue continues to grow, so margins\u00e2\u20ac\u201deven though they will be lower over the next several years as these expenses ramp\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshould not be permanently impaired. Ultimately these expenses will improve earnings quality and the sustainability of the business model. We believe that it is more likely than not that Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings will double over the next 5 years and provide a very satisfactory return for long term investors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b5a01afe4b08b0659d55b6d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-26T17:16:51.298Z\">6.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Facebook is still on track to set an unwanted record tonight:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HoarseWisperer/status/1022518900616048640\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Facebook could become the first company in world history to lose $100 billion in market cap. in a single day. <a href=\"https://t.co/uiMjIxcgiG\">pic.twitter.com/uiMjIxcgiG</a></p>&mdash; The Hoarse Whisperer (@HoarseWisperer) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HoarseWisperer/status/1022518900616048640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 26, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b59fda8e4b08b0659d55b4b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-26T16:59:28.719Z\">5.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After a very bruising morning, Facebook shares are still down over 18% in New York.</p> <p>This has pulled the Nasdaq index into the red too; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down around 1%, having hit record highs earlier this week.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b59f570e4b08b0659d55ae1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-26T16:26:13.435Z\">5.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a case for investing in Facebook, despite its setbacks and the challenges ahead.</strong></p> <p><strong>Ben Barringer, </strong>equity research analyst at <strong>Quilter Cheviot</strong>, explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Facebook is making the changes to ensure that its place as the leading social media network is maintained following considerable scrutiny in the press and on Capitol Hill.

                "bodyText":"Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sparkling-looking results also includes a flurry of new achievements and milestones, from new Fire smart TVs and tablets to a French Alexa, Amazon Prime\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 22 Emmy nominations and some new cloud computing kit. But analysts really care about the guidance -- which shows that Amazon expects sales and profits to keep surging. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: Net sales are expected to be between $54.0 billion and $57.5 billion, or to grow between 23% and 31% compared with third quarter 2017. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is expected to be between $1.4 billion and $2.4 billion, compared with $347 million in third quarter 2017. The results are online here. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another big earnings night. Amazon has just posted a record quarter, with revenues up 39% to $52.9bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a huge sales performance, but actually $500m less than expected. But earnings per share have beaten forecasts. Shares have jumped in after hours trading. Boom! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official, Facebook has suffered the biggest loss of stock market value in a single day, ever. Shares in the social media giant just closed down almost 19%. That leaves them at $176.26, down $41.24 in a single painful session. That wipes more than $119bn off the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value, I think, and roughly $15bn off Mark Zuckerberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stake. It means Facebook has (reluctantly) taken the crown of the biggest one-day fall away from Intel. The news that Facebook missed Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenue and user growth targets last night, and slashed its forecasts, has clearly given traders a jolt. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no relief for Facebook shares, which are now down 19.5% - wiping around $120bn off the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value. Still, for every seller there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a buyer. So some investors think this is a good opportunity to snaffle a stake in Facebook. Jeff Henriksen, Founder and Managing Partner, Thorpe Abbotts Capital, explains why: First, the bad news. The market seems to be questioning the quality of growth seen in the past as Facebook spends more to address many of the concerns surrounding abuses on its platform and makes changes on the back of the GDPR regulations in Europe. This has had a negative effect on both costs and revenue growth and caused the market to question Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term prospects and the quality of its past performance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That said, I think the market is missing the larger picture here. First, even with the lowered guidance, revenue is still most likely to grow in the mid to high 30% range going forward. The guide higher in expenses (and lower in margins) reflects an increase in predominantly fixed costs that will scale nicely as revenue continues to grow, so margins\u00e2\u20ac\u201deven though they will be lower over the next several years as these expenses ramp\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshould not be permanently impaired. Ultimately these expenses will improve earnings quality and the sustainability of the business model. We believe that it is more likely than not that Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings will double over the next 5 years and provide a very satisfactory return for long term investors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Facebook is still on track to set an unwanted record tonight: After a very bruising morning, Facebook shares are still down over 18% in New York. This has pulled the Nasdaq index into the red too; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down around 1%, having hit record highs earlier this week. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a case for investing in Facebook, despite its setbacks and the challenges ahead. Ben Barringer, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Facebook is making the changes to ensure that its place as the leading social media network is maintained following considerable scrutiny in the press and on Capitol Hill. Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s user base remains large with over 2bn monthly active users and over 1.4bn daily active users. Ahead of the mid-term elections it is vital that it takes action on fake news, any political advertising on Facebook and of course data security. This involves considerable investment in staff and artificial intelligence and these costs will grow faster than revenue for the next 2 to 3 years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However for advertisers, the size and targeting offered by Facebook and increasingly Instagram, is highly attractive and this will continue to drive the growth of revenues and profits.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has suffered a staggering hit today. The value of Zuckerberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stake in Facebook has fallen by around $15bn today, or \u00c2\u00a311bn. That still leaves him with a personal fortune of around $72bn, due to his stake in the social media firm. This chart from Bloomberg shows how Facebook is facing the biggest loss of market value in cash terms ever: That $151bn loss is based on Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares dropping 24% (their worst point overnight). Currently they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still down 18%, which is a loss of around $113bn - so still the biggest rout in history (although that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not adjusted for inflation). Wall Street analysts are worried that Facebook suffered a slowdown in user growth last quarter. The number of North American daily active users on the site remained flat, while the European user base actually shrank -- following the Cambridge Analytics scandal, and new data protection rules. Bloomberg point out that several Facebook executives have been selling shares in recent months. A canny move, given today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout.... As you can see, Facebook missed several forecasts last night (although earnings per share were better than estimated) Facebook shareholders are suffering a historic loss of value today: Colin J Sebastian, analyst at Baird, says Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has been struck by two self-inflicted blows. Facebook dropped two \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bombshells\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the Q2 earnings call, a significant slowdown in revenue growth for Q3/Q4, followed by operating margin declines over the next 3+ years. Importantly, these are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self-inflicted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd issues to a large degree, as Facebook sacrifices core app monetization to drive usage/engagement of Stories. Lower margins will result from continuing large-scale investments in computing infrastructure and headcount, but without meaningful related revenue streams. While shares are moving to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153penalty box,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd we believe after-hours trading already embeds model changes. Maintain Outperform rating. At one stage, Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares were down a hefty 20% - wiping around $125bn off its value. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s basically the value of fast food chain McDonalds . Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nightmare\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd guidance of lower revenue growth and higher costs is causing the rout, says GBH Insights head of technology research Daniel Ives said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you look at their forecast for the second half of the year in terms of user growth, and the expense profile, it refuels the fundamental worries about Facebook post-Cambridge Analytica.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Facebook is tumbling in early trading on Wall Street, after the social network giant revealed the true cost of its data scandal last night. Shares in Facebook have plunged by 18% - an astonishing fall for a company of this size. They have fallen to $178.40 each, down from $217.50 before the company released its results last night. Bloomberg reckons this is Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record one-day fall (unless shares recover during today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session). Investors are unfriending the company after it missed revenue and user numbers in the last three months. But the real concern is that Facebook expects to be less profitable in the coming years, as it strives to clean up its network following the Cambridge Analytica revelations. David Wehner, Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief financial officer, spooked investors yesterday by predicting that the revenue slowdown will continue for some time. Facebook basically admitted that the cost of improving security, and driving out fake news, will make a big dent in profitability. Crucially, Wehner warned that Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operating margins will stop from their current rate of 44% (very tasty!) by around 10 percentage points. These quotes did the damage: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our total revenue-growth rates will continue to decelerate in the second half of 2018, and we expect our revenue-growth rates to decline by high-single-digit percentages from prior quarters sequentially in both Q3 and Q4.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking beyond 2018, we anticipate that total expense growth will exceed revenue growth in 2019,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Over the next several years, we would anticipate that our operating margins will trend towards the mid-thirties on a percentage basis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reaction to follow! Facebook shares have been hammered in pre-market trading....as traders prepare for the open of Wall Street.... Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group, argues that investors shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t totally lose faith in Facebook, despite yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointment. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Perhaps the data scandal is at last beginning to bite in Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings. Certainly, the frequent references to the other platforms available such as Instagram and the new revenue metric of how many people use at least one of the FB apps each month send a message that this is a company looking to find ways of becoming more than just a social media platform. High expectations can be a remarkable burden, and the reaction is often brutal when they are missed, but the revenue miss was slight, and $13.2 billion is not to be sniffed at. Facebook might have its wings clipped, but it is still a remarkable money-making machine. Fortune\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s David Meyer has a pithy explanation for how Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest results disappointed Wall Street last night: The company announced revenues and daily active user numbers that fell short of analyst estimates ($13.04 billion vs. $13.32 billion for the quarter, and 1.47 billion rather than 1.48 billion) and, more worryingly for investors, it warned that its increasing privacy efforts would hit its growth rate further in the second half of this year. Indeed, user numbers in North America are flat and those in Europe have actually fallen. So the expectation that Facebook was just going to shrug off Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard-hitting new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as well as the privacy scandals that have plagued it through much of the year so far, was way off the mark. These things are making a difference, and they will continue to do so. More here: Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market woes could go down in stock market history, says CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Santoli. Newsflash: The European Central Bank has left eurozone interest rates unchanged, at its meeting today. That means the headline borrowing rate remains at zero, an all-time low. Banks still face a negative interest rate (-0.4%) for leaving cash at the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaults rather than lending it. The ECB says it expects to leave interest rates on hold until the summer of 2019. It also affirmed that it intends to halt its asset-purchase stimulus scheme at the end of 2018 (a decision it took at its previous meeting). So no surprises here. President Mario Draghi will face the press in 45 minutes. He can expect questions about when summer starts and ends exactly (a tricky call if we get another heat wave next year). Market analyst David Jones points out that Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares hit record highs yesterday, before the company gave Wall Street a nasty shock after trading ended. Facebook shares remain on track for a massive slide when trading begins in New York, in less than two hours time. The stock is down around 20% in pre-market trading, after it missed Wall Street expectations last night and warned that profit margins will be thinner than expected in the years ahead. This would eliminate all Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains this year: Such a staggering selloff would wipe around $125bn off Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value, and drag founder Mark Zuckerberg down the list of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top billionaires. The French government has weighed in, seeking \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclarification\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the agreement reached between Juncker and Trump yesterday. Finance minister Bruno Le Maire sounds concerned that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s farmers could suffer, declaring firmly that agriculture should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153be kept outside the scope of the discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on lowering trade barriers. Le Maire says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have high sanitary, food and environmental standards as well as rules of production to which we are attached and that guarantee the protection and safety of our consumers. Europe will not compromise on these norms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Writing in the New Statesman, Stephen Bush argues that Jean-Claude Juncker outplayed Donald Trump yesterday: In reality, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a remarkable coup for Juncker. The EU is already seeking to buy more gas as part of the Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term efforts to wean the continent off Russian energy. The EU already has zero tariffs on soy in place, and American soybeans are currently at a low price thanks to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war with China making them attractive to European farmers anyway. But.... that might also threaten the agreement\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s viability. The president might rip it up, if he decides he got the rough end of the deal. One reason why Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s White House is so erratic is that the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind changes depending on which advisor is currently in favour: those wanting to avoid a trade war are currently on the up, but that could change. And that Juncker has conceded very little that the EU hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already conceded in practice may mean that Trump decides he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been had and that the whole mess is re-opened in the not too distant future. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Department for International Trade is hoping that America will soon lift its tariffs on EU steel and aluminium. In a statement, it says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We welcome the agreement by the U.S. and the EU to work together to reduce barriers to trade and to further increase trade and investment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We look forward to progress towards the removal of steel and aluminium tariffs and de-escalation of the tit-for-tat action that could harm businesses and jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Overnight, China has escalated its trade dispute with America by thwarting a $44bn takeover deal. Beijing regulators sunk chipmaker Qualcomm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempted takeover of Dutch rival NXP, by declining to approve the deal. Without a green light from China, the deal expired as the clocks struck midday in Beijing (midnight in New York) - even though eight other regulators around the globe had signed it off. This makes Qualcomm the biggest casualty yet of the Trump trade wars. It launched its takeover of NXP in October 2016, so the collapse of the deal is a serious blow. Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf admitted last night that the tensions between America and China were scuppering the deal, telling Bloomberg: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see anything in the near-term that would make it worthwhile to change the timing. There were probably bigger forces at play here than just us.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder to the White House that China can make things difficult for US companies if president Trump continues to impose tariffs on their imports. The Frankfurt stock market is leading the charge this morning, as trade war relief ripples through the trading floors. The German DAX has jumped by 1.4% this morning, or 172 points, to 12,751 . Automakers are continuing to rally, thanks to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge not to impose tariffs on car imports (in the near future, anyway). The Paris market is also upbeat, pushing France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC index up by 0.7%. Traders are pleased that the Juncker-Trump talk went rather better than expected, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx: While there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly much substance to what was announced, with the fact the relationship didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worsen being more notable than the plans to negotiate, it was enough to lift the spirits of the previously fearful markets. Alan Beattie of the Financial Times makes some good points about the EU-US trade announcement in this thread: Paul Donovan of UBS isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced by Juncker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to buy more American soybeans.... US President Trump tweeted that EU officials were going to buy more US soybeans. EU officials cannot do that. The US is already the largest exporter of soybeans to the EU. There are no subsidies, trade taxes or quotas on soybeans in the EU. Private farmers decide whether to buy more soybeans or not. Not everyone is cheering the news that America and Europe will co-operate on trade. Others noted that while the announcement marks a change in tone, it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily stop Trump from moving forward with auto tariffs later this year if he changes his mind. Phil Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, has pointed out that Donald Trump reached similar agreements with China in 2017 - only to hit them with tariffs months later. Levy explained (via Politico) that the agreement is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better than nothing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to solve any of the problems the president flagged \u00e2\u20ac\u201c trade deficits, tariffs, subsidies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It looks a lot like deals struck with China last year, which of course were a prelude to a full-blown trade war. Shares in European car makers are jumping sharply, as the threat of punitive tariffs fades away. Porsche, BMW, Fiat Chrysler and Volkswagen have all surged by at least 4% in early trading. Investors are relieved that Donald Trump has agreed not to slap any more tariffs on European imports - at least while officials try to hammer out closer trade ties. Before yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, manufacturers was bracing for America to impose 20% tariffs on European car imports, which would have made them much less competitive in the US. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says the US and EU presidents managed to stave off a transatlantic trade war yesterday. Traders do have every right to celebrate Juncker and Trump meeting because the tensions were high before the meeting as it was pretty much clear that we are heading towards a real trade war. But thanks to common sense which prevailed last night, and it eased tensions stoked by threats coming from both side. Under the agreement, both sides would hold off on other tariffs as the negotiation process continues. The joint statement by leaders did look like a fairy tale, both sides agreed to work towards zero tariffs. For Trump it does not matter what the final deal would like, but for now, it is enough for him to show the world that he delivered on his promise and he brought the Europeans to a point where he thinks that things are fair. European officials were pleasantly surprised by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attitude last night, reports the Financial Times: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it was another Trump we saw in there,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one senior EU official. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He was different from the tweets and the noise, different from all that brouhaha. He was focused and engaged and clearly looking for something to help with the markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Another person familiar with the discussions said Mr Trump was eager to find a solution to what had become a growing problem for both sides. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anyone who knows Donald Trump knows that he wants to make deals,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the person. European stock market have opened higher, as traders welcome the warming of relations between Washington and Brussels over trade. The Trump-Juncker agreement isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really a deal, but it could turn into a game changer. So says Holger Schmieding of Berenberg Bank, who is reassured that America won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impose tariffs on EU car imports while negotiations continue. He writes that the two sides have taken \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a step away from the brink\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The US-EU agreement to talk rather than to slug it out in a tit-for-tat escalation of trade barriers strengthens our base case: despite all the noise, the US will not levy new tariffs on car imports from the EU in the end. Instead, the trade tensions stoked by Trump will ease somewhat as the two sides either strike a deal fast (25%probability) or at least engage in serious negotiations (55% probability). If so, Eurozone business confidence can recover this autumn. This should allow the Eurozone to overcome its current soft patch with a return to annualised growth rates of around 2% from Q4 2018 onwards. According to Juncker, he and Trump agreed that the US and the EU should strive in their negotiations to: remove mutual tariffs on industrial goods, reform the World Trade Organization (WTO), and intensify trade in services. While the EU pledged to import more soybeans and liquefied natural gas from the US, the US will re-assess the tariffs it has already imposed on steel and aluminium imports from the EU. The EU would then lift its retaliatory measures. However, Trump isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exactly known for consistency\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, so the upcoming negotiations could still founder, Schmieding adds. The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director, Christine Lagarde, has welcomed Trump and Juncker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am pleased to learn that the United States and European Union reached agreement today to work jointly to reduce trade barriers and, together with other partners, strengthen the WTO. The global economy can only benefit when countries engage constructively to resolve trade and investment disagreements without resort to exceptional measures.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sense of relief in the markets today, after America and the European Union stepped away from a trade war. Following talks at the White House, Donald Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker emerged to announce they had agreed to work together towards \u00e2\u20ac\u0153zero\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tariffs, barriers and subsidies. Trump declared it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very big\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd day, after Europe agreed to buy more soya beans and natural gas from America. The two sides have also agreed to work together to reform the international rules on trade. In truth, details are a bit scant -- as we covered in last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liveblog, the two sides have mainly agreed to negotiate. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an improvement on threats being fired across the Atlantic over social media. Importantly, the two sides have agreed not to impose any more tariffs while they keep talking. That removes the threat of new punitive levies on European car imports. The two men even shared one of Juncker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s famous kisses in the Oval Office - a fitting way to seal the d\u00c3\u00a9tente. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic affairs minister, Peter Altmaier, has cheered the move, saying it will save jobs. Analysts are also optimistic, with Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada saying: This is more positive outcome than many had expected. Also coming up today Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares will get slammed when Wall Street opened, after the social media giant missed forecasts last night. It also warned that profitability will be hit by the cost of cleaning up its platform and fighting election interference. Wall Street threw something of a wobbly last night, sending Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares plunging in after-hours trading. The European Central Bank is meeting to set monetary policy. No fireworks are expected. The ECB has already agreed a plan to wind down its stimulus programme, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far from ready to raise interest rates. But still, president Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference could be interesting. Plus, there are new US trade figures - they might show whether Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs have had an impact.

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clip of president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on the US economy: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good moment to wrap up. Have a good weekend. GW Snap verdict: president Trump is clearly taking today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figure as vindication of his economic policies. That means we can expect more of the same from the White House on trade, tax and spending. Larry Kudlow, the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic advisor, now speaks -- and he backs up Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the US economy will keep growing strongly. Kudlow insists: This is a boom that will be sustainable. Turning away from the economy, president Trump says that the remains of 55 Americans killed in the Korean war are returning to the US. He thanks Kim Jong-Un for sticking to his commitment. Onto trade...and president Trump criticises other countries for stealing US jobs and plundering its wealth. Our tariffs are bringing tariffs back to the US, he continues, saying that the burly steel workers he met in Illinois yesterday were in tears (of joy, presumably). Trump is insisting that his hard line on trade will bring jobs back to America (reminder: his administration is working on a $12bn bailout for US farmers hurt by the row with China) Giving his own trumpet a hearty toot, president Trump now says that his administration have achieved an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic turnaround of historic proportions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We are the envy of the entire world, he adds, saying that other world leaders are regularly congratulating him on the state of the US economy. President Trump is speaking on the economy now at the White House. He says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and that America is going to go a lot higher. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on track for the fastest growth rate in 13 years, the president declares. The US economy is growing much faster than under the previous two administrations, Trump continues. If the current growth rate is maintained, the US economy will double in size 10 years faster than it would have done under presidents Bush or Obama, Trump claims. He also points out that the trade deficit has dropped by over $50bn. Trump insists that the current growth rate is sustainable, and not a single shot boost (some analysts disagree, though) We have the official thumbs up from the White House: Even if this pacey growth doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last, it gives Donald Trump a boost going into the mid-term election this autumn. However, the feelgood factor could face if trade wars hurt the US economy in the coming months. Balraj Sroya, Sales Trader at Foenix Partners, explains: The words \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMake America Great Again\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 can be heard echoing from across the Atlantic this afternoon as the US economy grew 4.1% in the second quarter of 2018, which is the most robust pace in nearly 4-years. Strong export figures, aided by soybean exports in addition to consumer spending, helped the surge in the GDP print. Over the next quarter GDP figures will be scrutinised, as the threat of upcoming tariffs on US exports could dampen the next print. However, it gives Republicans a firm footing ahead of the Midterm elections, as GDP sitting above 3% has been a core pledge for the Trump administration since the beginning of his campaign. Our US business editor, Dominic Rushe, writes: The growth will be a major boon for the Trump administration, which pushed through $1.5tn in tax cuts at the start of the year with a promise that they would be paid for by economic growth. Ahead of the announcement on Thursday, Donald Trump teased that good news could be coming. Breaking with a tradition of presidents refraining from commenting on market sensitive government releases ahead of their release, the president told a rally in Illinois: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Somebody actually predicted today 5.3 [percent growth]. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to happen ... if it has a four in front of it, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re happy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But economists warned the growth spurt may be unsustainable and the evidence so far is that the benefits of the mini-boom have disproportionately gone to the wealthiest Americans. The last time the economy expanded at a comparable pace was in 2014, when growth hit 5.2% in the third quarter. The economic boost was driven by rising consumer spending, exports and business investment over the quarter. More here: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rob Hodgson, Senior Wealth Manager at GWM Investment Management, on the US GDP figures: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Economic Adviser told us it was going to be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fair to say that analysts were projecting some exciting figures. A 4.1% growth rate in Q2 is the strongest since the third quarter of 2014. Projections were ranging between 3 and 5 percent and business confidence remains upbeat so we were expecting a strong quarter of growth. We would suggest that 4.1% overstates the underlying pace of activity, but the tax cuts and impacts of deregulation are likely to keep economic growth accelerating from this point.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As this chart shows, America has just posted its strongest quarter since Donald Trump became president. However, growth was still stronger in the middle of 2014, during Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second term. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reforms have spurred US growth in recent months: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US economy is showing the fastest growth since 2014. A strong labour market, benign inflation and strong corporate investment have contributed to this positive landscape for growth. The economy was already on the up before Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts added further fiscal fuel. The tax cuts are now filtering through to the real economy as companies have been empowered to increase investment spend, the lion share of which is going into technology and automation. Pablo Shah, economist at the CEBR think tank, says America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate was impressive in the last quarter: While much of the resurgence in US growth can be attributed to somewhat transitory factors, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures remain impressive. A strong labour market coupled with accommodative fiscal and monetary policies are set to sustain solid growth throughout the remainder of the year. However, he also suspects growth will fade over time: The US economy is likely to come off the boil in the coming quarters, as the boost to growth delivered by the tax cuts begins to wear off, trade restrictions and an overall slowing of the global economy start to weigh on exports, and further interest rate hikes tighten financial conditions. The dollar has dipped slightly, despite America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate jumping. That suggests investors don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think this growth rate is sustainable. US consumers drove America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US economic growth in the last three months. Consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 4% in the last quarter, up from just 0.5% in January-March. Business investment was 7.3% higher. Exports grew by 9.3%, while exports only expanded by 0.5% -- that will please the White House. NEWSFLASH: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew at an annual rate of 4.1% in the last three months, as growth accelerated. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fastest growth rate since 2014, and a very solid result (although not as high as some economists had hoped). It may show that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts have given the economy a boost. US growth in January-March has also been revised up, to an annual rate of 2.2% from 2%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot stronger than France, which grew at an annualised rate of 0.8% in the last quarter (or 0.2% quarter-on-quarter) More to follow! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly time to discover how fast America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew in the last quarter. Forecast range from an annualised growth rate of 2.6% all the way up to 4.8%, which would be very pacy. First Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares tumble after missing Wall Street forecasts, then Twitter follows suit. So has the social media boom hit a roadblock, or are investors simply over-reacting? Arguably, Wall Street should welcome signs that these companies are getting serious about tackling abuse, fake accounts and disinformation, even if it hits the bottom line. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says there are two theories why shares are tumbling: One, expectations for revenue growth are being fundamentally reset in the social media space. Two, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction is maybe overdone as investors have been spooked by the horrid earnings call from Facebook. Everyone knew that Twitter was full of fake accounts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c why their removal should be impacting the share price in the way is unclear \u00e2\u20ac\u201c investors may be better advised to keep a check on earnings and revenue growth instead. Both Facebook and Twitter have been affected badly by fake news, fake accounts and accusations of Russian meddling. But arguably Twitter looks in better shape as the efforts to monetise the platform are working, whilst we see fundamental concerns about Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advertising model.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Twitter says it is determined to tackle \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcproblem behaviour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, even if it does hurt user numers. It tells shareholders: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are making active decisions to prioritize health initiatives over near-term product improvements that may drive more usage of Twitter as a daily utility.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some snap reaction to Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results: NEWSFLASH: Twitter has just reported that its user numbers have fallen, as it got to grips with fake accounts. The social media/micro-blogging site says monthly users fell by one million in the last three months, to 353 million. Wall Street had expected a rise of one million. Twitter took steps to weed out abusive content providers, and so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbots\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, to (finally) address concerns from regulators, politicians and the public. But investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed, even though twitter also posted earnings of around $100m or $0.17 per share, in line with forecasts. Shares have slumped by 18% in pre-market trading, matching Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble earlier this week. City traders, mortgage holders, savers and borrowers all need to be alert for a UK interest rate rise next week. The Bank of England sets monetary policy next Thursday, and a rate rise is possible - but not certain. There are arguments to hike, but also to sit tight a bit longer. As Nicholas Wall of Old Mutual Global Investors puts it: For a nation that has endured the trials and tribulations of Love Island over the summer, the original unreliable boyfriend returns next week. Will the Bank of England governor Mark Carney deliver the 0.25% rate hike that the market expects? Here are Wall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122sa rguments for a rate hike: Growth may not be that strong, but is reasonable considering the reduced growth potential post-crisis Strong retail sales and manufacturing data (PMIs) High job creation While here are three reasons not to: Brexit uncertainty, which is likely to intensify this autumn Trade war fears - as America threatens China with new tariffs Weak real wages, with earnings only slightly ahead of inflation France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak growth this year could mean Paris misses its deficit reduction targets, and push the national debt higher, says economist Emanuele Canegrati: That would be problematic for president Macron as he tries to push for eurozone reforms. Germany will be less receptive of more risk-sharing between euro members if the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest member is struggling. Global stock markets remain upbeat, as traders count down to 1.30pm BST...when we learn how America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy fared in the last quarter. Ken Odeluga of City Index says Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peach deal between the US and EU on trade is helping, as are recent financial results. In Europe the stream of earnings is picking up, with a set of pleasing if not spectacular reports on Friday. The car sector remains in sharp focus as an epicentre of the trade conflict on this side of the Atlantic and after the apparent stay of execution due to EU-U.S. rapprochement. With Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MIB all just slightly higher and Paris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC slightly soft, the atmosphere is constructive for further potential strength though lacks catalysts. In the currency markets, the pound has dropped back below $1.31 against the dollar. Sterling weakened after Brussels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 negotiator Michel Barnier gave Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcChequers Plan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 a punch in the solar plexus. Barnier rejected the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s idea of collecting tariffs and duties on goods entering Britain and heading into the European Union, saying that the EU must keep control of its money and borders (sound familiar?....) France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has been a tale of two halves in the last year, as economist Shaun Richards points out. Christopher Dembik of Saxo Bank fears the French economy is facing a negative shock: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our energy correspondent, Adam Vaughan, explaining why BP will be pleased to have acquired BHP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Billiton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US shale assets... The deal gives BP a much bigger footprint in oil-rich onshore basins and was described by its chief executive, Bob Dudley, as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transformational acquisition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ...and why BHP will be delighted to have got rid of them: BHP first acquired shale assets in 2011 for more than $20bn with the takeover of Petrohawk Energy and shale gas interests from Chesapeake Energy Corp, but suffered as gas prices collapsed, forcing it to book massive writedowns. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was the wrong environment to have bought the assets when they did but this is the right market to have sold them in,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Craig Evans, the co-portfolio manager of the Tribeca Global Natural Resources Fund, said. This chart, from INSEE, shows how France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate slowed in the last six months, after a solid 2017: The IT meltdown at Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s TSB bank has hurt its parent company, Sabadell, rather badly. Sabadell reported this morning that it tumbled into the red in the last quarter, losing \u00e2\u201a\u00ac138.7m in April-June. That period was a nightmare for TSB, and its customers, when an IT migration to a new platform went disastrously wrong, locking customers out of their accounts for days (and in some cases weeks). Sabadell has taken a one-off charge of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac203m for the outage, a bigger hit than expected, to cover compensation and lost business. TSB CEO Paul Pester was heavily criticised for his handling of the crisis. He has told reporters this morning that he plans to stay at the bank, and is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153100 percent focused\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on putting things right. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak growth figures haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t alarmed investors. European stocks have opened higher with the FTSE 100 gaining almost 0.3%. The French CAC is 0.2% higher too. In London, consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser has surged by 9%. It raised its annual revenue growth target on Friday, following strong growth in its child nutrition business. Telecoms group BT is also leading the risers, up 3% after posting a 3% rise in adjusted profits. European stocks are benefiting from the drop in the euro on Thursday. It shed almost 1% to $1.164, after the European Central Bank sounded dovish about interest rate hike prospects. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Macroeconomic on the French GDP figures: Bloomberg says those French growth figures are a disappointment: The euro area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy had a rough start to the year, when it, along with much of Europe, saw output strangled by bad weather and snowstorms. While there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a general loss of momentum across many economies this year, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown was exacerbated when rail workers staged industrial action to protest President Emmanuel Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reform plans. The continued sluggishness in France is a handicap for the euro area amid a period of uncertainty marked by global trade tensions and the prospect of European Central Bank paring back its vast monetary stimulus. Important energy news: oil giant BP is buying US shale oil and gas assets from mining group BHP Billiton, in a $10.5bn deal. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a major deal for BP - its biggest in around two decades, giving it a much more powerful position in the US energy sector. CEO Bob Dudley says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a transformational acquisition for our Lower 48 business, a major step in delivering our upstream strategy and a world-class addition to BP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s distinctive portfolio. Effectively BP is catching up the ground it lost after the Deepwater Horizon disaster, in which 11 workers died when their rig in the Gulf of Mexico caught fire. Shares in BHP Billiton have jumped over 2% at the start of trading in London -- analysts had only expected these assets to sell for $8-$10bn. BP are down 2%. Economist Philippe Waechter of Ostrum Asset Management says France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP new figures are disappointing. It may mean Emmanuel Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government will fail to hit its growth targets this year. French factories had a lacklustre quarter, with goods production falling in the last three months. INSEE says: Production in goods and services barely accelerated in Q2 2018 (+0.2% after +0.1%). It fell back again in goods (\u00e2\u02c6\u20190.3% after \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.6%) while it continued to grow in services (+0.4% after +0.3%). Output in manufactured goods fell back again (\u00e2\u02c6\u20190.2% after \u00e2\u02c6\u20191.0%). Production in refinery stepped back (\u00e2\u02c6\u20199.9% after \u00e2\u02c6\u20191.6%) due to technical maintenance; production in electricity and gas dropped too (\u00e2\u02c6\u20191.7% after +1.9%). However, construction bounced back (+0.6% after \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.3%). A wave of strikes by French railway workers and Air France employees hurt growth in the last quarter, it seems. Stats body INSEE blames industrial action across the French transport system for a big drop in transport spending. It says: In services, the slow down was notably driven by the downturn in transport expenses (\u00e2\u02c6\u20193.2% after +1.0%), mainly in rail transport as a result of strikes. French rail workers walked out for 26 days between April and June, as part of protest against reforms to the SNCF rail company. This caused disruption to national services, and routes within Paris. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has failed to accelerate. New growth figures show that the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest economy only grew by 0.2% in the second quarter of 2018. That only matches the slow performance seen in the first three months of 2018, and is weaker than the 0.3% which economists expected. The data highlights how Europe has lost momentum this year, after a rollicking 2017. INSEE, the statistics body, says household spending fell in the last quarter. Trade also held back growth, with imports growing faster than exports: Household consumption expenditures faltered slightly (\u00e2\u02c6\u20190.1% after +0.2%), whereas total gross fixed capital formation recovered sharply (GFCF: +0.7% after +0.1%). Overall, final domestic demand excluding inventory changes contributed as much to GDP growth as in Q1 (+0.2 points). Imports bounced back this quarter (+1.7% after \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.3%) as did exports to a lesser extent (+0.6% after \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.4%). All in all, foreign trade balance contributed negatively to GDP growth, \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.3 points, after a neutral contribution in Q1. Conversely, changes in inventories drove GDP on (+0.3 points after 0.0 points). More details to follow... Investors are also desperate to learn how well America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy performed in the last quarter. US GDP, due at 1.30pm UK time is likely to show impressive growth, as president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts stimulate the economy. White House economic adviser Lawrence Kudlow told the markets to expecting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd number - that could mean an annual growth rate over 4%. Also coming up today Amazon has brought some calm to the markets last night by beating profit forecasts. The e-commerce giant racked up record revenues in the quarter, and made twice as large a profit as investors expected. On a conference call with investors, Brian Olsavsky, the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief financial officer, cited growth in Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153most profitable areas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, particularly the cloud-computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Olsavsky also pointed to the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advertising products as contributing to gross profit while \u00e2\u20ac\u0153growing at a rapid clip\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That made up for Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shocking performance a day earlier, which prompted the biggest one-day loss in Wall Street history.

Judging from the available components, German inflation data still tells a two-sided story: while prices for consumer goods have gradually accelerated in recent months, inflation on services has slowed down and has even been negative for a couple of months for communication. Also, whether it was the World Cup effect or just the ordinary sales season is hard to tell, but prices for clothing and shoes were the biggest drag on headline inflation.</p> <p>Looking ahead, there are still little signs supporting the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general optimism that underlying inflation in the entire Eurozone is picking up. Despite a very long economic cycle, low unemployment and rising wages, the German economy shows little sign of overheating, not even a significant pick-up in underlying inflation. Instead, headline inflation is mainly dominated by external and one-off factors. In this regard, the current heatwave could push up food prices and hence headline inflation in the coming months. But with little upside pressure on underlying inflation, chances that headline inflation will fall back under 2% towards the end of the year are much higher than staying at, or closely above, the 2%-mark.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b5ef322e4b09ef967470779\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-30T11:17:23.589Z\">12.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Oil prices are moving higher, helped by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong growth figures from the US.</p> <p>The prospects of sanctions on Iran denting supply is also supporting the market, although the continuing trade tensions between the US and China are a dampening influence.</p> <p>Brent crude is currently up 0.75% at $74.85 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 1.76% better at $69.9. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b5ee9d2e4b0a09780004cd7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-30T10:36:18.726Z\">11.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Press Association on the UK lending figures:</p> <blockquote> <p>The number of mortgage approvals made to home-buyers jumped to a five-month high in June, Bank of England figures show.</p> <p>Some 65,619 mortgages got the green light for house purchase - the highest monthly total since January.</p> <p>Re-mortgage approvals fell by 7.3% month on month, with 47,895 loans approved in June.

Economic sentiment decreased slightly in July, adding to the view that the current pace of 0.4% GDP growth QoQ is more or less the cruising speed for 2018. The PMI and ESI sent differing signals about the performance of industry and services.

Overall, the picture was less positive from a business perspective for both surveys, while the ESI indicated stable consumer confidence.</p> <p>While disappointment with current economic conditions seems to be par for the course at the moment, growth concerns seem to be overstating the current situation somewhat. The outlook for domestic demand remains quite bright with continued employment recovery and some improvements in wage growth.

                "bodyText":"Markets remain edgy after technology shares remain unloved in the wake of disappointing updates last week from Facebook and Twitter. Investors are also cautious ahead of a raft of central bank meetings this week, including the Bank of Japan, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. The FTSE 100 is virtually flat while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 0.29% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has slipped 0.18%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.12% while the technology heavy Nasdaq index is down 0.49%. On the economics front, confidence across the European Union held up this month with the European Commission figures showing a pick-up in sentiment in the UK. Still with the UK, mortgage approvals hit a five month high while in Germany, inflation was steady in July. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Better than expected second quarter earnings from industrial giant Caterpillar have given some support to struggling US markets. The heavy equipment maker raised its outlook for the full year, easing fears that the continuing trade dispute between the US and China would badly damage corporate profits. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has edged up 13 points or 0.07% in early trading while the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.01%. But last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tech sell-off continues to undermine the Nasdaq Composite, which has dipped 0.27%. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate remained steady in July, above the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of 2%. Consumer prices rose 2.1% year on year, the same as the previous month, according to the Federal Statistics Office. That was the figure harmonised with the rest of the European Union - without that it was within the 2% target and down from 2.1% the previous month. Economist Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank said the figures provided little evidence of a sustainable increase in underlying inflation: Based on the results of seven regional states, German headline inflation recorded another marginal drop and slowed down to 2.0% year on year in July, from 2.1.% YoY in June and 2.2% YoY in May. Measured by the harmonized European consumer price index, headline inflation remained unchanged at 2.1%, suggesting that headline inflation in the entire Eurozone (to be released tomorrow) could have hit the 2%-mark for the fourth time in the last five years. Returning to Germany, headline inflation at around 2% YoY, however, is still less the result of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultra-loose monetary policy but rather the result of higher energy prices. In fact, where available, regional core inflation measures remained broadly unchanged and only slightly above 1%, indicating that underlying inflationary pressures in the German economy remain low. Judging from the available components, German inflation data still tells a two-sided story: while prices for consumer goods have gradually accelerated in recent months, inflation on services has slowed down and has even been negative for a couple of months for communication. Also, whether it was the World Cup effect or just the ordinary sales season is hard to tell, but prices for clothing and shoes were the biggest drag on headline inflation. Looking ahead, there are still little signs supporting the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general optimism that underlying inflation in the entire Eurozone is picking up. Despite a very long economic cycle, low unemployment and rising wages, the German economy shows little sign of overheating, not even a significant pick-up in underlying inflation. Instead, headline inflation is mainly dominated by external and one-off factors. In this regard, the current heatwave could push up food prices and hence headline inflation in the coming months. But with little upside pressure on underlying inflation, chances that headline inflation will fall back under 2% towards the end of the year are much higher than staying at, or closely above, the 2%-mark. Oil prices are moving higher, helped by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong growth figures from the US. The prospects of sanctions on Iran denting supply is also supporting the market, although the continuing trade tensions between the US and China are a dampening influence. Brent crude is currently up 0.75% at $74.85 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 1.76% better at $69.9. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Press Association on the UK lending figures: The number of mortgage approvals made to home-buyers jumped to a five-month high in June, Bank of England figures show. Some 65,619 mortgages got the green light for house purchase - the highest monthly total since January. Re-mortgage approvals fell by 7.3% month on month, with 47,895 loans approved in June. Despite the drop-off, the Bank said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153re-mortgaging approvals remain broadly in line with the average over 2018 so far\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd... The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Money and Credit report also said that, excluding mortgages, households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 annual growth in borrowing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remained stable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at 8.8% in June. It said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Credit cards have been accounting for an increasing share of consumer credit growth over the past couple of years and the growth rate of credit card lending has exceeded that of other loans and advances (which includes personal loans, overdrafts and car finance) since January 2018.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Annual credit card growth stood at 9.5% in June, compared with 8.5% annual growth in other loans and advances. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the continued strength in non-mortgage borrowing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is symptomatic of the pressure on consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 finances, rather than rising confidence about the outlook for their incomes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The recent volatility in tech shares could herald a tricky summer for markets, says David Cheetham, chief market analyst at online trading platform XTB: The summer months are often seen as doldrums as far as the markets are concerned with the perception dating back several centuries and characterised succinctly with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sell-in-May\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trading adage. However, there have been some large moves in recent years and there are growing signs that we could be set for another turbulent August as we saw in 2011 and 2015. The root causes of those plunges were the Eurozone debt crisis and fears of a Chinese slowdown, and while the latter of the two could in particular resurface in the not too distant future the early signs this time around, should another plunge occur, seem to be in US tech stocks. Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stunning drop in Facebook caught many off guard and serves as a timely reminder that the latest leg higher in US markets has come on a narrowing breadth and increasingly ambitious price multiples. There remains much to occur before we even get anywhere near the panic seen in previous August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s but there are a growing set of circumstance arising which may spark a period of heightened volatility. Speaking of the Bank of England rate-setting meeting on Thursday, Stefan Koopman, market economist at Rabobank, says: This meeting is Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leap of faith. He has led the markets to expect a rate rise, so he now has little choice but to follow through or risk losing credibility. The good news is that after disappointing economic data earlier in the year, we expect to see 0.4% GDP growth this quarter. With there being evidence to show that the Q1 dip was weather-related rather than a structural, the Bank appears to have the platform to push through a hike. The only plausible reason we could see behind interest rates remaining flat would be the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit. But if rates do stay at 0.5% this time, we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect another rise until there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more clarity around the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the European Union. The pound is having an uncertain time as investors try to decide whether or not an interest rate rise is coming this week. Against the dollar it has edged up 0.15% to $1.3122 while against the euro it is down 0.18% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1226. Sterling is of course being influenced not only by the prospect of a rate rise but the continuing Brexit discussions and the progress (or lack of it) being made by the government. Ahead of the latest eurozone GDP figures due on Tuesday, ING economist Bert Colijn said: We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP data for Q2 to have improved from the disappointing Q1 and it does not look like Q3 has started on a stronger footing. Economic sentiment decreased slightly in July, adding to the view that the current pace of 0.4% GDP growth QoQ is more or less the cruising speed for 2018. The PMI and ESI sent differing signals about the performance of industry and services. The PMI saw a decline in the services index, while the ESI saw improvements and while the PMI indicated stable manufacturing conditions, the ESI industry indicator dropped. Overall, the picture was less positive from a business perspective for both surveys, while the ESI indicated stable consumer confidence. While disappointment with current economic conditions seems to be par for the course at the moment, growth concerns seem to be overstating the current situation somewhat. The outlook for domestic demand remains quite bright with continued employment recovery and some improvements in wage growth. The outlook for the external environment remains uncertain thanks to trade war concerns, although recent developments have been more positive. Even though a trade war has far from been avoided, last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting between US President Trump and European Commission President Juncker at least cleared the air for the moment and could be positive for Eurozone sentiment. The Eurozone economy has shifted into a lower gear for now, but the expansion does not seem to be at risk. Business confidence across Europe remained fairly stable in July with a particularly strong performance from the UK, according to the latest figures. The EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic sentiment indicator for the eurozone was down just 0.2 points at 112.1 while for the wider European Union it edged up 0.1 points to 112.3. The commission said: Broadly unchanged euro-area sentiment resulted from decreases in industry and retail trade confidence, which were offset by an increase in the services sector. Confidence in construction remained broadly stable while it stayed unchanged among consumers. The marginally better outcome of the headline indicator for the EU (+0.1) was mainly due to the marked improvement of sentiment in the largest non-euro area EU economy, the UK (+1.6) More on the UK borrowing figures: Signs of life in the UK housing market, as mortgage approvals picked up last month. Bank of England figures showed approvals rising from 64,684 in May to 65,619, slightly better than expected and hitting a five month high. Net mortgage lending rose by \u00c2\u00a33.851bn while consumer lending increased by \u00c2\u00a31.567bn. Some bad news from Heineken, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest beer maker. Reuters reports: [The company] cut its full-year margin forecasts due to currency weakness in some more profitable markets and expansion in Brazil, knocking its shares on Monday. The brewer of Heineken lager, Tiger, Sol and Strongbow cider reported first-half earnings below market expectations and said its operating margin would decline by 20 basis points in 2018, compared with a previous forecast of a 25 basis point increase, after it fell sharply in the first six months. Overall, the brewer sold more beer in the first six months of 2018 than expected, with growth rose steepest in its two most profitable markets, Vietnam and Mexico, along with Brazil, Cambodia, South Africa, Ethiopia and Russia. Heineken shares traded down 6.0 percent at 86.84 euros, by far the weakest performers in the FTSEurofirst index of leading European shares. The Dutch brewer, whose Heineken lager is the top seller in Europe, said the new guidance was because of the negative translational hit from currencies concentrated more in its higher margin countries, such as Vietnam, and a larger dilutive effect of its expanding Brazilian business. Heineken acquired the loss-making Brazilian operations of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kirin in 2017 to become the number two player in the South America country, and had previously warned of an impact on its margins. The latest Twitter comments from the US president have moved away from trade disputes for the moments, which may give some relief to investors, says Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management: US President Trump has been active on Twitter. Most of the tweets are about media and the Mueller investigation, and do not matter to markets. However, there was also a threat of shutting down the US government if US President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big, beautiful wall\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is not approved by Congress. There is a 30 September budget deadline. Markets may be somewhat relieved that the political focus of the Trump Twitter Feed has shifted from trade to immigration. Both matter as long-term economic topics, but trade is a bigger threat to investors in the near term. The downbeat mood continues although it is by no means a rout. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The markets got off to a negative start on what is going to be a crazy busy week, with investors caught between last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US tech-sell-off and the Fed and Bank of England meetings on Wednesday and Thursday respectively. The FTSE \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is not only facing the much-awaited BoE decision, but the latest PMIs AND updates from nearly a fifth of its constituents \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fell 0.4% after the bell. That dragged the index back under 7700, a level it has struggled to substantially break beyond for most of July. Once again its commodity stocks proved to be an issue, especially its miners, led lower by a 1% drop from copper. While the FTSE struggled, the pound \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for which Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BoE interest rate decision could be a make or break event \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was fairly serene. Against both the dollar and the euro sterling rose around 0.1%, hitting $1.312 against the former and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.125 against the latter. As for the Eurozone indices, there were in a similar mood to their UK counterpart. The DAX dipped 35 points, taking it back under 12850, with the CAC slipping 20 points to slip below 5500. In comparison to the UK and US the region doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a huge amount going on this week, meaning its trading could be driven by the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship to the dollar and pound. GVC, the owner of bookmakers Ladbrokes and Coral, is topping the FTSE 100 risers after confirming a $200m deal with MGM Resorts, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest casino operator. GVC is currently up more than 5%. Our full story on the deal is here: As expected, European markets have begun the week on a downbeat note, following the tech sell-off on Wall Street on Friady. The FTSE 100 has fallen 25 points or 0.33%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 0.27%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has lost 0.4% and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is 0.42% lower. On the results front, London focused estate agency Foxtons has slumped into loss as the capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property market continues to struggle. It lost \u00c2\u00a32.5m in the first half compared to a \u00c2\u00a33.8m profit this time last year, and said the outlook was mixed with a subdued sales market. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: Sales are the real problem as the exodus of buyers in the wake of the Brexit vote continues, while higher stamp duty is biting. Sales revenues fell 23% to \u00c2\u00a317.2m. Chief executive Nic Budden finds comfort in London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstrong fundamentals as a global hub\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. So he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be pleased to see Deutsche Bank moving half of its euro clearing out of the capital to Germany. Deutsche is reported by the Financial Times to be moving almost half its euro clearing activities from London to Frankfurt (\u00c2\u00a3). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets are expected to open lower after a tech sell-off on Wall Street at the end of last week. Investors are beginning to wonder if the relentless rise of the FAANG companies - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (now owned by Alphabet) - could be over. More likely is that there will be increasing divergence between them. Amazon reported stellar results once more and Alphabet easily shook off the effects of a European Commission fine, but Facebook recorded the biggest ever one day loss in value on Thursday after its outlook statement unnerved the market. This followed disappointing results from Netflix a few days earlier. Meanwhile Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s user numbers saw a 1m fall and its shares plummeted 20% on Friday. So the tech heavy Nasdaq Compositie index lost nearly 1.5% on Friday, which has already fed through into declines in Asian markets. Europe, which on the whole put in a reasonable performance last week after Donald Trump and EC president Jean-Claude Juncker eased trade war fears after a better than expected meeting, is also on course for early losses. The falls in the US came despite news that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy had grown by 4.1% on an annualised basis. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: The US session at the end of last week left traders digesting 4.1% yoy economic growth in the US in addition to another round of tech stocks reporting. After Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing update and record breaking sell off, Twitter quickly followed suit. A beat in revenue but a drop off in user activity sent the stock plunging 12% on fears that the platform\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s user growth could be limited. Earnings season had set off to a good start, however tech stock headlines have quickly dominated, transforming perceptions and raising questions over valuations of FAANG stocks. With Netflix, Facebook and now Twitter disappointing with results, investors are seriously questioning these advertising revenues based or subscription-based models. On the other hand, Amazon beat earnings expectations comfortably, whilst Alphabet shrugged off a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 billion fine. This original FAANG trade, which petty much guaranteed impressive returns across previous years, suddenly looks a lot more complicated. Whilst prior to the year these stocks could do no wrong, suddenly that is no longer the case. Investors will now be looking ahead to Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results on Tuesday, with the iPhone maker expected to be closer to the Amazon end of the scale than Facebook, This week also sees a number of central bank meetings. The Bank of England is expected to sanction an interest rate rise on Thursday, but the US Federal Reserve is likely to hold fire a day earlier, albeit it could well give further hints at a September increase. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the turn of the Bank of Japan, US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England to guide on monetary policy, and while no surprises are expected from the FOMC, we could get some policy tweaks from the Bank of Japan after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interventions in the JGB market. We could also get a rate rise from the Bank of England on Thursday when they meet to run the rule over the UK economy and the latest inflation report. Back to today, and there are a few economic numbers to look out for.

In retail, this usually involves asking landlords of poorly performing shops to reduce rental payments or allow the company to exit leases on stores which they would otherwise be bound to for long periods. </p>\n    <p>Companies hire an insolvency practitioner to assess the business and whether a CVA has a reasonable chance of success. They then produce a CVA proposal which may involve changes to the terms of leases or termination of onerous supply or employment contracts.</p>\n    <p>In order for a CVA to go ahead, the company must call a meeting of unsecured creditors, which may include suppliers and landlords. For the CVA to be approved, creditors who are owed at least 75% of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total unsecured debt must vote in favour. At least 50% of creditors who voted for the CVA must not be connected to the company.</p>\n    <p>Once approved, the company can continue trading as usual and all unsecured creditors are bound by the deal, even those who voted against it or didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vote at all. </p>\n    <p>Creditors are often willing to support a CVA in the hope of recovering more cash than they would if the company went into administration or liquidation. They hope that reducing debts will help create a viable company that can continue to trade and pay them.</p>\n    <p>The process is popular with managers because they usually remain in charge of the company and it is cheaper than other forms of insolvency.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>However, the CVA plans have been thrown into doubt by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/26/house-of-fraser-rescue-deal-faces-delay-while-legal-action-is-settled\">a legal challenge in Scotland</a>, where a group of landlords argues that the restructuring plan would inflict unfair financial pain on them.</p> \n<p>Alex Williamson, the chief executive of House of Fraser, has previously described the CVA as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153last viable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd option for the business.</p> \n<p>Days after the restructuring scheme was announced, Ashley won a legal challenge to obtain the store\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business plans, providing him with vital information in the event of an investment bid.</p> \n<p>Ashley bought his 11% stake in 2014 when 89% of the business was sold to Chinese conglomerate Sanpower in a deal worth \u00c2\u00a3480m.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/sports-direct-international\">Sports Direct</a> founder also has a 29.7% stake in Debenhams and strategic investments in businesses including Goals Soccer Centres and French Connection.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>House of Fraser is one of a number of retailers to seek controversial CVAs as some of the biggest names on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high streets struggle to cope with rising costs, weak consumer confidence and competition from online-only rivals such as Amazon.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/11/poundworld-administration-jobs-high-street\">Poundworld</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/28/toys-r-us-falls-into-administration-putting-3200-uk-jobs-at-risk\">Toys R Us and Maplin</a> collapsed earlier this year, while the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/23/prezzo-to-close-almost-100-restaurants-with-loss-of-about-500-jobs-italian-chain-cva-restructuring\">Prezzo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/31/byron-burger-chain-close-20-sites-under-rescue-plan-creditors\">Byron</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/16/not-so-fresh-why-jamie-oliver-restaurants-lost-their-bite\">Jamie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian</a> have shut restaurants and cut hundreds of jobs.<br></p>",

The billionaire, who already owns an 11% stake in House of Fraser, was asked in recent days by bankers advising the retailer to consider providing it with a \u00c2\u00a350m loan, according to a report by Sky News. In June, House of Fraser announced plans to close 31 of its 59 stores, putting 6,000 jobs at risk. The retailer later secured breathing space from its lenders when they agreed to extend loans while it carries out the restructuring under a company voluntary arrangement scheme. C.banner, the Chinese owner of Hamleys, had agreed to make a \u00c2\u00a370m investment in House of Fraser, conditional on the CVA being implemented. However, the CVA plans have been thrown into doubt by a legal challenge in Scotland, where a group of landlords argues that the restructuring plan would inflict unfair financial pain on them. Alex Williamson, the chief executive of House of Fraser, has previously described the CVA as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153last viable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd option for the business. Days after the restructuring scheme was announced, Ashley won a legal challenge to obtain the store\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business plans, providing him with vital information in the event of an investment bid. Ashley bought his 11% stake in 2014 when 89% of the business was sold to Chinese conglomerate Sanpower in a deal worth \u00c2\u00a3480m. The Sports Direct founder also has a 29.7% stake in Debenhams and strategic investments in businesses including Goals Soccer Centres and French Connection. House of Fraser is one of a number of retailers to seek controversial CVAs as some of the biggest names on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high streets struggle to cope with rising costs, weak consumer confidence and competition from online-only rivals such as Amazon. Poundworld, Toys R Us and Maplin collapsed earlier this year, while the likes of Prezzo, Byron and Jamie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian have shut restaurants and cut hundreds of jobs.",
