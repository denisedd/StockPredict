                "bodyText":"Time for a recap. Worries over a potential trade war have weighed on market today, as factories report that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent move towards protectionism is hurting. Asian stock markets tumbled by around 2% overnight, triggering a selloff in Europe. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has just closed, down 89 points or nearly 1.2%. The French CAC shed 0.9%. The losses came after Donald Trump claimed that Europe was as bad as China when it came to trade. That has fuelled concerns that the US could impose tariffs on EU car imports. Europe has already fired a warning shot to Washington, saying it would impose retaliatory tariffs on $300bn of US sales into the EU. The US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, has defended the White House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions, insisting that the global trade system needed to be reformed. Ross also declared that the recent stock market volatility wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t force the administration to change its policies. David Madden of CMC Markets explainsays : The ongoing trade standoff between the US and China has triggered a wave of selling, as traders are fearful the tarifffs could hurt economic growth and bring about a slowdown. There are already signs that the prospect of a trade war is hurting growth. European factory growth slowed last month, with many bosses blaming uncertainty over tariffs for a drop in confidence. Data firm Markit reported that output and new order growth eased in June, while business optimism hit the lowest level this year. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on steel and aluminium, and the prospect of action on Chinese imports, is also having an effect on American manufacturing. US factory bosses have reported a drop in confidence, and a big jump in input prices, as they await the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next move. Back in the UK, UBS have warned that the pound could slide against the euro in the coming weeks, as the Brexit negotiations come to the boil. The US stock market is recovering some ground, but the Dow is still down 100 points (0.45%) today. ISM have also reported that every commodity got more expensive for US factories last month. That suggests that firms were scrambling to lay their hands on raw materials before a trade war breaks out. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to retaliate against America if Trump delivers on his threat to impose 20% tariffs on EU car imports. Donald Trump will put a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tax on the American people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if he goes ahead with a threat to hit European carmakers with punitive tariffs, the European Unionhas warned. In a hard-hitting paper, the European commission said Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self-defeating and would weaken the US economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, estimating that almost $300bn (\u00c2\u00a3228bn) worth of US goods could be hit by countermeasures. The warning comes in the commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first detailed response to the US department of commerce following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to hit imports of European cars with tariffs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The European Union is possibly as bad as China, only smaller,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the US president told Fox News on Sunday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They send a Mercedes in, we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t send our cars in,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he claimed. The EU imposes a 10% tariff on US-built cars, while the US levies a 2.5% tariff on cars assembled in Europe and a 25% tariff on European-built vans and pick-up trucks. More here: The US Institute of Supply Management has also reported that tariffs are having a negative effect on American factories. ISM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey of US manufacturing found that factories are finding it harder to get supplies delivered on time. That suggests that recent curbs on steel and aluminium imports are already having an effect (echoing what Markit reported a few minute earlier) Timothy Fiore, chairman of the ISM Business Survey Committee, says that trade war fears are weighing on the sector. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lead-time extensions, steel and aluminum disruptions, supplier labor issues, and transportation difficulties continue. Demand remains robust, but the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment resources and supply chains continue to struggle. Respondents are overwhelmingly concerned about how tariff related activity is and will continue to affect their business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite these concerns, ISM reports that American manufacturing grew at the fastest pace in four months in June. Newsflash: American factories are also feeling the impact of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade dispute. Data firm Markit has just reported that US manufacturing growth hit a four-month low last month. New order growth slowed to the lowest rate since November 2017, which American factory bosses blamed on recent tariffs. US purchasing managers also reported that input prices kept climbing last month. This was due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153greater global demand for inputs and the effects of recent tariffs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Markit says. This pulled the US manufacturing PMI down to 55.4 in June, down from 56.4 in May (so showing slower growth). Donald Trump has argued that US manufacturing will benefit from his actions, as companies will be encouraged to seek domestic alternatives to imported goods (once they incur an extra tariffs). But Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says tariffs are having a negative effect on the sector: Business optimism about the year ahead also fell to the lowest since January, with survey respondents worried in particular about the potential impact of trade wars and tariffs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tariffs were widely blamed on a further marked rise in input costs, and also linked to worsening supply chain delays \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which hit the highest on record, exacerbating existing tight supply conditions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd DING DING: Wall Street has joined the global selloff at the start of trading in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 180 points, or 0.75%, at the open to 24,085 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 is also down around 0.7%. US traders are concerned that the trade dispute between the US and Europe appears to be deepening, with president Trump claiming that the EU was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as bad as China\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The big concern is that Trump may decide to impose tariffs on imports of cars from Europe (as he threatened last month). The news that the EU has threatened to retaliate with tariffs on $300bn of US imports suggests that tit-for-tat tariffs could hurt economic growth. The US commerce secretary has insisted that market volatility won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deter Donald Trump from shaking up the global trade system. In an interview with CNBC, Wilbur Ross said the US president was determined to push through changes - even if it creates uncertainty that drags stock markets down. Ross argued that the US economy is in good shape, with strong capital expenditure and employment growth - and more jobs available than unemployed people to fill them. All these claims that the sky is falling are at least premature and probably inaccurate. Q: But, the markets have fallen in recent weeks as the trade disputes have gathered pace.... Ross suggests the White House isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t concerned -- especially as US stocks have risen so sharply since Trump won the 2016 presidential election. The stock market hates uncertainty, business hates uncertainty, everyone hates uncertainty. The worst fear is the first of the unknown. But in the end arithmetic prevails, facts prevail, and fears are either realised or they go away. Q: What if the stock market fell 20% from its highs (the definition of a Bear Market)? Ross is adamant that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bright line level\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that would force a change of policy. The president is trying to fix long-term problems that should have been dealt with a long time ago. Obviously there will be some pushing and tugging as we try to deal with very serious problems. There will be some hiccups along the way. Ross also played down reports that Trump might yank America out of the WTO. He argues that the WTO itself understands that some reforms are needed, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153premature\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to talk about withdrawing from the whole agreement. Over in Athens the Bank of Greece has released its much-awaited monetary policy report on the state of the economy following last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key debt-relief package. The report - handed to the Greek parliament this morning - says the agreement reached with euro zone creditors on June 21 offers debt sustainability in the medium term but over the longer term only further reforms and more relief would guarantee it continued. The warning echoed similar concerns expressed by the International Monetary Fund last week. But while the Bank insisted that Greece should take stock of a precautionary credit line once it exits its last international rescue programme in August, it also said the debt relief deal would facilitate the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s return to the capital markets from which it has been excluded for the best part of a decade. Accessing markets again would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the last and decisive indication that the Greek economy had surpassed the crisis,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it said. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leftist-led coalition is bitterly against agreeing to a credit line that would be perceived to compromise the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclean exit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from bailout oversight. In the report, the Bank of Greece governor, Yiannis Stournaras, said he foresaw growth rates of 2% and 2.3% for this year and next. The pound is flat against the euro today, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.13, meaning one euro is worth around 88.5p. But Brexit uncertainty is still swirling, as Theresa May tries to devise a customs deal which her cabinet can support (and which the EU will accept). UBS Global Wealth Management have advised clients to buy the euro against the pound, predicting that sterling will slide in the weeks ahead - especially if negotiations with Brussels fail to make progress. Dean Turner, their UK economist, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve long been advocates that economics not politics should drive markets. However, the current stalemate between the UK and Europe on a Brexit deal cannot be overlooked. In the near future, it is not just events in Threadneedle Street that will matter. Downing Street will be equally important in the minds of markets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Businesses have been fairly resilient in the face of Brexit uncertainty, but they may not stand for much more. If the negotiations drag on we expect confidence in a transition deal to wane. This poses a tangible risk to the economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect there to be a drag on sterling in the coming months as the Brexit back and forth continues.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of a big breakthrough yet. Instead, Brussels officials say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unimpressed by the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest efforts to maintain close ties to the EU while also restricting migration. More here: Worries over trade wars are pushing many currencies down today, as traders seek the safety of the US dollar. The pound is down half a cent against the dollar at $1.315, while the euro has lost a similar amount to trade around $1.163. Emerging market currencies are also suffering; the Indian rupee hit its lowest level since 2013 against the dollar today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a bad year for many emerging market currencies; the rupee, the ruble and the yuan are all down in 2018 (the Turkish lira and the Argentinian peso have really slumped, but partly for non trade-war reasons....) Over in California, Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employees should have enjoyed a good night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep after finally hitting their production targets. The electric carmaker succeeded in churning out 5,000 of its Model 3 model last week, after a major push which saw founder Elon Musk spend his birthday on the production line. It was all worth it, though, as Musk told staff that : \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We did it! What an incredible job by an amazing team.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Musk also tweeted about his jubilation.... ...and found himself gently teased by the European boss of Ford: Ford do have rather a headstart in car production, of course... The price of copper has hit its lowest level since late March, as investors fear that tariffs are hurting economic growth. Reuters has the details: Benchmark copper was down 0.5% at $6,585 a tonne at 1040 GMT from an earlier $6,550 a tonne, its lowest since March 26. Prices of the metal used widely in power and construction have tumbled 10 percent since June 7. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors are taking risk off the table because of trade tensions, which threaten Chinese exports to the United State sand also their profit margins,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said SP Angel analyst John Meyer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Industrial metals rely on China.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The selloff is partly due to this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory data, showing that Chinese factories suffered a drop in export orders last month. The US stock market is expected to drop when trading begins in three and a half hours, following the lead from Asia and Europe. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is being called down 167 points, or 0.7% while the S&amp;P 400 is expected to drop 16 points or 0.5%. Back the markets, shares continue to be buffeted by trade war worries. The main European indices are all in the red, after Donald Trump and the EU both raised the ante in their ongoing tariff dispute. This follows those heavy losses in Asia, where major markets lost over 2% Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the damage: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100: down 77 points, or 1%, at 7,558 French CAC: down 53 points or 1% at 5,270 German DAX: down 55 points or 0.5% at 12,250 Fiona Cincotta of City Index says markets are also suffering from the news that Canada has slapped tariffs on US imports (in retaliation for Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier actions). She explains: From Sunday Canada started imposing trade tariffs on $12.6 billion worth of American goods including iron, orange juice and whiskey in response to the US tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium which were introduced on 22 June. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s northern neighbour joins the ranks of the EU and Mexico, both of which have also hit back against US import tariffs with tariffs of their own, with Mexico penalising imports of US pork, steel, cheese and apples and the EU levying duties on whiskey, motorcycles and orange juice. Amid the trade whirlwind investors are now increasingly looking for stocks that will be the least effected by the tariff tit-for-tat although it is difficult to say what these stocks may be given that Donald Trump has already said he intends to respond with another set of trade tariffs in response to his trade partners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reaction. Finally, some good news. Unemployment across the eurozone is its lowest since the financial crisis began a decade ago. The euro-area jobless rate was 8.4% in May, statistics body Eurostat reports, matching April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest reading since December 2008. In the wider EU, unemployment was a healthier 7.0% - the best since August 2008, shortly before the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered a global downturn. Encouragingly, unemployment has fallen in every eurozone country in the last 12 months. But there are still wide disparities in the region. Eurostat says: Among the Member States, the lowest unemployment rates in May 2018 were recorded in the Czech Republic (2.3%) and Germany (3.4%). The highest unemployment rates were observed in Greece (20.1% in March 2018) and Spain (15.8%). Economists are concerned by this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory growth figures from the UK and the eurozone. Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst says there is weakness at the heart of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector: Growth is lower as manufacturing business rely on backlogs and inventory building to keep machines working, something that cannot continue for too much longer. Similarly, businesses are passing on higher costs to customers but there will be a limit as to how much those customers can or will take. Risks for the sector remain in everything from the weakness of sterling, the threat of trade tariffs and more difficult international trade terms, Brexit and those higher input prices from commodity markets. The trend in UK manufacturing is one of weakness and this figure confirms that fact.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ms Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturing group EEF, is concerned that factory growth slowed across Europe last month: With the rest of the EU being a dominant source of growth over the past year this slowdown, in part driven by fears about global trade tensions, could be a further signal of more weakness to come.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lee McDarby, Corporate IP Managing Director at moneycorp, thinks Brexit is making companies too nervous to invest right now: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In normal times we would expect the weak pound, especially against the Dollar, to have translated into higher manufacturing growth. These are not normal times, however. The weakness of sterling is reflective of investor concern about Brexit and the strength of the UK economy and it could be that these same concerns are holding back manufacturers from investing in growth Newsflash: factory growth in Britain remained steady last month, but bosses are getting gloomier. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK manufacturing PMI has come in at 54.4 this morning, slightly up on May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 54.3 (reminder, any reading over 50 shows growth). But the survey also found that new order growth remained subdued, meaning companies relied on existing business and inventory building to keep their staff busy. Markit says: Although the rate of increase in new business edged up to a three-month high, it remained among the weakest registered over the past year- and-a-half. Business optimism also dropped last month, to a seven-month low, Markit adds. Some firms expressed concerns about input price increases, possible future trade tariffs, the exchange rate and Brexit uncertainty. Newsflash: eurozone factory growth has slowed to an 18-month low - another sign that trade war fears are hurting the economy. Data firm Markit reports that output and new order growth at European firms has slowed this year, and that factory bosses are more pessimistic about future business. This has dragged Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone manufacturing PMI, which tracks activity in the sector, down to 54.9 from 55.5 in May. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the weakest reading since the start of 2017, and closer to the 50-point mark that shows stagnation. According to Markit, factory production grew at the slowest pace since November 2016 while new business growth was the weakest since August 2016. This pulled business optimism down to its lowest level in over two-and-a-half years. The survey also found that France is lagging behind other eurozone nations: Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, is particularly concerned that exports orders remain subdued: The biggest concern is the extent to which export order book growth has cooled since the start of the year, and could soon go into decline. The survey reveals mounting worries from companies relating to the impact of tariffs and trade wars, suggesting firms are bracing themselves for the potential for further export losses. Not surprisingly, business expectations for future production deteriorated in June to the lowest November 2015. City economist Paul Donovan of UBS isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that Europe is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as bad as China\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when it comes to trade. He says: US President Trump sounded upset about Europeans selling Americans things Americans want to buy. The Financial Times reports the EU is threatening to tax a fifth of US exports if the US imposes taxes on consumption of EU autos and auto parts. That would be a trade war. US carmakers are lobbying against the proposed US taxes, showing that tariffs are an outdated concept. July has started in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153troubled mood\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx, as he watches the main European markets slide into the red. Campbell blames the trade war fears that are rippling through trading floors today: Trump kicked off July by targeting the EU, not China, saying that the region was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpossibly as bad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as Beijing in how it treats the US, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjust smaller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This has sent the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous threat of tariffs on EU car imports back to the top of investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTo Fear\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lists, with the added spice of a report from the Financial Times suggesting the European Union could respond in kind with tariffs of $300 billion on US products. Financial stocks are also having a bad morning. The Stoxx 600 banks index, which tracks Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest banks, has dropped by 1.9% in the first few minutes of trading. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has fallen by 72 points, or almost 1%, at the start of trading. That takes the blue-chip index of top shares down to 7574 points. Mining companies are leading the selloff, with Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton both down over 2%. That reflects the fact that demand for iron ore, coal, nickel, copper and oil will all fall if Europe and America hit each other with tit-for-tat tariffs. Other European markets have also opened in the red, with the German DAX shedding 1.3% at the open. Konstantinos Anthis, Head of Research at trading firm ADSS, says Investors are worried about the stalemate in discussions within Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Germany coalition government and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intention to slap China with more tariffs. In a worrying sign, Chinese factories are suffering from falling export orders. Data firm Caixin has reported that new export sales at Chinese manufacturing firms shrank last month, for the third month in a row. That may be a signal that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs are already hurting global trade. Caixin also flagged up that Chinese factories are shedding jobs, as some don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough work lined up. Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, explains: The index for new export orders fell to a low for the year so far and remained in contraction territory, pointing to a grim export situation amid escalating trade disputes between China and the U.S., which led to weak demand across the manufacturing sector. Asian stock markets are a sea of red today, as traders fret about the prospect of a global trade war. Every major share index is in the red, and many emerging market currencies are sliding against the US dollar again. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim yesterday that Europe was treating the US unfairly has helped to drive markets down. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose fresh tariffs on American goods has also alarmed investors: A ramping up of trade war headlines over the weekend, such as a strong warning of retaliation from the EU and a potential currency war with China (US), will ensure that the fear of an all out global trade war is central in trader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind, as the session begins on Monday. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The second half of the financial year is beginning where the first half left off, with rising anxiety over a trade war. Overnight, Donald Trump has launched a fresh attack on the European Union, claiming it treated the US very badly and was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153possibly as bad as China, just smaller\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Speaking on Fox News, the US president declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Look what they do to our farmers, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want our farm products. In all fairness they have their farmers so they want to protect their farmers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t protect ours and they protect theirs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments raise the prospect that the US could impose further tariffs on EU imports - possibly on car imports (something he threatened last month). Europe isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taking Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sledging lying down, though. According to the Financial Times, the EU has threatened to retaliate with tariffs on up to $300bn of US products, if the US does indeed penalise EU carmakers. The threat of retaliatory tariffs on US imports into Europe came in a written submission to the US Department of Commerce, outlining how the bloc would respond to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threats. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jim Brunsden explains: Brussels said that an American investigation into whether foreign cars and parts posed a national security risk could plunge the global economy into a full-on trade war, harming employment in the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auto sector, which accounts for more than 4m jobs. In a sign of the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exasperation at Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confrontational trade policy, which has already stoked tensions over steel and aluminium, the document said the move \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could result in yet another disregard of international law\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the US. It said imposing the car tariffs would not be accepted by the international community and would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153damage further the reputation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the US. This has already sparked a selloff in Asia, where Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CSI 300 index have both shed 2%. European markets are set for losses at the open too, with the FTSE 100 called down 50 points. Also coming up today Data firm Markit is publishing its latest Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) reports, showing how manufacturing companies across the world fared last month. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll show whether the threat of a global trade war has hurt factories. And in Germany, Angela Merkel is still locked in battle with her CSU coalition over migration. Last night, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interior minister reportedly announced his intention to resign - a move that could bring down the Chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasingly shaky coalition. Merkel and Horst Seehofer are due to hold fresh talks this afternoon, so the great survivor of European politics could yet see off another crisis. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9am BST: Eurozone manufacturing PMI for June 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI for June 10am BST: Eurozone unemployment figures for May 3pm BST: US manufacturing PMI for June",

                "bodyText":"European markets have closed higher, as traders welcomed a day without trade war escalation. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 gained 45 points or 0.6% to close at 7953, while the German DAX gained 0.9% and the French CAC picked up 0.75%. The reassuring noises out of Beijing today helped to calm nerves (although perhaps only temporarily), as did the German coalition deal on migration. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Stocks are higher as improved political relations in Germany and constructive trade comments from China has lifted investor sentiment. Angela Merkel has brokered a deal with Horst Seehofer which will keep their alliance intact. The positive mood might not last long though, as the Social Democrats need to inspect the agreement. An official from the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China announced they will not use the yuan as a tool in the trade spat with the US, and traders are taking this as a step in the right direct for global trading relations. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. GW Time for a quick recap. Chinese central bankers have vowed not to use their currency as a weapon in the trade conflict with the U.S. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China has pledged to keep the yuan stable, after seeing it slide to its weakest level in almost a year. PBOC insisted that Beijing is committed to upholding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153multilateralism, globalization, free trade and rule-based global guidelines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a roll-call of causes under threat from America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protectionist moves. Sun Guofeng, head of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial research institute, told Bloomberg: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recently the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate has shown some weakness. This is entirely due to changes in market expectations as external uncertainties rise rather than intended guidance of the central bank. China upholds multilateralism, globalization, free trade and rule-based international guidelines, and will not make the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate a tool to cope with trade conflicts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd PBOC also pledged to maintain the yuan at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reasonable, equilibrium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd level. This has helped to pull the yuan back up; earlier today it tipped below the 6.7 mark against the US dollar. Donald Trump has defended his policy of pushing other countries to reform their trade rules, or be hit with fresh tariffs. European stock markets are recovering from Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. In London, the FTSE 100 is now up 76 points (1%) at 7622. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says European investors are relieved that Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition crisis has been resolved. A day after the German interior minister offered his resignation over Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy on immigrants, a move that had serious implications on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brittle coalition government, Chancellor Angela Merkel managed to pull Germany back from the brink with a last minute deal which has pacified the rebels in her government. There was a collective sigh of relief across European stock markets Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector has posted stronger growth. Housebuilding helped to push activity up last month, but Brexit uncertainty may be restricting big projects. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no wild dramas on Wall Street...yet anyway. The US stock market has opened calmly, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 109 points, or 0.4%. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge not to use the yuan as a tool in the trade conflict with America is providing some reassurance. But, analyst Marc-Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Fongern believes the PBOC may have to back up its words with actions, and prop up the yuan if it falls again. Indian industrialist S.M. Lodha has warned that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to shake up global trade will backfire. Lodha, who chairs UK insulation firm Western Thermal Limited, believes US firms will suffer as the EU, China, Canada and Mexico impose retaliatory tariffs. Lodha explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The trade tariffs imposed by President Trump on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closest allies including Canada, Mexico, European Union and India, are strategically misplaced and self-defeating as it stands to directly weaken the US economy. The US Chamber of Commerce, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest lobbying group which has been historically close to Republican administrations, have themselves gone on record to denounce Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s erroneous idea of putting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153America First\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd though trade wars. As President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel tariff directly affects countries including Canada, EU and India, the EU has already warned that an estimated $300 billion worth of US goods could be hit by countermeasures. Even Canada has vowed to impose punitive countermeasures which can see over $12.6 billion worth of American goods being directly hit. Therefore, it is the American exporters who would be bearing a brunt over something the illogical and politically misguided actions of President Trump. If a country imposes tariffs on another, one can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complain if they retaliate. This is a key \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcArt of the Deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Mr Trump seems to have missed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has promised not to launch a currency war against America. Bloomberg has the details: China is committed to multilateralism, globalization, free trade and rule-based global guidelines, Sun Guofeng, director of the PBOC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial research institute, said in a written response to Bloomberg News. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an interesting pledge, given that the yuan (which is tightly controlled by Beijing) fell to an 11-month low today. Even the PBOC can only have so much effect - if Chinese companies and wealthy citizens try to move capital overseas, the yuan will fall. A weaker yuan also helps Chinese exporters, allowing them to cut prices and cushion the blow of US tariffs. Sun Guofeng\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge seems to be reassuring the markets, pushing the yuan a little higher against the US dollar away from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 6.7 low. The Treasury committee has been quizzing tax experts this morning, and hearing that online giants are still getting an unfair advantage. Charlie Elphicke, Tory MP for Dover and Deal, asked Richard Allen, the founder of group Retailers Against VAT Abuse Schemes, whether recent changes in the Finance Act had been effective in cracking down on VAT fraud by sellers on Ebay, Amazon and other online marketplaces. Allen replied that the measures were not tough enough and that legislation was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more relaxed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than in Germany. Elphicke asked: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Compared to Germany, our taxpayers are still being taken for a ride and Amazon are still in a position where they are not having to hand over information?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Allen agreed, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Small traders get very annoyed when they find themselves being investigated for VAT when big companies don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to get the same kind of attention. I was told by senior officials they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been instructed, HMRC had been instructed not to go too hard on Amazon yet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This has resulted in online firms having an unfair competitive advantage over high street retailers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The regulatory environment in which these online businesses operate is not as tough as the regulatory environment for highstreet retailers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Allen added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sell dangerous products in a shop. You couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t openly sell goods where there is no VAT charge in a shop\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 There is a huge imbalance between online retail and high street retail.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd His biggest concern is that online retailers are unregulated private marketplaces operated by one company. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The owner of a private marketplace online gets to see the sales data of everyone selling on that platform and can use that to their advantage selling products themselves.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This means \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they can manipulate prices on their own marketplace,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Allen said, adding that Amazon sometimes sold lost leaders to maintain its market position. He is backing a VAT surcharge on overseas retailers selling goods in Britain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a similar measure is working well in Australia, he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would introduce an extra cost on these cheap imports that would protect British retailers from an avalanche of cheap stuff\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Exactly 49 days before Greece exits its third and final EU-sponsored bailout programme, the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic and financial affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici is visiting the country \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with a message of hope. Helena Smith reports from Athens: The French have done more to back Greece than any other euro zone member in the nine years since the country almost crashed on the rocks of bankruptcy and as one of Paris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 most prominent politicians, Pierre Moscovici is an embodiment of that support. On a flying one-day visit Tuesday, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics chief insisted there were no ifs and buts to Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ordeal finally being over. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The time has come for Greece to be a normal country,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Moscovici emphasising that oversight of the nation once it exited its last economic adjustment program would not amount to a fourth bailout. He told the Greek parliament: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no more program for Greece. There won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be any more programs for Greece.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meeting the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of state earlier, Moscovici said the agreement euro zone countries had reached last month to reduce the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staggering debt load had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153opened a new road with new conditions and prospects\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Greece. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I know well that the story that we all experienced had tragic aspects and was dangerous for the euro zone and very, very difficult for the Greeks,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said referring to the depression the country had suffered as it applied tough austerity and structural reforms in exchange for rescue funds. Moscovici added he would never forget the pensioners who had had their pensions slashed, workers who had lost jobs, and families who had seen their children leave for wealthier climes. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, who also met Moscovici, praised his supra-nationalism saying he and his team had worked for the good of Europe even if along the way \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we had very big disagreements.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greece exits its third bailout programme on August 20. Another early start for the US president...and a chance to bang the drum for trade reform. I suspect \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmost countries\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 would also rather the president tackled the issue in a more multilateral way, rather than using \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnational security threats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to justify new tariffs on nations that saw themselves as US allies.... Good news from Ireland: the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate has hit a 10-year low. Irish unemployment fell to just 5.1% in June, the central statistics office reports. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been this low since October 2007, just after the credit crunch struck. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate has been falling steadily since its bailout ended in 2013, and is someway below the eurozone average of over 8%. World stock markets are staging a recovery from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slides, after China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank tried to calm the panic. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 32 points or 0.44% to 7580 (it would be more, but for Glencore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump). The other European markets are also up, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX leading the way after Angela Merkel resolved the migration dispute that was threatening to rip her coalition apart. Investors have been cheered by the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to protect the yuan at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reasonable, equilibrium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd level, after it hit an 11-month low toda. Although we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not got details, that feels like a promise not to allow the yuan to plunge alarmingly. Even so, trade war fears still dominate the markets - with America and China set to impose retaliatory tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of exports later this week. Mihir Kapadia, founder of Sun Global Investments, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the end of the Asian trading day, markets in China are in a more nervous state than last week as investors fear the dispute between the United States and other nations will have a significant and serious impact on global growth. The Chinese yuan fell to an 11 month low, unsettling investors and causing the Chinese central bank to pledge to keep the currency stable. Despite similar tensions over tariffs on EU goods, European markets saw some relief on the back of a migration deal that appears to have helped to stabilise Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition government and has allayed fears of German political uncertainty at least for the time being. With President Trump setting an implementation deadline for the extra US$ 200bn of tariffs against China for this Friday, the markets reflect the anxiety and concern of many investors and stockholders with multi-billion dollar tariffs due to hit the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second biggest economy. With the dispute continuing to escalate, it is likely that global markets will feel the force of the tariffs set to be imposed by both nations, with Chinese companies likely to be hit the hardest.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little early, but we should raise a glass to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gin industry, which has enjoyed a bumper year. Sales of UK-produced gin jumped by 32.5% in 2017 to \u00c2\u00a3461m, the Office for National Statistics reports. That follows a spate of new distillery openings across the country, the rise of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccraft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or artisan gins, and even special gin festivals. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food producers were the largest division of UK manufacturing, creating \u00c2\u00a370bn of products sold at home and around the world. Petrol cars were the biggest single product category last year, with sales over \u00c2\u00a320bn. Aircraft parts and diesel cars were also very significant . Beer also shone last year, breaking back into the list of top 10 products. More here. Hold on. Max Jones, global Corporates relationship director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, argues that Brexit is hurting the UK building sector. He points out that large construction projects are being held back, despite the rise in activity last month: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The industry has regained some confidence after the lows of earlier this year. The bounce-back in Q2 appears to confirm that much of the weakness in the first quarter was the result of shutdowns in the wake of the Beast from the East rather than anything more structural. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the sector is hardly motoring, with some large contractors blaming Brexit uncertainty for the delay or cancellation of projects. The London market also looks significantly exposed to any reduction in EU labour. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nevertheless, the announcement of approval for a new runway at Heathrow has boosted sentiment in the sector, if not yet order books and revenue. But with Heathrow, Hinkley Point and HS2 all now given the green light, the focus shifts to the next mega-project that will offer firms comfort and visibility over their long-term pipelines.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector appears to be shrugging off economic anxiety (despite the looming shadow of Brexit), says Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the fastest rise in new orders since May 2017, it appears the brakes are off for the construction sector. Despite being hampered by economic uncertainty, firms reported an improved pipeline of work as clients committed to projects and hesitancy was swept away. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Input prices were a challenge with the biggest inflationary rise since September 2017, so the pressure was on to build up stocks of materials rising in price and becoming more scarce. This resulted in a heavy impact on suppliers unable to keep pace as deliveries became laboured and purchasing managers were at their busiest for two and a half years. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing sector has strengthened, thanks to a pick-up in house-building. Data firm Markit reports that construction activity accelerated last month, at the fastest pace since November 2017. New orders jumped, prompting companies to splash out on new materials - driving prices up. This all propelled Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI (which measures activity) up to 53.1 in June, from 52.5 in May, beating expectations. Encouragingly, optimism in the construction sector picked up in June, from May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seven-month low. Tim Moore, associate director at IHS Markit, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders are getting back to work after the winter slowdown. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest increase in UK construction output marks three months of sustained recovery from the snow-related disruption seen back in March. A solid contribution from house building helped to drive up overall construction activity in June, while a lack of new work to replace completed civil engineering projects continued to hold back growth. I\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdll pull together some reaction now. The DoJ subpoena means problems are mounting up for Glencore. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Thomas Biesheuvel explains: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a tumultuous year for Glencore, mostly due to challenges linked to its business in the Congo, where it operates giant copper and cobalt mines. The Swiss company trader and miner is already facing the possibility of a bribery investigation by U.K. prosecutors over its work with Dan Gertler, an Israeli billionaire and close friend of Congo President Joseph Kabila, people familiar with the situation said in May. Last November, the Paradise Papers expose showed Glencore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s links to Israeli mining billionaire Dan Gertler in Africa, including in the DRC. Wow. Around \u00c2\u00a35bn has been wiped off Glencore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Newsflash: The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest commodity trading firm is caught up in a US investigation. Glencore told the City that it has received a subpoena from the US Department of Justice, asking for documents covering its activities in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela. The investigation relates to US laws covering money-laundering and bribery of foreign officials. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the statement: Glencore Ltd, a subsidiary of Glencore plc, has received a subpoena dated 2 July, 2018 from the US Department of Justice to produce documents and other records with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and United States money laundering statutes. The requested documents relate to the Glencore Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela from 2007 to present. Glencore is reviewing the subpoena and will provide further information in due course as appropriate. Glencore shares have tumbled by 9% as City traders digest the news, hitting their lowest level in almost a year: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker has blamed America for the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness. In a statement, Yi Gang, governor of the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China (PBOC), says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recently, there have been some fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. We are paying close attention to this, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is mainly due to factors such as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and external uncertainties.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yi does have a point - emerging market currencies are all suffering from the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revival. The Vietnamese dong has also been under pressure, hitting an all-time low against the dollar today. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China has launched an attempt to reassure Chinese investors and prevent the yuan falling further. In a statement released a few minutes ago, PBOC says it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153closely watching\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd moves in the foreign exchange markets. Importantly, the Bank is also pledging to keep the yuan \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reasonable, equilibrium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd level. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also promising to maintain prudent and neutral monetary policy. This \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcverbal operation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 seems to be having an effect - the yuan is dragging itself back off the mat, recovering some (but not all!) of its losses today. ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s China economist Iris Pang also blames Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs for causing the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s depreciation is market-driven, reflecting the risks of a trade war. This implies that the central bank is allowing market forces to dictate the speed of the depreciation when there is room to do so.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chinese banks scrambled to prop up the yuan after it fell through the 6.7 level against the US dollar this morning. Bloomberg explains: Chinese banks were seen selling dollars after the yuan weakened past a key level, stoking speculation that authorities were seeking to slow the losses. The yuan was 0.5% lower at 6.6981 per dollar at 11:31 a.m. in Shanghai after earlier falling to 6.7204. Some Chinese major banks sold the dollar in the swaps market, according to four traders. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no escape from trade war fears today. Asian stock markets have fallen to their lowest levels since last autumn, after Donald Trump refused to cave into international pressure over his tariffs. A volatile day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading saw China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite index shed another 1.9% to a 28-month low, before rebounding in a late rally. The Chinese yuan also had a bad day, sliding against the dollar to its weakest level in almost a year. Both the onshore and offshore yuan have fallen through the 6.7 per dollar level for the first time since August 2017. The selloff suggests that Asian investors have been badly shaken by the looming tit-for-tat tariffs between China and America. US tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese products are due to kick in on July 6, with China set to retaliate with duties of its own on the same value of American goods. A trade was could hurt China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy badly, at a time when Beijing is trying to tackle its shadow banking sector and continue the evolution from a manufacturing-driven economy to a services-led one. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, says the sharp depreciation in the Chinese currency is worrying investors. He reminds us that a similar slump three years ago spooked the global markets: In August 2015, USD-CNY appreciated from 6.21 to 6.44, a two-day gain of 3.85%. As a result, global stock markets sold off sharply as investors feared the beginning of a currency war. With trade tensions increasing day by day, Beijing might be playing this game as a tool in its trade war with the U.S. However, such a strategy will be a double-edged sword as it might also lead to a flight of capital which the PBoC is well aware of. Although the Chinese currency depreciated 3.23% in June, it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound quite so alarming, given that the Dollar appreciated against most major currencies in May and June. Going forward it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be about the pace and magnitude of the currency moves that will drive equity markets. CNYUSD traded at 6.70 at the time of writing and will keep a close eye on 6.96, the lowest level reached in January 2017. The White House is pressing on with its plans to penalise trading partners unless they give America a better deal. Yesterday, president Trump insisted that the World Trade Organisation must reform, after \u00e2\u20ac\u0153treating us very badly for many, many years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Also coming up today: A new healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders is published this morning. The construction PMI is expected to show another month of slow growth, as the collapse of Carillion in January continues to ripple through the sector European stock markets are expected to rise, after Angela Merkel reached a deal on migration with interior minister, Horst Seehofer that should prevent her coalition from collapsing. We also get new eurozone retail sales and US manufacturing orders data, which will show whether trade war fears are having an impact.

Hewson adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The decision by the US to raise tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium may well protect US jobs in this particular area but it will also raise costs in the areas of the US economy that use these metals, like auto, construction and manufacturing.</p> <p>This will likely mean higher prices and higher inflation which in turn will hit the US consumer which at the moment, despite a tight labour market is only seeing modest wage growth. This would suggest that in seeking to protect US industry from cheap imports domestic prices could well rise causing US businesses to shed staff to cope with higher costs.

The stronger-than-expected reading, which points to GDP growth of 0.4% between April and June, coupled with a pickup in inflationary pressures has cemented the view among City economists that the Bank of England will hike interest rates next month.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Markit/CIPS PMI saw the business activity reading climb to 55.1 in June, taking it back in line with the average reported since the series began in 1996. The employment component moved sideways at close to average levels, while business expectations were little changed, sitting toward the bottom end of the range seen since the Brexit referendum in 2016.</p> <p>Taken as a whole, the business survey data for June lend more weight to the idea that the weakness in growth reported for 1Q was temporary: our version of the composite PMI has recovered to sit slightly above its average, having been a couple of points below it in March. Indeed, the weakness in the reported IP data through to April is looking increasingly like an outlier in the data. We continue to look for the MPC to raise rates in August, and see the dataflow and recent MPC commentary as raising confidence in that view.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b3ca713e4b061883625a8d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-04T11:00:45.632Z\">12.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the statement in full from Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance ministry, courtesy of Reuters.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Chinese government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position has been stated many times.

Copper has fallen to a new nine-month low ahead of the implementation of trade tariffs by China and the US on Friday, which could hit demand for the industrial metal. Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange slipped 0.6% to $6,450 per tonne, the lowest since September 2017. Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke said: Trump is not fostering global trade. There is scrutiny about the export side of the market in terms of copper-containing household goods or electronics being shipped out of China and we believe that will stay with us at least until US mid-term elections in November. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s return to trade wars. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trade wars are good and easy to win\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, so says Trump who last weekend railed against the EU for being as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bad as China\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on trade practices, writes Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. The rhetoric over global trade has been ramped up in recent weeks. Hewson adds: The decision by the US to raise tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium may well protect US jobs in this particular area but it will also raise costs in the areas of the US economy that use these metals, like auto, construction and manufacturing. This will likely mean higher prices and higher inflation which in turn will hit the US consumer which at the moment, despite a tight labour market is only seeing modest wage growth. This would suggest that in seeking to protect US industry from cheap imports domestic prices could well rise causing US businesses to shed staff to cope with higher costs. In 2002 the Bush administration adopted similar measures on steel however they were abandoned after 18 months as a raft of US companies in related industries went bust as costs increased. While the US does have a point about Chinese steel dumping the scattergun effect of his trade sanctions will also serve to penalise the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historical partners and allies, with Canada being hit the hardest. Hewson (and others) believe that trade wars are bad and usually hurt the very people they are designed to protect. The EU has retaliated with a modest range of tariffs on US imports, to the tune of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.8bn, on goods like motor cycles, whisky and orange juice. Canada has also followed suit, and China will weigh in later this week, with the risk that the US will respond further as it targets the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge automotive sector, the US being its second biggest export market. This raises the prospect of making a bad situation worse with consumers likely to bear the brunt, and while one can sympathise with the fact that the US is behaving irrationally, surely the best way to deal with the US is to play the game a different way. Tit for tat responses rarely end well, with the reactions to Smoot Hawley in the 1930\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being used as a historical precedent, as rising costs impacted on domestic consumers. Furthermore, there are significant anomalies on how the EU levies tariffs on US imports, which suggests that President Trump has a point about some of the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade policy. Rather than dealing with the US by way of counter punch the EU would best serve its consumers by way of engaging with the Trump administration in a more constructive fashion, holding back from kneejerk retaliation and displaying a willingness to negotiate in the expectation that we could see a ratcheting down of some of the recent trade tension that is currently spooking investors. This approach worked in 2002 when the Bush administration was forced to abandon its steel tariffs after 18 months under pressure from US businesses who were adversely affected by the increases in costs. Earlier today, it emerged that a former Rio Tinto executive has been released from a Shanghai prison, after serving eight years in jail following a 2010 conviction for corruption and stealing commercial secrets. Hu, an Australian citizen and the former head of the mining company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s China iron ore business, was originally sentenced to 10 years in jail as tension flared between China, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top user of iron ore, and its biggest supplier, Australia. Fired by Rio in the aftermath, Hu is expected to return to Australia. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, told a daily news briefing in Beijing that Hu had been released on Wednesday. Lu said that Hu had had his sentence reduced in accordance with the law, without saying where Hu currently was nor when he might return to Australia. Here is the full story: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another comment on the UK services data released this morning, from Malcolm Barr at JPMorgan. The stronger-than-expected reading, which points to GDP growth of 0.4% between April and June, coupled with a pickup in inflationary pressures has cemented the view among City economists that the Bank of England will hike interest rates next month. The Markit/CIPS PMI saw the business activity reading climb to 55.1 in June, taking it back in line with the average reported since the series began in 1996. The employment component moved sideways at close to average levels, while business expectations were little changed, sitting toward the bottom end of the range seen since the Brexit referendum in 2016. Taken as a whole, the business survey data for June lend more weight to the idea that the weakness in growth reported for 1Q was temporary: our version of the composite PMI has recovered to sit slightly above its average, having been a couple of points below it in March. Indeed, the weakness in the reported IP data through to April is looking increasingly like an outlier in the data. We continue to look for the MPC to raise rates in August, and see the dataflow and recent MPC commentary as raising confidence in that view. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the statement in full from Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance ministry, courtesy of Reuters. The Chinese government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position has been stated many times. We absolutely will not fire the first shot, and will not implement tariff measures ahead of the United States doing so. Earlier, we thought that the Chinese tariffs on $34bn of US goods ranging from soybean to stainless steel pipes would kick in before the similarly-sized tariffs from Washington, after an unnamed source told Reuters that Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs would take effect at the start of the day on 6 July, and other similar media reports. Due to the 12-hour time difference, this would have put the implementation ahead of Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The ministry then issued the brief statement above. Earlier, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China was ready to act, although he gave no details on the timing of tariffs. China has already made preparations. As long as the United States issues a so-called tariff list, China will take necessary measures to firmly protect its legitimate interests. China has denied that it will fire the first shot in an escalating trade dispute with the US. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance ministry said in a statement it would not implement its tariffs on US goods before Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on Chinese imports take effect, according to Reuters. Both sides have threatened 25% tariffs, on a combined $68bn of goods, which are due to kick in on 6 July (Friday). We are awaiting further details... Here our story on the UK outlook: A stronger-than-expected UK services reading, which suggests an improved growth outlook for Britain, has helped the pound this morning. Sterling is extending gains against the euro, rising 0.4% to 88.01p. Jennifer McKeown at Capital Economics said about the eurozone numbers: This is a sign that at least some of the weakness in the first quarter was temporary and at least suggests we are not embarking on the start of a sharp slowdown. There has been some stabilisation in the surveys if nothing else. That will reassure the ECB that a gradual normalisation of policy is warranted. Here is our full story about the impending trade war between Beijing and Washington. Over in the eurozone, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a similar story. Business activity picked up in June, according to the latest PMI reports, making it easier for the European Central Bank to tighten policy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although it should be noted that confidence among companies declined to its lowest level since late 2016. The ECB has already set out plans to end its bond buying programme by the end of the year, dismantling the economic stimulus a decade after the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic downturn started. However, interest rates are likely to stay on hold for quite some time, and ECB president Mario Draghi might leave office in October 2019 without having raised rates once during his eight-year term. IHS Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final composite purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index for the eurozone \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which combines data from manufacturing, construction and services and is seen as a good indicator of economic growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rose to 54.9 in June from 54.1 in May, comfortably above the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction. IHS Markit said this signalled second-quarter GDP of 0.5% in the eurozone (which compares with an estimated 0.4% for the UK). Services firms have not been hit as hard as manufacturers by the increasingly bitter trade dispute between the EU and the US. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on European steel and aluminium are driving up costs for US manufacturers and exacerbating a slowdown for eurozone factories, IHS Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing survey showed on Monday. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI reports suggest that UK companies grew rather faster in June than in March, when snow was dragging the economy back. Jacob Nell of Morgan Stanley says they are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consistent with a robust rebound\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the second quarter of 2018: ING economist James Smith also spies a UK interest rate hike on the horizon.... Just like the manufacturing and construction indices, the latest UK services PMI has beaten expectations. At 55.1, it now stands at the highest level since October, and despite the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Brexit, new orders are rising at the fastest rate in over a year too. This, much like the recent data emerging from the retail sector, suggests that the economy is having a better ride in the second quarter than in the first - and for the Bank of England, this will be put a fairly big tick in the August rate hike box The jump in UK service sector growth has helped the pound to shake off its early losses. Sterling has crept back over $1.32, having dropped to $1.317 earlier, as traders conclude that an August interest rate hike is now a little more likely. Balraj Sroya, Sales Trader at Foenix Partners, explains: The Services PMI print today concluded a trifecta of phenomenal PMI figures from the UK this month, posting 7-month highs at 55.1. The bullish figures from the Services, Construction and Manufacturing sectors, along with GDP beating estimates last week, prove the UK economy is gaining momentum once again. As a result, the likelihood of the Bank of England raising rates this summer has strengthened, with chances currently sitting over 60% in favour of a hike. The pick-up in growth does have a downside. Companies are struggling to find skilled staff to help them tackle their new orders. Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Exceeding expectations the sector ended on a positive note at the end of the second quarter, buoyed up by the fastest rise in new orders in over a year and the strongest overall performance since last October. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However the downside of this achievement came in the form of relentless capacity difficulties as business backlogs rose to an acute degree, not seen for around three years. Not even the minor uplift in hiring could alleviate the problem as salary pressures and the struggle to find skilled hires caused firms to hesitate to increase staff numbers further. Add increased costs for fuel, and the picture emerges of a sector experiencing the sharpest cost inflation since September last year, as well as the confidence to pass on these additional costs to their clients to maintain their margins. This is actually good news for workers, though, with some companies reporting that staff salaries have risen as they try to attract and retain employees. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast-beating services data shows that Britain has recovered from the winter slowdown - when the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBeast from the East\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forced school and shops to close. Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, comments: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These are the best sentiment numbers for the UK services industry since October and highlight that the sector is continuing to bounce back from the weather affected Q1 that saw shops shuttered and supply lines cut. Both growth and inflation within the services sector and the wider economy are set to have risen in Q2 with the PMIs for the period hinting at a GDP number of 0.4-0.5% with inflation higher on both higher fuel and wage costs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pick-up in growth last month will encourage the Bank of England to raise interest rates in August, suggests Capital Economics: Boom! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominant service sector has picked up pace, suggesting that UK economic growth has accelerated in the last quarter. Service sector firms enjoyed the strongest rise in activity since last October, data firm Markit reports, thanks to a rise in new orders. Companies reported a pick-up in demand, particularly from particularly for business and financial services. Some companies also got a boost from the warm weather, as consumers hit the shops. This has propelled Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector PMI up to 55.1 in June, from 54 in May. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a stronger result than expected. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surveys indicate that UK GDP rose by around 0.4% in the last three months - twice as fast as in January-March. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stronger growth of service sector activity adds to signs that the economy rebounded in the second quarter and opens the door for an August rate hike, especially when viewed alongside the news that inflationary pressures spiked higher. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The survey data indicate that the economy likely grew by 0.4% in the second quarter, up from 0.2% in the opening quarter of 2018. The sharp rise in business costs, linked to surging oil prices and the need to offer higher wages, suggests inflation will also pick up again from its current rate of 2.4%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It remains encouraging yet also surprising that current business activity continues to show such resilience amid relatively moribund confidence regarding the year ahead outlook. The survey once again highlights how the business outlook remains clouded by widespread concerns about the impact of Brexit uncertainty in particular. Just in: Eurozone service sector growth picked up last month, suggesting Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is recovering after a weak start to 2018. Data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone services PMI has risen to 55.2, up from May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 53.8. This makes up for a slowdown at Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories, where growth slowed last month. Markit says: The eurozone economy regained some traction at the end of the second quarter. Rates of expansion in output and new business accelerated, although failed to fully recover the momentum lost earlier in the year. The main impetus was provided by the services economy, which saw growth accelerate to a four-month high, offsetting a further waning in the pace of increase in manufacturing production. However, business optimism at eurozone service companies has dropped to a 19-month low. Markit cites \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rising trade worries and political uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as likely causes. Beijing policymakers will be relieved to hear that growth in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector rose last month, despite trade war jitters. The monthly Chinese service sector PMI rose to 53, the highest in four months, showing accelerating growth. Service companies reported a pick-up in new orders, encouraging them to take on more staff. However, the picture is less rosy at China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing companies, where new orders fell last month. Trade war worries are hit metal prices today. Copper has dropped to a nine-month low (at $6,423 per tonne) while zinc touched its lowest level in a year. That reflects concerns that economic demand will be hurt by the looming US-China tariffs. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has dropped again today, as traders fret about the escalating trade dispute with America. The benchmark Shanghai Composite index fell 1% to finish the day at 2,760 points, its lowest closing point since March 2016. With US and China both finalising tariffs on each others goods, further jitteriness is likely. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors should expect volatility to continue. Uncertainty over interest rates, protectionism, and China are key risk factors. We recommend investors stay invested, but consider five actions: looking to alternatives, hedging equity exposure, improving credit quality, diversifying sector and country risks, and taking a longer-term view.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The trade dispute between the US and China is heating up. Beiijng is preparing to impose 25% tariffs on over $30bn of American imports, including agricultural products and manufacturing items, in response to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own tariffs on Chinese imports which kick in on Friday. And it appears that China will actually get its retaliation first - officials are preparing to implement the tariffs from midnight on July 6, or noon Washington time tomorrow (5pm UK time). Reuters has the details: Chinese tariffs on $34bn of U.S. goods will take effect from midnight July 6 Beijing time, a person with knowledge of the plan told Reuters, amid worsening trade tensions between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. Washington has said it would implement tariffs on $34bn of Chinese imports on July 6, and Beijing has vowed to retaliate on the same day. However, the 12-hour time difference puts Beijing ahead in terms of actually implementing the tariffs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our measures are equal and being equal means that if theU.S. starts on July 6, we start on July 6,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the source told Reuters, who requested anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to media. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The implementation time for all policies starts at midnight.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Economists had hoped that Washington and Beijing might step away from actually imposing the tariffs they had threatened each other with. But neither side has backed down, despite the real risk that the measures will hurt growth and cost jobs. The prospect of a trade war may cast a shadow over the US today, as it celebrates Independence Day. Wall Street will be closed, so it could be a quieter day generally in the markets. European stocks are expected to dip. Also coming up today We get a healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector, as data firm Markit publishes its last monthly surveys of purchasing managers. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services PMI is expected to be unchanged at 54, showing steady growth. Anything higher would be a boost for the British economy, as Westminster wrestles with Brexit negotiations. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Even if service sector activity is stronger than forecast, it may fail to capture investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attention for any significant amount of time. Brexit will be firmly back on the agenda, with the Prime Minister due to hold talks at the Chequers residence this weekend, in the hope of finding a solution to the customs partnership with the EU post Brexit. Theresa May has made a series of pleas to her bickering party to sort out their differences and to the EU, not to decline the third proposal.

                "bodyText":"Nearly 600 more retail jobs are to go in the UK as the Jacques Vert, Windsmoor and Precis department store brands are wound down by administrators. Administrators said they had failed to find a buyer for Calvetron Brands, which had been restructured following a rescue deal last summer. The business entered administration in May and had already shed more than 400 jobs before Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement. The latest retail job losses come as more than 30,000 jobs are at risk in the UK following mass closure announcements by major chains including House of Fraser, New Look and Marks &amp; Spencer. Retailers are suffering from rising costs and the switch to online shopping just as hard-pressed consumers rein in spending. A report out this week predicts nearly 70,000 high street jobs will disappear this year unless action is taken to reinvigorate town centres and revamp business rates. Calvetron, which sold clothing from 300 outlets in department stores such as Debenhams, House of Fraser, and M&amp;Co, called in administrators from Duff &amp; Phelps after struggling to cope with high costs and falling sales. Administrators had continued to trade while they sought a buyer but on Wednesday said no viable offers had been received. The closures mark the final demise of a business founded in 1972 by Jack Cynamon and Alan Green, tailors from the East End of London. In 1977 they used their names, with a French twist, to create the Jacques Vert clothing brand. The group, which was once listed on the London Stock Exchange, has been through numerous iterations.

                "bodyText":"That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a brisk summary UK car sales fell last month, as the diesel crisis continued to hurt the sector. Sales were down 3.3% compared to a year earlier, with diesel registrations tumbling by 28%. Economists blamed uncertainty over diesel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future, after the emissions-rigging scandal. Subdued consumer confidence may be another factor. A string of MPs have urged the government not to risk a hard Brexit, after Jaguar Land Rover became the latest company to sound the alarm. JLR warned that \u00c2\u00a380bn of potential investment was at risk, if it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect frictionless trade wit the EU. There were other signs that Brexit is having a damaging impact, as the cabinet prepares for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crucial meeting on a customs deal. Some Brexit supporters are already unhappy with Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest proposal. German business bosses said they were reluctant to invest in Britain, and investment bank JP Morgan began moving some staff overseas. The Bank of England governor has warned that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protectionist trade policies are already hurting the global economy. Mark Carney was more upbeat about the UK economy, though, sounding confident that the slowdown earlier this year was being reversed. Goodnight! A late newsflash from America. US central bankers are concerned that a trade war could derail the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong growth. The minutes of the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest meeting, just released, show that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most (policymakers) noted that uncertainty and risks associated with trade policy had intensified and were concerned that such uncertainty and risks eventually could have negative effects.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But otherwise, the Fed believes that recent economic data shows that the US recovery remains robust. It was business as usual for Jaguar Land Rover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tens of thousands of workers today, despite worries about the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future under a hard Brexit. One worker at JLR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plant in Solihull feared trouble ahead, telling the Guardian: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a matter of time before something bad happens, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it? We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep on being so lucky,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Another, though, argued that JLR had invested too much in the site to simply walk away. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They have put billions into this and we hear all the time they are planning future investments on this site. More here: The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of EU negotiations, Nicole Sykes, explains why UK firms are now going public with their Brexit concerns: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our Q&amp;A about the risks of a hard Brexit to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have closed higher tonight, despite the ongoing Brexit tensions. The rally seems to be spurred by suggestions that America might row back on plans for new tariffs on European car imports, if the EU lowered its own tariffs. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Equity markets are in positive territory as it was reported that the US might not impose a 20% tariff on EU cars. This was met with a positive reaction, and it was reported that Angela Merkel might give her support to lower the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariff on US cars. Traders welcomed the news as it suggests the trade talks are moving in the right direction. This has sent shares in European carmakers higher, with Volkswagen up 4.2%, Daimler gaining 3.8% and BMW up 3.6%. That propelled the German DAX index up by over 1% Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 gained 30 points, or 0.4%, to 7,603. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all kicking off at Westminster, as the paperwork for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s showdown cabinet meeting leaks. According to The Spectator, the paperwork explains that Britain would commit to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ongoing harmonisation with EU rules on goods\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Such a move might address the concerns voiced by carmakers over tariff and non-tariff barriers. But (the magazine claims), this could make it harder for Britain to strike a new trade deal with America. Political editor James Forsyth says: Brexiteers are taking this as Theresa May effectively ruling out a post-Brexit trade deal with the US just days before the US President arrives in this country. However, Downing Street are now denying this interpretation, saying Britain is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd still seeking a bilateral trade deal with the US after Brexit. But getting a deal that suits America could be harder, if Britain is committed to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agricultural standards, for example (the chlorinated chicken problem....) Our Politics Live blog has all the details: Away from the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit problems.... we have some solid economic data from America. US service sector companies have posted their strongest growth in four months, thanks to a pick-up in sales and new orders. That matches yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solid UK service sector data - which also showed growth at a four-month high. Some of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful businesses have warned that Brexit uncertainty is putting them off investing in the UK. Our colleague Lisa O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Carroll reports: Germany Industry UK, which represents 100 companies, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Lufthansa, the train and bus operator Arriva and the steel producer ThyssenKrupp, said it needed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certainty and clarity about the way forward sooner rather than later\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Bernd Atenstaedt, the chairman and chief executive of GIUK, said it was frustrating for his member businesses because they still did not know what a post-Brexit Britain would look like two years after the referendum. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is some reluctance from German business to invest in the UK with projects on hold because of the uncertainty about the future and with only nine months left before the UK leaves the EU, time is running out,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. JP Morgan isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waiting to the British cabinet to agree what kind of Brexit it wants. According to Reuters, the investment bank has begun the process of moving staff from the City to continental Europe. A small first wave of employees will lead the way in the coming months. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the story: JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has asked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153several dozen\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd employees to lead a first wave of relocations from the UK to continental Europe by early next year, as it pushes the button on plans to protect its business post-Brexit, according to a memo sent to staff on Thursday and seen by Reuters. The memo, the first Brexit-related mass communication to JPMorgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 16,000-strong UK workforce this year, highlights the organisational and strategic challenges facing global banks as they prepare for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union. It comes a day before Prime Minister Theresa May is due to host crunch talks with ministers at her country residence Chequers on how she wants to shape Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trading relationship with the soon-to-be 27-member club. Signed by Daniel Pinto, chief executive of JPMorgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Corporate &amp; Investment Bank and Mary Erdoes, chief executive of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Asset &amp; Wealth Management division, the email also outlined JPMorgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to beef up its presence in several other EU cities including Paris, Madrid and Milan. Last year JP Morgan also bought an office block in Dublin, which could help it reshape its operations after Brexit. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman insists the PM is listerning to British businesses about Brexit. He told reporters in Westminster: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The PM has been very clear that we take the views of business seriously and we also know the importance of providing certainty as we leave the EU,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the spokesman told reporters. We are looking forward to providing further details in the white paper.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That white paper will outline the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred customs arrangement with the EU. It should be published after tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crunch cabinet meeting at the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s country residence, Chequers. May isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t short of views from British businesses either. Jaguar Land Rover is only the latest in a string of firms to go public with their concerns. Other anxious groups include: Airbus, which is threatening to move aircraft wing production out of Britain BMW, which says it could close UK plants if it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t import components from the EU quickly and reliably after Brexit The Professional and Business Services Council, which warned the PM that lawyers, accountants, surveyors et al need mutual recognition of qualifications, regulations and legal judgements The British Chambers of Commerce, which pointed out that virtually no progress has been made on the issues worrying businesses Former business minister and Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable has weighed in on Jaguar Land Rover. He says JLR isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t messing about and urges the Conservatives to treat business with more respect. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When I was in government I worked very closely with Jaguar Land Rover. It took some considerable effort to get JLR committed to the UK. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I got to know Ralf Speth well enough to know that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not bluffing when he says JLR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position is a hard Brexit would make the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position in the UK untenable. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Conservatives should listen. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no evidence that they are willing to treat major employers with anything other than complete contempt.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jim Pickard of the FT has heard that Speth is feeling more and more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153distressed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the impact Brexit will have on his company. Ouch. Labour MP Alison McGovern has roasted Owen Paterson for his claim that a hard Brexit would be good for JLR. McGovern points out that tariffs aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only worry. Non-tariff barriers (such as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrules of origin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 restrictions, or time-consuming border checks) could hit sales and gum up supply chains. McGovern says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is quite stunning that Owen Paterson thinks himself better placed to comment on Jaguar Land Rover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future than their own CEO. Perhaps even more striking is his obvious total ignorance of the just-in-time supply chains which make the car industry profitable, and the fact that it is not tariffs, but non-tariff barriers which would be the major obstacle to manufacturers in a no-deal Brexit. People in manufacturing towns across Merseyside, the North and the Midlands know all too well what it feels like when Tories show they just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about our communities and our families\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 livelihoods, and they will not stand for it. To protect jobs in the manufacturing industry, the only feasible solution is to stay in the Single Market and the Customs Union.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd McGovern\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wirral South constituency includes the Vauxhall car plant at Ellesmere Port, and is also close to JLR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Halewood plant. Labour MP Jack Dromey fears that jobs could be lost at Jaguar Land Rover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Castle Bromwich plant, in his Birmingham Erdington constituency. Dromey says there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153profound and growing concern\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the impact of Brexit on Erdington, and the wider UK economy. He points out that manufacturers rely on seamless movement of parts to and from Europe, which would be threatened by non-tariff barriers in a hard Brexit. The nature of the automotive industry and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjust in time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 arrangements mean that without frictionless trade with our closest trading partners, businesses cannot function and trade properly. Thousands of lorries go backwards and forwards every week to and from the continent. Dromey adds that JLR adds billions of value to the UK economy each year, and is a vital employer. We cannot allow the will of the hard-right Brexiteers to drive the UK down a deeply damaging road which would be disastrous for British business and British workers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In one of the poorest constituencies in the country, the Jaguar plant has transformed the lives of thousands of workers. It would be tragic to see those opportunities snatched away from the thousands still out of work.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stephen Phipson, chief executive of EEF, the manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation, is urging ministers to heed JLR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns about a hard Brexit. Phipson points out that jobs are also at risk at the many small companies who supply parts to the company. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This clearly underlines the reality being faced by the manufacturing sector. This is not just an issue for big companies, however, but those SMEs who are also heavily exposed in the major supply chains and, as yet, are unable to know what scenario they are planning for. Time is now running out to secure the frictionless and tariff free relationship we need with the EU if there are not to be serious consequences right across UK industry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Labour MP Maria Eagle fears that Jaguar Land Rover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Halewood car plant, in her Garston and Halewood constituency, is at risk from a hard Brexit. Eagle says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Such a move would mean the end of JLR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Halewood plant, the end of car manufacturing in South Liverpool and the needless destruction of thousands of the best private sector jobs in Liverpool.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am shocked but not surprised at this stark yet realistic warning from JLR chief executive Prof Ralph Speth about the appalling effects of the extreme Tory hard Brexit supported by half the Cabinet &amp; a hardline cabal of Brexit extremists\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nissan, which employs around 7,000 people at its Sunderland car plant, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nissan continues to work with the UK government to ensure the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term success and investment in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Getting back to Jaguar Land Rover.... and Owen Paterson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that Brexit is a super opportunity for carmakers is getting short shrift: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official: An England World Cup win would be good for the economy, according to the Bank of England governor. Thanks to dapper manager Gareth Southgate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success, retailers are already enjoying a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwaistcoat bounce\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This chart from Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech shows just how damaging the Bank believes a trade war could be: Mark Carney appears to be getting into the World Cup spirit: Mark Carney has also used his speech in Newcastle to warn on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade tariffs. Richard Partington reports: Donald Trump has received yet another warning over the threat to the global economy from his mounting trade disputes around the world - this time from the governor of the Bank of England. Speaking in Newcastle, Mark Carney said the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing use of trade tariffs were already having an effect on the world economy by causing a slowdown in exports and for manufacturing. But he warned the situation could get much worse. Should the US raise import tariffs by a further 10% on all of its trading partners, that could knock as much as 2.5% off American growth and 1% off global output. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a conservative estimate, because this would be through the direct impact on trade channels alone. Things could get worse still should companies put investments on hold amid the political turmoil. It could also lead to higher borrowing costs, he says. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is speaking in Newcastle, where he says he is more confident now that the slowdown in the UK economy in the first quarter - when growth was just 0.2% - was temporary because of the disruption caused by bad weather. Investors reaction immediately, reading the comments as the latest signal from the Bank that interest rates will rise in August. The pound is currently up 0.1% at $1.3247, having hit an intraday day high of $1.3262. Speaking at the Northern Powerhouse Business Summit, he said: Domestically, the incoming data have given me greater confidence that the softness of UK activity in the first quarter was largely due to the weather, not the economic climate. Rebecca Long Bailey, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow business secretary, said Jaguar Land Rover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit warning should be ringing alarm bells for Theresa May. This stark warning from one of the jewels in the crown of British automotive manufacturing should be a klaxon call to Theresa May and her cabinet. They cannot continue to spar with each other and play ideological games whilst British jobs and industries are being pushed off the edge of a cliff. Uncertainty is already hurting investment and if the Government cannot provide urgent assurances to business on negotiating a deal that secures frictionless trade with the EU, our biggest export market, 40,000 jobs at Jaguar Land Rover and countless supply chain businesses could be lost in the blink of an eye, devastating our world leading automotive sector along with the communities that support them. Sean Kemple, director of sales at Close Brothers Motor Finance, says consumer nervousness contributed to the drop in UK car sales last month. June saw the SMMT release a harsh warning about the impact of Brexit on both production output and demand to the UK motor industry, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve certainly seen some hesitance from consumers when it comes to big ticket purchases. This is exacerbated by the uncertainty around diesel, which is having a fierce impact on diesel sale figures. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ian Gilmartin, Head of Retail &amp; Wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, on the drop in car sales last month: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A dip in overall new car sales is no surprise considering the plethora of challenges being faced by sellers. The industry has rightly been more vocal in recent weeks, with the lack of clarity around what the playing field will look like for the motor market post-Brexit growing. As we saw with Jaguar Land Rover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning this morning, patience is running out for both manufacturers and retailers, with all parts of the industry hoping to see some material progress to allow them to plan for the future. As today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data shows it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just a trade issue, with wider questions over diesel policy posing another headache for operators as diesel purchases fell by almost a third in June. The sector has to focus on delivering more environmentally efficient vehicles, but diesel cars have a part to play in this and consumers need reassurance that a diesel purchase is still a sensible move.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Conservative MP Owen Paterson thinks Jaguar Land Rover are wrong to worry about a hard Brexit. Paterson, a Brexit supporter, told Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme that JLR would be in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wonderful position\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd once Britain has left the single market and the customs union. Paterson argues that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrong to assume that tariffs would be imposed on goods travelling into the UK from Europe. He points out: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we go to WTO terms, we set our tariffs and we can choose to have no tariffs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added out that JLR was enjoying strong sales in China - why shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that continue after Brexit? I think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a few problems with this view, though. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no guarantee that the EU won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t set tariffs on UK goods crossing the channel, in the event of a hard Brexit. JLR sold almost 2.5 million cars in Europe in the last quarter, compared to almost 475,000 in the UK. New customs checks at the UK-EU border could slow the movement of goods, if the two sides aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t committed to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcregulatory equivalence\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That might ruin the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjust-in-time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 production strategies developed by many large manufacturers to improve productivity and cut down on waste. Wirral West Labour MP Alison McGovern says the government must heed JLR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that a hard Brexit could wipe out its UK profits. She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behind-closed-doors Brexit summit at Chequers, the news that Jaguar Land Rover says a hard Brexit outside the Single Market and the Customs Union would make it impossible for them to remain profitable in the UK should send shockwaves through the political establishment. Newsflash: UK car sales fell by 3.5% in June, as drivers continue to shun diesel motors. Some 234,945 new cars were registered across Britain last month, the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders reports. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 243,454 a year ago, and ends a two-month run of rising sales. In total, UK car sales in 2018 are down 6.3% so far this year, following declines in the first quarter of 2018. Sales of diesel cars slumped by 28%, as the emissions-testing scandal continues to hit demand. Petrol sales rose 12%, while electric vehicles sales jumped 45% (but at 15,549, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only 6.6% of the market). The SMMT blames the slump in diesel sales on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continuing consumer uncertainty over future policy towards this technology\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Some cities are already moving towards \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclean air\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 zones in which more polluting vehicles are banned. The West Midlands and Liverpool could be badly hit if Jaguar Land Rover cuts investment in the UK or moves production overseas because of Brexit. The company runs several manufacturing plants in Britain - which have benefitted from billions of pounds in investment since bought JLR a decade ago. Solihull, Birmingham: More than 6,000 people work here, producing Defender, Discovery, Range Rover and Range Rover Sport models. Castle Bromwich, Birmingham: 3,200 staff produce Jaguar models, including the F-TYPE, XJ, XF and XK Gaydon, Coventry: Land Rover design team are based at this engineering site, using virtual-reality technology, wind tunnels, CAD systems and a test tracks to develop new models Halewood, Liverpool: More than 4,00 people work at this 300-acre site, producing the Range Rover Evoque and the Land Rover Discovery Sport. Whitley, Coventry: JLR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global headquarters is based here, along with Jaguar Design and Jaguar Land Rover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate staff. Wolverhampton: Almost 1,400 people work at JLR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Engine Manufacturing Centre, which the company proudly calls \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of the most cutting-edge facilities of its kind in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It produces low-emission 4-cylinder Jaguar Land Rover petrol and diesel engines, and is a key part of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expansion strategy in recent years. Union leaders are urging the government to heed Jaguar Land Rover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning, rather than play \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRussian roulette\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with UK jobs. Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, says Theresa May must heed the concerns being voiced by British business leaders, who fear new trade barriers with Europe. McCluskey says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tens of thousands of decent jobs - the sort we will need more than ever outwith the EU - are being put at risk by a Government that places its survival, indulging narrow, extremist views, above the well-being of the people of this country. This is simply not acceptable. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So I say this to the Tory party, our jobs are not yours to play Russian roulette with. Drop your red lines and secure a decent deal, one that is to the benefit of the working people of this country. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And if you cannot agree to put people before your ideology then move over and let a party that will get on with it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Earlier this week, Unite said it would push for an early general election if it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t satisfied with the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit deal. PB Balaji, chief financial officer at Tata Motors Group, has also weighed in, warning against new trade barriers with Europe. Echoing JLR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement, Balaji declares that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no-one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interests\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to end up with a Brexit which increases bureaucracy and reduces the productivity and competitiveness of the UK Industry. Balaji adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Motors have always maintained that the uncertainties from Brexit are avoidable and the business seeks clarity to ensure that industry takes timely and right decisions to manage the transition. Additionally, Jaguar Land Rover needs free and full access to the single market beyond transition to remain competitive which we also firmly believe is in the best long term interests of the United Kingdom. Shares in Jaguar Land Rover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company have hit a five-year low, after it warned that a hard Brexit could drive it out of the UK. Tata Motors slide by over 4% in early trading in Mumbai, as investors worry about the impact of Brexit on its business. Tata\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have now lost half their value since September 2016, as Brexit stormclouds have gathered. As Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest car maker, Jaguar Land Rover Automotive is a crucial part of Tata Motors. JLR posted reported pre-tax profits of \u00c2\u00a31.5bn in the last financial year - partly due to stronger sales to China and the US. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest carmaker has added its voice to the chorus of businesses warning against a hard Brexit, as negotiations with the EU (and within the cabinet) heat up. Jaguar Land Rover piled fresh pressure on the government by warning that tens of thousands of jobs are at risk, if new trade tariffs with Europe are imposed after Brexit. The news has knocked shares in parent company Tata Motors, and sent another shiver through Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasingly nervous auto industry. CEO Ralf Speth quantified the impact, warning that a bad Brexit deal would wipe out more than \u00c2\u00a31.2bn of profits each year - making new investment simply impractical. Speth declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a result, we would have to drastically adjust our spending profile \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we have spent around \u00c2\u00a350bn in the UK in the past five years, with plans for a further \u00c2\u00a380bn more in the next five. This would be in jeopardy should we be faced with the wrong outcome.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd JLR (like many other businesses) needs free and frictionless trade with the EU and unrestricted access to the single market, Speth explained. The warning is deeply alarming for JLR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 40,000 staff, as the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entire future in Britain could be at risk. As Speth put it (via the FT) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m forced to go out because we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the right deal, then we have to close plants here in the UK and it will be very, very sad. This is hypothetical, and I hope it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an option we never have to go for.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This intervention comes a day before cabinet ministers meet to discuss Brexit. Theresa May is pushing a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthird way\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 customs agreement, where the UK tracking goods as they come into the country, and levying EU import taxes on them only if their final destination is inside the EU. That might address some of businesses\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 concerns, but hard-line Brexiteers might argue it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a clean break with the EU (who might reject the idea anyway). Also coming up today: Bank of England governor Mark Carney is speaking at a major business summit in Newcastle. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be discussing the Northern Powerhouse scheme - City traders will be listening for hints about an August interest rate rise too. June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK car registration data are released this morning too - they may show sales rose for the third month running.

Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our earlier summary of the trade dispute. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report from China: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our write-up of the US jobs report. Our rolling coverage of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama starts here, after the US confirmed that it was imposing $34bn of tariffs on China, triggering criticism in Beijing and a rapid retaliation. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Thanks, and have a good weekend. GW In other trade spat news, Russia has announced new tariffs on US imports - in retaliation to the US steel and aluminium levies which Donald Trump signed off early this year. This will push the cost of certain US imports up by between 25% and 40%. Economic development minister Maxim Oreshkin explained: In particular, some types of road construction equipment, oil and gas equipment, tools for metal processing and rock drilling, as well as fibre optics are covered.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd CNBC have created a very handy list of the Chinese imports subject to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new 25% tariffs: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their article on the trade war. Will Hobbs, head of investment strategy at Barclays Smart Investor, believes president Trump is trying to squeeze concessions out of China, rather than deliberately cause economic harm. With US elections this autumn, the White House doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to upset voters, Hobbs argues: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The drumbeat of a full blown trade war is certainly getting louder, but we still maintain that this is more likely a negotiating strategy on the part of the US administration designed to prise open further a Chinese economy which remains amongst the most protectionist in the world. We are reliant on the presence of US midterm elections in November, as well as a degree of economic self-interest, to act as a restraining force on the US administration. The fact that most of the targeted goods in this latest batch of tariffs go into the supply chains of US multinational manufacturers and originates from companies that aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in fact Chinese gives some sense of how complicated, and messy, it is to prosecute a trade war in the modern era of exploded corporate supply chains. On the US jobs report, Capital Economics says: The 213,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in June, which followed an even stronger 244,000 rise in May, provides further evidence that uncertainty over trade policy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet having a major impact on the economy. It also leaves the Fed firmly on track to raise interest rates twice more by year-end. The Financial Times reports that Chinese social media was gripped by the process of Peak Pegasus, a ship full of American soyabeans, earlier today. Peak Pegasus was in a race against time to reach the port of Dalian before Chinese tariffs took effect. But its efforts were in vain....customs officials had received their orders to implement the new tariffs before it arrived. One of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic advisors has predicted that Donald Trump will succeed in shaking up global trade. Kevin Hassett, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, told Bloomberg that the president will hammer out reciprocal trade deals in the coming months that will reduce trade barriers. Hassett declared: The president wrote The Art of the Deal... I think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to see those deals soon. So far, though, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade moves have pushed up trade barriers. Not only with China too; his 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium have provoked the EU into imposing new levies on US products like motorbikes and orange juice. Americans have been waking up to the news that they are officially in a trade war with China. Ovenight, Washington imposed 25% tariffs on $34bn of Chinese imports - enacting a plan laid out by president Trump earlier this year. The levies mainly affect Chinese technology such as aerospace, IT, and medical kit. The tariffs are part of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s push against what it sees as China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unfair trade practices. But the move has been criticised in China - with the US labelled \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchoodlums\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by local media. Chinese premier Li Keqiang warned it would hurt free trade and multilateral relations. The ministry of commerce warned that America was starting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the biggest trade war in economic history\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Beijing has also delivered on its threat to make US imports pricier. It retaliated with tariffs on a range of products including soybeans, chemicals and some auto vehicles. Economists are concerned that the trade could intensify in the weeks ahead. Donald Trump has added to these concerns, by suggesting overnight that tariffs could eventually be imposed on $500bn of Chinese imports unless the country changed its ways. Mark Whitehead, manager of the Legg Mason Martin Currie Global Equity Income fund, says these moves could jolt the markets. Investors must therefore be prepared for volatility to intensify. This will particularly be the case if companies pass on any tariffs to consumers, which could stoke inflation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we get a prolonged trade war and the US Federal Reserve continues to raise rates and tighten policy, there is a danger that this combination of headwinds could cause the global economy to slide towards recession.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Farmers in America have voiced their concerns that sales to China - a key market - will suffer. Here are the key charts from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs report: The US dollar has fallen against other major currencies, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report - and the underwhelming wage growth. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pushing shares up in New York in pre-market trading. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report suggests America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is shrugging off the threat of a trade war. Our US business editor Dominic Rushe explains: The US added 213,000 jobs in June as the unemployment rate ticked up to 4%, suggesting the start of an international trade war has so far done little to dent the robust jobs market. The US has now added jobs every month for 93 months in a row \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the longest such stretch since records began. The unemployment rate most likely rose as more people who were not looking for work started job searches. The tariffs imposed today by the US and China have been overshadowing the global economy for months. Of course, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll only see their full impact in the months ahead.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a snap summary of the US jobs report, from Bloomberg TV Despite the solid job creation in May and June, the US unemployment rate has risen to 4% from 3.8%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first rise in a year, and might fuel concerns that the jobs market is levelling out. But... this is also because more people are looking for work. This pushed the labor force participation rate up to 62.9%, from 62.7% in May. Newsflash: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market created more jobs than expected last month, but wage growth remains subdued. The June non-farm payroll, just released, rose by 213,000 - beating forecasts of a 195,000 increase. May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure has also been revised higher, from 223,000 to 244,000 - underlining that America is still creating jobs at a decent rate. But disappointingly, average hourly earnings only rose by 0.2% during the month - missing hopes of a 0.3% rise. That kept the annual earnings growth at 2.7%, missing expectations of 2.8%. This suggests that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much wage inflation in America - bad news for workers, but it might take the pressure off the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. More to follow... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of Airbus CEO Tom Enders warning today that Brexit will be damaging for his industry and the UK, whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153soft or hard, light or clean or whatever you call it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premier has warned that Beijing will respond to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs, even though a trade war isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interests. Li Keqiang told a summit meeting in Sofia, Bulgaria, that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A trade war benefits no-one because it hurts free trade and the multilateral process. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If a country wants to raise tariffs, China will respond to defend itself.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Li is attending the 7th summit of heads of government of Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC) and China, which has been slightly overshadowed by the start of the US-Chinese trade war this morning. Paul Donovan of UBS argues that the US and China aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in a trade war yet....but they will be, if Trump actually slaps tariffs on $500bn of Chinese imports (as he seemed to threaten last night). Donovan also points out that US consumers will pay these tariffs: The US raised consumer taxes again overnight. $34bn of goods partially made in China now face a 25% tariff. The consumer tax was designed to minimize the impact on the US consumer, which makes it something of an economic practical joke. This is not a trade war - it may redistribute patterns of trade. US President Trump was sounding agitated, threatening to tax US consumers on up to $500bn of US sales (that would be a trade war). This creates uncertainty, which the Federal Reserve warns may damage investment in the US. Even if just \u00e2\u20ac\u0153art of the deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bluster, such talk has a cost that may not easily be reversed. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstrom, has tweeted that these new tariffs will hurt the global economy: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a non-too-subtle rebuttal of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that trade wars are good and easy to win. US farmers are understandably concerned about the trade war, which could badly dent their exports. China is the biggest single market for US soybeans, buying more than half the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s production. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve now less attractive due to the additional 25% tariff being levied by Chinese officials at the border, which might increase demand for Brazilian soy instead. Brent Bible, an Indiana farmer who grows corn and soy, says the trade war has already caused damage, driving down the price of soybeans in the wholesale market. This means farmers are reluctant to invest in new equipment and storage, Bible told the New York Times, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not spending money then other industries aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t making any money off of us, either.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The financial markets continue to take the trade war in their stride. European equities are a little higher, after a positive day in Asia. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim overnight that he could eventually impose tariffs on $500bn of Chinese imports - a truly colossal sum - hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t caused any obvious panic. Arnaud Masset of Switzerland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online bank Swissquote, says investors don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really know where they stand: The dollar index was down 0.10% to 94.30, the single currency rose 0.20% to 1.1715, while the Swiss franc and Japanese yen were treading water. The Chinese yuan was down only 0.10%. Equities were blinking green across the screen, while bond yields were relatively stable on both side of the Atlantic. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit points out that tariffs actually hurt the country imposing them, as well as their target. Newsflash: China has joined Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war, by imposing retaliatory tariffs of 25% on $34bn of US goods. The Xinhua news agency is reporting that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs came into effect at 12.01pm Beijing time - shortly after America fired the opening salvo. The list of products affected includes US fruit and vegetables (from apricots to soy beans), cigars, chemicals, some vehicles, a wide array of chemicals (including crude Benzene and various adhesives), plastics and some medical equipment. The latest reading for the productivity of British workers is out, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unlikely to cheer the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who has made boosting efficiency one of his top priorities. According to the Office for National Statistics, economic output per hour of work dropped by 0.4% in the first three months of 2018 from the final quarter of last year, amid a strong increase for employment across the UK. When more people contribute to the economy without generating increased levels of economic output, productivity falls. The reading is worrying because higher rates of productivity tend to lead to greater increase in pay - which has grown at a pitiful rate in the UK since the financial crisis. Comparing the first quarter to the same period a year ago, productivity growth increased by a healthier-sounding 0.9%. However, the ONS said this growth remains below the average pre-downturn of 2%, continuing the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153productivity puzzle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Economists are perplexed as to why the UK has failed to return productivity growth towards the pre-crisis average, although many fear falling business investment as Britain leaves the EU could make the problem worse. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because companies spending on machinery and better technology tends to boost the efficiency of workers. Newsflash: Airbus says is already taking steps to protect itself from Brexit damage: Airbus CEO Tom Enders insists he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trying to meddle in UK politics - despite launching such a stinging attack on the government. Airbus is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgoing for broke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in its attempts to avoid a damaging hard Brexit, reckons Tom Macleod of Sky News. John Collingridge of the Sunday Times says the government really should listen to major businesses like Airbus (rather than just swearing about them, foreign secretary....) Back in Britain, the boss of Airbus has launched an absolutely blistering attack on the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit strategy. CEO Tom Enders has told reporters that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no clue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about how to execute Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the European Union without causing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsevere harm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. My colleague Rob Davies is attending Airbus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual media briefing, and reports. Last month, Airbus warned that it could be forced to stop making aircraft wings in Britain, if Brexit disrupts its access to the European customs union. This new intervention comes as Cabinet ministers head to Chequers for their own crunch talks on Brexit, where Theresa May faces a battle with ministers... Anticipation is building in the markets, as traders wonder when China will deliver on its promised retaliation. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says Beijing is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153teasing the markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by delaying its response to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move, making it clear that the US fired the first shots. Technically, I think the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 comes first.... (as in the successful \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctit for two tats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 game theory strategy). The American Chamber of Commerce in China has appealed to both sides to negotiate a settlement. Chairman William Zarit warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are no winners in a trade war. We urge the two governments to come back to the negotiation table.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Buy on the sound of cannons\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is an old City maxim. And today, traders are buying on the sound of tariffs. Asian stock markets have actually risen today, despite Donald Trump pulling the trigger on Chinese imports. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite index has gained 1%, with Hong Kong close behind. Traders may be relieved that the waiting is over - these tariffs have been hanging over our heads for weeks! Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada explains: The first batch of US tariffs on China came into force \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is a milestone in the trade war but a very well-telegraphed one. China said it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forced to retaliate, but did not specify a time-frame, helping risk appetite. Trump repeated his claim that China is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153killing us\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on trade at a rally in Montana last night \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but his pattern so far has been to respond to the response \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delay in retaliation may slow down the war. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newspapers are very critical of Donald Trump for launching the trade war, accusing the US president of leading a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgang of hoodlums\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Our Beijing bureau chief, Lily Kuo, reports: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If what the US wants is to escalate a trade war with China, then so be it. A little fighting may be the only way the Trump administration clears its mind and allows everyone to sober up,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the state-run Global Times said on Friday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Trump administration is behaving like a gang of hoodlums with its shakedown of other countries, particularly China,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said an English-language article in the China Daily. On Thursday, a spokesperson for China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ministry of commerce said the US will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153opening fire on the whole world and also opening fire on itself.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re now awaiting Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s formal retaliation. China has swiftly hit back, accusing the United States of starting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the biggest trade war in economic history\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Commerce Ministry said imposing tariffs on $34bn of Chinese sales into America would hurt the global economy, damage large companies and consumers. A ministry spokesman added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China is forced to strike back to safeguard core national interests and the interests of its people.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. The trade war between America and China has begun, as Donald Trump delivers on his threat to hit $34bn of Chinese imports with new 25% tariffs. Washington imposed the new tariffs at midnight East Coast time, as Donald Trump had outlined in June. The move means US customs officials must now collecting 25% tariffs on more than 800 Chinese products, including aerospace, IT, robotics and industrial machinery. Tariffs on another $16bn of Chinese goods are expected in a couple of weeks. China has already vowed to hit back, of course, and has lined up tariffs on $34bn of US goods \u00e2\u20ac\u201d such as soya beans, electric vehicles, seafood and pork. That could hurt America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agricultural base. Last night, Trump told reporters that the US could impose more tariffs if China retaliates, with officials working on a second wave of $200bn of imports. Speaking on Air Force One, he floated the idea of tariffs on an extra $300bn of Chinese goods, on top of what has been lined up . The president explained: \u00e2\u20ac\u015334 [billion dollars], and then you have another 16 in two weeks and then as you know we have 200 billion in abeyance and then after the 200 billion we have 300 billion in abeyance. Ok? So we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Such an escalation would seriously roil the financial markets, and risk chilling global growth. As Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned yesterday, a full-blown trade war risks damaging the world economy, including America. Also coming up today The pound could be volatile as the British cabinet meets to debate Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit plan. Brexiteers are already criticising the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest attempt to limit the economic damage of leaving the EU, claiming it would prevent a decent trade deal with the US. It could be a long and testing day at Chequers. We also discover how many jobs were created in America last month. June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll is expected to rise by 195,000, compared with the 223,000 new jobs in May. Economists hope that wage growth picked up, to 2.8% per year from 2.7%.

                "bodyText":"With this, we are closing the blog for the day. Thank you for all your great comments. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Following an initial dip, the pound has rallied since news broke of the resignation of Brexit secretary David Davis late on Sunday night. He has been replaced by former housing minister Dominic Raab, a Brexit-supporting minister. Sterling is currently up nearly 0.5% at $1.3349, and steady against the euro. Investors are betting that Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 departure won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t endanger the prime minister, and that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153soft\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit has become more likely since Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chequers summit. Stock markets have begun the week on a positive note, despite rising trade tensions between America and China, which both imposed tariffs on a number of imported goods on Friday. Analysts say that markets brushed aside concerns over the impact on the world economy (as they have known for a month that the tariffs were coming), and were cheered by Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthy US jobs figures. Oil prices are climbing on higher global demand and US efforts to block Iranian supplies using sanctions. Brent crude is up 0.8% at $77.71 a barrel while US crude is little changed at $73.82 a barrel. It is the third day of gains on US stock markets. Wall Street has opened higher, as expected. Dow Jones up 0.4% S&amp;P 500 up 0.4% Nasdaq up 0.55% This means Draghi could leave office in November 2019 without ever having hiked interest rates during his eight-year term. Interest rates in the eurozone will stay on hold for at least another year, as previously signalled. Draghi said: We expect key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remains aligned with our current expectations of a sustained adjustment path. Draghi also reiterated that the ECB would pare back its monthly asset purchases from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30bn to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn and end the programme at the end of December. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is subject to incoming data confirming our medium-term inflation outlook.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In his speech to the European parliament, ECB chief Mario Draghi has warned that the main risks to economic growth come from trade disputes. As I have said before, downside risks to the outlook mainly relate to the threat of increased protectionism. A strong and united European Union can help reap the benefits of economic openness while protecting its citizens against unchecked globalisation. In leading by example, the EU can lend support to multilateralism and global trade, which have been cornerstones of growing economic prosperity over the past seven decades. But to be successful on the outside, the EU requires strong institutions and sound economic governance at home. You can read the whole speech here. Wall Street is expected to open higher, with investors still cheered by healthy US jobs data published last Friday, which have outweighed concerns over rising trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. Stock market futures are pointing to rises of 0.4% to 0.5% for the S&amp;P 500, the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones. While we are waiting for ECB chief Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech at the European parliament in Brussels (2pm BST), the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council member Ewald Nowotny has warned that trade wars, Brexit and capacity constraints are the main risks for the eurozone economy. He told a financial seminar in Zurich: For the eurozone, the Brexit constellation is something we look at. It is mainly a risk for the UK, but it also may pose risks and uncertainties for the eurozone.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Michael Minall, automotive sector specialist at management consultancy Vendigital said that following steady sales declines over the past few years, this admission from Nissan could well mean the death of diesel. In 2015, VW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emissions-rigging highlighted the disparity between real-world performance of diesel engine cars and laboratory test results. These latest revelations have once again pushed the issue into the spotlight, at a time when many consumers have also lost confidence in diesel. While the findings of Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation and the immediate impact of the news on automotive suppliers is unlikely to be significant, it certainly represents another nail in the coffin for the diesel car market. In other news, Nissan has admitted that exhaust emissions and fuel economy tests for 19 models in Japan were falsified. Reuters reports: The Japanese carmaker said on Monday it had discovered the testing environments for emissions and fuel economy in final vehicle inspections at most of its factories in Japan were not in line with requirements, and inspection reports were based on altered measurements. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A full and comprehensive investigation of the facts \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 including the causes and background of the misconduct, is under way,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nissan said. The problems were found during voluntary compliance checks following an improper vehicle inspection scandal last year. In October, a recall of 1.2m vehicles was triggered after Nissan said uncertified inspectors had signed off on final checks for cars sold in Japan. The carmaker blamed staffing shortages for the scandal, which caused annual operating profit to slide. Nissan said the latest misconduct did not compromise the safety of the affected models, and mileage readings were in line with levels presented in product catalogues. It was in the process of compiling data for the GT-R sports car to confirm it satisfied safety standards. Returning to trade... China says it will use the funds collected from tariffs charged on imports from the US to help ease the impact of US tariffs on Chinese companies. The commerce ministry also said it will encourage companies to import more products such as soybeans and cars from other markets. Amin Nasser, the chief executive of Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state energy giant Saudi Aramco, has warned of an oil supply crunch as investment in shale projects won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be enough to meet rising demand. He told the Financial Times in an interview (paid content): Something like shale oil\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it is not going to really create a major dent in total global supply requirements up until 2040. Energy companies are reluctant to invest in longer-term projects that are more costly, and are instead cutting costs and returning money to investors through dividends and share buybacks. Meanwhile, the Church of England has threatened to sell its shares in oil and gas firms that fail to do enough to combat climate change. Elsewhere, oil prices are climbing on increased global demand and US use of sanctions against Iran to shut out Iranian output. Brent crude, the world benchmark, is 0.8% higher at $77.74 a barrel. The US wants to reduce oil exports from the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fifth-bigger producer of oil to zero by November, which would put pressure on other big producers such as Saudi Arabia to pump more crude. However, Saudi Arabia and other members of the Opec oil cartel have little spare capacity and oil demand has outpaced supply in recent months. US oil output is increasing but is not enough to plug the gap if Iranian exports are blocked. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, has also explained the buoyancy of sterling following David Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 departure. Sterling continued to benefit from the resignation of Brexit Secretary David Davis, with his claim that he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t challenge Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tory leadership, alongside the swift appointment of Dominic Raab as his replacement, extending the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monday gains. Hopes that Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 grumpy abandonment of his passion project will lead Britain away from the harder EU exit Double D was after, and towards the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsofter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit proposed by Theresa May at Chequers over the weekend has allowed the pound to ride-out Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bumpy ministerial transition. Against the dollar it shot up half a percent, hitting a 3 and a half week high of $1.333, while against the euro it climbed 0.3% to sit a smidge off \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.133. Despite all this the FTSE still managed to find its own groove on Monday, the UK index rising 0.5% to tickle 7650. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very much in line with the situation elsewhere, with the DAX up 0.2% and the CAC jumping 0.6%. The gains come as investors express their relief at the lack of trade war escalation between the US and China (or indeed the US and EU) over the weekend, something that had become the norm in the last few weeks. Turning to this afternoon and the Dow Jones it looking at its own half a percent rise when the bell rings on Wall Street, a move that would leave the US index just short of 24600, its best price in a fortnight. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not too much US-specific stuff to deal with this Monday, so, Trump-intervention aside, should be able to keep hold of that growth. The pound is remarkably resilient this morning following David Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 resignation as Brexit secretary. Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING, says: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been saying that what matters for sterling markets is the type of Brexit delivered - not who delivers. The pound is able to live with ministerial resignations as long as that is the extent of the fallout. Looking at the tail risks of a Tory leadership contest - or even a General Election - we note the legislative hurdle is pretty high to see either outcome. So at this stage, one is inclined to interpret Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 resignation as a sign that the UK government is steering towards a softer Brexit - which is the more powerful, positive sterling driver. UK bond yields are also rising as investors are betting on a greater chance of Britain reaching a Brexit deal with the EU, following the resignation of Brexit minister David Davis. Dominic Raab, the housing minister, has been announced as his replacement in the last few minutes. Davis said this morning that he was not calling on other ministers to quit and expressed belief that Theresa May could survive the upheaval. The yield on two-year gilts hit its highest level since 24 May. Some more thoughts on sterling, which is up around 0.4% at $1.3340. Chris Scicluna at Daiwa Capital Markets said: Sterling remains broadly stable this morning, and firmer than it was ahead of the Cabinet agreement last Friday. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at online trading firm IG, said: Brexit concerns are back at the top of the agenda, following last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting at Chequers, culminating in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation from David Davis. While markets should be worried by the added uncertainty of losing the Brexit secretary just eight months before the UK leaves the EU, there is a feeling that the UK is moving towards a business-friendly softer Brexit. The BCC has voiced its concerns over the impact of a potential rate rise, with companies clearly in limbo ahead of an uncertain Brexit. However, while companies and individuals may not too keen on a BoE rate rise, markets are clearly warming to the idea, with GBPUSD rising to a three-week high, amid a wider dollar selloff. Markets are currently pricing in an 80% chance of a BoE rate rise in less than a months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time, yet with the UK GDP figure due out tomorrow morning, we could see some sterling volatility to come this week. Interestingly, tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK GDP reading represents the start of a new period where we will see monthly releases from the ONS, allowing the BoE to enjoy a more accurate economic environment for setting rates. Contrary to earlier reports, junior Brexit minister Suella Braverman has not resigned, Reuters is reporting, citing a UK government official. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much corporate news here in the UK this morning. As we reported earlier, Mothercare is slashing more jobs than expected and unveiled details of its planned fundraising later this month. The German publisher Axel Springer has raised its stake in the UK online estate agent Purplebricks to 12.5% from 11.5% and did not rule out a further increase. Purplebricks ventured into the US last year, its third market after Britain and Australia, but remains deep in the red with its operating loss quadrupling last year. Despite warnings that the tariffs imposed by Washington and Beijing on Friday in a tit-for-tat trade dispute could hit economic growth around the world, markets are sanguine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for now. Analysts at London Capital Group said: The actual trade tariffs are nothing new, the market has been aware of them for over a month, and for now conditions are still supportive for financial growth, allowing markets to move higher. Sentiment could remain resilient until we see solid evidence of these trade tensions feed through to softer economic data, particularly in China. Global stocks have hit a two-week high following the stronger-than-expected US jobs report on Friday, and as traders shrugged off rising trade tensions between America and China. Sterling recovered quickly after a dip following Brexit secretary David Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 resignation as traders focused on the likelihood of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153soft Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Davis made clear this morning that he would not stand against Theresa May and would not encourage others to challenge her. The pound is now up 0.5% against the dollar. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, has risen 0.8% while the pan-European Stoxx 600 is 0.6% ahead. UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 up 0.15% at 7629.13 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax up 0.2% at 12,524.87 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC up 0.6% at 5480.75 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex up 0.4% at 9947.70 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB up 0.66% at 22,0780.09 Sterling is now up more than 0.5% to $1.3358, after former Brexit secretary David Davis said he was not planning to challenge Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership, and that he wanted her to stay as prime minister. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I like [May]. She is a good prime minister,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told the Radio 4 Today programme. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m told that the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy governor Ben Broadbent is speaking at an internal event this morning. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Andy Haldane is speaking at townhall meetings in the North East. Again there is no text. UK regulators have blocked the sale of aircraft parts firm Northern Aerospace to a Chinese buyer following a probe into national security concerns. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Competition and Markets Authority launched an investigation last month into the \u00c2\u00a344m sale of the company by its UK private equity owner Better Capital to Chinese aerospace and mining firm Shaanxi Ligeance Mineral Resources. The probe came after the UK business secretary Greg Clark intervened. Northern Aerospace is based in County Durham and employs 600 people. It designs and makes aeroplane components for carriers including Airbus, Boeing and Gulfstream. Better Capital said this morning: Permission to complete the sale was not obtained from the Competition and Markets Authority by the revised contractual deadline, despite requests for such permission by both parties. Accordingly the proposed transaction has lapsed. Mothercare shares fell more than 12% in early trading to 25.2p, and are now changing hands at 26.17p. The new shares are being issued at 19p. On the corporate front, struggling retailer Mothercare has announced details of its restructuring and refinancing package as it fights for survival. It plans to cut 900 jobs, 100 more than previously announced, and put its Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World subsidiary into administration. The move comes after landlords rejected the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposals for rent reductions for Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World stores last month. Mothercare will now close a total of 60 out of its 137 stores, 10 more than it said in May. These will be carried out through a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), which allows companies to shut loss-making shops and secure rental discounts. It expects to make annual savings of about \u00c2\u00a310m following the closures, and also plans to raise \u00c2\u00a332.5m from existing shareholders through a rights issue.

Last week, German finance minister Olaf Scholz warned that Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to impose tariffs on imports from China and the EU would damage everyone. Donald Trump threatened last month to impose a 20% tariff on imports of all vehicles assembled in the EU. He imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium imported from the EU, Canada and Mexico at the start of June. The EU and Canada hit back with their own levies on US goods. German trade data this morning show that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus widened in May \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade dispute with the US. Exports rose 1.8% on the month, according to data from the Federal Statistics Office in Berlin, while imports increased 0.7%. This pushed the trade surplus up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20.3bn in May from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac19bn in April \u00e2\u20ac\u201c better than expected. Carsten Brzeski at ING says: The latest weakening of the euro should bring some relief in the coming months, more than offsetting current US tariffs on European aluminium and steel. Looking ahead and despite the very benign impact of trade tensions so far, a fully fledged trade war would surely leave negative marks on the German economy. Markets are hoping for further clues about a tightening to monetary policy when European Central Bank president Mario Draghi speaks at the European parliament in Brussels this afternoon. CMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Madden says: Traders will be listening carefully to the central banker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech as it may give away clues to possible changes to the monetary policy. Last month, the head of the ECB announced the bond-buying scheme would be wound down at the end of the year. Mr Draghi also suggested that interest rates are unlikely to be hiked until at least the back end of 2019. The currency bloc has been going through a mixed economic period, and Mr Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s update could give an insight into what the central banker is thinking. European markets have risen at the open. UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 up 0.4% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax up 0.4% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC up 0.5% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex up 0.2% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB up 0.5% Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PSI 20 up 0.3% David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: The pound is holding up relatively well. This will put severe pressure on Prime Minister May, and there are questions being asked about how long she will last in the top job. Trade remains in focus globally, with Donald Trump heading to Europe this week for the NATO summit. He has already voiced his opinion that the US pays a large share of the NATO budget. Madden says: Mr Trump is still playing the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAmerica first\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 card, and there is a possibility that global trading relations could take a further knock. Last week there were signs that the relationship between the EU and the US were improving, after it was reported that the Trump administration is contemplating rowing back on the threat to impose 20% tariffs on EU cars. It was also reported that Angela Merkel is considering throwing her weight behind the proposal of cutting levies on US cars into the EU. The embattled prime minister, Theresa May, is expected to reshuffle her cabinet sometime after 9am following Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 resignation. You can read the latest on our politics live blog. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at online forex broker FXTM, says: The pound was surprisingly steady after the resignation of the Brexit secretary David Davis. Trading the pound is going to be tricky in the coming days and will depend predominantly on how the negotiations with the EU develop after Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 resignation and the survival of Theresa May. However, from Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market reaction, traders seem to believe we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still heading towards a soft Brexit. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. The trade war between America and China began on Friday, when both Washington and Beijing imposed 25% tariffs on a number of imports. The US fired the opening salvo, imposing levies on $34bn of Chinese imports, including aerospace, IT and medical kit. China hit back with tariffs on products such as soybeans, chemicals and some cars. But markets have taken the escalating trade dispute in their stride. European stocks are expected to open higher after Asian stocks rallied overnight. Worries over the trade dispute ebbed away on Friday when non-farm payrolls data showed stronger-than-expected US job growth and steady wage gains, suggesting the Federal Reserve will stick to gradual interest rate increases, and pushing US stocks higher that day. The pound wobbled after the shock resignation of UK Brexit secretary David Davis and Brexit ministers Steven Baker and Suella Braverman. Sterling weakened to $1.3290 when the news broke, but has since recovered and hit its highest level since 14 June this morning. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now trading 0.2% higher at $1.3321. Against the euro, it has been steady at 88.38p. Central bankers including Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent and European Central Bank president Mario Draghi are due to speak today.

Oliver Jones at Capital Economics says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After rising and then falling by more than 1% against the dollar since Friday, sterling has been more stable today, after a lull in the storm in the UK Conservative Party.</p> <p>In the wake of the high-profile resignations of the past couple of days, the prospect of an immediate challenge to Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership appears to have subsided. For the time being at least, it appears that not enough Conservative MPs are willing to back a vote of no confidence in her that could trigger a leadership contest. And Michael Gove has pledged not to resign from the Cabinet, contrary to speculation that he would follow David Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead.</p> <p>Admittedly, not everyone appears convinced. According to betting markets, the probability of a general election in the UK this year remains at nearly 30% today, compared to closer to 15% last week. The implied probability that Boris Johnson becomes the next prime minister is higher than last week too. While this is still deemed fairly unlikely \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an implied probability of just under 15% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such an eventuality would presumably significantly increase the chances of a much \u00e2\u20ac\u0153harder\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit than the government is currently pursuing.</p> <p>Despite the jitters in betting markets, though, there is still little evidence that investors in financial markets are braced for an early election, or a pivot towards a hard Brexit by some other means. Overall, sterling is roughly where it was before Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cabinet summit at Chequers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that is taking into account the mildly disappointing UK economic data released today.</p> <p>In contrast to the run-up to the EU referendum, there is no sign that investors are purchasing options to protect themselves against the possibility of a sharp fall in sterling in the near future either. And UK small-cap equities, which suffered disproportionately just after the vote to leave the EU, have risen since Friday.</p> <p>Looking ahead, our central forecast is that sterling will rise from about $1.33 to $1.40 by the end of the year. This is based on the assumption that continued progress will be made towards a soft form of Brexit. (Indeed, since the EU is likely to reject the proposal approved by the Cabinet at Chequers, the government may end up negotiating an even closer relationship with the EU.) It also rests on our view that the Bank of England will tighten monetary policy faster than investors are anticipating.</p> <p>Of course, a hard Brexit cannot be ruled out, especially given that the clock is ticking. But even a successful challenge to Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership would not necessarily bring about this outcome, particularly given that it currently lacks parliamentary support.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b44c67ee4b04dbcfcbde351\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-10T14:46:53.131Z\">3.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More positive employment data from the US, with the latest job opening numbers (one of the key pieces of information considered by the Federal Reserve under former chair Janet Yellen):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hamrickisms/status/1016693848146407424\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Latest &quot;JOLTS&quot; numbers just posted from late May reflect some decline in total number of job openings in the U.S., but still robust at 6.6 million.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A fairly uneventful session allowed the Western indices to push higher, with the Dow Jones climbing to a fresh 3 week peak.</p> <p>Rising 140 points, the Dow Jones crossed the 24900 mark for the first time since 19<sup>th</sup> May. The main driver of the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent growth appears to be a lack of trade war escalation in the last week or so. And while that may sound odd given that Friday saw the tariff tit-for-tatting between the US and China, those measures were well-trailed, and since then there hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been anything to cause another macro-wobble.</p> <p>Over in the Eurozone the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indices benefited from the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor performance. The single currency has struggled in light of a trade war-hit pair of dismal ZEW economic sentiment readings, dropping 0.3% against the dollar and 0.4% against the pound. This in turn meant that the DAX and CAC could climb 0.6% and 0.5% respectively, taking the German index back above 12600. </p> <p>As for the FTSE, the UK index couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite match the growth seen elsewhere, posting a disappointing 0.1% increase. That did, however, still keep the FTSE above 7700, and at an effective 3 and a half week high.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b44b485e4b0174534148b74\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-10T13:38:03.008Z\">2.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over in the US, markets have got off to a positive start, helped by better than expected results from PepsiCo and a rise in oil shares as crude is supported by supply problems.</p> <p>So the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 108 points or 0.44% in early trading, while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.16% higher and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.19%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b44af33e4b0f86cea7469c1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-10T13:17:26.502Z\">2.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK economy forecast to grow by 0.4% in second quarter - NIESR</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Following the official UK growth figures, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research has published its latest GDP forecasts, which suggest a pick-up in the second quarter.</p> <p>The think tank said the 0.2% growth seen in the three months to May was in line with its own forecasts. It now expects the UK economy to grow by 0.4% in the three months to June, as the effects of the bad weather earlier in the year drop out of the equation.</p> <p>For the third quarter it expects GDP growth to improve to 0.5%, as the manufacturing and construction sectors recover from a particularly weak start to the year and the service sector grows slightly faster. Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The economy is showing clear signs of recovering from the unexpected slowdown in the first quarter. Taking the business surveys together, we believe that this recovery will be most noticeable in manufacturing and construction where output should start to increase once more. Overall though, we continue to expect the economy to grow broadly in line with its potential in the second and third quarters and not by enough to compensate for the slowdown in the first quarter.</p> <p>There are a number of plausible explanations for the weakness in the first quarter and the subsequent recovery. Extreme weather in the UK in March appears to have impacted adversely on the construction sector and to some extent on the retail sector as well. Growth in the Euro Area, our largest trading partner, also slowed and some of the weakness there can be attributed to similar one-off factors, particularly in France and Germany. Although Brexit and protectionist agendas loom large, there is little clear evidence that these factors specifically dragged economic growth lower in the first quarter. The international picture is mixed. Activity in the Euro Area has recovered since the first quarter slowdown, but growth is likely to be subdued in the single currency block compared with the pace achieved in 2017. By contrast, economic growth in the US is expected to gain momentum as the full effects of the fiscal expansion take effect. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1ff602dcf34a8147842ff5d37a4b60010fd5cdf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1ff602dcf34a8147842ff5d37a4b60010fd5cdf/0_0_1012_672/1000.jpg\" alt=\"niesrjuly\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b44abd9e4b04dbcfcbde1cb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-10T13:02:32.456Z\">2.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">A quick recap</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jul/10/uk-monthly-gdp-data-economy-recovery-ftse-sterling-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-5b446e7ee4b04dbcfcbddf32#block-5b446e7ee4b04dbcfcbddf32\">Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has picked up pace, according to the first ever monthly GDP reading</a>. </strong>GDP rose by 0.3% during May, the Office for National Statistics says, up from 0.2% in April as growth benefitted from warmer weather.</p> <p>The ONS also reports that the economy stagnated in the February-April quarter, before picking up with 0.2% growth in March-May.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jul/10/uk-monthly-gdp-data-economy-recovery-ftse-sterling-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-5b447267e4b0f86cea746710#block-5b447267e4b0f86cea746710\">The data shows that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy remains unbalanced. </a></strong>The services sector provided the bulk of the growth, while construction and manufacturing both shrank in the last three months.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jul/10/uk-monthly-gdp-data-economy-recovery-ftse-sterling-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-5b4471b8e4b0174534148855#block-5b4471b8e4b0174534148855\">The ONS said that retail spending and computer programming boosted growth</a></strong>.</p> <p>Some economists believe this increases the chances of an August interest rat rise; others suspect that political instability might deter the Bank of England.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jul/10/uk-monthly-gdp-data-economy-recovery-ftse-sterling-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-5b44829ce4b0f86cea74679c#block-5b44829ce4b0f86cea74679c\">Separate figures have shown that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit widened</a></strong>, partly due to a big drop in car exports.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jul/10/uk-monthly-gdp-data-economy-recovery-ftse-sterling-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-5b4492bce4b0f86cea746847#block-5b4492bce4b0f86cea746847\">German investor morale has fallen to a six-year low, as the threat of a trade war hurts confidence</a></strong>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b44a795e4b0174534148ac3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-10T12:38:22.236Z\">1.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ee011ab7367e83d28128a87b5b6bfe25db7ecc45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee011ab7367e83d28128a87b5b6bfe25db7ecc45/0_148_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Poundworld store.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Newsflash: 25 Poundworld stores are shutting, with the loss of 242 jobs.</strong></p> <p>Deloitte, which took control of the discount retailer after it went bust last month, is closing the stores because it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet found a buyer for the chain.</p> <p>The Press Association explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A memo to staff penned by the professional services firm, and seen by the Press Association, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As previously advised, the administrators have been preparing contingency plans in the event that we are not able to deliver a sale of the business as a whole. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153These plans have been continuing and it is with regret that the administrators have taken the decision to effect an organised wind down of 25 stores, starting today.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> <p>That last day of trading for the affected stores will be July 15.</p> </blockquote> <p>Poundworld has more than 300 stores across the UK.

                "bodyText":"The lack of further trade tensions between the US and China, better than expected results from PepsiCo and a slightly calmer day on the UK political scene has seen markets end the day (mostly) in positive territory. But with Brexit tensions still apparent (including two Conservative vice chairs resigning), and UK growth figures suggesting an interest rate rise in August, the FTSE 100 has underperformed most of its European peers. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Investors are still in buying mode as there has been no update regarding the trade dispute. [They] are using the relatively quiet period in terms of newsflow as an opportunity to buy into the market... Traders...are also getting ready for the latest [US] earnings season, and it is drawing attention away from the trade spat. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 4.05 points or 0.05% at 7692.04 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 0.53% to 12,609.85 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.67% at 5434.36 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 0.11% to 22,057.30 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.38% at 9889.3 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 140 points or 0.58%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The pound is fairly steady at the moment, as the UK political chaos of the past few days eases and investors consider the prospect of a soft(er) Brexit. Oliver Jones at Capital Economics says: After rising and then falling by more than 1% against the dollar since Friday, sterling has been more stable today, after a lull in the storm in the UK Conservative Party. In the wake of the high-profile resignations of the past couple of days, the prospect of an immediate challenge to Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership appears to have subsided. For the time being at least, it appears that not enough Conservative MPs are willing to back a vote of no confidence in her that could trigger a leadership contest. And Michael Gove has pledged not to resign from the Cabinet, contrary to speculation that he would follow David Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead. Admittedly, not everyone appears convinced. According to betting markets, the probability of a general election in the UK this year remains at nearly 30% today, compared to closer to 15% last week. The implied probability that Boris Johnson becomes the next prime minister is higher than last week too. While this is still deemed fairly unlikely \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an implied probability of just under 15% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such an eventuality would presumably significantly increase the chances of a much \u00e2\u20ac\u0153harder\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit than the government is currently pursuing. Despite the jitters in betting markets, though, there is still little evidence that investors in financial markets are braced for an early election, or a pivot towards a hard Brexit by some other means. Overall, sterling is roughly where it was before Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cabinet summit at Chequers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that is taking into account the mildly disappointing UK economic data released today. In contrast to the run-up to the EU referendum, there is no sign that investors are purchasing options to protect themselves against the possibility of a sharp fall in sterling in the near future either. And UK small-cap equities, which suffered disproportionately just after the vote to leave the EU, have risen since Friday. Looking ahead, our central forecast is that sterling will rise from about $1.33 to $1.40 by the end of the year. This is based on the assumption that continued progress will be made towards a soft form of Brexit. (Indeed, since the EU is likely to reject the proposal approved by the Cabinet at Chequers, the government may end up negotiating an even closer relationship with the EU.) It also rests on our view that the Bank of England will tighten monetary policy faster than investors are anticipating. Of course, a hard Brexit cannot be ruled out, especially given that the clock is ticking. But even a successful challenge to Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership would not necessarily bring about this outcome, particularly given that it currently lacks parliamentary support. More positive employment data from the US, with the latest job opening numbers (one of the key pieces of information considered by the Federal Reserve under former chair Janet Yellen): Markets continue to edge higher, with the absence of further trade war developments helping to give some support. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: A fairly uneventful session allowed the Western indices to push higher, with the Dow Jones climbing to a fresh 3 week peak. Rising 140 points, the Dow Jones crossed the 24900 mark for the first time since 19th May. The main driver of the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent growth appears to be a lack of trade war escalation in the last week or so. And while that may sound odd given that Friday saw the tariff tit-for-tatting between the US and China, those measures were well-trailed, and since then there hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been anything to cause another macro-wobble. Over in the Eurozone the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indices benefited from the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor performance. The single currency has struggled in light of a trade war-hit pair of dismal ZEW economic sentiment readings, dropping 0.3% against the dollar and 0.4% against the pound. This in turn meant that the DAX and CAC could climb 0.6% and 0.5% respectively, taking the German index back above 12600. As for the FTSE, the UK index couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite match the growth seen elsewhere, posting a disappointing 0.1% increase. That did, however, still keep the FTSE above 7700, and at an effective 3 and a half week high. Over in the US, markets have got off to a positive start, helped by better than expected results from PepsiCo and a rise in oil shares as crude is supported by supply problems. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 108 points or 0.44% in early trading, while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.16% higher and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.19%. Following the official UK growth figures, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research has published its latest GDP forecasts, which suggest a pick-up in the second quarter. The think tank said the 0.2% growth seen in the three months to May was in line with its own forecasts. It now expects the UK economy to grow by 0.4% in the three months to June, as the effects of the bad weather earlier in the year drop out of the equation. For the third quarter it expects GDP growth to improve to 0.5%, as the manufacturing and construction sectors recover from a particularly weak start to the year and the service sector grows slightly faster. Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting, said: The economy is showing clear signs of recovering from the unexpected slowdown in the first quarter. Taking the business surveys together, we believe that this recovery will be most noticeable in manufacturing and construction where output should start to increase once more. Overall though, we continue to expect the economy to grow broadly in line with its potential in the second and third quarters and not by enough to compensate for the slowdown in the first quarter. There are a number of plausible explanations for the weakness in the first quarter and the subsequent recovery. Extreme weather in the UK in March appears to have impacted adversely on the construction sector and to some extent on the retail sector as well. Growth in the Euro Area, our largest trading partner, also slowed and some of the weakness there can be attributed to similar one-off factors, particularly in France and Germany. Although Brexit and protectionist agendas loom large, there is little clear evidence that these factors specifically dragged economic growth lower in the first quarter. The international picture is mixed. Activity in the Euro Area has recovered since the first quarter slowdown, but growth is likely to be subdued in the single currency block compared with the pace achieved in 2017. By contrast, economic growth in the US is expected to gain momentum as the full effects of the fiscal expansion take effect. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has picked up pace, according to the first ever monthly GDP reading. GDP rose by 0.3% during May, the Office for National Statistics says, up from 0.2% in April as growth benefitted from warmer weather. The ONS also reports that the economy stagnated in the February-April quarter, before picking up with 0.2% growth in March-May. The data shows that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy remains unbalanced. The services sector provided the bulk of the growth, while construction and manufacturing both shrank in the last three months. The ONS said that retail spending and computer programming boosted growth. Some economists believe this increases the chances of an August interest rat rise; others suspect that political instability might deter the Bank of England. Separate figures have shown that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit widened, partly due to a big drop in car exports. German investor morale has fallen to a six-year low, as the threat of a trade war hurts confidence. Newsflash: 25 Poundworld stores are shutting, with the loss of 242 jobs. Deloitte, which took control of the discount retailer after it went bust last month, is closing the stores because it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet found a buyer for the chain. The Press Association explains: A memo to staff penned by the professional services firm, and seen by the Press Association, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As previously advised, the administrators have been preparing contingency plans in the event that we are not able to deliver a sale of the business as a whole. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These plans have been continuing and it is with regret that the administrators have taken the decision to effect an organised wind down of 25 stores, starting today.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That last day of trading for the affected stores will be July 15. Poundworld has more than 300 stores across the UK. The 25 stores earmarked for closure are located in: Doncaster North Shields Wakefield Stretford Sutton Coalfield Ashton Blackburn Manchester Arndale Denton Derby West Field Nottingham Broadmarsh Grays Middlebrook Chester Newcastle Wallsend Bradford Ivegate Birmingham Crewe Halifax Liverpool Bell Vale Loughborough Ipswich Carmarthen Dumfries Hyde Meanwhile in Germany, investor confidence has sagged to its lowest level in six years. The ZEW index of German investor morale dropped to -24.7 in July from -16.1 in June. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the weakest reading since August 2012, when the eurozone crisis was raging. Achim Wambach, president of ZEW (an economic think tank) blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great political uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for making German business leaders jittery. In particular, fears over an escalation of the international trade war with the United States have dampened the economic outlook. The positive news regarding industrial production, incoming orders and the labour market have been greatly overshadowed by the anticipated negative effects on foreign trade.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics correspondent, Richard Partington, on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures: The start of the summer heatwave has helped the British economy recover ground after grinding to a halt earlier this year, despite a severe downturn for the manufacturing industry in the three months to May. Presenting its first ever estimates for gross domestic product (GDP) on a monthly basis, the Office for National Statistics said warmer weather and the royal wedding in May helped Britain bounce back from zero growth in March, when the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beast from the east\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd caused the UK economy to flatline. GDP increased by 0.3% in May, up from 0.2% in April, as shoppers returned to the high street and activity among computer programming companies and law firms increased. Overall, the ONS said average growth for the three months to the end of May was 0.2%, meeting economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations. More here: Suren Thiru, Head of Economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too impressed by the pick-up in growth in May. He says the UK economy remains \u00e2\u20ac\u0153underwhelming\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and unbalanced -- and is also concerned that the trade gap has widened. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest GDP data confirms that there was a modest rally in economic activity over recent months but coming after the marked slowdown in the first quarter there is further confirmation that UK growth remains underwhelming. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The uptick in growth also masks a number of key concerns. The persistent imbalances in the UK economy remain, so while there was solid growth in the services sector, industrial production and construction sectors are adding little to overall growth. The widening in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit for the second successive month is also a concern and means that trade is likely to have been a drag on GDP in the second quarter of the year. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probable that the UK is past peak-trading conditions for exporters, with slowing global growth and the prospect of a trade war weighing on demand for UK goods and services. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While we still expect UK growth to have picked up in the second quarter as a whole, there remains little sign of a prolonged upswing in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth trajectory. The current political and Brexit related uncertainty, as well as the failure to deal with longstanding issues such as weak productivity, are likely to weigh on economic activity over the near term. Bad news: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit with the rest of the world has widened. The ONS reports that the total UK trade deficit widened by \u00c2\u00a35.0bn in the three months ot May 2008, to \u00c2\u00a38.3bn It blamed falling goods exports and rising goods imports -- a combination that scuppers the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to narrow the trade gap. Car exports took a nasty fall during the quarter, helping to drag total exports down by \u00c2\u00a33.1bn. Imports jumped by \u00c2\u00a31.9bn during the quarter. The ONS says that vehicle sales to the US, Oman and Australia all shrank -- which looks like a blow to attempts to build Global Britain after Brexit. The report also shows how dependent Britain is on trade with Europe: The UK imported 55% of its goods from the EU and exported 51% of its goods to countries outside of the EU in the 12 months to May 2018. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy appears to have bounced back, following a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lacklustre\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd performance earlier this year. So says Charles Hepworth, investment director at asset management firm GAM: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK economy appeared to bounce back over the last three months compared to its lacklustre performance in the first quarter of 2018. GDP grew 0.2% in the three months to the end of May with the month of May alone delivering 0.3%. The ONS has now changed how it calculates GDP. Instead of the previous quarterly estimates, it will now deliver monthly estimates along with a rolling three month number in an effort to provide more accurate numbers that aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so prone to revisions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Services, accounting for 80% of the economy, predictably was where the growth was seen \u00e2\u20ac\u201c retail performed strongly, with the Royal Wedding no doubt helping. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool has calculated that the new monthly GDP data released today gives a rosier picture of UK growth since the EU referendum. He tells me: I have plotted together annual GDP growth (based on the latest release of quarterly GDP data) and inferred annual growth (based on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s release of monthly GDP data from ONS code: ECY2 ). The monthly data paint a much rosier picture from 2016Q3 onwards. To the extent that the MPC members decide to trust today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly GDP data, it is more likely than not that they will hike in August, unless, of course, Boris Johnson and his Brexit colleagues have other ideas about the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fate! Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing the details: This chart from Morgan Stanley shows how services drove the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth in the last three months: MS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jacob Nell says: The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first monthly GDP print showed growth picking up in May, driven in particular by a strong services sector, helped by a partial May rebound in construction and manufacturing. Services strong, manufacturing and construction weak: While services grew strongly manufacturing and IP remained drags on growth on the 3M measure. However, manufacturing and construction bounced back partially in May. May rebound keep August hike on track: This print is the last GDP data before the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s August 2 decision. They look consistent with a solid 2Q rebound \u00e2\u20ac\u201c consistent with the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.4%Q forecast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and keep our call for an August hike on track, we think. Ben Brettell, Senior Economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, points out that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy still looks unbalanced. The Royal wedding and some great weather boosted the economy in May, with GDP rising 0.3% on April. The economy grew 0.2% in the quarter to May..... While the news is undoubtedly positive, the usual concerns will no doubt surface around the bias towards the service sector, which drove the growth. Industrial production and construction both fell in the quarter, though the latter rebounded slightly in May. Michael Thirkettle, chief executive of construction consulting and design agency McBains, is concerned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building activity shrank in the last quarter (despite the recovery in May). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures make for further depressing reading and show that construction is well and truly mired in the deep waters of recession. UK and international companies and investors that are looking to invest in the UK are still struggling to get a read on the post-Brexit destination, meaning a reluctance to commit to new projects. In particular, the wages of scarce skilled tradespeople has been rising sharply in recent months and companies will face a further squeeze on labour with the supply of non-UK skilled workers being cut off when the UK leaves the EU \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an effect, which coupled with material price increases, is squeezing margins substantially.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is from Mike Jakeman of PwC: The continued dominance of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services companies shows why the sector needs to be protected from Brexit disrupion, says Anthony Kurukgy, senior sales trader at Foenix Partners: The latest growth figures were spearheaded by the service sector, despite contraction in both production and construction industries. Last week, Prime Minister May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsofter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit stance highlighted the need to protect the very sector that carries significant importance to the UK economy. Although somewhat lacklustre, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures show that the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call to protect the freedom of services at home and across the Channel should not be jeopardised. Andy Bruce of Reuters shows how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy was still reliant on service sector growth in the last three months: On the other hand, Tom Stevenson, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced UK interest rates will rise next month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The first of a new-style monthly GDP report shows a continuation of an old-style economic story. Good weather and a Royal Wedding provided a boost to the services side of the economy in the three months to May but construction and manufacturing remain in the doldrums. The overall trend is yet to break out of the downward path it has traced since the beginning of 2017. There is nothing in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s release to suggest that the Bank of England will be rushing to raise rates in August.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, has analysed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data and predicts that UK growth may have picked up to 0.4% in April-June. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153GDP growth in the three months to May was still relatively modest at 0.2% relative to the previous three months, but this is dragged down by the weak performance in March, when the bad weather caused GDP growth to fall to zero. Since then a revival in retail sales and other services sectors has led GDP growth to pick up steadily in April and May. Construction output also picked up strongly in May after a couple of weak months. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a result, we estimate that growth in the second quarter will end up at around 0.4%, given signs from business surveys of continued forward momentum in services and construction in June. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This pick-up in growth could be enough to tip the majority of the MPC towards a rate rise in August, though this is not yet a done deal given continuing uncertainties over Brexit and rising global trade tensions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ONS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of national accounts, Rob Kent-Smith, says shopping and coding helped to drive growth in recent months. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The first of our new rolling estimates of GDP shows a mixed picture of the UK economy with modest growth driven by the services sector, partly offset by falling construction and industrial output. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Retailing, computer programming and legal services all performed strongly in the three months to May while housebuilding and manufacturing both contracted. Services, in particular, grew robustly in May with retailers enjoying a double boost from the warm weather and the royal wedding. Construction also saw a return to growth after a weak couple of months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories and builders suffered a sharp contraction in the last three months, but the service sector grew. UK manufacturing sector contracted by 1.2% in the three months to May, according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report, thanks to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153weak exports\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Industrial production output (which includes energy and mining) dropped by 0.6% in the quarter. Construction growth decreased by 1.7% in the quarter, as some projects were suspended due to snowy and ice weather in March. But the services sector grew by 0.4% during the quarter - and enjoyed a strong May thanks to the better weather. So that all added up to growth of 0.2% in March-May, and 0.3% in May alone, up from zero growth in February-April, and 0.2% in April. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth report also shows that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy flatlined in February-April, before bouncing back in May. This chart shows how the UK economy fared in the last few months: Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.3% in May, as the economy strengthened from the winter slowdown. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up up 0.2% in April, and stagnation in March, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics. The ONS has also calculated that GDP only rose by 0.2% in the March-to-May quarter - matching the 0.2% growth recorded in the first quarter of 2018. More to follow! Financial news service RANsquawk are getting excited about today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures... Speaking of Brexit... Airbus has provided Theresa May with some valuable air support today. The Franco-German aircraft maker has welcomed the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit strategy, and urged Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron, and the top brass in Brussels to cut the PM some slack. Last night, CEO Tom Enders said the EU should take a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pragmatic and fair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd approach to Brexit (last week, he accused the UK of having \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno clue\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 about Brexit...) The City is calm as investors await this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s snapshot of the UK economy. The pound has inched up to $1.327 against the US dollar, and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.13 against the euro. Politics will have as much impact as economics on sterling right now, following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dramatic resignation. Investors are concerned about the Brexit negotiations, as Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management explains: The resignation of UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson led to a small market reaction \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unlike some other former UK ministers, international investors have heard of Johnson. The former foreign secretary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s notoriety owed perhaps more to a slapstick comedy style than to diplomatic skill. Sterling weakened a little [yesterday], then firmed. Investors are unlikely to be concerned about the quality of the UK government changing after the loss of Davis and Johnson. The focus is the implications for the interminably tedious EU exit process. Prime Minister May seems relatively secure for now. If the EU were to demand major concessions over the exit, that may undermine May and the government. In the media world, Sir Martin Sorrell has burst back following his shock departure from WPP earlier this year. Sorrell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new venture has bought Dutch firm MediaMonks for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300m (\u00c2\u00a3266m). I imagine he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be particularly pleased to have pipped WPP to the prize. WPP are less impressed, though, as my colleague Mark Sweney explains: Sorrell pursued the deal despite receiving a legal letter from WPP alleging that he was being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unlawful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and in breach of his confidentiality agreement on the basis that he looked at buying the digital ad production firm when he was still chief executive. Sorrell denies the allegations. More here: Tesco has announced that Charles Wilson is stepping down as chief executive of its UK and Ireland business following treatment for throat cancer. Wilson is the former boss of Booker and took on the role at Tesco when the supermarket chain bought the wholesaler for \u00c2\u00a33.7bn earlier this year. Tesco said that Wilson had been diagnosed with throat cancer following an operation to remove his tonsils in April and had undergone daily radiotherapy during May and June. Tesco told the City: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The good news is that Charles has responded very well to the treatment and all the signs are that the treatment has been successful.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The supermarket group added that given the nature of the illness and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the need for Charles to remain vigilant in his recuperation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it was making changes within its senior leadership team. Wilson will step down from the Tesco board but he will remain on the executive committee and will lead the Booker business, reporting to Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis. Jason Tarry, currently chief product officer, will become chief executive of Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK and Ireland business. Andrew Yaxley Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive of Ireland, will take over Tarry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role. All new roles will take effect from 16 July. Shares fell 1% after the changes were announced, making Tesco the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s change to reporting GDP each month is meant to provide UK policymakers with a better of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. James Scruton, the head of GDP data at the statistics body, said recently: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While this might seem like a small change, monthly GDP will mean higher-quality and quicker estimates of our changing economy, ensuring policymakers have the important information they need to take vital decisions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our preview of the GDP changes: Economist Simon French of Panmure Gordon also expects decent economic data today: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A blizzard of economic data is heading our way this morning, giving new insight into how the UK economy is faring. In a first for Britain, the Office for National Statistics will release a monthly GDP estimate. This is expected to show the economy grew by a healthy 0.3% in May alone. If so, that would show the economy is recovering from the winter slowdown (when growth was just 0.2% in January, February and March combined). We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also get a new rolling three-month growth estimate - covering March, April and May. That may actually be lower than the May figure, due to the impact of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBeast from the East\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. So, lots for the City to get excited by. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says a decent growth report could make an August interest rate rise more likely. UK GDP is expected to have increased at 0.3% month on month in May, with the 3-month average forecast to be 0.2%, reflecting the slower growth from the earlier months. Stronger data is expected to lift the pound, particularly a solid figure from the monthly GDP release, which could help boost the case at the BoE for a rate rise, when policy makers meet in 3 weeks time. James Smith of ING agrees (political tensions not-withstanding, of course): But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all! The Office for National Statistics is also publishing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade figures for May (likely to show a goods deficit of \u00c2\u00a312bn), and fresh industrial and manufacturing output data. Also coming up today Stock markets are looking calm as fears over a trade war recede (for the moment, anyway). The pound may be volatile, though, following the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson. Theresa May is trying to hold her government together in the face of Brexiteer anger over her plan for leaving the EU.

In contrast, the US S&amp;P 500 has so far fallen by much less. But China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction to the US tariffs could pose a far greater threat to the index in time.</p> <p>China has yet to announce exactly how it will respond to the US announcement. It could implement further tariffs on its goods imports from the US (it matched the duties on $34bn of goods imposed by the US last week).</p> <p>But it would not be able to fully match the scope of the US tariffs, since its goods imports from the US amounted to only $154bn last year. And it might be wary of imposing blanket tariffs, as some of the goods it imports from the US will be difficult to source elsewhere.</p> <p>China can respond by other means, though. It has been suggested that it could deliberately weaken the renminbi \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which fell by more than 0.6% against the dollar today. But while we forecast that the renminbi will fall a little further this year, we doubt that the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank will tolerate, or engineer, a steep fall in the currency. Our forecast for the end of the year is 6.80/$, compared to 6.67/$ now.</p> <p>Instead, we suspect that China will target US firms operating in China directly...The operations of the majority-owned foreign affiliates (MoFAs) of US multinational enterprises (MNEs) in China dwarf those of their Chinese counterparts in the US, measuring either by sales or employment. And the sales of US MoFAs in China exceeded $350bn in the most recent year for which we have data, which is similar in scale to the US trade deficit in goods with China. So there is considerable scope for China to retaliate by penalising these firms, for example via much more stringent regulatory checks or consumer boycotts.</p> <p>Despite falling today, US equities have generally proved surprisingly resilient to trade worries, while those in China have suffered considerably. But if China were to target US multinationals directly, then this might well change.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b461cc8e4b0f86cea7477f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-11T15:07:25.838Z\">4.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Heading into the close for European markets, IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief market analyst Chris Beauchamp says the trade tensions have made investors more selective:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> While stock markets remain in the red in Europe and the US, we are still seeing some buying, taking the likes of the Dow and the Nasdaq firmly off their overnight lows. It feels like we have been stuck in a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctrade wars on, trade wars off\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for months now, and last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headlines about fresh US taxes on imports from China certainly fitted this game plan.</p> <p>The big question for investors is whether their fear of the damage done by tariffs outweighs their expectations of further global growth. While we have seen the S&amp;P 500 knocked back once again from 2800, it remains within touching distance of this level. Perhaps trade wars are losing their ability to shock, or perhaps investors are more convinced after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minutes that the Fed does have their back if things really do turn ugly.</p> <p>One thing is for certain, and that is that trade wars have made investors more selective about which index to pick \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this afternoon sees a repeat of previous trade war-influenced sessions, as the small cap Russell 2000 outperforms its bigger brethren.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b461944e4b0f86cea747785\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-11T14:56:18.757Z\">3.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US crude stocks fell by a bigger than expected 12.6m barrels last week, the largest drop since September 2016, according to the Energy Information Administration.

The FTSE, meanwhile, was down 1.1%, just about keep above 7600 having crossed 7700 earlier in the week. </p> <p>While the indices remained resolutely in the red, the forex markets completely flattened out as Wednesday progressed.

But the big question going into this meeting was how policymakers would view the recent flare-up in trade tensions.</p> <p>Well, although the statement is littered with references to tariffs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd appears no less than six times \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the message appears to be one of cautious optimism. Interestingly, it expects the impact of the steel/aluminium tariffs to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153modest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and still expects growth to average around 2% over the next couple of years. It also remains fairly upbeat about investment, despite trade concerns weighing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in some sectors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>So with most core inflation measures now back around 2%, we suspect the Bank of Canada could strike again later this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear this is highly contingent on Nafta talks. Negotiations have noticeably stalled over the past month-or-so and it looks like talks could stretch beyond the US mid-term elections in November. This would mean a more prolonged period of uncertainty for Canadian firms. But on the flip-side, as long as the actual trade situation remains unchanged, Canada will continue to reap the rewards of an exceptionally strong US economy.</p> <p>At this stage, we are forecasting another rate hike in the fourth quarter, although any breakdown in Nafta talks, or implementation of further tariffs, could easily change that.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b4611e8e4b0f86cea747709\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-11T14:21:46.270Z\">3.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back in the US, and further signs of inflation even before the tariff effect.</p> <p>Producer prices rose by 3.4% year on year, compared to expectations of a 3.2% increase. Bart Hordijk, market analyst at Monex Europe,said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US Producer Price Index has moved up 3.4% on a 12-month basis, the steepest growth since November 2011, beating expectations for the second month in a row.</p> <p>As the most recent report concerns June, the impacts of the steel and aluminium tariffs that recently came into effect are still hard to discern. Increases in prices for services, for example, contributed the most to the higher than expected price growth, not a rise in prices in goods, as might be expected if companies were hoarding inputs <em>en masse</em> as they await the broadly announced tariffs to come into effect.</p> <p>We know that when producers are forced to switch from cheap foreign inputs to more expensive domestic inputs, or face added tariffs to what they import, that prices paid for inputs are bound to increase. With producer prices already increasing at a multi-year record high pace, tariff induced inflation will only push producer inflation further into record territory. As producers need to pass the higher prices on to consumers, given that lowering margins is not always possible, then consumer prices may receive an extra boost from the side of producers.</p> <p>Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PPI numbers thus indicate risks of an upward trajectory for the Consumer Price Index.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b460ec2e4b01745341497e5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-11T14:12:09.612Z\">3.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bank of Canada raises interest rates</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over in Canada, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has raised interest rates and warned of more to come.</p> <p>The Bank of Canada <a href=\"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2018/07/fad-press-release-2018-07-11/\">lifted its overnight rate target from 1.25% to 1.5%,</a> as analysts had been expecting.

                "bodyText":"News that the Trump administration has threatened to slap tariffs on another $200bn of imports from China has sent a shudder through global stock markets, which were beginning to take a lack of developments on the trade war front as a positive sign. With China expected to respond - but uncertainty over how it will do so - investors decided it was a day to sell out. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 100.08 points or 1.3% lower at 7591.96 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.53% to 12,417.13 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 1.48% down at 5353.93 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.58% to 21,708.06 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended off 1.57% 9733.6 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 174 points or 0.7%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow, barring any major new developments later. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest tariff threat could hit the US stock market even hard, especially if it targets American companies operating in China, says Oliver Jones at Capital Economics: Chinese equities were amongst the worst performers today, with the Shanghai Composite dropping 1.8% after the US Trade Representative set out the $200bn of Chinese imports on which it intends to impose a 10% tariff. In contrast, the US S&amp;P 500 has so far fallen by much less. But China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction to the US tariffs could pose a far greater threat to the index in time. China has yet to announce exactly how it will respond to the US announcement. It could implement further tariffs on its goods imports from the US (it matched the duties on $34bn of goods imposed by the US last week). But it would not be able to fully match the scope of the US tariffs, since its goods imports from the US amounted to only $154bn last year. And it might be wary of imposing blanket tariffs, as some of the goods it imports from the US will be difficult to source elsewhere. China can respond by other means, though. It has been suggested that it could deliberately weaken the renminbi \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which fell by more than 0.6% against the dollar today. But while we forecast that the renminbi will fall a little further this year, we doubt that the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank will tolerate, or engineer, a steep fall in the currency. Our forecast for the end of the year is 6.80/$, compared to 6.67/$ now. Instead, we suspect that China will target US firms operating in China directly...The operations of the majority-owned foreign affiliates (MoFAs) of US multinational enterprises (MNEs) in China dwarf those of their Chinese counterparts in the US, measuring either by sales or employment. And the sales of US MoFAs in China exceeded $350bn in the most recent year for which we have data, which is similar in scale to the US trade deficit in goods with China. So there is considerable scope for China to retaliate by penalising these firms, for example via much more stringent regulatory checks or consumer boycotts. Despite falling today, US equities have generally proved surprisingly resilient to trade worries, while those in China have suffered considerably. But if China were to target US multinationals directly, then this might well change. Heading into the close for European markets, IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief market analyst Chris Beauchamp says the trade tensions have made investors more selective: While stock markets remain in the red in Europe and the US, we are still seeing some buying, taking the likes of the Dow and the Nasdaq firmly off their overnight lows. It feels like we have been stuck in a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctrade wars on, trade wars off\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for months now, and last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headlines about fresh US taxes on imports from China certainly fitted this game plan. The big question for investors is whether their fear of the damage done by tariffs outweighs their expectations of further global growth. While we have seen the S&amp;P 500 knocked back once again from 2800, it remains within touching distance of this level. Perhaps trade wars are losing their ability to shock, or perhaps investors are more convinced after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minutes that the Fed does have their back if things really do turn ugly. One thing is for certain, and that is that trade wars have made investors more selective about which index to pick \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this afternoon sees a repeat of previous trade war-influenced sessions, as the small cap Russell 2000 outperforms its bigger brethren. US crude stocks fell by a bigger than expected 12.6m barrels last week, the largest drop since September 2016, according to the Energy Information Administration. Analysts had been expecting a fall of 4.5m barrels. Gasoline stocks dropped by 694,000 barrels, compared to forecasts of a 750,000 barrel decline. But with Opec forecasting a fall in demand for its crude next year, down by 760,000 barrels a day to 32.18m, oil prices remained under pressure. Already hit by the prospect of a trade tariff impact, Brent crude is down 2.3% at $76.98 a barrel. Markets are still in the red, but the outlook is really dependent on how China actually responds to the new US threat of tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: It was one of those days defined by one single, market-shaking event, the kind that actually end up being quite boring because of the rigidity of trading. All that is to say little changed as Wednesday went on, Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threats to $200 million of Chinese imports keeping the markets a state of fear throughout the session. And while the Dow Jones didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fall quite as sharply as promised by its futures, the index still plunged 0.6% after the bell, taking it back below 24800 having hit 3 week peak on Tuesday. The day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses were actually far worse in Europe. The DAX, perhaps spooked by the sniping between Trump and Angela Merkel, was the worst hit, the German index dropping 1.4%, with the CAC not too far behind with a 1.3% decline. The FTSE, meanwhile, was down 1.1%, just about keep above 7600 having crossed 7700 earlier in the week. While the indices remained resolutely in the red, the forex markets completely flattened out as Wednesday progressed. The dollar, previously in the green as investors looked for a safe haven, shed its growth, reverting back to its starting positions against the pound and the euro. Heading into Thursday and investors will be on high alert for a Chinese response, with any potential Beijing retaliation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or, equally, a lack of reaction \u00e2\u20ac\u201c likely to be what drives trading in the second half of the week. Commenting on the Canadian rate rise, ING economist James Smith says: As was largely expected, the Bank of Canada resumed its tightening cycle on Wednesday with its first rate hike since January. But the big question going into this meeting was how policymakers would view the recent flare-up in trade tensions. Well, although the statement is littered with references to tariffs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd appears no less than six times \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the message appears to be one of cautious optimism. Interestingly, it expects the impact of the steel/aluminium tariffs to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153modest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and still expects growth to average around 2% over the next couple of years. It also remains fairly upbeat about investment, despite trade concerns weighing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in some sectors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So with most core inflation measures now back around 2%, we suspect the Bank of Canada could strike again later this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear this is highly contingent on Nafta talks. Negotiations have noticeably stalled over the past month-or-so and it looks like talks could stretch beyond the US mid-term elections in November. This would mean a more prolonged period of uncertainty for Canadian firms. But on the flip-side, as long as the actual trade situation remains unchanged, Canada will continue to reap the rewards of an exceptionally strong US economy. At this stage, we are forecasting another rate hike in the fourth quarter, although any breakdown in Nafta talks, or implementation of further tariffs, could easily change that. Back in the US, and further signs of inflation even before the tariff effect. Producer prices rose by 3.4% year on year, compared to expectations of a 3.2% increase. Bart Hordijk, market analyst at Monex Europe,said: The US Producer Price Index has moved up 3.4% on a 12-month basis, the steepest growth since November 2011, beating expectations for the second month in a row. As the most recent report concerns June, the impacts of the steel and aluminium tariffs that recently came into effect are still hard to discern. Increases in prices for services, for example, contributed the most to the higher than expected price growth, not a rise in prices in goods, as might be expected if companies were hoarding inputs en masse as they await the broadly announced tariffs to come into effect. We know that when producers are forced to switch from cheap foreign inputs to more expensive domestic inputs, or face added tariffs to what they import, that prices paid for inputs are bound to increase. With producer prices already increasing at a multi-year record high pace, tariff induced inflation will only push producer inflation further into record territory. As producers need to pass the higher prices on to consumers, given that lowering margins is not always possible, then consumer prices may receive an extra boost from the side of producers. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PPI numbers thus indicate risks of an upward trajectory for the Consumer Price Index. Over in Canada, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has raised interest rates and warned of more to come. The Bank of Canada lifted its overnight rate target from 1.25% to 1.5%, as analysts had been expecting. It said further gradual rises would be justified, but warned that increasing trade tensions could have a bigger than expected impact on investment and exports: The possibility of more trade protectionism is the most important threat to global prospects. It added: The July projection also incorporates the estimated impact of tariffs on steel and aluminum recently imposed by the United States, as well as the countermeasures enacted by Canada. Although there will be difficult adjustments for some industries and their workers, the effect of these measures on Canadian growth and inflation is expected to be modest. With the escalating trade tensions thanks to the threatened new round of Trump tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports, it is no surprise that Wall Street has followed other global markets lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 140 points or 0.56%. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.5% lower and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.78%. Donald Trump may be at the Nato meeting, but he is still preoccupied with tariffs: The escalation of the trade dispute could cause a chain reaction of negative events around the world, says Nigel Green, chief executive of financial advisory group deVere: It is going to lead to higher inflation in the US, as import tariffs raise the cost of imported goods while domestic producers find that they can increase their prices as foreign competition weakens. This means interest rates will be hiked and the dollar will go up. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheap goods have helped keep prices, and therefore US and global inflation, low. To counteract increasing inflation, the US Federal Reserve is even more likely to raise interest rates. A jump in rates will, of course, strengthen the dollar. A stronger dollar also increases stress in emerging markets, many of which have borrowed heavily in recent years in dollars and who now find interest and capital repayments on these loans have shot up in local currency terms. In addition, emerging markets are particularly vulnerable to a downturn in exports resulting from a rise in quotas and import by the US, given that exports are a key driver of growth for many under-developed countries with China the most obvious example. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war is a masterclass in self harm for the US and global economy. China could retaliate against Donald Trump by launching a currency war, and allowing the yuan to weaken, argues Tom Milson, executive director at GWM Investment Management. This would allow China to overcome being unable to impose retaliatory tariffs as it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t import $200bn from the US each year (as explained earlier). Milson explains: The issue China has is that is unable to match the US in the value of imports it applies tariffs to, as the US imports more Chinese goods and services than the Chinese import from the US. China will therefore have to be creative and could retaliate by using its currency to strengthen the value of US dollar, thereby pushing up borrowing costs in the US and making Chinese goods cheaper. It could also put in place measures that will make things difficult for US businesses such as increased regulations. The US stock markets is expected to fall when trading begins, following the losses in Europe and Asia. The Dow Jones industrial average is being called down 170 points, or 0.7%, at 24,750. Artjom Hatsaturjants, research analyst at Accendo Markets, says Wall Street is fretting about Donald Trump (who is currently attending the NATO summit in Brussels). After several days of calm, investors are back worrying about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest threat, which would target $200bn of Chinese goods with 10% import duty. This latest effort to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccorrect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the Sino-US trade imbalance would take him half-way to his avowed $500bn \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnuclear option\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, targeting all Chinese exports to the US. His aggressive opener at NATO could also tee us up for a volatile rest of the week in Europe. Economic growth in China and the US would suffer if Donald Trump imposes tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports, on top of the $34bn of reciprical tariffs already implemented. Louis Kuijs, head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics, estimates that around 0.25 percentage points could be knocked off China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate next year, with more damage in 2019. The US would also take a (smaller) hit, Kuijs estimates. Kuijs also warns that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153further escalation seems unavoidable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, unless Beijing and Washington can negotiate and dial down the situation. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that criticism from US politicians could persuade Trump to step back, he adde. Obviously, China cannot continue to retaliate with a proportionate response, given that its imports from the US are much lower than its exports to the country. But the new US tariffs are not a done deal either. Although the Trump administration seems quite determined to take further steps, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaders must still hope that low domestic support for a trade war in the US could delay and/or reduce the scale of further actions from the US. Indeed, the latest actions quickly drew criticism at home, including from Orrin Hatch, the Republic chairman of the Senate finance committee. Tomorrow Donald Trump arrives in the UK for a controversial visit that will be marked by protests in London, and a swanky dinner at Blenheim Palace. Some of the great and the good of British business will be there....but it appears entrepreneur Sir Alan Sugar won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be wielding a fish knife in Woodstock tomorrow. My colleague Rob Davies asked Lord Sugar to check his diary.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear whether Sir Alan has nobly declined to meet the US president as a matter of principle, or simply been missed off the guest list altogether. Either way, it means the two hosts of The Apprentice won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to swop anecdotes about boardroom bloodletting. It might be for the best, though. Back in 2012, Sugar and Trump clashed over plans to build wind turbines in Scotland, leading to this unedifying exchange: Perhaps we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d better not let them get too close to sharp implements, and each other... Newsflash: The Chinese yuan is weakening, as anxiety over the trade war builds. The yuan fell through the 6.7 mark against the US dollar in offshore trading, down from 6.65 yuan to the US dollar last night. The 6.7 point is seen as an important psychological point for the yuan against the US dollar -- previously, the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China has intervened to prevent the currency weakening beyond this point. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just badger hair on the list! The FT have spotted that human hair imported from China to the US could soon face a 10% tariff. Live eels, feathers and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbeaver heads, tails and paws\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 are also among the thousands of products facing new levies. Donald Trump is taking the trade dispute with China to the dangerous point where neither side can back down, argues Bloomberg. They say that the new tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports outlined overnight could force Beijing to escalate the dispute (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s either that or a humiliating surrender), which could have dangerous consequences. China has seven weeks to make a deal or dig in and try to outlast the U.S. leader. President Xi Jinping, facing his own political pressures to look tough, has vowed to respond blow-for-blow. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already imposed retaliatory duties targeting Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s base including Iowa soybeans and Kentucky bourbon. Yet matching the latest U.S. barrage would force China to either levy much higher tariffs or take more disruptive steps like canceling purchase orders, encouraging consumer boycotts and putting up regulatory hurdles. Not only does that risk provoking Trump to follow through on threats to tax virtually all Chinese products, it could unleash nationalist sentiment on both sides that fuels a deeper struggle for geopolitical dominance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already past the point of no return,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Pauline Loong, managing director at research firm Asia-Analytica in Hong Kong. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next is not so much a trade war or even a cold war as the dawn of an ice age in relations between China and the United States.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The trade war is coming to American bathrooms. Personal deodorants, antiperspirants, bath salts, shampoos, eye and lip make-up, soap and manicure preparations are all on the new list released by the US Trade Representative last night. So unless America backs down, these products will be around 10% more expensive this autumn. Manure spreaders, shark fins, cod-liver oil, baseball mitts and bicycle speedometers are all also on the list of Chinese goods facing 10% tariffs. So, weirdly, are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153footwear of asbestos\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd..... David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, sums up the situation: Stock markets in Europe are firmly in the red as President Trump outlined plans to impose a fresh round of tariffs on China. The US president has lined up tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods as a way of showing Beijing he means business. There will be a two month review process, and a hearing in late August. The threat of another round of tariffs has rattled investors, just as market confidence was picking up. China will have to think creatively when it hits back against America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs. Beijing cannot simply simply slap a reciprocal 10% tariffs on $200bn US goods, because it actually only imported $150bn of goods from America last year. This chart shows: In theory, Beijing could impose a higher tariff, to create the same economic impact. Or it could target the services sector - where America ran a surplus with China. But if China does retaliate again, then Donald Trump could hit back with further tariffs. America imported around $500bn of stuff from China last year - giving Trump another $250bn of ammunition. America could suffer economic damage if these new tariffs are imposed in September, says Cailin Birch, global analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. He explains: The proposed list of $200bn worth of goods includes a number of industrial inputs and components that would squeeze US companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 supply chains and ultimately raise consumer prices. And this, at a time when US exporters (particularly of agricultural products and manufactured goods including clothing and machinery) will be suffering from weaker external competitiveness, as a result of the tariffs imposed by China--as well as the by EU, Canada and Mexico, as part of a related dispute. In some areas, China will continue to rely on (now more costly) US imports, including soybeans, which will raise inflationary pressures in China. In others areas, however, China will eventually divert its trade flows and source these goods from elsewhere. Russ Mould, investment director at stock brokers AJ Bell, says investors are scrambling to put their money into safe assets toda: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Plans by the US for an additional $200bn of tariffs on Chinese goods has caused investors to lose their appetite for risk and seek solace in more defensive sectors such as consumer goods and utilities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European stock markets are not a pretty picture this morning, as trade war worries hit stocks. In London the FTSE 100 is now down by 105 points, or 1.3%. The Stoxx 600, which tracks the biggest companies in Europe, is down 1%. Mining companies are among the top fallers in the City, dragged down by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble in commodity prices. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to kick off the process of imposing tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods has clearly hit confidence. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, explains: Things were going so well. After four days of straight increases in US stock markets, mainly prompted by the looming earnings season which is expected to show a very respectable growth of about 20% this quarter for the S&amp;P 500, stock markets in Asia, Europe, the US and most of the major commodities were plunged into red this morning, courtesy of the latest US trade tariff decision.... In commodities the board was also almost uniformly red with declines in Brent Crude, gas, precious metals and wheat prices. Worse hit was copper, trading down 3.2% on the day. With China being the single biggest global buyer of base metals, frequently accounting for about half of global trade in the likes of copper, aluminium, nickel and zinc, investors were spooked by the intensifying trade tit-for-tat. Not only will this be negative for China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demand for metals but will also affect FTSE heavyweights such as Rio Tinto, Glencore and BHP Billiton and a whole host of medium sized and smaller metals producers. America is now conducting a two-month consultation on these proposed tariffs, meaning they could be imposed in September. Paul Donovan of UBS points out that tariffs are actually an additional sales tax, as they make imports more expensive. He says: President Trump once again prepared to lower the yoke of additional taxation onto the shoulders of US consumers. Commodity prices are being hit hard today, with zinc dropping by 6% in Shanghai and copper down around 3.5%. Traders are worried that these new tariffs will dent demand for metals, especially if Chinese growth is hit. The list of Chinese goods facing new 10% tariffs at the US border is long and varied. Thousands of individual products are being targeted. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just speed-read the list, here are some highlights: Meat, such as frozen swine and frogs legs Fish, including live trout, tuna, turbot, Vegetables, such as butter, onions, garlic, fruits and nuts Drinks such as malt beer, orange juice, rice wine Various tobacco products, including cigarettes and cigars Building products such as gypsum and sandstone Commodities including copper, nickel, lead and tin ores Chemicals such as Chlorine, argon, oxygen, barium and mercury Industrial products, such as metals, tires, leather, fabrics, wood and papers. Consumer products such as electric lamps, mattresses, furniture, and camera equipment Electronic kit such as TV components More unusual products on the list include Badger hair for brushmaking Bovine semen Dog and cat food. Antiques at least one hundred years old Postage stamps You can read the full list here Our Beijing correspondent, Lily Kuo, reports that China has heavily criticised America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move. She writes: In Beijing, Li Chenggang, assistant minister at the ministry, said at a forum in Beijing that the latest US proposals interfered with the globalisation of the world economy and that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support for a multilateral trade system would not change. An English-language editorial in the state-run China Daily that has now been taken down said, without mentioning the new tariffs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China has no option but to fight fire with fire. It has to resolutely fight back while taking proper measures to help minimise the cost to domestic enterprises and further open up its economy to global investors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Another editorial in China Daily said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If Trump launches an all-out trade war, the US economy and society may not be able to withstand the impact of countermeasures from China and other economies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Duncan Innes-Ker of the Economist Intelligence Unit points out that America is now targeting low-value manufacturing goods. This could drive production out of China, perhaps to Vietnam and Mexico. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new planned tariffs could have a serious impact on China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories. China exports around $500bn of goods to the US each year. If these latest tariffs go through, then around half those goods will arrive with additional levies slapped on them. That could hurt demand for Chinese goods in America, creating damage in China and beyond. As Zhu Huani of Mizuho Bank put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given the magnitude and breadth of the tariff list, the impact is expected to ripple through supply chains and cause collateral damage on regional economies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index has fallen 60 points, or 0.8%, to 7630 in early trading. Other European markets are also in the red, as trade war fears ripple across the trading floors again. The Chinese stock market slumped by over 2% after America announced it was targeting another $200bn of imports. The CSI 300 shed 77 points to 3,390, back towards the 18-month low struck last week. Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADSS, says there is shock at Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest move. This new $200 billion salvo would be a considerable step up in the trade spat between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strongest economies and the odds of this dispute taking a toll on global growth are now mounting. The European and US futures are reflecting investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 nervousness and the gains seen this week are now under threat Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global markets are rattled this morning after America escalated the deepening trade war between the two countries. Overnight, Donald Trump began the process of slapping 10% tariffs on a further $200bn of imports from China, on top of the $34bn (soon to be $50bn) imposed last week. The move is a significant escalation of the trade war between Washington and Beijing, further raising the dangers of a major economic shock. US trade representative Robert Lighthizer announced that the US was acting because China had not heeded previous warnings. For more than a year, the Trump administration has patiently urged China to stop its unfair practices, open its market, and engage in true market competition. We have been very clear and detailed regarding the specific changes China should undertake. Unfortunately, China has not changed its behaviour \u00e2\u20ac\u201d behaviour that puts the future of the US economy at risk.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The list of products facing tariffs is long and varied -- everything from vacuum cleaners and TV components to bricks, tires and badger hair for shaving brushes (!) (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull together a longer list ASAP). The move has been swiftly and heavily criticised by China, which said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153totally unacceptable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for America to keep escalating the trade dispute. Investors have also reacted badly, with shares and emerging market currencies falling overnight. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.1 %, while Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei dropped by 1.1%. European stock markets are expected to follow Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead, as economics warn that a trade war would cause serious economic harm.

                "bodyText":"Fitch could also downgrade some US companies if they are hurt by the trade dispute with China. It already has a negative outlook on the Alabama State Port Authority, due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncertainty over trade policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and the likely impact on revenues. Fitch explains: The largest portion of the port\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade value with China is made up of wood pulp and other agricultural products, but it is also exposed more broadly to the metallurgical coal and steel markets. The port has relatively high exposure to commodities, particularly coal and steel, which comprise over 50% of revenues and nearly 50% of overall tonnage. Ratings agency Fitch has identified the US states most vulnerable to a trade war with China. Fitch says that Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and Indiana all exported more than $1.2bn of plant products, such as soybeans, to China in 2016. However, plant-based exports to China made up a bigger percentage of the state economies of South Dakota, North Dakota, Iowa and Nebraska. Fitch explains: Exports to China make up more than 20% of the total agricultural output in both South and North Dakota and in excess of 10% in Iowa and Nebraska. While Illinois is the largest producer of soybeans in the US, the state is likely to be less affected by a fall in demand for US soybeans due to its more diversified, larger economy. Total plant product exports to China as a percentage of the economy of Illinois was less than 1% 2016. Global stock markets are recovering from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff, despite anxiety over a US-China trade war. In London, the FTSE 100 is up 50 points, or 0.66%, at 7642. The French CAC is 0.7% higher while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has gained 0.3%. That follows a stronger day in China, where the Shanghai market clawed back yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. This positive mood has extended to Wall Street, where the Dow has jumped over 100 points in early trading. Artjom Hatsaturjants, Research Analyst at Accendo Markets says: The FTSE has staged a strong rebound, retracing nearly all of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off. All the while Donald Trump continues to play the disruptive \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 amongst the rest of NATO \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpigeon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 allies. Sentiment improved despite continued uncertainty on whether US and China still have each other in trade cross-hairs, or if negotiators are ready to sit down again. US washing machine prices have surged by over 13% in the last year, in another sign that protectionism can drive up the cost of living. Donald Trump imposed new tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels in January, saying he wanted to protect US jobs. But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report shows that the move has hit shoppers in the pocket. Core US inflation (stripping out volatile factors) also rose last month, from 2.2% to 2.3%. Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics predicts it will keep rising, especially if new levies are imposed on Chinese imports (as tariffs are paid by consumers, not producers). with the labour market exceptionally tight and activity expanding strongly, we think that core inflation has further to rise. The prospect of further tariffs on Chinese imports will only add to that upward pressure. The US economy is heating up, says James Knightley of ING, and that makes future interest rate rises more likely. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on the jump in American inflation to 2.9% last month. The US has an economy that probably grew 4% in the second quarter, has an inflation rate rapidly heading to 3% at the same time as arguably experiencing the strongest labour market for 50 years. This suggests that even with the uncertainty generated by trade protectionism the Federal Reserve should continue tightening monetary policy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gradually\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This is certainly the line that we expect the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s semi-annual monetary policy report to take on Friday. We continue to look for two further rate rises this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one in 3Q and one in 4Q18. The jump in US inflation to 2.9% means that American real wages are falling. Average earnings only rose by 2.7% in June, last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report showed. That means that pay isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keeping pace with rising prices. Economist Joseph Brusuelas thinks a trade war would make that situation even worse: Newsflash: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has struck a six-year high, as US citizens are hit by higher prices in the shops. The US Consumer Price Index rose by 2.9% in June, compared to a year earlier. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s te highest rate since 2012. On a monthly basis, prices rose by just 0.1% compared to May, compared to 0.2% a month ago. Fuel prices rose by 0.2% in June, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says, driven by pricier dairy, cereal, fruit and vegetable products Gasoline prices rose by 0.5%, and housing costs were 0.1% higher. The tariffs outlined by America yesterday would push up the cost of many food products and consumer goods from China, potentially pushing inflation up. The European Central Bank is worried that the increase in trade protectionism in recent months is hurting the European economy. The minutes of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last meeting, just released, show that policymakers believe that trade tensions have become a greater threat,. They cite Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium from Europe, and the threat of tariffs on car imports. The minutes say: While the expected upward impact of fiscal stimulus in the United States remained in place, geopolitical risks had not abated and trade tensions were considered to have become more likely. In particular, concerns were expressed about the possibility that such tensions could lead to a more general decline in confidence throughout the global economy, beyond any direct effects from the imposition of tariffs. Against this background, the balance of risks to the global economic expansion continued to be assessed as tilted to the downside. The ECB points out that a trade war can affect the economy in various ways. 1) Tariffs and trade barriers can drive up prices, fuelling inflation 2) Protection leads to falling exports, which hurts economic confidence and weakens demand. The ECB adds: In this context, risks associated with heightened volatility in global financial markets were also highlighted more broadly. Newsflash: The UK government has given Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox the green light for its attempted takeover of Sky. This clears the way for a proper takeover battle between 21CF (which raised its offer to \u00c2\u00a314 per Sky share yesterday) and US media group Comcast (which hit back with a \u00c2\u00a314.75 per share bid last night). Sky shares have risen today, to \u00c2\u00a315.37 each, showing that the City expects another bid.... Valdis Dombrovskis, Vice-President for the Euro, says Europe needs to protect itself against the threat of a global trade war: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153European economic activity remains solid with 2.1% GDP growth forecast for the euro area and the EU28 this year. Nevertheless, the downward revision of GDP growth since May shows that an unfavourable external environment, such as growing trade tensions with the US, can dampen confidence and take a toll on economic expansion. The growing external risks are yet another reminder of the need to strengthen the resilience of our individual economies and the euro area as a whole.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: The European Commission has cut its growth forecast for Europe this year, and blamed the rising threat of a trade war. The EC now expects the eurozone and the EU to both only grow by 2.1% this year, down from 2.3% predicted three months ago. It reckons that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic momentum has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moderated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after more than a year of strong growth. It has slashed its forecast for German growth to 1.9% in 2018 (down from 2.3%) and also 1.9% in 2019 (down from 2.1%). Britain is now expected to only grow by 1.3% this year (down from 1.5% in the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spring forecasts) and by 1.2% in 2019 (unchanged). That would make the UK the joint-slowest growing EU economy this year, along with Italy. Pierre Moscovici, Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs, says the threat of a trade war is hurting Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Growth in Europe is set to remain resilient, as monetary policies stay accommodative and unemployment continues to fall. The slight downward revision compared to the spring reflects the impact on confidence of trade tensions and policy uncertainty, as well as rising energy prices. Our forecast is for a continued expansion in 2018 and 2019, although a further escalation of protectionist measures is a clear downside risk. Trade wars produce no winners, only casualties.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in Beijing, China has hit out at America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose tariffs on $200bn of its goods -- and called on US companies to help. The Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng warned that the escalating trade dispute between the two countries would hurt the global economy, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China resolutely opposes such behaviour and will have to take the necessary countermeasures. However, we still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know exactly how China plans to hit back (as it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t import enough from America to simply impose reciprocal tariffs). Gao suggested that US firms with operations in China could put pressure on the White House to change course. He cited industrial group GE, Qualcomm and carmakers Ford, BMW and Tesla as examples of companies who have recently increased production capacity in China. Trade war fears have forced South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank to cut its growth forecast today. The Bank of Korea has trimmed its growth outlook for South Korea to 2.9%, from 3%. Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol told reporters that the tit-for-tat tariffs imposed between America and other nations are a serious concern. He added that South Korean exports could be hit (echoing the trade ministry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier warning). Ju-yeol said (via Associated Press): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Uncertainties in growth path are higher than ever and the major source of the uncertainties is global trade conflicts. At first we thought the trade conflicts among major economies would not grow further, but as they deepen day by day, now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very difficult to tell where they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re headed to.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at Yale University, also thinks America will lose out if it keeps slapping tariffs on Chinese imports. He told CNBC this morning that trade wars are not easy to win (something Donald Trump claimed earlier this year). They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re easy to lose, and the U.S. is on track to lose this trade war. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is live ammunition. This is not just rhetorical discussion any more,. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the early stages of fighting skirmishes in a real, live trade war. The question is, how far does it go? And how significant will the ammunition be in the future?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wayne McCurrie of South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s First National Bank fears that global growth will be damaged if the US-China trade dispute keeps escalating. Tom Rafferty of the Economist Intelligence Unit points out that China could cushion the blow of tariffs if it allows its currency to weaken. Naeem Aslam of City firm Think Markets expects Beijing to retaliate soon: Trump is serious about punishing China, he is picking up the areas where it would hurt the most. Although, market participants still aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t factoring in a full trade war. The hope is that China and US would be able to resolve this matter through bilateral agreement. But uncertainty around this matter has anchored up. The sad aspect is none of the parties are ready to throw in the towel yet which makes me think that there is no resolution in insight yet. Beijing has threatened for retaliation action against the current measures. Therefore, over the coming days, I would expect a tit-for-tat reaction from China-unless the bilateral discussions resume between the two parties. The alarming area is if China chooses to go after the multinational companies which are operating in China. Certainly, that is the area where it would create more wounds. We think that the odds are high that China would specifically pick on US firms or at least it would shift the grounds in such a way that other foreign firms would have more privileges being in China on relative perspective. After all, China isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to sit on its hand and see its GDP dragging lower by another 0.2% if the new tariffs become effective. The car industry is also worried by America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s belligerent stance on trade. The labour union of South Korean manufacturer Hyundai warned that tens of thousands of US jobs could be lost if China and the US don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t step back from a trade war. Hyundai employs around 20,000 workers at a factory in Alabama, and also operates plants in China, India, Russia, Turkey, Brazil, and the Czech Republic, as well as in South Korea. In a statement, the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s union warned that overseas factory could be the first to close if sales are hit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If South Korean car exports to the U.S. get blocked and hurt sales, the U.S. factory in Alabama that went into operation in May 2005 could be the first one to be shut down, putting some 20,000 American workers at risk of layoffs. The South Korean trade ministry is worried that demand for its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcintermediary goods\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will be hurt, if America imposes tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods. These are products which are assembled to create a final product (for example, memory chips and hard drives used to build a computer). The ministry explained: As Chinese electronics, computers and communications equipment were included in the additional list of tariffs, Korean companies are worried their exports of intermediary goods used in those items could decrease if the tariffs are imposed. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. City traders will be trudging wearily to their desks this morning after last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gripping World Cup drama, and worrying about the impact of a US-China trade war. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose tariffs on an extra $200bn of Chinese imports is causing rising anxiety. South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government has weighed in this morning, warning that its exports could be hurt by the escalating dispute between Washington and Beijing. South Korea is a major producer of technological products -- such as components used in electrical devices, computers and mobile phones. It fears that demand for these exports could slide if the global trade systems gums up. Deputy Minister for Trade Kang Sung-chun told Reuters that Seoul is watching the situation closely: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have detailed analysis (on which products will be affected by the U.S.-China trade war),\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The impact will be mixed. There will be both positive and negative effects. Some Korean exports could replace Chinese goods to be slapped with tariffs, for example. Global stock markets fell heavily yesterday after the US Trade Representative outlined plans for a 10% tariff on other 6,000 individual Chinese imports (everything from meat and vegetables to stamps and baseball mitts). The FTSE 100 lost 1.3%, or 100 points, while the Dow Jones industrial average ended down 219 points or 0.9%. Shares are rising a little this morning, but any fresh retaliations between the two sides could undermine the rally. Also coming up today The pound could be lively as the UK government publishes its eagerly-awaited Brexit white paper, outlining its preferred future relationship with the EU.

                "bodyText":"Markets are ending the week on a - marginally - positive note. Earlier this week, news of further tariffs to be imposed by the US on Chinese imports had left shares floundering, but there was a minor recovery today, mainly due to the lack of any further developments. But the pound wobbled after President Trump told the Sun that there would be no US-UK trade deal because of Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit policy. Sterling came off its worst levels as the president seemed to backtrack slightly at this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference with the UK prime minister. It is currently down 0.2% at $1.3171, having earlier fallen as low as $1.3104. The weaker pound has helped support the FTSE 100, with its large number of overseas earners. The UK index is up 0.22% at 7668, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has risen 0.48% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.44%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now virtually flat. Earlier China reported a record trade surplus with the US, which will not help dissuade Trump from his current trade policy. And Bank of England deputy governor John Cunliffe cautioned against raising UK interest rates too quickly. On that note, it is time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. The lack of any new trade tensions between the US and China is giving some support to Wall Street, but mixed results from three big banks have limited the gains. JP Morgan Chase beat expectations, but Wells Fargo disappointed and Citigroup shares were under pressure despite the bank reporting better than forecast profits. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 20 points or 0.06%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.05%. The Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.05%. The pound has recovered some ground as President Trump and Theresa May give their joint press conference, with Trump seeming to backtrack on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no-trade deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rhetoric of earlier. Sterling, having fallen as low as $1.3104 against the dollar, is now down 0.3% at $1.3162. Goldman Sachs economists have said there is a 60% chance that the US would go ahead with the extra $200bn tariffs on Chinese goods announced this week. They said: While very uncertain, we would expect the tariffs could be imposed as soon as late September but possibly not until after the election. (The mid-term elections take place in November.) Bank of England deputy governor Jon Cunliffe said there was a case for caution in raising interest rates. Speaking in Kendal, he quoted advice given in 1999 by US economist Alan Blinder, who said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In my view both as a citizen and as a policymaker, a little stodginess at the central bank is entirely appropriate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cunliffe, who voted against the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last rate rise in November said the UK economy appeared to be growing as fast as predicted in May, but wages did not seem to be growing at the expected 3% annual rate. He concluded: Looking to the medium term, there remains a case for a little \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstodginess\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 yet. JP Morgan Chase has turned in better than expected results, as Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earning season kicks off. The bank reported second quarter income of $8.32bn, up from $7.03bn this time last year, helped by higher than forecast trading revenue and increased demand for loans. Cuts in corporate tax rates and a growing economy has driven demand from borrowers, while the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading business benefited from increased volatility thanks to the current trade tensions. Chief executive Jamie Dimon said: We see good global economic growth, particularly in the US where consumer and business sentiment is high. Wall Street is expected to open marginally lower after Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which closed up 224 points or 0.9%, is forecast to dip by around 10 points at the open, according to IG. President Trump has said the relationship between the US and the UK is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very, very strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - despite his earlier comments to the Sun. Speaking to reporters at Chequers ahead of talks with Theresa May, he said they would be talking about trade among other things. But given he seemed to rule out a trade deal between the two countries because of May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit strategy, it remains to be seen how this turns out. The pound does not seem convinced, still down 0.6% against the dollar. More on the record Chinese trade surplus with the US. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB, said: Trade remains one of the key topics for investors at present, with China announcing a record surplus with the US for the month of June. In Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s simplistic view of trade, the president views a deficit as a loss to the US, and therefore he will clearly be unhappy with the record high $29B shown against China for last month. The recently announced tariffs should see this fall in the present month, but it is unlikely to contribute to a major decline immediately with the tariffs themselves still only representing a fairly small portion of overall trade. Another development that will likely attract the ire of Trump is the ongoing depreciation of the Chinese yuan, which is on course for its fifth consecutive week of losses against the US dollar - its longest weekly losing streak in two years. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more apparent fallout from the trade tensions between the US and China, courtesy of Reuters: A hotel in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen on Friday denied a report that it would charge U.S. guests an extra 25 percent amid an escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing. However, three staff members who declined to be identified told Reuters that a discriminatory rate policy had indeed been posted at the hotel as of Thursday but had since been removed. The Global Times, a hawkish tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daily, said in a report dated Thursday that the Modern Classic Hotel Group had put up a notice at its hotel informing guests of the extra charge. It cited a spokesperson at the hotel, surnamed Yang, saying that the hotel had posted the notice last Friday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have no idea where this news came from. My phone has been ringing off the hook all day today,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bai Lulu, a front office manager, told Reuters at the hotel. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We treat all our guests equally. We wouldn*t charge one type of guest more than another type of guest,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bai said, adding that the hotel did not currently have any American guests. However, another staff member, declining to be identified, said there had indeed been notices saying Americans would be charged extra. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There were ads up yesterday in the restaurant stating Americans would be charged 25 percent extra. We took photos.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Global Times had cited a spokesperson for the hotel surnamed Yang as saying their boss was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153really angry about the endless tariffs the U.S. planned to impose on China\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The pound continues to slip against the dollar as investors weigh up Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflammatory comments about Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit proposals meaning no UK-US trade deal. It is currently down 0.64% at $1.3119, after hitting a low for the week of $1.3117. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said: US President Trump has put his counterpart Teresa May in a difficult position this morning saying that a soft Brexit would mean no trade deal between the UK and US. This comes a day after May released a white paper on the UK-Europe relationship after Brexit, offering a softer stance ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote on a Brexit trade bill. The UK can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to alienate either the US or the EU, its two largest foreign trade partners, and will not be able to choose an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153either-or\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd solution. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments come at a particularly bad time for May who is facing bigger problems as her government is in a precarious balance after the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson earlier this week. The pound dropped 0.6% against the dollar following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: For the second day in a row the markets ignored Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aggressive posturing to rebound, climbing back towards the levels abandoned at the start of the week. Not that there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t at least one casualty of the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big mouth... The FTSE led the way after the bell, the UK index adding another 60 points to re-cross 7700. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s put the FTSE back in the ballpark of Monday and Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3 and a half week highs, showing the extent to which investors are trying to ignore the ongoing trade war between the US and China unless they specifically have a new threat to deal with. The pound, on the other hand, couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but pay attention to the President... Trump claimed that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current Brexit plan \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwill probably kill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 any potential US trade deal, a comment that not only undermines the Prime Minister at the end of an already challenging week, but one that understandably sent sterling sharply lower. Against the dollar the pound fell 0.6%, forcing cable under $1.315 and to its worst price since the start of the month, while it also trickled 0.2% lower against the euro, where it slipped to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.129. Not that the euro was looking too good against the greenback, the single currency slumping 0.4% to hits its own 2 week nadir. This allowed the Eurozone indices to do the same as the FTSE, with the DAX and CAC rising 0.6% and 0.5% respectively. Only three fallers in the FTSE 100: Randgold Resources as the gold price dips, credit specialist Experian following a trading update and Sky, as investors take some profits after Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise on the back of the bid battle between Rupert Murdoch and Comcast for the satellite broadcaster. As expected, investors continue to push the markets higher as European trading begins. The FTSE 100 is up 0.68% at 7704, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has risen 0.45% , France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.41% while Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is 0.43% better. Michael van Dulken at Accendo Markets said the Chinese trade figures were a double edged sword: [They are] supportive of global growth but backing up Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade grievances. More on China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade figures, and more fuel for Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dispute with the country. The latest figures show a record trade surplus with the US as Chinese exporters rushed to sell goods to America ahead of the imposition of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs. Reuters reports: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus with the United States swelled to a record in June as its overall exports remained solid, a result that could further inflame a bitter trade dispute with Washington. The data came after the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump raised the stakes in its trade row with China on Tuesday, saying it would slap 10 percent tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, including numerous consumer items. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus with the United States, which is at the centre of the tariff tussle, widened to a record monthly high of $28.97 billion, up from $24.58 billion in May, according to Reuters calculations based on official data going back to 2008. Trump, who has demanded Beijing cut the trade surplus, could use the latest result to further ratchet up pressure on China after both sides last week imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on $34 billion of each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goods. Washington has warned it may ultimately impose tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods - nearly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year. The dispute has jolted global financial markets, raising worries a full-scale trade war could derail the world economy. Chinese stocks fell into bear market territory and the yuan currency has skidded, though there have been signs in recent days its central bank is moving to slow the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declines. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s June exports rose 11.3 percent from a year earlier, China General Administration of Customs reported, beating forecasts for a 10 percent increase according to the latest Reuters poll of 39 analysts, and down from a 12.6 percent gain in May. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commerce ministry confirmed last month that Chinese exporters were front-loading exports to the U.S. to get ahead of expected tariffs - a situation that could exacerbate any slowdown in shipments toward the year-end. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking ahead, export growth will cool in the coming months as US tariffs start to bite alongside a broader softening in global demand,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics in Singapore wrote in a note, though he noted a weaker yuan should help offset some of the decline. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With Donald Trump focussed on the Nato budget, Brexit and bigging up Boris Johnson, investors have managed to put fears of an escalating trade war behind them for the moment. Following a slump earlier in the week as Trump threatened to slap tariffs on another $200bn worth of Chinese imports to the US - ranging from human hair to sculptures - markets have managed to regain their composure. With no new developments since then - although China has yet to spell out how it will, inevitably, retaliate - the positive mood is set to continue when traders begin work this morning. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The absence of harsh words from the US and China encouraged traders to step into the market and snap up stocks. Investors are getting used to the pattern, whereby equity markets can recover after a big sell-off that was triggered on account of trade tensions. In keeping with recent trends, the US indices held up better than their European counterparts. The S&amp;P 500 hit its highest level since early March and the NASDAQ 100 hit an all-time high. Dealers believe the US is in a stronger position to weather the storm than the rest of the world, and that is why the US equity benchmarks are outperforming. Steven Mnuchin, the US secretary of the Treasury, revealed that many of the trade talks with China have broken down, however, he confirmed that China is very important in cooperation with North Korea. These remarks suggest the US doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be too aggressive with Beijing, which is also giving investors hope. Wall Street closed up 0.9% and the Nikkei 225 has gained more than 1.9%, so Europe is forecast to open higher: China released trade figures overnight showing stronger than expected exports, up 11.3% compared to estimates of a 10% increase. Imports rose by 14.1% compared to forecasts of a 20.8% increase. None of this is likely to deter Trump from his view of unfair trade practices from China. CMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Madden said: It is impressive that exports topped forecasts given that US tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium kicked in last month. The massive trade surplus that China has with the US is one of the reasons that President Trump instigated the trade spat, and dealers will be keeping an eye on developments. Elsewhere the pound is down following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments that prime minister Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit plan may mean no trade deal with the US. Against the dollar sterling is down 0.34% at $1.3160 while it has fallen 0.17% against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1292. The dip is likely to help the FTSE 100, which is packed with overseas earners which benefit from a weaker pound. Jasper Lawler, head of researh at London Capital Group, said: Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declaration that this softer version of Brexit would mean that a trade deal with the US was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153probably\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd off the table, was a blow to both host Theresa May and the pound, sending sterling tumbling overnight. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not forget that the hope of a quick trade deal with the US was a significant factor in Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to invite Trump in the first place. Another embarrassment that May could have done without.

Trump and May are expected to hold a joint press conference after lunch where they will both be pressed for trade comments. In the absence of any encouraging trade comments, gains in the pound going forward could be limited, and a meaningful move over $1.32 could be doubtful.

                "bodyText":"The cut-price books, crafts and toys chain The Works has shrugged off the troubles on the high street with plans for a \u00c2\u00a3100m stock market listing that will give its private equity owners and management a \u00c2\u00a336.7m payout. Its chief executive, Kevin Keaney, said the 447-strong chain was aiming to open 50 more outlets a year as the market was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crying out for a really family-friendly retailer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Keaney said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Undoubtedly there are tough times but really well-run discount retailers like B&amp;M, Primark, Home Bargains and ourselves are doing really well \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 our whole strategy is to take money away from full-price specialists like WH Smith with disruptive pricing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The chairman, Dean Hoyle, who owns Huddersfield Town FC and is worth about \u00c2\u00a3350m, thanks to the sale of the Card Factory business he founded, is set to make \u00c2\u00a31m by selling shares. He will also retain a 14% stake worth a further \u00c2\u00a314m at the float price. Endless, the private equity firm that owns the chain, is selling shares worth \u00c2\u00a330m and retains a 10% stake worth \u00c2\u00a310m. Nick Bubb, a retail analyst, expressed surprise that The Works had been able to finalise its initial public offering, which was first mentioned in the spring. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We had assumed the IPO dream had died, in the face of the gloom about the high street and the demise of Poundworld,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. On Friday, The Works said it had set its initial share price at 160p, which equates to a market capitalisation of \u00c2\u00a3100m when the company joins the stock market on 19 July. The offer will raise \u00c2\u00a365.2m, of which \u00c2\u00a328.5m will go to the company, mostly to pay off debts, while \u00c2\u00a336.7m will go to shareholders.

In response, the White House last week released <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/11/us-tariffs-on-chinese-goods-will-range-from-badger-hair-to-asbestos-shoes\">a wide-ranging list of Chinese goods</a>, from tobacco to pet food, worth $200bn it would target with a 10% tariffs.

                "bodyText":"China has filed a complaint against the US at the World Trade Organization after Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threats to place tariffs on an additional $200bn (\u00c2\u00a3150bn) worth of Chinese goods. The one-sentence announcement by the ministry of commerce comes less than a week after the US president called for a second round of tariffs on China, in retaliation for Chinese tariffs placed on American goods. On 6 July, the US imposed 25% tariffs on $34bn in Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to hit back with levies on the same amount of US exports to China. In response, the White House last week released a wide-ranging list of Chinese goods, from tobacco to pet food, worth $200bn it would target with a 10% tariffs. Beijing said it would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fight back as usual\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and would file a complaint with the WTO. The latest round of tariffs would not come into effect until September, making China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response uncharacteristically quick. Up to now Beijing has waited for Washington to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fire the first shot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the escalating trade war. Chinese economic data on Monday fanned fears that trade frictions between the two countries may soon have an impact on the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $12.5tn economy expanded 6.7% in the second quarter compared with the same period a year earlier. It was in line with expectations but was modest by recent Chinese standards.

Mao Shengyong, a spokesman for China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Bureau of Statistics said the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth was stable, but added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The uncertainties of the external environment are mounting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Generally speaking, trade frictions unilaterally started by the US will have an impact on the economy of both countries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In total, the US has threatened to place tariffs on more than $500bn worth of Chinese goods to the US, an amount that Beijing cannot reciprocate.

                "bodyText":"And finally, London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market closed lower tonight. The FTSE 100 lost 61 points to end at 7,600, a fall of 0.8%. Miners and oil companies were among the fallers, following the slowdown in Chinese growth and persistent worries about trade spats. Fiona Cincotta of City Index explains: The FTSE fell heavily on Monday, dipping below 7600, as commodity stocks and a stronger pound weighed on the index. With the Chinese economy expanding at a slightly slower pace in Q2, metal prices tumbled, causing mining stocks to trace the price lower, which oil majors slipped as oil tumble 3%. Given the heavy weighting of resource stocks on the FTSE, the blue-chip index lagged significantly behind its European peers. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX had a better day, up 0.16% while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC dipped by 0.3% as the Paris exchange enjoyed a quiet session after the World Cup final. Goodnight! GW Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics correspondent Richard Partington on the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new economic forecasts: Rising trade tensions between the United States and the rest of the world could cost the global economy $430bn (\u00c2\u00a3324bn), with America \u00e2\u20ac\u0153especially vulnerable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to an escalating tariff war, the International Monetary Fund has warned. Delivering a sharp rebuke for Donald Trump, the Washington-based organisation said the current threats made by the US and its trading partners risked lowering global growth by as much as 0.5% by 2020, or about $430bn in lost GDP worldwide. Although all economies would suffer from further escalation, the US would find itself \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as the focus of global retaliation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with a relatively higher share of its exports taxed in global markets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is therefore especially vulnerable,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the fund said. Just in: CNBC are reporting that Goldman Sachs will name their new CEO tomorrow morning. David Solomon, currently president of Goldman Sachs, will be promoted to succeed Lloyd Blankfein, they say. That wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a surprise; Solomon has been in poll position for the top job since rival Harvey Schwartz stepped down four months ago. Solomon is known as a food fanatic and music fan (spinning vinyl as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153DJ D-Sol\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd).... The IMF expects advanced economies to slow next year, while emerging markets will power on. But these forecasts could turn to dust if the tit-for-tar trade dispute turns into an damaging trade war. The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Maurice \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Maury\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Obstfeld is speaking now, warning that the global recovery has plateaued and become less balanced. Obstfeld says: We continue to project global growth rates of just about 3.9 percent for both this year and next, but judge that the risk of worse outcomes has increased, even for the near term. He points out that growth has slowed recently in the eurozone, Japan and the UK (which is why the IMF has trimmed their growth forecasts). Obstfeld says Europe looks less stable than three months ago (before Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s populist government was sworn in, and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition was split over migration). He explains: Political uncertainty has risen in Europe, where the European Union faces fundamental political challenges regarding migration policy, fiscal governance, norms concerning the rule of law, and the euro area institutional architecture. The terms of Brexit remain unsettled despite months of negotiation. Obstfeld also warns that financial markets seem \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broadly complacent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the risks of a trade war, and the geopolitical tensions rising across the world. Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has warned that hundreds of billions of dollars of growth will be wiped out, if a full-scale trade war breaks out. The IMF estimates that the global economy will be 0.5% smaller by 2020 if the various tariffs threatened by the US, China, Europe, Mexico, Japan and Canada are all implemented. The warning comes in the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest economic outlooks, which also cuts Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth predictions this year. Maury Obstfeld, IMF Economic Counsellor, says: The risk that current trade tensions escalate further\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwith adverse effects on confidence, asset prices, and investment\u00e2\u20ac\u201dis the greatest near-term threat to global growth. Global current account imbalances are set to widen owing to the United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 relatively high demand growth, possibly exacerbating frictions. The United States has initiated trade actions affecting a broad group of countries, and faces retaliation or retaliatory threats from China, the European Union, its NAFTA partners, and Japan, among others. Our modeling suggests that if current trade policy threats are realized and business confidence falls as a result, global output could be about 0.5 percent below current projections by 2020. As the focus of global retaliation, the United States finds a relatively high share of its exports taxed in global markets in such a broader trade conflict, and it is therefore especially vulnerable. The IMF has lowered its forecast for eurozone growth this year to 2.2%, from 2.4% back in April. It has also cut its forecast for UK growth in 2018 to just 1.4%, from 1.6%. But it still expects the global economy to grow by 3.9% this year, and in 2019. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty obvious that trade wars can make imports more expensive, as tariffs are effectively paid by consumers. But they can also make domestic goods cheaper, if suppliers are left with a glut of products which they can no longer sell competively overseas. And this is already happening in America, where pork prices are falling on fears that China will stop importing as many US hams. Bloomberg reports that hog futures are weak this year. And American meat lovers are already taking advantage, and tucking into some culinary treats..... On Saturday in Dallas, as many as 30 people on a local bacon-focused food tour were set to traverse the city chomping down on bacon donuts, bacon brown sugar ice cream, bacon jam and candied bacon. While retail bacon prices are down in the past 12 months, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still up from six years ago, so any relief from higher costs will be welcome news to the pork enthusiasts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost like a bonding experience,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jeanine Stevens, the owner of Dallas Bites! Tours, which takes participants to little known restaurants and other eateries. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bacon is a kind of food that people just feel a little bit lighthearted about. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fun food.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Vincent-Fre\u00c4\u203ade\u00c4\u203aric Mivelaz of Switzerland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s SwissBank is concerned by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chinese growth figures. Mivelaz points out that there are signs of weakness, with fixed asset investment dropping from 6.1% to 6% per year in June, industrial production growth down to 6% from 6.8%, and retail sales growth below their recent average. He adds: Money supply is tightening, due to caution of financiers and debt risk, so the Chinese economy is expected to slow down industrial activity and private consumption. Trade tariffs will be a key factor in coming months. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our Beijing correspondent, Lily Kuo, on China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation against America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs: China has filed a complaint against the US at the World Trade Organisation over Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threats to place tariffs on an additional $200bn worth of Chinese goods. The one-sentence announcement on Monday, from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ministry of commerce, comes less than a week after the US president called for a second round of tariffs on China, in retaliation for Chinese tariffs placed on American goods. On 6 July, the US imposed 25% tariffs on $34bn in Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to hit back with levies on the same amount of US exports to China. In response, the White House last week released a wide-ranging list of $200bn in Chinese goods, from tobacco to dog and cat food, to target with 10% tariffs. Beijing said it would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fight back as usual\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and would file a complaint with the WTO. The new round of tariffs would not come into effect until September, making China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response uncharacteristically quick. Up to now Beijing has waited for the US to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fire the first shot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the escalating trade war... More here: Newsflash: US retail sales grew steadily last month, indicating that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is growing steadily despite tariff worries. Retail sales jumped by 0.5% in June, the Commerce Department reports. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fifth monthly rise in a row. May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures have also been revised higher, to show a 1.3% increase - up from 0.8% previously. However, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccore retail sales\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (stripping out cars, gasoline, food and building materials) were flat in June. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy chart, showing how the availability of credit in China has recently been reined in, after a long period of loose monetary policy after the financial crisis. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has fallen into the red, as City traders fret about the risk of a tradw war. The FTSE 100 has shed 88 points, or over 1%, to 7573. After a slow start, equities took a hit as the oil price fell, hitting shares in energy producers and miners. Brent crude is now down almost 2% at $73.94 per barrel, following the news that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate has slowed. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initially meagre losses gathered pace as Monday went on, the index dragged lower by its commodity stocks. With Brent Crude slipping 1.1%, and copper down 0.7%, both suffering in light of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Q2 slowdown, the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hefty oil and mining ended up in the red, dragging the UK index lower in the process. Getting back to trade, the boss of asset management giant BlackRock has warned that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade dispute with China will hurt growth. Larry Fink told Bloomberg TV that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy would suffer if the White House imposes tariffs on an extra $200bn of Chinese imports (as it threatened last week). Fink said that US economic growth has been strong in 2018, but it will weaken in 2019 if America escalates the trade war with China. He predicted that: GDP will slow down dramatically.....we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have even more uncertainty about the state of the world. Fink added that shares would tumble if a full-blown trade war broke out, adding that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153markets will speak louder than any single voice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Defence secretary Gavin Williamson says the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new concept fighter jet will help the country \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u0153fly higher, further and faster than ever before\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Williamson explains that the Tempest could be operated by a pilot, or be flown unmanned (using a virtual cockpit, I think). He hopes that the plane could be operational by 2035, and adds that Britain is open to partnering with other countries on its future fighter programme (as happened with the Eurofighter Typhoon, of course). Several major engineering and defence firms are already on board, including Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems. Over in Farnborough, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence secretary has just unveiled a new concept fighter jet to protect the UK in the coming years. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tempest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and dubbed a next-generation fighter jet that could eventually replace the Eurofighter. Just in: the Eurozone suffered a drop in exports in May, narrowing its trade surplus with the rest of the world. However, the euro area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus with America has grown - which will not please Donald Trump. Eurostat reports that the eurozone exported \u00e2\u201a\u00ac189.6bn of goods to the rest of the world in May 2018, a drop of 0.8% compared with May 2017. Imports from the rest of the world rose by 0.7% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac173.1bn, (from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac171.9bn in May 2017). This means the euro area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goods surplus has shrank to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac16.5bn in May, down from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac19.3bn a year earlier. The figures also show that the European Union exported 2.1% more goods to America in the first five months of 2018, but imported 3.1% less. As a result, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus with the US has swelled to \u00c2\u00a354.8bn, up from \u00c2\u00a348.1bn a year ago [more details here]. Trump has other things on his mind today, of course, but this data might reinforce his belief that the EU treats America very badly on trade. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Associated Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: China announced it filed a World Trade Organization challenge on Monday to U.S. President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal for a tariff hike on $200bn of Chinese goods, reacting swiftly amid deepening concern about the economic impact of their spiraling technology dispute. The one-sentence Commerce Ministry statement gave no legal grounds for the challenge or other details. It is an unusually rapid move for a trade case, coming less than one week after the U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] announced the tariff plan, which wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take effect until at least September. The USTR said last week that it proposed the levy in response to Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to retaliate for U.S. tariff hikes over complaints China is hurting American companies by stealing or pressuring foreign enterprises to hand over technology.... This is a swift move by China. By appealing to the WTO, Beijing is signalling that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal to slap 10% tariffs on a wide range of imports - from meat and vegetables to chemicals and consumer products (plus plenty of unusual items). However, China still hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t revealed how it will retaliate against America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to make $200bn of its imports less competitive. That may be because Beijing can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t announce reciprocal tariffs, as it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t import enough stuff from the US.... Newsflash: China has filed a complaint with the World Trade Organisation over America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest threat to impose levies on Chinese imports. According to Associated Press, Beijing is protesting about the plan to hit $200bn of Chinese goods with a new 10% tariff (probably starting in September). Tom Rafferty of the Economist Intelligence Unit believes China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has held up well despite the trade spat with the US. However, he also expects growth to slow in the next few months. Rafferty says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The data shows that global trade headwinds have yet to grip China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. Despite the heated global rhetoric around trade and associated financial market volatility, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s export sector performed well in the second quarter of the year and will probably prove quite resilient under the limited tariff actions we anticipate from the US and China. We are more concerned about slowing domestic demand within China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, with investment persistently weak and consumption also having slowed, and these are much more important drivers of growth than exports. The fall in industrial output growth in June was notable in this regard. The authorities have begun to loosen policy settings, but will be reluctant to go too far given their desire to curb financial risks. As such, we expect growth to slow in the second half of the year and more markedly in 2019.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ING economist Iris Pang has spotted an important detail in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chinese growth figure. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s robot production only grew by 7.2% year-on-year in June, compared to 23% for 2018 as a whole. That signals that factory bosses are worried about the future, and refusing to invest in new equipment right now. European stock markets are subdued this morning, with the FTSE 100 dipping by 18 points (0.2%) in early trading. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has made a better start, up 0.35%, while the French CAC is flat (maybe Parisian traders are recovering from the World Cup). Neil Wilson of Markets.com says investors are awaiting developments in Helsinki, and not too alarmed by the Chinese growth figures.... Looking ahead, the Trump-Putin summit could have an impact on risk assets as the US president continues to show a willingness to disrupt the established world order. After calling the EU a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfoe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on trade, European leaders in particular will be wary about just how much Trump cosies up to Putin, which may dampen risk appetite. But at the very least it deflects attention away from Chinese trade wars for the time being. Asian stocks fell as overnight China GDP data disappointed a touch but we can look through the noise here. There is little change from the last several quarters with growth holding just below the 7% level. The chatter is that trade war concerns are weighing on business confidence but this sounds more like a lot of noise. Tusk: Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not start trade wars European Council President Donald Tusk has urged the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major powers, including China, to help prevent a global trade war that would hurt the global economy. Speaking at the 20th EU-China summit, Tusk called for policymakers to strengthen and reform the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrules-based\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 international setup, rather than unravelling it. He also gave a pointed nudge towards the US-Russia summit which is taking place in Helsinki later today, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are all aware of the fact that the architecture of the world is changing before our very eyes. And it is our common responsibility to make it a change for the better. Let us remember, here in Beijing, and over there, in Helsinki, that the world we were building for decades, sometimes through disputes, has brought about peace for Europe, the development of China, and the end of the Cold War between the East and the West. It is a common duty of Europe and China, America and Russia, not to destroy this order, but to improve it. Not to start trade wars, which turned into hot conflicts so often in our history, but to bravely and responsibly reform the rules-based international order.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tusk has also tweeted that he hopes his message reaches the leaders of the US and Russia in Finland. Iris Pang, Greater China Economist at ING in Hong Kong, argues that Chinese policymakers need to do more to boost growth. She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They need to slow financial deleveraging slightly and to turn their focus more on growth-supportive measures, for example increasing liquidity through (bank reserve requirement) cuts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the situation gets worse a lot faster than what we expect I do think Chinese authorities need to beef up supportive measures, both fiscal and monetary.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Although China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate only dipped slightly, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a worrying sign for the health of the global economy, argues Bloomberg News. They fear that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspillover effects\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown could hurt other countries, arguing: Confirmation that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is slowing amid an escalating trade war is a worrying omen for global growth. Data released since Friday has affirmed what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been expected for some time: That an ongoing campaign to curtail credit is putting the brakes on the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest economy. Given that China generates as much as a third of global growth, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s adding to signs that the best world expansion in years is plateauing. The International Monetary Fund, which has repeatedly warned that the trade spat between the U.S. and China will reverberate globally, is scheduled to release fresh growth forecasts later Monday. The Chinese economy grew at an expected 6.7 percent in the second quarter, its slowest pace since 2016, while key readings on investment growth and industrial output slowed in June. Retail sales held up. Louis Kuijs, head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong, has warned clients that the trade row between Beijing and Washington could soon cause serious harm to economic growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the US and China do not resume talks in the next two months or so, the conflict will escalate further, with major economic implications for themselves and the global economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Investment manager Mario Cavaggioni tweets: Back in April, Beijing told state-owned banks to stop lending so much money to local authorities to fund building projects. That clampdown is now hitting growth, argues Haibin Zhu, chief China economist at JPMorgan in Hong Kong. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A main reason for the slowdown is that infrastructure investment began to slow down in the first quarter as the government was trying to control local government debt. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The good news is that there is space to provide more fiscal support through tax cuts and higher infrastructure investment. We expect they will move along these lines.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mao Shengyong, spokesperson for China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Bureau of Statistics, has told reporters that the Chinese economy made a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good start\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to 2018 - despite growth slowing a little in the April-June quarter. Reuters has more details: Noting increasing external uncertainties and the fact that China is still going through a critical stage in structural adjustment, Mao said the country would stick to the supply-side structural reform and coordinate efforts to ensure stable and sound economic performance. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate has dipped to its lowest rate since 2016, in a sign that the trade dispute with America maybe hitting its economy. Chinese GDP rose at an annual rate of 6.7% in the second quarter of 2018, partly due to slower-than-expected growth in factory output. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a slight deterioration on the first three months of this year, when the economy expanded by an annual rate of 6.8%. Although this is above Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal of growth \u00e2\u20ac\u0153above 6.5\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it will stoke concerns that the tariffs imposed by America this year are hurting. It could also show that the campaign to rein in shadow banking and risky lending is also restraining growth. Official government figures also show that industrial output only grew by 6.7% year-on-year in June, down from 6.9%. However, retail sales jumped by 9% year-on-year, up from 8.5%. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Bureau of Statistics warned that there are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153increased uncertainties\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the global economy (no prizes for who they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re thinking of...). It also argued that the Chinese economy is still on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153steady and improving trend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, despite the shadow of a trade war with America. Asian stock markets dipped following the data, with the Shanghai Composite down around 0.8%. European markets are also set for an underwhelming start to the new week. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull together some reaction now. Also coming up today The International Monetary Fund is publishing its latest assessment of the global economy this afternoon. We also get new eurozone trade stats and US retail sales figures. Investors will be watching Helsinki, as Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin hold a summit. The meeting comes just days after 12 Russian military intelligence officials were indicted for allegedly trying to hack the Democratic party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emails and computer networks during the 2016 election campaign. Trump has given European leaders fresh cause for alarm, declaring that the EU is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153foe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd given how it trades with America. Plus, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always Brexit. Overnight, Conservative MP and former minister Justine Greening has called for a second referendum, creating yet another headache for Theresa May ahead of more crunch votes in parliament this week. Brexit will also be high on the agenda at Farnborough, as the aerospace industry gather for the International Airshow.

Reuters reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Powell, questioned by members of a House congressional committee, repeated on Wednesday that rising world protectionism would over time pose a risk to a U.S. and global expansion that appears largely on track to continue.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153If this process leads to a world of higher tariffs on a wide range of goods and services that are traded and those are sustained for a longer period of time, if it results in a more protectionist world, that would be bad for our economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Powell told the House Financial Services Committee. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t up to us to criticise (administration) policies. But the evidence is clear that countries that remain open to trade have higher productivity. They have higher incomes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance largely retraced the testimony and questioning from a Tuesday hearing with the Senate Banking Committee.</p> <p>In prepared testimony and an accompanying report Powell depicted a U.S. economy poised for perhaps years more continued growth, with the central bank close to its goals of maximum employment and inflation stable at around 2 percent.</p> <p>But as with senators the day before, House members zeroed in on the possible economic consequences of the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imposition of tariffs, with threats of more to come, in the name of cutting better trade deals with both allies like Canada and rivals like China.</p> <p>Powell has tried to walk a fine line in his responses, at once steering clear of direct criticism of the president who appointed him, while also making the economic consequences clear.</p> <p>Powell said he thought the administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aim was to ultimately lower tariffs worldwide, and if there was disruption in the meantime \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it might be worth paying a bit of a short-term price to get to a better place.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>At the same time, he and other Fed officials have been clear that businesses are telling them that they already are changing spending and investment plans because of the risks and uncertainties around a possible trade conflict.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b4f68e5e4b0afc5fe58276d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-18T16:23:31.204Z\">5.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Troubled UK outsourcer Capita has seen its shares fall around 2.5% after it said its finance director is stepping down.</p> <p>It said Nick Greatorex would stay with the company for the next few months as it searched for a replacement.

Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound tumbled to a 10-month low versus the dollar after inflation in June failed to tick high...</p> <p>These figures could give the BoE reasons to pause for thought over an August rate hike. With inflation steady at a one year low and average wages slipping, the central bank could have problems justifying the need for a rate hike. Policy makers could use the argument of recovering economic growth over the last few months, however the inflation figures show that growth is not at levels where it is starting to push up inflation. From whichever angle you look at this the data so far this week has not been supportive of an interest rate rise. Instead we are in danger of seeing a repeat of May, where weak data leading up to the MPC meeting prevented the widely expected rate hike. The market expectations of a rate hike slipped to 72% from 77% prior to the release.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-07-18T15:52:51.273Z\">at 4.52pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b4f53cae4b0a426f7db4b53\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-18T14:51:33.877Z\">3.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with Google, and Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In a way Google has become a victim of its own success in terms of its search and marketing capabilities, with little in the way of alternative search and browser options available.

The bigger issue here may be the obvious benefits to Amazon (and potentially Apple) from the ruling; first, even though Amazon already generates ~50% of commerce and product-related searches, the EC will require Android users to take another step before they can access an alternative product search engine. Secondly, to force Google to support distribution of forked-versions of Android (which Google does not control) could directly benefit Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fire devices. To use the example cited by Margrethe Vestager in the press conference, the EC argues that Fire smartphones were not commercially successful because Google did not allow manufacturers to pre-install Google apps on those devices (forget the fact that the apps wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work as well, or at all, on a modified OS.)</p> <p>In order to make an anti-trust argument, the EC needed to argue that Apple iOS (25% market share in Europe) is not a direct competitor to Android, and that Amazon is not a competitor to Google in search. In fact, the EC specifically cites Google/Android having 95% mobile OS market share (outside of China.) While convenient for an anti-trust ruling, we think these assumptions do not reflect the reality of the marketplace. In fact, as others have pointed out numerous times, Apple puts far more restrictions on network operators than Google does, including requirements to pre-install at least 3x as many apps as Google does, while Amazon continues to take share of product search. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b4f41a1e4b0afc5fe5824da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-18T13:39:44.912Z\">2.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Google parent Alphabet has said it will accrue the EC fine in the second quarter of 2018, in <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000119312518220240/d552608d8k.htm\">a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</a></p> <p>Meanwhile its shares have edged marginally higher - up 0.18% - after an initial dip.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b4f3f76e4b0a426f7db4a14\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-18T13:25:20.527Z\">2.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Investors will be watching shares in Google parent Alphabet when Wall Street opens shortly.

Reuters reports: Powell, questioned by members of a House congressional committee, repeated on Wednesday that rising world protectionism would over time pose a risk to a U.S. and global expansion that appears largely on track to continue. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If this process leads to a world of higher tariffs on a wide range of goods and services that are traded and those are sustained for a longer period of time, if it results in a more protectionist world, that would be bad for our economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Powell told the House Financial Services Committee. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t up to us to criticise (administration) policies. But the evidence is clear that countries that remain open to trade have higher productivity. They have higher incomes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance largely retraced the testimony and questioning from a Tuesday hearing with the Senate Banking Committee. In prepared testimony and an accompanying report Powell depicted a U.S. economy poised for perhaps years more continued growth, with the central bank close to its goals of maximum employment and inflation stable at around 2 percent. But as with senators the day before, House members zeroed in on the possible economic consequences of the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imposition of tariffs, with threats of more to come, in the name of cutting better trade deals with both allies like Canada and rivals like China. Powell has tried to walk a fine line in his responses, at once steering clear of direct criticism of the president who appointed him, while also making the economic consequences clear. Powell said he thought the administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aim was to ultimately lower tariffs worldwide, and if there was disruption in the meantime \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it might be worth paying a bit of a short-term price to get to a better place.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At the same time, he and other Fed officials have been clear that businesses are telling them that they already are changing spending and investment plans because of the risks and uncertainties around a possible trade conflict. Troubled UK outsourcer Capita has seen its shares fall around 2.5% after it said its finance director is stepping down. It said Nick Greatorex would stay with the company for the next few months as it searched for a replacement. Capita, which is cutting costs as it attempts to cut its debt levels, appointed a new chief executive, Jon Lewis, in December. The pound has pulled back from its lowest levels but is still down on the day. Immediately following the unchanged UK inflation figures, which cast doubt on whether the Bank of England would indeed raise interest rates next month, sterling slid to a 10 month low against the dollar of $1.3011. It is now at $1.3042, still down more than 0.5% on the day. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said: The pound tumbled to a 10-month low versus the dollar after inflation in June failed to tick high... These figures could give the BoE reasons to pause for thought over an August rate hike. With inflation steady at a one year low and average wages slipping, the central bank could have problems justifying the need for a rate hike. Policy makers could use the argument of recovering economic growth over the last few months, however the inflation figures show that growth is not at levels where it is starting to push up inflation. From whichever angle you look at this the data so far this week has not been supportive of an interest rate rise. Instead we are in danger of seeing a repeat of May, where weak data leading up to the MPC meeting prevented the widely expected rate hike. The market expectations of a rate hike slipped to 72% from 77% prior to the release. Back with Google, and Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: In a way Google has become a victim of its own success in terms of its search and marketing capabilities, with little in the way of alternative search and browser options available. In terms of browsing there is Firefox, Opera and Microsoft Edge, however search options are more limited, with Yahoo and Bing the more well-known names. The solution is likely to be something similar to the solution which Microsoft implemented a few years ago when it had to unbundle Internet Explorer from its operating system to comply with similar EU antitrust rules, allowing the user to choose their own search and browse options. With Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit to Nato and Russia hogging the headlines, his trade battle with China seemed to have gone a bit quiet. Now one of his advisors has been talking trade again. Reuters reports: U.S. President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic adviser said on Wednesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153holding up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a deal to resolve a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant trade dispute\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between the United States and China. Larry Kudlow, head of the White House Economic Council, also said that he expects European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to bring a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trade offer to Trump when he visits Washington next week. The comments were made to CNBC: Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell gave his latest testimony to the US Senate yesterday, and shortly he will be up before the House of Representatives. His testimony is the same to both committees and can be found here. On yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: In his appearance in front of the Senate Banking Committee Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was unequivocal in his upbeat assessment of the US economy. [He] continued with the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message to continue raising rates gradually as he sees several years of the jobs market remaining strong and inflation steady around 2%. This was music to the ears of the dollar, providing the greenback a welcome distraction from the trade war noise over recent weeks. Overall US markets have edged ahead in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 19 points or 0.06%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are both showing similar percentage gains. Positive results from United Airlines and Morgan Stanley are helping to support industrial and banking shares. The EC ruling on Google is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bit misguided\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but is likely to be a minor inconvenience in the short and medium term, says Colin Sebastian, senior analyst at investment bank Baird. (Given the muted reaction from the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price, the market seems to agree). Sebastian adds: Longer term, we see modest (but not unexpected) added risk from requirements to support forked versions of Android, and secondly, from the direct and/or indirect benefits of this ruling for Apple and Amazon. Overall, this ruling should have a limited direct impact on Google since it ostensibly does not force a change to the Google search algorithm, and it also seems relatively straight-forward for Google to comply. The bigger issue here may be the obvious benefits to Amazon (and potentially Apple) from the ruling; first, even though Amazon already generates ~50% of commerce and product-related searches, the EC will require Android users to take another step before they can access an alternative product search engine. Secondly, to force Google to support distribution of forked-versions of Android (which Google does not control) could directly benefit Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fire devices. To use the example cited by Margrethe Vestager in the press conference, the EC argues that Fire smartphones were not commercially successful because Google did not allow manufacturers to pre-install Google apps on those devices (forget the fact that the apps wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work as well, or at all, on a modified OS.) In order to make an anti-trust argument, the EC needed to argue that Apple iOS (25% market share in Europe) is not a direct competitor to Android, and that Amazon is not a competitor to Google in search. In fact, the EC specifically cites Google/Android having 95% mobile OS market share (outside of China.) While convenient for an anti-trust ruling, we think these assumptions do not reflect the reality of the marketplace. In fact, as others have pointed out numerous times, Apple puts far more restrictions on network operators than Google does, including requirements to pre-install at least 3x as many apps as Google does, while Amazon continues to take share of product search. Google parent Alphabet has said it will accrue the EC fine in the second quarter of 2018, in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Meanwhile its shares have edged marginally higher - up 0.18% - after an initial dip. Investors will be watching shares in Google parent Alphabet when Wall Street opens shortly. At the moment the pre-market price is showing limited damage from the EC fine, down just 0.25%. Sundar Pichai, Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, has issued a statement decrying the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision, and confirming that the company plans to appeal against its fine. Pichai argues that Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open source model (which allows manufacturers to modify Android to their purposes) has been good for competition. He also accuses the Commission of favouring proprietary rivals (such as Apple, which keeps a tight hold on its own operating system). Significantly, Pichai states that Google offers phone makers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the option of pre-loading a suite of popular Google apps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The EC, though, accuses Google of using \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tying practices\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exclusivity payments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to prevent rivals app-makers getting a foothold on Android. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the heart of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine. Pichai writes: Today, because of Android, a typical phone comes preloaded with as many as 40 apps from multiple developers, not just the company you bought the phone from. If you prefer other apps\u00e2\u20ac\u201dor browsers, or search engines\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto the preloaded ones, you can easily disable or delete them, and choose other apps instead, including apps made by some of the 1.6 million Europeans who make a living as app developers. In fact, a typical Android phone user will install around 50 apps themselves. Last year, over 94 billion apps were downloaded globally from our Play app store; browsers such as Opera Mini and Firefox have been downloaded more than 100 million times, UC Browser more than 500 million times. This is in stark contrast to how things used to be in the 1990s and early 2000s\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe dial-up age. Back then, changing the pre-installed applications on your computer, or adding new ones, was technically difficult and time-consuming. The Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Android decision ignores the new breadth of choice and clear evidence about how people use their phones today. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement. The EC have created this graphic to explain how Google has been unfairly keeping a grip on its Android operating system, hurting rival search engine and browser makers. The French government has welcomed the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move. Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told reporters in Paris that it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexcellent decision\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No-one is above the laws that have been laid down in common for all....Not Google, nor any other entity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US tech entrepreneur Jason Kint has calculated that the EC has basically fined Google 4% of its annual revenues. That happens to be the maximum penalty available under Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new data privacy rules (even though this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a data violation). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of Margrethe Vestager denying she has a vendetta against America during today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference: Our news story about Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record fine for breaking Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition rules is now live. Our Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin writes: Google has been hit with a record \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.34bn (\u00c2\u00a33.8bn) fine by the European Union for abusing its market dominance in mobile phone operating systems. The EU imposed the multibillion-euro penalty after finding that the US tech firm required smartphone manufacturers to pre-instal Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s search and browser apps devices using its Android operating system, otherwise they would not be allowed to use its Google Play online store and streaming service. Margrethe Vestager, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition commissioner, said Google has used its Android mobile phone operating system \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to cement its dominance as a search engine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, preventing rivals from innovating and competing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and this is illegal under EU antitrust rules\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Vestager added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The vast majority of users simply take what comes with their device and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t download competing apps. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Or to slightly paraphrase what [US free market economist] Milton Friedman has said \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthere ain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t no such thing as a free search.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jennifer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling comes too late to affect the mobile phone market, my colleague Sam Gibbs says: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour of his analysis: The EC is demanding that Google cede some control over Android in its licensing. The EC is demanding that manufacturers should be free to use Android and include the Google Play Store without having to pre-install the Google Search app and Chrome. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a similar strategy to that employed by the EC in 2004, when it forced Microsoft to release a version of Windows without Windows Media Player and later offer a browser choice screen, which allowed users to select a web browser other than Internet Explorer. But as with the Media Player-free version of Windows, Windows XP N, for which there was no demand, consumers are unlikely to buy a version of Android without Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance is arguably six to eight years too late,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Geoff Blaber from analyst firm CCS Insight. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Android has already helped establish Google apps and services as essentials for consumers in the western world. More here: Q: Why does Google get fined in Europe, but not in the US and Canada? Commissioner Vestager insists that the EC has been fair - it has investigated complaints and taken evidence in order to reach its decisions. Q: Was today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision really taken outside the context of the political situation? [a reference to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attacks on the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade policies, and threats to impose tariffs on European exports, I think] People more insightful than me say that the world is becoming more and more unpredictable, Vestager replies. That means it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to do predictable things -- so if you breach antitrust rules you pay the penalty, she adds. The press conference is now over. Q: Currently, the mobile phone operating system is dominated either by Android or Apple. Do you really think that is going to change? Commissioner Vestager says she isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to guess how the mobile sector will develop. But she insists that competition will develop, if the market is fair. She says that Amazon developed a fork which they were very keen to roll out to manufacturers, but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possible because of Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s illegal restrictions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Q: This is the biggest fine ever for antitrust violations, so is Google guilty of the biggest ever antitrust breach? Vestager jokes that she loves all her children equally, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not fair to make her choose which company has been the worst sinner against competition in the EU. Q: Wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t breaking up Google address these antitrust concerns? Vestager denies that breaking up a company would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsilver bullet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to deliver competition. Q: Was Donald Trump right when he told Jean-Claude Juncker last week that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Your tax lady really hates the US\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? Vestager says she has fact-checked this statement. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a woman, and that she deals with tax. But after that point, the US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim becomes less accurate. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I very much like the US\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Vestager insists, pointing out that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from Denmark, where people often have American friends and appreciate US culture and travel. Q: Why is today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine twice as big as the one imposed on Google in 2017? The fine reflects the scale of Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very serious illegal behaviour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Vestager replies. Q: Do you think Google needs to be broken up to improve competition? Vestager says she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know whether that would improve the situation. The EC really wants Google to allow proper competition at the mobile phone operating system level. Q: Does the length of time these cases take limit their impact, as the market has moved on by the time the EU acts? Vestager says that the case began in 2015, following a number of complaints. The EC sticks to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdue process\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which limits how fast these cases can be wrapped up, she explains. Q: What remedies will be available to existing Android phone users? Could Google be forced to send out a notification to customers, telling them they can change their search engine or browser? Vestager says the EC is making a classical \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccease and desist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now up to Google to decide how to make amends in the future. [I think that means that existing Android users won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any difference on their handset] Q: Google now has an entrenched position in the mobile sector (with four-fifths of devices), so how can you enforce changes now? Vestager says Google needs to take away the contractual restrictions that have held back competition on Android. Q: Did you examine whether Google blocked rivals from collecting data on Android users? Vestager says that rival search engines \u00e2\u20ac\u0153never really\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd got a foothold on Android, due to Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restrictions (ie, the company didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to actively block its rivals, as they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there in the first place). Q: Could your decision drive up the cost of mobile phone handsets? Vestager says there are still various ways in which Google can monetising the Android operating system, rather than simply hiking prices. Q: What will happen to the money (assuming Google pays up). Vestager says that the fine will be returned to EU member states, based on how much each country pays into the EU budget. But that could take a while, if Google files an appeal. Commissioner Vestager is taking questions about the Google fine now. Q: Could this decision affect next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting between EC president Juncker and US president Trump? Vestager says that the US competition authorities want fair competition, just as Europe does. As such, they expect the EC to do its job. Q: Should Google apologise? We want Google to end its illegal behaviour, Vestager replies. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a moral endeavour - we just want Google to play by the rules. The size of Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine reflects the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seriousness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and sustained natures of its violation of the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s antitrust rules, commissioner Margrethe Vestager tells reporters in Brussels. The company must end its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcillegal conduct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 within 90 days, by ending the restrictions it has imposed on mobile phone makers (as outlined here), Vestager explains. Our decision stops Google from controlling which search and browser apps manufacturers can install, or which android operating system they can use, she says. And if Google doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comply, its parent company Alphabet could be fined up to 5% of its daily turnover each day. Newsflash: Google says it will appeal against the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine. Google spokesman Al Verney argues that its Android operating system [which is used on 80% of phones worldwide] has been good for consumers. Verney says: Android has created more choice for everyone, not less. A vibrant ecosystem, rapid innovation and lower prices are classic hallmarks of robust consequences. We will appeal the Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. The EC says that Google has been abusing its market position for seven years. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling states: Google has prevented device manufacturers from using any alternative version of Android that was not approved by Google (Android forks). In order to be able to pre-install on their devices Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proprietary apps, including the Play Store and Google Search, manufacturers had to commit not to develop or sell even a single device running on an Android fork. The Commission found that this conduct was abusive as of 2011, which is the date Google became dominant in the market for app stores for the Android mobile operating system. Commissioner Vestager is now outlining how Google restricts manufacturers from creating rival \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcforks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of its Android operating system. In theory, a manufacturer can used the Android source code to create their own platform, as Google makes it openly accessible. But in practice, Vestager says, device manufacturers who wish to obtain Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proprietary Android apps and services need to enter into contracts with Google, as part of which Google imposes a number of restrictions. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager adds: Google has used Android as a vehicle to cement its dominance as a search engine. These practices have denied rivals a chance to innovate and to compete on the merits. They have denied European consumers the benefit of effective competition in the very important mobile sphere. And this is illegal under EU antitrust rules. Vestager is outlining the case against Google. She says: Google required manufacturers to pre-install the Google search and browser apps on Android phones, otherwise they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be allowed to use Google Play (its app service)/. Google paid manufacturers and network operators to make sure that only the Google search app was installed on devices Google has restricted the development of competing mobile phone operating systems, which could have provided a platform for rival search engines. Commissioner Vestager says Google must make amends within 90 days, or the company will incur penalty payments. NEWSFLASH: The European Commission has fined Google \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.34bn for breaching EU antitrust rules. The tech giant is being sanctioned for abusing its dominant position in the Android operating system for mobile phones. The EC says Google unfairly took advantage of the popularity of its Android mobile phone operating system, and forced phonemakers to pre-install Google services such as its flagship search product. Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager is outlining the decision now. More to follow! Margrethe Vestager, the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Competition Commissioner for Competition, is about to give a press conference in Brussels. Presumably this is to announce the Google fine. It will be streamed online here. Over in Brussels, antitrust regulators are preparing to hit Google with a multi-billion euro fine. My colleague Jennifer Rankin explains: Google could be hit with a record fine by the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition authorities on Wednesday for abusing its market dominance in mobile phone operating systems. The company risks a multibillion-euro penalty for making the Google search engine the default on most phones using its Android operating system. Citing people familiar with the case, the Financial Times reported that the fine is likely to exceed the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.4bn (\u00c2\u00a32.1bn) penalty imposed by the European commission in 2017 when Google was found to have used its dominant search engine to build its internet shopping service. Google is appealing against that decision. The EU regulator could fine Google up to 10% of its turnover, or some \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11bn. Reuters is reporting that Google could be fined around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.3bn, or $5bn. The decision could be just minutes away.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sector has suffered another blow \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaty restaurant chain Gaucho is expected to file for administration today. The move will threaten around 1,500 jobs, adding to the thousands being cut at high street chains such as House of Fraser, Poundworld, Marks &amp; Spencer and Mothercare. UK house price inflation has hit a five-year low. House prices across the UK rose by 3.0% in the year to May, which is the slowest growth since August 2013. Once again, falling house prices in London dragged the national average down. The Office for National Statistics explains: The lowest annual growth was in London, where prices decreased by 0.4% over the year. London has shown a general slowdown in its annual growth rate since mid-2016. This is the fourth consecutive month that London house prices have fallen over the year. Political uncertainty (ie Brexit) is hurting prices in the capital, says Guy Bradshaw, Director of Central London Sales and Lettings at UK Sotheby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s International Realty: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As annual growth in the UK has continued to decline to the lowest rate we have seen since August 2013, it is unsurprising to see the London market has also followed suit. We were never expecting to see a particularly buoyant market this year, with political uncertainty and stamp duty continuing to dampen sales. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSpring Bounce\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is undeniably modest in comparison to previous years and whilst this may be due to the poor weather we encountered late into the year this may very well be setting the scene for the summer market. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics correspondent Richard Partington on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures: The chances of a rise in interest rates in August have dipped after British inflation remained at a one-year low last month. Confounding expectations for the return of higher rates of inflation in June fuelled by the rising price of petrol, the Office for National Statistics said the consumer price index remained unchanged at 2.4% from the previous month. Although the cost of gas and electricity prices increased and the price at the pump hit the highest level for nearly four years, consumers benefited from the falling cost of computer games and the summer clothing sales. House prices across the UK also rose at the slowest pace in nearly five years. Faced with falling wage growth, the latest snapshot from the ONS poses the Bank of England with limited grounds for raising interest rates next month. Sterling slid to a 10-month low against the dollar on foreign exchanges after the data was released. More here: The Resolution Foundation has warned that inflation could overtake earnings growth soon, which would mean real wages would start falling again: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation data, from Financial Secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster General, Mel Stride: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation has fallen from its peak last year but we recognise the cost of living is still a challenge for some families. That is why we are freezing fuel duty saving drivers \u00c2\u00a3160 a year, cutting income taxes for 31 million people and increasing the National Living Wage to \u00c2\u00a37.83 an hour.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound is acting more like the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGreat British Peso\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 right now, as it is buffeted by political tensions as well as economic data. So says Bart Hordijk, Market Analyst at Monex Europe, who believes sterling is behaving increasingly like an emerging market currency. Hordijk explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As the dust settles on yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWild West\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 style standoff in Parliament, UK macroeconomic data comes back into the spotlight ahead of the Bank of England rate decision in August..... Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knee jerk reaction [to the inflation data], carving lows not seen since September 2017, evidences how over-inflated expectations were on the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upcoming decision. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s soft inflation reading will do little to knock the Bank of England off of their implied course, but tail risk of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 resurfacing has increased. Sterling looks to be in for a bleak day, especially as Theresa May will have to fend off grilling during today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prime Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Questions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool predicts that the Bank of England will hike borrowing next month, even though inflationary pressures are less intense than feared. He thinks the BoE will be keen to get an interest rate rise through before Brexit becomes even more tense. Despite inflation getting stuck at 2.4%, I sense that early August is a very convenient time for the MPC members to hike. Why? UK inflation, at 2.4% in the second quarter of 2018, is fully in line with their 2.43% forecast recorded in the May Inflation report. So no surprises there. This, together with the widespread expectation that GDP growth in 2018 Q2 will be higher than the previous quarter figure will encourage MPC members to raise the policy rate. At the same time, with the Parliament moving in recess in less than a week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government will get a much needed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbreathing space\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in terms of Brexit-related tensions. All this implies a very short \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctime window of opportunity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for MPC members to hike in August rather than kicking the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinterest-rate can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 down the road. Inflation is still taking a big chunk out of UK workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pay cheques. At 2.4% in June, consumer prices are rising nearly as fast as earnings, meaning real wages are only up around 0.3%. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdUK CPI inflation remains steady at 2.4%, but it is still above the 2% target and is likely to be stuck close to 2.5% over the summer. The gap between wage growth (2.7%) and inflation remains narrow - just 0.3%. So consumers are likely to remain cautious while their living standards are still rising very slowly. Tej Parikh, Senior Economist at the Institute of Directors, warns that wages are unlikely to rise sharply this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The unchanged inflation rate offers some reprieve for households at a time when wage growth remains uninspiring. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite higher utility bills and petrol costs, consumers may have benefitted from offsetting seasonal discounts, particularly on clothing. The good news should however be taken with a pinch of salt. With the recent weak performance in pay packets, and high street bargains only temporary, the cost of living still remains high. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The stickiness in prices will reduce pressure on the Bank of England to hike interest rates in August. The decision is certainly not set in stone, particularly as wage growth is a key component of inflation, and the recent data shows little promise of a sustained rise in salaries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd UK inflation is still over the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of 2%, meaning prices are rising much faster than the saving rates on offer from the banks. Kate Smith, head of pensions at life insurance firm Aegon, says household budgets are still being squeezed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Financial pressure created by rising prices will continue to hit people on fixed incomes, such as pensioners, the hardest. As people live longer, with more years spent in retirement, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vital they protect their savings from the erosive effects of inflation. Even at relatively low levels of inflation the spending power of \u00c2\u00a3100 in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money could be halved in 20 years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time. June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unchanged inflation rate is a huge surprise, says Tom Stevenson, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International. Inflation had been expected to bounce back up to 2.6% or even 2.7% on the back of higher fuel and energy prices. While these came through, they were offset by falling prices for clothes and games. Inflation remained at 2.4% for the third month in a row. Faster rising prices would have given the Bank of England cover for an interest rate hike next month. Now it looks odds-on that the MPC will hold fire yet again. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s particularly the case after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage growth data emerged weaker than expected at 2.5% including bonuses. Stevenson suspects that the Bank of England will hold off raising interest rates until November, or maybe until 2019.... Economist Philip Shaw of City firm Investec says the pound is suffering from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpolitical trauma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as well as today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker-than-expected inflation data. Jamie McGeever of Reuters predicts that sterling could fall through the $1.30 mark (which would be a new 10-month low) Simon French of Panmure Gordon says that an August interest rate rise looks less likely, especially after UK wage growth slowed to a six-month low yesterday. The pound has hit its lowest level in 10 months, as traders react to this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpectedly weak inflation data. Sterling has dropped to $1.3011, its weakest level since September 2017. The City is calculating that an August interest rate rise is now less likely, as there is less sign that inflationary pressures are building. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153political shenanigans in Westminster\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are also weighing on the pound, following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s narrow victory for Theresa May over her customs plan (see earlier post). This chart shows how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s household heating bills, and petrol costs, drove the cost of living up last month. Clothing, toys and computer games got cheaper, though, meaning inflation was flat month-on-month (rising by 2.4% year-on-year). Men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothing prices fell sharply last month, also helped to keep inflation pegged last month. The ONS says: Prices of clothing fell by 2.3% between May and June this year compared with a fall of 1.1% between the same two months a year ago. Prices usually fall between May and June as the summer sales season begins, but the fall in 2018 is the largest since 2012. The effect came mainly from men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothing. The Office for National Statistics says that recreation got cheaper last month, making up for more expensive energy and fuel. Rising prices for motor fuels and domestic gas and electricity produced the largest upward contributions to change in the rate between May and June 2018. Falling prices for clothing and games, toys and hobbies provided the largest downward effects. At just 2.4%, UK inflation remains at its joint-lowest level in 14 months. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate remained at 2.4% in June, defying expectations that it would rise to 2.6%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for households, given the slowdown in wage growth in the last quarter. It also takes some pressure off the Bank of England to raise interest rates next month. More to follow! UK engineering group Smiths is having a bad morning. Smiths shares are down 7%, after it told the City that some of its medical products have lost certification under the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Medical Device Regulations. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 35 points in early trading, partly thanks to easyJet. The budget airline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have jumped by 3%, after it reported a 14% jump in revenues in the last quarter and also raised its profit forecast. Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor, says easyJet is benefiting from falling competition: The demise of competitors such as Monarch, Air Berlin and Alitalia has opened up the field, ancillary revenue has increased due to a change in passenger behaviour (increasingly paying for additional baggage and allocated seating) and load factors remain high. European stock markets have hit a one-month high this morning, led by technology stocks. The Stoxx 600 has risen by 0.6% today, with the tech sector gaining over 2%. Semiconductor firm ASML and telecoms equipment maker Ericsson are leading the rally, after both beating analyst forecasts this morning. That follows a solid day in Wall Street yesterday, where the Nasdaq hit another record high. With Amazon hitting new peaks, and Netflix recovering from disappointing results earlier this week, the tech boom doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to have ended yet. The pound has dipped below $1.31 against the US dollar this morning, close to its lowest level of 2018. Sterling slumped yesterday when the unemployment figures showed wages growth slowing, potentially making an August interest rate rise less likely. The pound is also being dragged down by Brexit anxiety, after prime minister Theresa May was forced to threaten her own MPs with a general election to force them to back her Brexit plan. Although May won a crucial vote on the customs union last night, she lost on a separate amendment which demanded that the UK remained under EU medicines regulation after leaving the bloc. Given the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s precarious position, City investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced that May can drive her plans through the Commons. Kallum Pickering of Berenberg Bank says the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s challenge is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Like herding cats\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Once again, the Brexiteers have laid bare how difficult it is for UK Prime Minister Theresa May to hold her Conservative government together. Although May had turned her plan for a semi-soft Brexit into the official line of her Cabinet last week, causing prominent dissenters to quit, Brexiteers led by MP Jacob Rees-Mogg forced her on Monday to accept an amendment that would make it even more difficult for the EU to endorse her proposed customs arrangement. The strongly pro-EU House of Lords will probably reject the amendment. After the House of Commons barely passed it anyway (305 for, 302 against), the amendment may not survive a second vote. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain may be facing a new cost of living squeeze. Inflation figures due out this morning are expected to show that prices rose at a faster rate in June, hitting consumers in the pocket. Economists predict that the consumer prices index rose by around 2.6% in June, up from 2.4% in May, partly due to rising energy prices. Sue Trinh of Royal Bank of Canada says: The rise in petrol prices in June should ensure that the transport category continued to make a strong positive contribution to UK inflation. Added to that, a number of pre-announced utility price increases kicked in last month, including a 5.5% rise from the largest energy provider British Gas which came into effect at the end of May. This comes as UK wage growth slows. Yesterday we learned that basic pay only rose by 2.7% in the three months to May, the weakest in six months. If you include bonuses, then total earnings only rose by 2.5%. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures will help to influence whether the Bank of England feels confident enough to raise interest rates next month. If prices are rising faster, then the hawks at the BoE will push for borrowing costs to be hiked. But dovish colleagues may worry that wage growth isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t strong enough. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also inflation day in the eurozone. Consumer prices in the euro area are expected to have risen by 2% in the last year, up from 1.9% in May. Also coming up today Google is bracing for a record fine from the European Commission today, over claims it has abused its dominant position in the mobile phone operating system market. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker, Jerome Powell, is returning to Capitol Hill later for a second day of questioning. Yesterday he told senators that the US economy was growing strongly, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The unemployment rate is low and expected to fall further.

                "bodyText":"And finally, London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market got a small boost from the slump in the pound today. The FTSE 100 has just closed seven points higher at 7683, a gain of 0.1%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty modest gain, but better than elsewhere today - the French and German markets both lost around 0.6%. Sterling is still weak, though, down 0.75 of a cent today at $1.2993, a ten-month low. The City is still concerned by the drop in retail sales last month. Fiona Cincotta of City Index explains why the data is a worry: Whilst hot weather can sometimes encourage consumers to hit the high street, June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heatwave, combined with the World Cup kept consumers away, resulting in non-food retailers suffering from reduced footfall. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results are part of a continuing trend. Retailers in general have been under intense pressure over the past 18 months as squeezed consumers hold back on spending in the face of higher prices and sluggish wage growth. Big names such as Marks and Spencer, Mothercare and House of Fraser have been closing stores in order to reduce costs. Meanwhile internet spending, continued to break news records. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Over in America, the number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefit has hit its lowest level in almost half a century. The initial claims total fell by 8,000 last week to just 207,000, a level not seen since December 1969. Paul Ryan, the Republican House Speaker, has hailed the news: Donald Trump has belatedly spotted that Google has been fined (yesterday) by the European Commission for breaking competition rules in the mobile phone sector. The president reckons it vindicates his criticism of Europe (who he called a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfoe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 last week). The International Monetary Fund has weighed in on Brexit, warning that both sides would lose out if Britain left the EU without a deal. The IMF estimate that Britain would suffer the biggest damage, losing 4% of its GDP. But Ireland would be nearly as badly hit, with the EU as a whole losing 1.5% of its economic output. A timely reminder of the dangers ahead, as negotiators struggle to resolve issues such as the Irish border, and future custom arrangements. More here: Royal Mail\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders have given the company a bloody nose. Around 70% of votes cast by shareholders at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the annual meeting were against the resolution on the director\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remuneration report. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a major rebellion. Investors are unhappy that new CEO, Rico Back, has been handed a 17% pay rise compared to previous boss Moya Greene. Back on the drop in UK retail sales.... and Paul Mumford at Cavendish Asset Management argues that shops can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just blame the weather (or the football!): While hot weather and sporting events have been a great boost for sales of waistcoats, it has clearly diverted shoppers away from some areas of the high street. Other areas such as convenience stores might have seen an increase in footfall due to ice cream sales and ready-made meals. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all too easy to use the weather as an excuse each time figures aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as expected. Whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too hot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too cold\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it seems that some retailers have been unable to find a climate that is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just right\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for them this year. Perhaps businesses would be wise to instead understand these figures as a signal of a downward trend, and adapt accordingly It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gaucho restaurant chain has gone into administration. Deloitte have taken control of the Argentine-themed group, which employs 1,500 people. Hundreds of workers are being laid off immediately, as the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cau chain is being closed. The remaining jobs could also be lost soon, if a buyer for Gaucho can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be found. Just in: US media conglomerate Comcast has abandoned its plan to take over rival 21st Century Fox. In a statement, Comcast says it will focus on its attempt to acquire the broadcaster Sky (which 21CF is also trying to buy.) This leaves Disney clear to pursue its own deal to buy 21CF. Indeed, Comcast chief Brian Roberts has congratulated Disney on winning the race for Fox: However, the Disney-Fox deal could yet be disrupted if Comcast wins the battle to buy Sky (of which Fox owns 39%). Complicated, eh? Newsflash: Two former City traders have been sentenced to jail for conspiring to fix the Euribor interbank lending rate. Reuters has the details: Former star Deutsche Bank trader Christian Bittar and Philippe Moryoussef, who once worked at Barclays, were sentenced to jail by a London court on Thursday for plotting to rig global interest rates. The two Frenchmen, friends outside work who went skiing together, were convicted of conspiracy to defraud by dishonestly manipulating the Euro interbank lending rate (Euribor), a benchmark for trillions of financial contracts and loans, between January 2005 and December 2009 for profit. Bittar, 46, was handed a sentence of five years and four months. Once one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best-paid traders, he pleaded guilty in March and has been in custody since. Moryoussef, 50, was sentenced to eight years after a jury unanimously convicted him last week. He did not take part in the trial, having skipped bail and sought refuge in France. A jury failed to reach a verdict on three other individuals; the Serious Fraud Office said earlier today it will seek a retrial. Last week, Britain was gripped by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s working visit, including a glitzy dinner at Oxfordshire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Blenheim Palace. Some business chiefs stayed away - perhaps nervous of being seen to kowtow to the US president, or simply deterred by his views on migration, protectionism or women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rights. But others donned their evening wear to welcome Turmp. One top UK business leader, Dame Helena Morrissey, has now explained that she took part, because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very important\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to engage with the US at this time. She told Sy News: We engage with companies that we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree with everything they are doing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important that we engage with politicians and countries, particularly the US, which is such an important trading partner for the UK.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Richard Partington on the retail sales data: The World Cup and the summer heatwave kept British shoppers away from the high street last month, despite encouraging stronger sales of food, drink and barbecues across the country. Revealing a surprise fall in retail sales in June, the Office for National Statistics said clothing stores and other non-food retailers suffered from reduced footfall amid the hot weather and football celebrations. The volume of goods sold across the whole of the retail industry dropped by 0.5% last month compared with May, missing City expectations for a rise of 0.2%. Sales at foods stores edged up 0.1% over the month. The latest snapshot from the ONS will add further pressure on the Bank of England to delay an expected rise in interest rates next month after weaker readings for growth in workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pay and inflation, which unexpectedly stayed at a one-year low in June. The surprise fall in retail sales triggered a sell-off of the pound, which fell against the dollar to a 10-month low of just below $1.30. The Financial Times also reckons the much-anticipated August interest rate hike is now in doubt, following June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak retail sales figures. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cat Rutter Pooley says: The pound had been hesitant to test the $1.30 level, despite testing times for Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and her control of the Brexit process \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and underwhelming UK inflation data on Wednesday. The inflation data had already raised questions about the likelihood of the Bank of England being able to raise rates in August, as markets had expected, sending sterling down to $1.3008 on Wednesday before rebounding to $1.3068 at the close. But disappointing retail sales figures for June \u00e2\u20ac\u201d when the current heatwave gripping the UK began \u00e2\u20ac\u201d compounded the price growth figures, sending the pound down below $1.30 and suggesting politics and fundamentals are both exerting a weight. Reuters is reporting that the pound has hit an eight-month low against a basket of rival currencies. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak retail spending (which makes an August interest rate rise less likely) and anxiety over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union. Brexit anxiety is on the rise today, after the European Commission warned member states to prepare for the possibility that the UK tumbles out of the EU without a deal. The pound is also losing ground against the euro, as the drop in retail sales in June disappoints the City. Sterling is down 0.35 of a eurocent at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.12, a four-month low, and bobbing around the $1.30 mark against the US dollar. The World Cup and the long sunny spell brought cheer to some shops, but gloom to others, says Andrew Westbrook, head of retail at RSM. He explains: With record breaking weather and the England team making a stunning start to the World Cup, you might have expected the feelgood factor to translate into bumper retail sales in June but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d only be half right. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSupermarkets appear to have been the big winners with the strongest three-month on three-month growth since May 2001. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also evidence that shoppers splashed out on refreshing their summer wardrobes, upgrading their TVs, ordering in food and gambling. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHowever, footfall on the high street was down in June versus last year, resulting in a monthly decline of 0.5 per cent in the quantity bought in non-food stores. Encouragingly for small retailers, the amount sold by specialist food stores (including butchers and bakers) was up 25.3% in June compared to a year ago. That follows a slump of 17.8% a year ago, and may be due to the growing popularity of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcartisan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 outlets. The warm weather may also have helped here - if people headed to their local butcher for BBQ suppliers or their high street sourdough bakery for picnic treats. Not even internet spending could save the UK retail sector last month, says Kathleen Brooks, research director of Capital Index. She writes: Although retail sales figures can be volatile, there is a growing sense that the UK economy is slowing down sharply, and with the political backdrop deteriorating, the Bank of England needs to have a pretty solid reason for hiking rates when it meets next month. The details of the report are worth noting. Declines in UK sales last month were broad based with clothing and household goods leading the way. Not even the internet could boost the retail sales figures: non-store retailing saw volumes fall by 1.4%, and the annual rate for non-store or internet sales retreated to 9.8% in June, compared with 16.1% in May. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales data shows that Brits spent 0.3% more at petrol stations last month -- due to rising fuel prices. Food spending was flat, while non-food stores suffered a chunky drop in takings. UK retail sales could remain weak if the Brexit negotiations continue to struggle, warns ING economist James Smith. Consumer spending has driven UK growth in recent years, but Simon French of Panmure Gordon reckons those days are over... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, on the consumer spending slowdown: Investors are not willing to back the pound with data disappointing and the political situation becoming even more fractured. Once again, it may be easy to ascribe such a slip in sales to the recent good weather; the combination of the World Cup and the temptation of a pub garden will have kept the hospitality sub-sector buoyant but elsewhere trade will have been lacklustre. We expect a bounce back in July especially with the recent news that holidaymakers are staying home as opposed to hitting the beaches of the Med for their weeks off.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve now learned this week that UK retail sales fell in June, inflation was flat at 2.4%, and wage growth slowed. Is the Bank of England really going to look at this data and conclude that we need higher borrowing costs? Until recently, an August rate hike looked likely. Now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more of a coin-toss. The retail spending picture is less gloomy if you look at the last quarter. Sales are up 2.1% in the April-June period, as Britain shook off its winter gloom. Office for National Statistics senior statistician, Rhian Murphy explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Retail sales grew strongly across the three months to June 2018 as the warm weather encouraged shoppers to buy food and drink for their BBQs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, in June retail sales actually fell back slightly, with continued growth in food sales offset by declining spending in many other shops as consumers stayed away from stores and instead enjoyed the World Cup and the heatwave.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing retail sales have added to the Brexit anxiety enveloping the pound, says Naeem Aslam of City firm Think Markets: The pound has come under brutal selling pressure as the retail sales data was extremely bad. In simple words, the retail data has made the matter worst for the British pound which was already suffering from disappointing inflation number and a tumultuous week of politics. NEWSFLASH: UK retail sales shrank by 0.5% in June. This is much weaker than the 0.2% growth the City expected, and dashed hopes that the warm weather and England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Cup campaign would boost spending. The Office for National Statistics says that football fever and the heatwave may actually have kept people out of the shops. While hot weather and World Cup celebrations increased food store sales, it was suggested by retailers that these factors resulted in a decrease in footfall in non-food stores; which, along with non-store retailing, resulted in a monthly decline of 0.5% in the quantity bought. This has hit the pound hard -- sterling has fallen by three-quarters of a cent to $1.298, its weakest level since last September. Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ Bank, has spotted that China suffered a small capital outflow last month. Not a serious level, but maybe a sign that some nervous companies or individuals are trying to move money abroad. That might intensify, if the yuan keeps falling.... Some underwhelming earnings figures are weighing on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets today. Advertising giant WPP has fallen almost 4% in London, after its French rival Publicis startled traders by reporting a drop in sales in the last three months. UK defence firm Babcock are also suffering, with shares down 9%. It lowering its revenue growth target for this year, partly due to delays in British government spending on submarines. Over in the City, shares in Sports Direct have slumped by almost 10% after it told investors its stake-building in department store chain Debenhams has kocked \u00c2\u00a385m off its profits. Laith Khalaf, Senior Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says the curious \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strategic investment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has cost SPD dearly. Sports Direct now owns 29.7% of Debenhams, just under the 30% threshold which would require a formal takeover bid. The company has a string of such \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strategic investments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which also includes House of Fraser, French Connection and Goals Soccer Centres, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to fathom the precise strategy at play here. Sports Direct is also trying to rebuild its reputation after the exposure of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcVictorian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 working practices at its warehouse. CEO Mike Ashley was quick to flag up that SPD has been ranked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153among the ten companies with the most improved reputation in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd... The Chinese media are reporting that banks are being encouraged to boost lending, and support small firms. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a significant sign that Beijing is taking a more hands-on approach to stimulating the economy; understandably, given the disruption that new US tariffs on Chinese exports could cause. Royal Bank of Canada have summarised the key points: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big banks are now being given cash and told to go and lend more/buy corporate bonds amid the sharp contraction in shadow banking Local news sources are reporting that the Chinese Banking and Insurance regulator (CSRC) has asked financial institutions to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153earnestly implement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd plans to help reduce financing costs for small firms (the ones with generally lower credit ratings), saying that big lenders (state banks) should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153take the lead\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd China Business News reported the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China plans the use of its medium term lending facility (MLF) to encourage bank loans and investment in lower-rated corporate debt. These moves help to explain why the yuan is weakening today. China is easing monetary policy, at a time when other central banks are trying to unwind their stimulus programmes or raise interest rates. As Sue Trinh of RBC puts it: The Chinese central bank will be buying (more) corporate bonds and China is doing more QE as the rest of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major central banks march toward tightening/policy normalisation. The selloff is gathering pace, as traders spot that Beijing isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t intervening to prop its currency up again. The yuanis now down 0.6% today at 6.7876 per dollar in offshore trading, a new one-year low. Margaret Yang Yan of CMC Markets says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Gravity is doing its job again as monetary policy diverges further between US and China\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Gao Qi, foreign exchange strategist at Scotiabank, blames the US-China trade spat for the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness....and predicts it will continue. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Market concerns resulting from uncertainty such as trade war continue to weigh on sentiment. Investors will keep pushing the yuan to 6.8 per dollar. The PBOC will step in, if one-sided depreciation pressures are seen. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank is deliberately letting the yuan depreciate, says Hannah Anderson of J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In contrast to earlier this year, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness seems to reflect a more explicit policy decision. After signaling it would accept more volatility in the currency, the PBoC has followed up by lowering the daily fixing rate. Policy makers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 responsiveness to market pressures that have been building all year is encouraging, especially as China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system seeks to become more globally integrated. She adds that the yuan is likely to keep weakening, given the slowdown in Chinese growth, and the strength of the US dollar. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The Chinese yuan has hit a one-year low, as trade war fears continue to loom over the global economy. The yuan, which is usually closely controlled by Beijing, has slipped to 6.784 against the US dollar in offshore trading. That suggests that Chinese policymakers are allowing their currency to weaken, in the face of anxiety over the tariffs being imposed by the US. The yuan has suffered steady losses in recent months - it was trading around 6.3 to the US dollar back in April, before Donald Trump ratcheted up the pressure on Beijing: Previously, the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China has intervened in the markets to prevent the yuan falling through the 6.7 mark. Not any more, it seems. Bloomberg explains: The fixing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153signals the PBOC is not defending any line in the sand for the exchange rate and is comfortable with gradual yuan depreciation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Tommy Xie, an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore. The signs of easing are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certainly not supportive to the yuan, and the currency may see another wave of selling pressures ahead.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A weaker currency will help Chinese exporters to cushion the blow of US tariffs (as it makes their goods more competitive). But it will also fuel concerns that China may be heading for bumpier times, especially after growth weakened a little in the last three months.... Also coming up today Retail sales data will show whether UK shops got a much-needed World Cup boost. Economist predict that takings were 3.5% higher than a year ago in June Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had the feelgood factor of an England football team reaching the semi-finals of the World Cup as well as some scorching weather which is likely to have prompted some decent spending on big screen TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, clothing, food and drink and gardening paraphernalia. Consumer giant Unilever and high street retailer Sports Direct are reporting results this morning. Neither look too impressive. Unilever seems to have missed City forecasts - posting underlying sales growth of 1.9%, vs expectations of 2.2% for the last quarter.

She gives a small, hard smile when asked about the coverage.</p> <p>She should not really be surprised. The number of women running businesses, let alone institutions of the stature of the NYSE, is still small. And the number of women running the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top 500 companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c many listed on the NYSE \u00e2\u20ac\u201c <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/05/21/women-fortune-500-2018/\">fell this year.</a></p> <p>The floor of the stock exchange itself is also still a sausage fest.

She says her surprise at the attention her appointment has brought may be because, in retrospect, she has always been gender-blind.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I always liked maths, science and problem-solving, so I gravitated towards engineering,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Cunningham, who grew up in New Jersey, the fourth child of six, three boys, three girls. (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m the well-adjusted middle child,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says.) She says she is disappointed that more girls don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go into science and maths, but in her own case it was the obvious choice: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think about that at all.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f63519fcaf9c53044cc9a7c3aa870e65cfb85196\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f63519fcaf9c53044cc9a7c3aa870e65cfb85196/0_362_5400_3239/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Fearless Girl statue\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the move ... Fearless Girl will soon stand outside the NYSE.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Lennihan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Cunningham was at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, studying industrial engineering, one of her sisters asked her to report back on the date-worthiness of the boys in her class. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As I looked around the classroom, I realised I was the only girl in the class \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and I had been in that class for weeks. I had no idea that I was the only girl in the class, because I just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a consistent theme. Until about four weeks ago [now two months ago, when she was appointed], when it was actually hard to tune out the fact that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a woman in this industry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>She must have had to tune out a lot. She first entered the NYSE in 1994 as an intern, when she was one of about 30 women among 1,000 men. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I walked in and right away I fell in love with the place,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153energy and the pace\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd reminded her of her family. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What struck me right away was the sense of community.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>After she graduated, she came back to the NYSE, working on the trading floor until 2005, when she took time off to complete a culinary training course. She then worked at a rival stock exchange, the Nasdaq, as director of capital markets, before rejoining the NYSE and becoming the exchange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief operating officer in 2015.</p> <p>She acknowledges that things have changed for women at the NYSE in the decades since she first worked here. For one, they have proper bathrooms. When she started, women had to make do with one tiny bathroom converted from a phone booth, while the men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bathrooms had a palatial lounge area.</p> <p>But she never experienced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/24/sexism-in-banking-its-happening-and-its-complicated\">the rampant sexism other women in finance have complained about</a>, she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you walked through a trading floor 20 years ago as a woman, there was a little bit of you that could feel the room looking at you,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. But she says she never experienced any behaviour that made her uncomfortable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Whether or not NYSE is sheltering a marketing operation or a vital financial institution is the least of its problems</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153In my experience, if I said to somebody: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHey, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not OK, too much,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and I said it with a smile, too, then they knew,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says, giving that tight little smile again. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whether it was the language people used, or something else that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appreciate, I just made it clear where I stood and I felt that I was respected for it. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not saying that every woman would have had that same experience. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure there are women who tried to draw lines and they were ignored. I was fortunate that when I drew lines people stayed outside them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Cunningham takes over the top spot at a challenging moment for the NYSE. Some of that is on view during my visit. I arrive for the opening bell that marks the beginning of the trading day and is a fixture of the financial news cable TV shows. We are corralled into a holding pen in line of the TV cameras as Cunningham rings the bell, alongside executives from BJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, a discount warehouse retailer, who are celebrating the launch of its share sale on the NYSE.</p> <p>The mood is frenetic, celebratory, somewhere between a graduation and the start of a race. But the energy is inside the corral, generated by the people who work for BJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, the exchange or the media organisations that report from the floor. Outside the pen, the number of brokers employed on the NYSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vast floor is in the hundreds, not the thousands of years gone by. You leave with the impression things will be pretty quiet once the opening ceremony is over.</p> <p>Most stock trading is now done electronically, principally from a far less photogenic datacentre in New Jersey. Its critics claim the exchange is a dog and pony show \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Disneyland for capitalism, a marketing exercise where CEOs can ring a bell and a few traders run about looking busy for the cameras while the algorithms do the real work.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153That floor is a TV station,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says one senior Wall Street executive, who did not want to be named. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is pomp and circumstance, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing but a bunch of clapping seals.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4f5e7555aa042c5d776e3d339ac5cdc53e16efa7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f5e7555aa042c5d776e3d339ac5cdc53e16efa7/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stacey Cunningham on the floor of the NYSE\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhat struck me right away was the sense of community\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ... Cunningham on the floor of the NYSE.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cunningham and the NYSE could not disagree more. Algorithms cannot compete with human discernment and experience, or with days of big news. Cunningham mentions the day of the Brexit vote, for example \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the human touch helped calm jitters. People bring \u00e2\u20ac\u0153judgment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One analogy we often use to describe how people add to that equation is an airline pilot. So, a plane can take off and land without a pilot. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to have a human being in the cockpit. But that human being adds value, especially during the most tumultuous times,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says.</p> <p>Frankly, however, the argument over whether or not the NYSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much photographed neoclassical facade is sheltering a marketing operation or a vital financial institution is the least of its problems.</p> <p>One issue for all the exchanges, but the NYSE in particular, is that there are fewer and fewer share sales like that of BJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Big companies such as Uber, Airbnb and WeWork are choosing to stay private for longer, powered by huge piles of private equity money.</p> <p>Rival exchanges are also chipping away at the NYSE and other establishment players. The NYSE accounts for about 22% of stocks traded in the US, but that is down from about one-third of trading in 2009. It now competes with dozens of less high-profile trading platforms, such as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dark pools\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (exchanges run in-house by big banks such as Goldman Sachs that account for 40% of trading); Nasdaq, its closest competitor, where tech companies including Apple and Facebook are listed; the Chicago Board Options Exchange; and IEX, the exchange set up by Brad Katsuyama, a central character in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/03/michael-lewis-i-knew-flash-boys-would-be-a-bombshell\">Michael Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s book Flash Boys</a>, about high-speed traders.</p> <p>The competition \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and some investors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are pressing the NYSE and the Nasdaq on their fees, while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main financial watchdog, has a pilot scheme under review that aims to assess how, and if, the complex system of fees and rebates the NYSE and others pay to brokers for trading on their exchange affects trading.</p> <p>Critics argue that the rebates on broking fees offered by the NYSE and others to encourage traders to use their market create a conflict of interest. They incentivise brokers to send their customer orders to exchanges that pay the biggest ones, even if their clients might be better served elsewhere.</p> <p>The two-year pilot, which has the support of some huge pension funds, would allow the SEC to assess their impact on how trades are made. But Cunningham says the scheme is poorly designed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it does not include the dark pools, for example \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the Nasdaq has hinted that it may sue to stop the scheme.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df6e62a312fb2873ede0fe20856eeb072627b50e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df6e62a312fb2873ede0fe20856eeb072627b50e/0_382_5941_3565/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cunningham and executives from BJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ring the exchange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bell to announce the wholesale retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share sale\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sound investment ...

Ryan, who runs a rival exchange that has been involved in <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-05-18/s70518-4022871-167340.pdf\">a public spat with the NYSE over the fees study</a>, says the NYSE is too dependent on the fees it charges for data and is on the wrong side over rebates.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you have all of your constituents annoyed about how you are extracting money from the street, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unsustainable,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Look, in 2002, Blockbuster was a video rental store, but something like 70% of their profits came from charging late fees. That was obviously not a sustainable model. I think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a correlation to this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>There is no air of crisis at the NYSE, which has dismissed IEX as an exchange with a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-05-18/s70518-4022871-167340.pdf\">\u00e2\u20ac\u0153clearly failing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</a> business model.</p> <p>And Cunningham does not believe the NYSE is in trouble. The financial world may be changing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and fast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the NYSE remains the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most famous stock market. She is confident it can adapt and keep its pre-eminent position.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The future of equity markets is increasingly global, technology-focused and data-driven,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. In that world, she believes the NYSE \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is uniquely positioned\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to leverage its huge footprint, and technology, to stay ahead of the pack.</p> <p>On a brief tour of the recently refurbished NYSE \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it looks like a particularly nice outpost of the luxury hotel chain W Hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we pop into a room full of portraits of past presidents \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all pale males. One day, Cunningham will be up there, too. It is quite a first, even if she does not seem keen to acknowledge it. Perhaps Fearless Girl will ensure she is not the last.</p>",

I had no idea that I was the only girl in the class, because I just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a consistent theme. Until about four weeks ago [now two months ago, when she was appointed], when it was actually hard to tune out the fact that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a woman in this industry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She must have had to tune out a lot. She first entered the NYSE in 1994 as an intern, when she was one of about 30 women among 1,000 men. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I walked in and right away I fell in love with the place,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153energy and the pace\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd reminded her of her family. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What struck me right away was the sense of community.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After she graduated, she came back to the NYSE, working on the trading floor until 2005, when she took time off to complete a culinary training course. She then worked at a rival stock exchange, the Nasdaq, as director of capital markets, before rejoining the NYSE and becoming the exchange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief operating officer in 2015. She acknowledges that things have changed for women at the NYSE in the decades since she first worked here. For one, they have proper bathrooms. When she started, women had to make do with one tiny bathroom converted from a phone booth, while the men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bathrooms had a palatial lounge area. But she never experienced the rampant sexism other women in finance have complained about, she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you walked through a trading floor 20 years ago as a woman, there was a little bit of you that could feel the room looking at you,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. But she says she never experienced any behaviour that made her uncomfortable. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In my experience, if I said to somebody: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHey, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not OK, too much,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and I said it with a smile, too, then they knew,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says, giving that tight little smile again. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whether it was the language people used, or something else that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appreciate, I just made it clear where I stood and I felt that I was respected for it. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not saying that every woman would have had that same experience. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure there are women who tried to draw lines and they were ignored. I was fortunate that when I drew lines people stayed outside them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cunningham takes over the top spot at a challenging moment for the NYSE. Some of that is on view during my visit. I arrive for the opening bell that marks the beginning of the trading day and is a fixture of the financial news cable TV shows. We are corralled into a holding pen in line of the TV cameras as Cunningham rings the bell, alongside executives from BJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, a discount warehouse retailer, who are celebrating the launch of its share sale on the NYSE. The mood is frenetic, celebratory, somewhere between a graduation and the start of a race. But the energy is inside the corral, generated by the people who work for BJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, the exchange or the media organisations that report from the floor. Outside the pen, the number of brokers employed on the NYSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vast floor is in the hundreds, not the thousands of years gone by. You leave with the impression things will be pretty quiet once the opening ceremony is over. Most stock trading is now done electronically, principally from a far less photogenic datacentre in New Jersey. Its critics claim the exchange is a dog and pony show \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Disneyland for capitalism, a marketing exercise where CEOs can ring a bell and a few traders run about looking busy for the cameras while the algorithms do the real work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That floor is a TV station,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says one senior Wall Street executive, who did not want to be named. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is pomp and circumstance, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing but a bunch of clapping seals.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cunningham and the NYSE could not disagree more. Algorithms cannot compete with human discernment and experience, or with days of big news. Cunningham mentions the day of the Brexit vote, for example \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the human touch helped calm jitters. People bring \u00e2\u20ac\u0153judgment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One analogy we often use to describe how people add to that equation is an airline pilot. So, a plane can take off and land without a pilot. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to have a human being in the cockpit. But that human being adds value, especially during the most tumultuous times,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. Frankly, however, the argument over whether or not the NYSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much photographed neoclassical facade is sheltering a marketing operation or a vital financial institution is the least of its problems. One issue for all the exchanges, but the NYSE in particular, is that there are fewer and fewer share sales like that of BJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Big companies such as Uber, Airbnb and WeWork are choosing to stay private for longer, powered by huge piles of private equity money. Rival exchanges are also chipping away at the NYSE and other establishment players. The NYSE accounts for about 22% of stocks traded in the US, but that is down from about one-third of trading in 2009. It now competes with dozens of less high-profile trading platforms, such as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dark pools\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (exchanges run in-house by big banks such as Goldman Sachs that account for 40% of trading); Nasdaq, its closest competitor, where tech companies including Apple and Facebook are listed; the Chicago Board Options Exchange; and IEX, the exchange set up by Brad Katsuyama, a central character in Michael Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s book Flash Boys, about high-speed traders. The competition \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and some investors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are pressing the NYSE and the Nasdaq on their fees, while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main financial watchdog, has a pilot scheme under review that aims to assess how, and if, the complex system of fees and rebates the NYSE and others pay to brokers for trading on their exchange affects trading. Critics argue that the rebates on broking fees offered by the NYSE and others to encourage traders to use their market create a conflict of interest. They incentivise brokers to send their customer orders to exchanges that pay the biggest ones, even if their clients might be better served elsewhere. The two-year pilot, which has the support of some huge pension funds, would allow the SEC to assess their impact on how trades are made. But Cunningham says the scheme is poorly designed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it does not include the dark pools, for example \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the Nasdaq has hinted that it may sue to stop the scheme. It is a complicated issue, but one that will require Cunningham to spend more of her time in Washington. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The biggest worry for her is that the regulatory tailwinds are going the other way,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ronan Ryan, the president of IEX. Ryan, who runs a rival exchange that has been involved in a public spat with the NYSE over the fees study, says the NYSE is too dependent on the fees it charges for data and is on the wrong side over rebates. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you have all of your constituents annoyed about how you are extracting money from the street, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unsustainable,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Look, in 2002, Blockbuster was a video rental store, but something like 70% of their profits came from charging late fees. That was obviously not a sustainable model. I think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a correlation to this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There is no air of crisis at the NYSE, which has dismissed IEX as an exchange with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clearly failing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd business model. And Cunningham does not believe the NYSE is in trouble. The financial world may be changing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and fast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the NYSE remains the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most famous stock market. She is confident it can adapt and keep its pre-eminent position. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The future of equity markets is increasingly global, technology-focused and data-driven,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. In that world, she believes the NYSE \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is uniquely positioned\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to leverage its huge footprint, and technology, to stay ahead of the pack. On a brief tour of the recently refurbished NYSE \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it looks like a particularly nice outpost of the luxury hotel chain W Hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we pop into a room full of portraits of past presidents \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all pale males. One day, Cunningham will be up there, too. It is quite a first, even if she does not seem keen to acknowledge it. Perhaps Fearless Girl will ensure she is not the last.",

The dollar index has seen some outflows, with the safe-haven yen a beneficiary as investors cut back on risk thanks to the trade war rhetoric.

                "bodyText":"President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s controversial comments that the Federal Reserve is wrong to raise US interest rates and his new threats to impose tariffs on $500bn worth of Chinese imports have unsettled investors as the trading week winds to a close. The dollar was damaged by the remarks, giving some support to Wall Street. But European markets likely to be hit by any escalation of trade tensions, Germany in particular, came under pressure. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.07% or 5.18 points at 7678.79 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.98% to 12,561.42 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.35% lower at 5398.32 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.41% to 21,794.60 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex edged up 0.04% to 9724.8 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 29 points or 0.12%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. Stock markets are likely to remain under pressure even if this latest trade dispute blows over, says Oliver Jones at Capital Economics: We suspect that equities across Emerging Asia would slump once more if President Trump followed through with his latest tariff threat. Stock markets in Europe would probably be hit even harder than they have been so far too. Meanwhile, although the S&amp;P 500 has proved fairly resilient to trade worries so far, and has actually risen since they resurfaced in June, we doubt that this will last. The retaliation by other countries to US protectionism so far has mostly been aimed at US farmers, not US multinationals. But that could change. In particular, we suspect that China will start to target US multinationals operating in China directly rather than imposing more tariffs of its own. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, even if this latest escalation in the trade war is somehow averted, we think that there are other reasons to be pessimistic about the outlook for equities in both the US and the rest of the world. Regardless of the direction of US trade policy, we think that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy will lose more momentum over the rest of this year, and forecast that the US economy will slow sharply in 2019 as the cumulative effects of Fed tightening and the fading fiscal boost start to bite. With this in mind, we forecast that the S&amp;P 500 will fall to 2,300 by the end of next year, compared to just over 2,800 now, and think that equities in the rest of the world will fall sharply too. Stock markets are off their worst levels, although European indices are struggling compared with the UK and Wall Street. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: After a few days without trade war headlines the topic has come back to life, as Trump turns the trade war rhetoric all the way up to 11 with his announcement that $500 billion of Chinese goods could suffer penalties. Having come away from the NATO summit with an apparent win using his strong-arm negotiating tactics, this move appears designed to bring the Chinese to the table. Markets have recovered from their initial shock, perhaps indicating that this kind of newflash is starting to lose its power. The news spoiled the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to move above the 7700 zone, which has held back progress for over a month now, while once again the Dax is taking the news on the chin, shedding 150 points as the week winds down and wiping out most of the progress made over the past few days. Another trend undergoing a reversal is that of the US dollar, which has fallen back today after weeks of gains. The dollar index has seen some outflows, with the safe-haven yen a beneficiary as investors cut back on risk thanks to the trade war rhetoric. However, the ongoing rally is not finished yet it seems, Jerome Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments this week having made it clear that the Fed has no intention of deviating from current policy, regardless of the views of the White House. The dollar remains in the doldrums as the US currency continues to react to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complaints about its current strength, along with investor concerns about the escalating trade war tensions with China. The dollar index, a measure of its value against a basket of other major currencies, is down 0.6% after it reached a one year high on Thursday. The weakness of the dollar has benefited the pound, which is up 0.73% to $1.3107 against the US currency, despite the continuing uncertainties over Brexit. One of the US central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s members has responded to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments. Reuters reports: The Federal Reserve will remain unaffected by President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on U.S. monetary policy and is focused on achieving the goals set for it by Congress, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said on Friday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The (Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy-setting) committee has a mandate to keep inflation low and stable and obtain maximum employment for the U.S. economy, so people can comment, including the president and other politicians, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up to the committee to try to take the best action we can to achieve those objectives,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bullard told reporters following an event in Glasgow, Kentucky. US markets have made a nervous start but the falls are not as bad as had been feared earlier. Investors are of course concerned about the latest threats from Donald Trump about imposing tariffs on $500bn worth of Chinese imports to the US, but there is some support for markets from Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast beating results. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 26 points while the S&amp;P 500 opened just 0.06% lower. The Nasdaq Composite managed to edge up slightly, up 0.19% at the start of trading. Still with trade, and German chancellor Angela Merkel said in her annual news conference that US complaints only take into account the trade in good. When trade in services and repatriation of profits are included the figures favour the US, she said. She criticised the tit for tat tariffs imposed or threatened by the US and China: We see these potential tariffs both as a breach of WTO rules and also as a danger to the prosperity of many in the world. Back with the US, and Trump is continuing his attack on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trade deals: Over in Canada, inflation figures came in higher than forecast. The annual rate rose to 2.5% in June from 2.2% the previous month, more than the expected figure of 2.3%. This is the highest figure since February 2012. And so does the Federal Reserve again: Trump has now turned from trade wars back to currency wars, and this time Europe is getting it too. The latest Trump tariff attack on China at least keeps Europe on the sidelines for the moment, sayd Edward Rumble, co-manager of the RWC Continental European Equity fund. He said: The potential for more restrictive trade between nations may be a serious threat to global growth, and the steady increase in rhetoric and retaliatory actions was already worrying prior to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest comments. One thing for European investors to consider is that, if Trump is obsessed with China, it does at least temporarily keep his sights off Germany and other European nations. However, given Germany has a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100bn trade surplus with the US, at some stage he will likely come for them as well. Such actions represent a reversal of a 50-year trend to more liberal trade that has helped fuel economic prosperity around the world for decades. Not surprisingly, many companies are not well prepared for such a scenario, indeed they have been taking advantage of the open environment to optimise manufacturing efficiency on a global basis. In many cases, the current structure will not be optimal if trade barriers require local production in end markets to ensure competitiveness. The current escalation in trade war rhetoric makes sense in the context of November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mid=term elections, says Will Hobbs, head of investment Strategy at Barclays Smart Investor. He said: We cannot pretend to know for sure that this is all part of a crude negotiating strategy on the part of the US administration. However, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp escalation makes sense in such a context, particularly with the midterm campaign trail on the horizon - The White House needs to force their opponents to swerve first in this game of trade chicken. On the other side, the political nature of the tariffs threatened to date, such as soybeans, suggests that the Chinese administration see a potential weakness in the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approaching moment of indirect electoral accountability. As November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US midterm elections loom larger, we see economic and political self-interest helping to de-escalate the scrap. In the meantime, the potential for capital markets to be dragged into a disciplinary role suggests investors will again need to call upon their stores of composure to see this through. Olaf van den Heuvel, chief investment officer at Aegon Asset Management, warns that the US president risks destabilising the global economy, and the financial markets: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So far the Trump trade policy has been more about creating leverage in a negotiation than about levying actual tariffs. Of course, as in a game of poker, you sometimes have to up the ante. The risks are high at this level. The impact on world economic growth of a levy of this magnitude will be severe and will likely have a strong negative impact on markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Donald Trump is adamant that he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be knocked off course by stock market volatility. Wall Street is up around 30% since the 2016 presidential election, which Trump says gives him a cushion to challenge China et al on trade. He put it to CNBC: This is the time. You know the expression we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re playing with the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Investor, though, will consider that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their money, and fear that a trade war will wipe out their recent gains. European car shares are falling sharply, following president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to deepen the trade dispute with China. Volkswagen are down 2.3%, and BMW have lost 1.5%, on fears that the US could impose tariffs on EU car imports soon. Artjom Hatsaturjants, research analyst at Accendo Markets, says market sentiment has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153soured\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd since Trump threatened to go \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhole hog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and impose tariffs on all $500B of Chinese imports to the US. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another clip, of Donald Trump explaining why he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not thrilled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that the US Federal Reserve keeps raising American interest rates: CNBC have now released a video clip of their interview with president Trump. In it, Trump claims that America is being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taken advantage of\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by China, the EU, Mexico, and Japan, because they all run trade surpluses with the US. Specifically on China, Trump says America is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153down a tremendous amount\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - with a trade deficit of at least $375bn - and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to fix it. The president then threatens to put tariffs on all China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $500bn of imports, because Beijing retaliated against America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial tariffs on $50bn of goods earlier this year. And he batted away the prospect that Wall Street might plunge if a trade war broke out. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key quotes: Trump: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I raised 50, and they matched us. I said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcyou don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t match us, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t match us because otherwise we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re always gonna be behind the A ball\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd CNBC: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Would you ever get to 500, though?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m ready to go to 500\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd CNBC: With the mid-terms on the horizon? What if the stock market were to go down? Trump: If it does it does. CNBC: [what if it falls] 20%? Trump: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m doing this to do the right thing for our country. We have been ripped off by China for a long time. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the video clip: Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to launch a full-blooded trade war with China has alarmed investors. US stock market futures are falling, suggesting that shares will drop when trading begins in three hours. In London, the FTSE 100 is now in the red, down 30 points at 7652, having been slightly higher earlier. NEWSFLASH: CNBC are now broadcasting their full interview with president Trump (they only released the snippet attacking the Federal Reserve yesterday). The new top line? Trump is threatening to hit China with a new wave of tariffs, which would drive up the cost of ALL Chinese imports into America, worth around $500bn per year. Trump told CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Squawk Box show that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m ready to go to 500\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, if China doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bow to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complaints about its trade policies. He added: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not doing this for politics, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m doing this to do the right thing for our country..... We have been ripped off by China for a long time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump denied that he is acting maliciously towards China, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want them to be scared. I want them to do well...I really like President Xi a lot, but it was very unfair.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So far, America has imposed 10% tariffs on $34bn of Chinese imports (which could soon rise to $50bn). Another $200bn of goods (including food, chemicals and consumer goods) could be hit by 10% levies in September. So far, China has announced reciprocal tariffs on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first wave of penalties. However, it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t retaliate if Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153goes to 500\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as it only buys less than $200bn of US goods each year. Donald Trump should blame himself, not the Federal Reserve, for the strengthening dollar, argues Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA. Erlam writes that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent tax cuts have stimulated the US economy, at a time when it was doing pretty well anyway...... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite clear to most people that part of the reason for the Fed raising rates at the current pace is the tax reform measures passed at the end of last year, when the economy was already running hot. This is also partially responsible for the dollar rising against other currencies, particularly the yuan and euro, which has suffered further as the President has sought to start a trade war with both. Trump is not one to accept responsibility for such events and now appears to be actively trying to push the blame onto others in a clear attempt to halt the rise in the greenback, the strengthening of which could weigh on the economy and soften the impact of the trade measures he is taking against other countries. Reuters points out that Donald Trump has made several public comments about the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength since taking office....something most US leaders have avoided. Back in the UK, the long task of fixing the public finances continues. New figures show that Britain borrowed \u00c2\u00a35.4bn to balance the books in June 2018, \u00c2\u00a3800m less than in June 2017. So far this financial year, the UK has borrowed \u00c2\u00a316.8bn; \u00c2\u00a35.4bn less than in the same period in 2017, and the lowest April-June borrowing since 2007 (before the financial crisis). Mike Jakeman of PwC reckons this gives the government some ammunition to cut taxes or boost spending in the autumn Budget. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management has a deliciously acerbic take on Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack on the Fed: US President Trump signalled unhappiness with Federal Reserve rate increases. This was in a TV interview, not a tweet, so it is not official administration policy. The decline of global inflation in the past quarter century was nothing to do with globalization, and nothing to do with technology. It was due mainly to central bank independence. Challenging independence is high risk. The Fed, even when run by a lawyer rather than a properly qualified economist, is not likely to alter policy direction. The Fed should tighten because deficit-financed tax cuts at a time of strong growth are unnecessary and need to be offset. However, US President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent consumer tax increases [tariffs] may slow the economy and reduce the need for rapid rate rises. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to emphasise that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of the Federal Reserve is pretty unusual. The whole point of central bank independence is that interest rates can rise or fall without political interference. That prevents governments from slashing borrowing costs to get a pre-election boom, creating an inflationary spike, forcing rates to go up again, slowing the economy, creating a recession.... Bart Hordijk, market analyst at Monex Europe, says Trump is acting more like the leader of an emerging market economy when he declares that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not thrilled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by US interest rate rises. Hordijk writes: The US dollar sold off across the globe [after Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack] and the question on every FX trader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind is; is the US becoming the new Turkey? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The answer seems, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no, but....\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Turkish lira lost almost 30% of its value this year mostly because Turkish President Recep Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is firmly set against higher rates (just like Trump) and is attacking the independence of the central bank (just like Trump). Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is notorious for criticising Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, and calling for lower interest rates. Earlier this month he even put his son-in-law in charge of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ministry of Finance and Treasury. Trump hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reached that point (Jared Kushner has other duties, anyway). Hordijk says: The big difference however is that the institutions in both countries widely differ and there are miles more of legal obstacles and checks and balances in place before Trump even gets close to have a direct say in the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate policy. Additionally Erdogan seems surrounded by a group of yes men, while Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team sometimes still keep him in check, as evidenced by Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders who went into damage control mode after the comments were made and reconfirmed Trump respects the independence of the Fed. But even so, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to fire a warning shot at the Fed should worry the markets... After starting a trade war, giving tax hand outs to the rich that will likely blow up the US fiscal deficit and antagonizing NATO allies while befriending despotic leaders, this latest action of Trump further establishes the pattern of his capricious, often short term focus. That in itself is a scary observation and an understandable reason why the dollar sold off.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd President Trump has set \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more cats among even more pigeons\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with his comments about interest rates and the dollar yesterday. So says Kit Juckes, foreign exchange expert at French bank Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale. Juckes doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence is now in doubt. And as long as [Fed chair] Jay Powell &amp; Co respond to a strong economy and easy fiscal policy with measured policy tightening, they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to send bond yields or the dollar down on their own. However, he also expects more fireworks if China allows its currency to keep sliding: As long as the renminbi is falling in an orderly manner, there is little urgency for the Chinese authorities to counter it. Whether or not China is wittingly undertaking a depreciation policy, the question will increasingly be on investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds as the slide deepens. And the Trump Administration is unlikely to keep quiet for long either The Trump administration is determined to push down their currency, says Neil Wilson of Markets.com. A cheaper dollar would help US companies compete abroad, a key plank of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to make trade \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfairer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Wilson writes: A clear pattern is emerging \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Donald Trump wants a weaker dollar. Prior to his inauguration he said the dollar was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctoo strong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Then earlier this year Treasury secretary Mnuchin echoed those comments when he openly questioned the strong dollar policy. The Mnuchin effect lasted until the middle of April, but since then the dollar has been on the rise again, with the dollar index hitting 95, a level not seen since November last year. When you look at the trade policies he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pursuing, a weaker dollar makes sense. The only problem is that an all-out trade war, by making dollars scarcer, will force up the greenback against its peers. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention raises the dangers of a full-blown currency war, says Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group. He says China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response - letting the yuan weaken sharply - is significant. As Trump moaned about the strength of the dollar, the PBOC devalued the yuan by the most since 2016, sending a chill through the markets. Interpreted as China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to the US trade war \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the starting of a currency war- risk off is prevailing with traders selling out of equities sending Asian markets and European futures sharply lower. It was only a month ago when China denied that they would start a currency war following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s action. A lot can change in a month under Trump. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of the Fed came after the US dollar hit a one-year high against a basket of other major currencies. The dollar has strengthened thanks to several US interest rate rises, and the prospect of more to come. US interest rates are now 2% - up from just 0.25% after the financial crisis - with the Fed likely to push through two more quarter-point increases this year. In contrast, eurozone interest rates are zero, while the UK Bank Rate is just 0.5%. Trump singled out China for particular criticism last night, saying it was letting the yuan drop \u00e2\u20ac\u0153like a rock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be pleased by Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China let the yuan hit a new one-year low today, fixing the currency at 6.7671 per dollar. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly 1% weaker than Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fix. The yuan then tumbled lower in nervous trading, hitting 6.812 to the dollar. That prompted a reaction; Chinese banks began buying the yuan and selling dollars, apparently in an attempt to prop the currency up. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With trade war fears mounting and Brexit looming, investors already have plenty to worry about. But Donald Trump has added a new anxiety -- currency wars. Overnight, the US president launched a rare attack on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bankers, revealing that he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy with their plans to raise US interest rates. Trump claimed that the Federal Reserve risked undermining all his good work strengthening the economy. He told CNBC that higher borrowing costs would drive up the dollar, especially as other central banks are keeping policy loose. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really \u00e2\u20ac\u201d I am not happy about it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like all of this work that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re putting into the economy and then I see rates going up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You could almost hear Fed chair Jerome Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyebrows rising sharply as Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments hit the wires. Central bank independence is a serious issue - policymakers are meant to navigate the economic squalls and storms free from political interference. But Trump clearly doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t play by the rules, so traders now have to calculate whether White House pressure is going to influence the path of interest rates. And if so, is that going to set off a currency war? Powell may feel Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism is particularly misplaced, as the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax-cutting agenda is putting pressure on the Fed to act, to prevent a dangerous inflationary bubble. Trump insisted that Powell was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very good man\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but even so the president \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t thrilled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the prospect of further interest rate hikes. The White House tried to row back on Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, insisting that he respected the independence of the Fed. But still, his intervention hit the markets, as CNBC explains: Financial markets across the globe whipsawed on Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments. The dollar index, which tracks the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance against a basket of six other currencies, fell from a one-year high and traded just below breakeven. U.S. equities edged off their session lows, but remained lower on the day. Also coming up today June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK public finances are released this morning. The City predicts that Britain borrowed around \u00c2\u00a35bn to balance the books last month, much the same as in May. 9.30am BST: UK public finances for June 1.30pm BST: Canadian inflation figures",

                "bodyText":"The war of words over Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose wide-ranging tariffs on imports from China and the European Union has intensified after the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said the levies threatened the incomes of workers across the world. On Friday, Merkel described possible US tariffs on imported cars as a breach of World Trade Organization rules and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a real threat to the prosperity of many in the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as Trump went on US television to say that he was ready to expand his roster of tariffs on Beijing to $500bn, covering almost every product imported to the US from China. Earlier, Trump said on Twitter that the US \u00e2\u20ac\u0153should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and bad trade deals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Stock markets slipped back on the news, with the German Dax the worst hit. The Frankfurt-based index tumbled 144 points, or 1.1% to 12,542. The FTSE 100 dropped almost 60 points in response to the tit-for-tat battle before ending the day down just 5 points at 7,678. The dollar index, a measure of its value against a basket of other major currencies, was down 0.6% after it reached a one year high on Thursday. For several months the Trump administration has ramped up its campaign to force rival economies to end what it believes are artificial subsidies and restrictive practices that deny US firms access to their markets. Trump has also been angered by central bank policies he says keep rival currencies low compared with the dollar, making US exports expensive. In his attempts to promote a more favourable exchange rate, Trump rounded on the US central bank, the Federal Resrve, for pressing ahead with interest rate hikes, thereby making the US a more popular destination for global savings and pushing up the value of the dollar. Merkel accepted during her annual summer news conference in Berlin that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regular jibes at Germany \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certainly have something to do with our economic size\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I try to address the criticism but also to provide an independent, confident answer, and this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always match the view held by the American president,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. She added that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complaint that Berlin is exploiting the US when it comes to trade was misplaced. Merkel said that narrative only takes into account the trade in goods and that the trade in services and repatriation of profits to the US from Europe favoured the US to an even greater extent. The German chancellor also pointed out that BMW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest car factory was not in Germany but in Spartanburg, South Carolina and employs 8,800 workers. Last week, Washington listed $200bn (\u00c2\u00a3150bn) worth of additional Chinese products it intends to place tariffs on as soon as September. The list named more than 6,000 items, including food products, minerals and consumer goods such as handbags, which would become subject to a 10% tariff. Trump has threatened to add another $300bn of products to the list, but his intervention on Friday was his most explicit threat so far. The European commission, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive arm, has already warned the White House it would be prepared to use tariffs against as much as $300bnof US products should Trump slap higher taxes on European automotive imports to the US. The president threatened last month to impose tariffs of 20% on imports of cars from the EU after Brussels carried through plans to tax US consumer goods \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as whiskey, cigars and Harley-Davidson motorcycles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in retaliation against US tariffs on European steel and aluminium. Oliver Jones at Capital Economics said investors would flee stock markets in Asia and Europe if Trump pressed ahead with his tariff threats. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The retaliation by other countries to US protectionism so far has mostly been aimed at US farmers, not US multinationals.

The relationship between Fiat and Italy, as well as its hometown of Turin, has changed, including from a legal and fiscal point of view, being FCA a Dutch company with fiscal domicile in the UK.</p> <p>The evolution of the company under its guidance is easily summarised in a few numbers: in 2004 when Marchionne took over, Fiat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenue was close to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac47bn, today its exceeds \u00e2\u201a\u00ac140bn. The company profit trebled from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.5bn in 2004 to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.4bn in 2017, while the stock market capitalization of the FCA universe spiralled from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.5bn to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn.</p> <p>After just a weekend to absorb the news markets are now dealing with its consequences. The importance of Marchionne as a leader emerged from the very first minutes after the bell, with FCA, Ferrari and the holding Exor (all these 3 stocks belongs to the FTSE MIB 40, the main basket of the Italian market) opening with heavy losses. Even more under pressure was Ferrari, where Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency should have continued beyond 2019. But after the initial shock the titles of the Fiat galaxy have started to regain some ground: another sign of Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talent: he managed to grow Fiat thanks to his personality, but building a future for the company independent from himself. A future that starts with Jeep, one of the brands that grew the most in recent years, from which the new CEO, Brit Michael Manley, comes from.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b55b40be4b0f7abbc8f153c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-23T11:18:42.982Z\">12.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fiat shares slide after Marchionne steps down</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a04c78319a60cc726471003f98ece221ec7c8882\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a04c78319a60cc726471003f98ece221ec7c8882/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fiat Chrysler Automobiles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Piero Cruciatti/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Italian-US carmaker Fiat Chrysler is facing a very uncertain future today following the shock resignation of long-serving CEO Sergio Marchionne over the weekend.</strong></p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sad tale - Marchionne had run Fiat for over a decade, masterminding the rescue of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chrysler after the financial crisis.

                "bodyText":"And finally, European stock markets have closed down a little, after a quiet session. The FTSE 100 lost 23 points, or 0.3%, to finish at 7,655. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC shed 0.5% while the German DAX dipped by 0.1%. Geopolitical anxiety is weighing on shares, says David Madden of CMC Markets. Stocks are broadly lower as dealers remain nervous about the state of global trading relations. European equities have lost ground as the prospect of a full-blown trade war is weighing on investor confidence. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today... US home sales - the other economic data of note today - are out. And they show that sales fell in June for the third month running, down 0.6% to an annual rate of 5.38 million units, from 5.41 million in May. House prices rose, though - with the average price up 5% year-on-year to $276,900. This suggests a shortage of properties on the market is keeping prices up, leaving some potential buyers unable to get on the housing ladder. Just in: there was no pick-up in consumer confidence across the eurozone in July, according to the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly healthcheck: Having blasted president Rouhani, Donald Trump has turned his attention to another adversary - Jeff Bezos. Trump has tweeted that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Amazon Washington Post\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (er, what?) has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gone crazy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in its recent coverage of him, and repeated his claim that the e-commerce giant isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t paying the postal service enough. Over the weekend, the Washington Post (owned by Amazon-founder Bezos) reported that Trump was privately frustrated with the slow progress in negotiations with North Korea. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack has knocked Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price down by almost 2%: Incidentally, that Supreme Court ruling cited by Trump should allow states to collect more sales tax from e-commerce companies. But it could actually be a win for Amazon, analysts say, as the company already collects sales tax on products it sells directly to US citizens. Wall Street has opened cautiously, as traders wait for Alphabet (Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company) to report its results tonight. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average have both dipped by around 0.1%, following the G20\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning against a trade war. In other auto news, Tesla shares have fallen over 3% in pre-market trading in New York, following reports that it had asked supplies for a financial helping hand. The Wall Street Journal says Tesla has asked some of its suppliers to refund some of its previous spending, as it strives to reach profitability. The WSJ wrote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Silicon Valley electric car company said it is asking its suppliers for cash back to help it become profitable, according to a memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal that was sent to a supplier last week. Tesla requested the supplier return what it calls a meaningful amount of money of its payments since 2016, according to the memo.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd CEO Elon Musk has now confirmed that Tesla is seeking cost reductions from suppliers. Tesla has been burning through its cash pile as it strives to hit its production targets, particularly for its Model 3 vehicle ActivTrades\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 chief analyst Carlo Alberto De Casa says Sergio Marchionne \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs dramatic resignation from Fiat Chrysler has caught everyone by surprise, even insiders at the auto firm. He explains how Marchionne rebuilt Fiat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fortunes, cutting costs (controversially) and boosting revenues Loved or hated Marchionne is the man who made FCA as we know it today. It is difficult to imagine FCA and Ferrari without the man and his unique style. He wore a sweater rather than the traditional suite and a tie as his every day business attire and with is unconventional leadership style he managed to turnaround one of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and often most troubled--industrial realities. Chosen by Umberto Agnelli on his deathbed, Marchionne took the helm of a an almost bankrupt Fiat 14 years ago and turned it into an international powerhouse. This required sacrifices and controversial decisions, including job cuts and an unpopular \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdenationalization\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the company. The relationship between Fiat and Italy, as well as its hometown of Turin, has changed, including from a legal and fiscal point of view, being FCA a Dutch company with fiscal domicile in the UK. The evolution of the company under its guidance is easily summarised in a few numbers: in 2004 when Marchionne took over, Fiat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenue was close to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac47bn, today its exceeds \u00e2\u201a\u00ac140bn. The company profit trebled from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.5bn in 2004 to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.4bn in 2017, while the stock market capitalization of the FCA universe spiralled from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.5bn to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn. After just a weekend to absorb the news markets are now dealing with its consequences. The importance of Marchionne as a leader emerged from the very first minutes after the bell, with FCA, Ferrari and the holding Exor (all these 3 stocks belongs to the FTSE MIB 40, the main basket of the Italian market) opening with heavy losses. Even more under pressure was Ferrari, where Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency should have continued beyond 2019. But after the initial shock the titles of the Fiat galaxy have started to regain some ground: another sign of Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talent: he managed to grow Fiat thanks to his personality, but building a future for the company independent from himself. A future that starts with Jeep, one of the brands that grew the most in recent years, from which the new CEO, Brit Michael Manley, comes from. Italian-US carmaker Fiat Chrysler is facing a very uncertain future today following the shock resignation of long-serving CEO Sergio Marchionne over the weekend. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sad tale - Marchionne had run Fiat for over a decade, masterminding the rescue of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chrysler after the financial crisis. Its share price surged on Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s watch, as he rebuilt Chrysler and also successfully spun off Ferrari, Fiat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultra-luxurious brand. But his stint has ended too soon; complications following shoulder surgery forced Marchionne to step aside over the weekend. Fiat Chryster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board have moved quickly, promoting Michael Manley, the head of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeep brand, as their new CEO. Manley, aged 54, was born in London and trained as an engineer. Jeep is one of Fiat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success stories of the last decade. But Fiat shares have fallen 3.3% today, as investors fret about how the company will cope without Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experience, wisdom, and work ethic. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tommaso Ebhardt has written a touching account of his time trying (and usually failing) to get an interview with Marchionne. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: It was not easy for Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aides and for everyone at the the Italian-American company. He demanded full dedication and had a constant sense of urgency. That cost him some talented executives. Marchionne could also be brutal, which hurt his relationships with CEOs in the industry and with political leaders. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time for BS,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he used to tell me. The son of a policeman, who moved with his family from Italy to a suburb of Toronto at the age of 14, he joined Fiat in 2004 with no experience in the car industry. Marchionne had planned to retire next year, Ebhardy adds: At the dinner in Michigan, the night before his last Detroit auto show, he acknowledged the time was coming to spend more time with his partner. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This business, if you want to do it at least the way I think it should be done, it is all -consuming,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, describing 14- and 16-hour days doing everything from approving Super Bowl commercials to deciding on electric cars. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now I am tired, I want to do something else.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In another blow to Fiat, there are reports that its European chief, Alfredo Altavilla, has stepped down. He was seen as a possible candidate to replace Marchionne, before Manley got the job.... Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is perking up, despite the threat posed by trade tariffs to its export base. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the Bundesbank, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, in its monthly assessment of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. It says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The economy has likely showed better momentum in the spring than at the start of the year. Although it is unlikely that the high growth rates of the past year will be repeated, manufacturing was once again the key economic driving force.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Germany would welcome a pick-up in growth. GDP only rose by 0.3% in the first three months of this year, down from 0.6% in the final quarter of 2017. The oil price is creeping higher, following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blast towards Iranian president Hassan Rouhani a few hours ago. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly modest rally, though; Brent crude is up almost 1% at $73.72 per barrel, which doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suggest the markets are pricing in a new conflict in the Middle East. Arnaud Masset of Swissquote Bank says investors are remembering how Trump tackled North Korea - furious tweets were followed by encouraging noises, and an all-smiles summit with Kim Jong-un. Masset explains: Market participants appeared not too concerned: they are used to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exaggerations. Last summer he promised \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fire and fury\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to North Korea: a year later Kim and Donald are best friends and North Korea has not shut down nuclear production Ryanair is dragging the European markets down, after the budget airline posted a 20% drop in profits. Worryingly for passengers, Ryanair also warned that recent strikes will probably continue this summer, due to an ongoing dispute over pay and conditions with its pilots and cabin crews. Ryanair also warned that the risk of a hard Brexit is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 being underestimated.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, helping to send its shares down over 5% this morning. Rival airline easyJet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are down almost 2%, leading the FTSE 100 fallers in London. European stock markets are solidly in the red this morning, as traders digest the G20\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning on trade tensions. In London the FTSE 100 has lost almost 50 points, or 0.6%, at 7629. Commodity prices are also dipping, reflecting worries that a trade wars will hit demand for agricultural goods. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says investors are focusing on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unsurprisingly inconclusive G20 meeting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of the US Federal Reserve for raising interest rates. In other geopolitical development, Donald Trump has launched a late-night, CAPS-LOCKED blast at Iran: Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ire was sparked after Iranian president Hassan Rouhani warned that the US would regret getting into a conflict with Iran, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mr Trump, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t play with the lion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tail, this would only lead to regret.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd America should know that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace, and war with Iran is the mother of all wars.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The financial markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be taking the war of words too seriously, though, says Paul Donovan of UBS: US President Trump sent out a tweet threatening Iran with all sorts of dire consequences if Iran is mean about the US. The tweet used lots and lots of capital letters. The oil market, understandably reacted \u00e2\u20ac\u201c oil prices fell a tiny bit. It is possible that US President Trump is unfamiliar with Aesop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fable of the boy who cried \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wolf.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After North Korea, markets are less inclined to take the US president seriously. Newsflash: China has fired a warning shot towards Donald Trump after he threatened to slap tariffs on all its exports to America. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters that threats and intimidation on trade won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. He added that China didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to devalue its currency to aid its exports. The yuan strengthened a little today, and is trading around 6.778 to the US dollar, up from 6.81 on Friday. Anti-austerity demonstrators held protests against the G20 and the International Monetary Fund, outside the meeting in Buenos Aires. There was clear anger about Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to seek a $50bn loan from the IMF, with strict promises to cut spending to bring its deficit down. Unions fear the plan will cost thousands of public sector jobs, and recreate the suffering seen in Greece since its debt crisis began. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To jaw-jaw is always better than to war-war\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as Churchill put it. But the talking at the G20 meeting hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yielded a breakthrough in the Washington-Beijing trade row. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reports there had not been any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantive discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with China about trade during the gathering in Argentina. He also argued that the ball is now in their court, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anytime that they want to sit down and negotiate meaningful changes, I and our team are available.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mnuchin also denied that America was being protectionist, insisting that it simply wants trade to be conducted on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fair and reciprocal terms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The G20 meeting has provided fresh evidence that America and her allies (or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfoes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as Donald Trump sometimes sees them) remain split over trade policies. EU financial affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici hit out at president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent tariffs, warning that no-one would win from a trade war. He told a press conference after the meeting that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Protectionism, I want to insist on that, is good for no one. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trade wars are not easy ... they create no winners, only casualties.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moscovici also warned that trade disputes could get worse, given the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery challenging\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 state of global relations. As he put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These meetings have been taking place in an international context which is very challenging. ... Trade tensions remain high and they threaten to escalate further. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Anxiety over a trade war continues to build, after finance ministers and central bankers warned that the risks facing the global economy are risking. After a sometimes bruising G20 meeting in Buenos Aires, finance chiefs from the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advanced economies cautioned that growth is becoming \u00e2\u20ac\u0153less synchronised\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. With inequality rising and geopolitical tensions bubbling away, the G20 fear that the risks to the financial recovery are rising. The G20 meeting ended with a call for more dialogue to prevent trade disputes -- just a few days after US president Trump rattled the markets by threatening to impose tariffs on all Chinese imports. The communique declared that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Global economic growth remains robust and unemployment is at a decade low,. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, growth has been less synchronised recently, and downside risks over the short and medium term have increased.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The G20 cited a series of risks... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These include rising financial vulnerabilities, heightened trade and geopolitical tensions, global imbalances, inequality and structurally weak growth, particularly in some advanced economies. We ... recognize the need to step up dialogue and actions to mitigate risks and enhance confidence.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd These stern words from the G20 are unlikely to deter Trump from pushing his America First agenda, though. So, the threat of a trade war continues to weigh on investors Asian markets are having a mixed day, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Topix down 0.35% and the Australian S&amp;P/ASX 290 down almost 1%. Shares are also dipping in early trading in London, with the FTSE 100 down 0.35% or 26 points at 7652. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: No progress at the G20 over trade issues means trade jitters are being sent through the markets. Asian equity markets dropped lower as traders took risk off the table, whilst flows into safe haven assets were once again on the increase. Safe haven Japanese yen was seen extending Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.9% gain versus the dollar, whilst gold followed a similar pattern. European futures are also pointing to a lower start after the opening bell. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much economic data to distract the City today, apart from US house sales and eurozone consumer confidence data this afternoon. The agenda 3pm BST: Eurozone consumer confidence for July 3pm BST: US house sales for July 6pm BST: Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent speaks to the Society of Professional Economists, London.",

                "bodyText":"European stock markets have closed higher tonight, swept up by Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong performance and optimism over China. Mining stocks led the rally in London, on hopes that Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new stimulus package will protect China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy from a crash. BHP Billiton, Anglo American and Glencore all surged over 5% to the top of the Footsie leaderboard, as commodity prices were lifted. Tech stocks also gained ground in Europe, as traders watched the Nasdaq hit today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record high. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the closing prices: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100: Up 53 points or 0.7% at 7709 German DAX: Up 120 points or 1.1% at 12,689 French CAC: Up 55 points or 1% at 5,434 Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new stimulus package has calmed some anxiety over the trade dispute with America, boostings sentiment across the globe. A package of tax cuts, research spending, special bonds, infrastructure spending and a pledge to use tax policy to stimulate growth shows that the authorities in China are concerned over the impact that the developing trade war will have on growth and are taking measures to counteract a weakening economy. Traders are also hopeful about the Q2 earnings season, which is getting into full swing; Earning season is off to a strong start, of the 21% of S&amp;P firms that have reported, 80.6% has beaten expectations for Q2 earnings, whilst 74% have surpassed expectations on earnings. These are the fundamental figures which are going to keep the equity rally alive given they offer the perfect distraction to trade war headlines. Until those trade war headlines are reflected in the data, these strong fundamentals will keep the bulls in charge. Over in New York, the Nasdaq remains at record levels. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 45 points at 7412. Alphabet is the second-top riser, up 4%, behind biotechnology company Biogen whcih also smashed profit forecasts today. PayPal (+2.1%) and Facebook (+1.3) are also among the top risers. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Newsflash from Lancashire: Shale gas firm Cuadrilla has been given the green light by government to start fracking at a well between Blackpool and Preston. This is the first permit granted under the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new regulatory regime, and comes despite protests from local residents and anti-fracking campaigners. Energy minister Claire Perry said shale gas was an important potential new energy source, and she was satisfied Cuadrilla had met the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conditions for granting a hydraulic fracturing permit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our world class regulations will ensure that shale exploration will maintain robust environmental standards and meet the expectations of local communities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some in the local community, though, fear that injecting liquid at high pressures into the rock to split it and release hydrocarbons could cause earthquakes and pollute the water supply. The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cure for the global economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imbalances includes cutting pensions in countries who are borrowing too much. On the other wide of the coin, it wants saver countries to keep older citizens in the jobs market for longer. Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has warned that the global economy is being destabilised by current account imbalances. In a new report, the IMF flags up that some countries are simply saving too much (such as Germany), while others are running persistent deficits (Britain and America). And over time, this is creating dangerous instability. The Fun warns: From a global perspective, excess surpluses have been especially large and persistent in a small group of countries, most prominently in Germany and China, and to a lesser extent, in Korea, Netherlands, Sweden and Singapore Excess deficits remain mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom, some euro area debtor countries, and a few vulnerable emerging market and developing economies (e.g. Argentina, Turkey). Donald Trump would surely agree, having made \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfair trade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 a key plank of his administration. But the IMF aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t endorsing the White House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war. Instead, it warns that protectionist measures will back fire. Chief economist Maurice Obstfeld says: The persistence of global imbalances and mounting perceptions of an uneven playing field for trade are fueling protectionist sentiment. These impulses are misguided. An escalation of protectionist policies would mainly hurt domestic and global growth, without much of an effect on current account imbalances, as this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also finds. The Fund also warns that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts could make the things worse: The fiscal easing currently underway in the United States is leading to a tightening in monetary conditions, a stronger US dollar, and a larger US current account deficit. In the near term, these trends risk aggravating trade tensions, and the resulting faster tightening of global financing conditions, which could prove even more disruptive for emerging market economies, especially those with weak external positions Most of the famous FAANG stocks are bursting ahead today. Google/Alphabet is leading the way (+4%), followed by Facebook (+2%), Amazon (+1.7%) and Apple (+0.9%). Investors are wagering that Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong results bode well for the current results season (Facebook reports tomorrow, followed by Amazon on Thursday and Apple early next week). Netflix, which missed Wall Street forecasts last week, is lagging behind though. Breaking: The Nasdaq stock index has hit a fresh record high at the start of trading in New York. Tech giant Alphabet is driving the rally, up 4%, after smashing Wall Street forecasts last night. This helped send the Nasdaq Composite Index up 70 points, or, 0.9%, to 7,912 in early trading. Traders are cheered by the strong earnings from its Google operations (see opening post), which delivered earnings per share of $11.75, compared to forecasts of $9.59 per share. The broader S&amp;P 500 index has gained 0.75%, while the benchmark Dow Jones industrial average is 0.6% higher. Investors in Europe are also putting their worries about trade wars behind them, pushing shares up in London, Frankfurt and Paris: Traders are also cheering China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new stimulus measures. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to cut R&amp;D taxes and spur local investment is bolstering optimism in the markets. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, says: European stock markets are higher in the wake of Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to stimulate the economy. The Chinese government unveiled plans to boost domestic demand in the face of heightened trade tensions. The second-largest economy in the world has been slowing down in recent years, and the tariffs imposed by the US are making matters worse. The proactive move by the Chinese authorities has lifted investor confidence around the global. Bitcoin is also on a tear this morning, as cryptocurrencies rally sharply. The Bitcoin price has jumped by 6% this morning to $8,175 on the Luxembourg Bitstamp exchange, extending its recent rally. The digital currency has now surged by a third in the last 10 days, having fallen sharply from around $20,000 at the start of the year. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, suggests that the Bitcoin bulls have been lured out of hibernation, and could push bitcoin towards $10,000 An inflow of positive news over the past few weeks regarding cryptocurrencies has revived investor appetite for Bitcoin and this can be reflected in the bullish price action. Goldman Sachs and BlackRock have expressed interest in the cryptocurrency markets while the Financial Services Board declared that they do not pose a threat to the global financial system. With this renewed sense of optimism over cryptocurrencies attracting investors from all directions, further upside could be on the cards in the near term. Alphabet shares are expected to jump around 4% when Wall Street trading begin in 45 minutes, after the tech giant beat revenue and earnings targets last night. In the old days, world leaders would prepare for a visiting politician by getting the red carpet swept, and perhaps organising a banquet. Times change, though (and not always for the better). So president Trump has limbered up for his meeting with EC president Jean-Claude Juncker tomorrow with another blast about trade. Tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting between Juncker and Trump could be heated. The EC would like to dial down the trade tensions with the US, which has already threatened to impose tariffs on European car imports. But Juncker may struggle to persuade his host that tariffs are counter-productive, and will hurt US consumers and cost jobs. The two sides have already fired shots in the trade wars; America hit Europe with 25% tariffs on steel imports, prompting new levies on US goods such as jeans and orange juice. But despite all the noise, the two sides actually have fairly low trade barriers. As Chris Giles wrote in the Financial Times today: Even though some trade is deterred by specific high tariffs on both sides of the Atlantic, the average weighted tariffs applied by the EU on US goods were 3 per cent in 2015, a little lower than the US equivalent of 3.3 per cent in the same year. City economist Timothy Ash thinks the Turkish central bank blundered today by not hiking interest rates: Yikes! The Turkish lira is tumbling after the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank surprisingly left interest rates on hold. The financial markets had widely expected a rate hike today, of at least one percentage point. Instead, the Turkish central bank left borrowing costs unchanged at 17.75%, despite concerns over high inflation and the weak currency. The move dealt the lira another blow, wiping 3% off its value against the US dollar. The decision will fuel concerns that president Erdogan is undermining central bank independence, as he pushes for lower interest rates. He has just promoted his son-in-law to a top role overseeing the Turkish economy. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taxi drivers have been pushing back against ride-hail app Uber for years, holding protests and demanding for tighter regulation. But now, they are taking their fight to a higher level - considering suing Uber for more than a billion pounds of lost earnings. Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Kleinman has the details: London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army of black cab drivers are drawing up a stunning plot to sue Uber for more than \u00c2\u00a31bn weeks after the ride-hailing app won a 15-month extension to its licence to operate in the capital. Sky News has learnt that the Licensed Taxi Drivers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Association (LTDA), which has 11,000 members in London, has engaged the leading law firm Mishcon de Reya to explore the potential for a massive legal claim against Uber. Sources said on Tuesday that if the case proceeded, the LTDA was expected to argue that all 25,000 black cab drivers in London had suffered lost earnings averaging around \u00c2\u00a310,000 for at least five years as a consequence of failings in the way Uber had operated. At that level, the overall compensation bill could total \u00c2\u00a31.25bn. Last September, Uber learned it was losing its licence after Transport for London concluded it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fit and proper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 operator. That forced the firm to tighten up its practices, including the reporting of criminal offences and carrying out background checks on drivers. TfL then granted Uber a new probationary licence last month, after the firm passed several inspections. Back in the markets, and Chinese stocks have surged after Beijing announced new fiscal measures to stimulate its economy. Overnight, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government rolled out a mixture of tax cuts and infrastructure spending to tackle the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hurting its economy. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China also acted, pumping $74bn into China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking system to prevent credit drying up. Premier Li Keqiang said it was important to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153preserve economic activity within a reasonable range\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as the cabinet agreed tax cuts for company research and development projects. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government will also accelerate the issuance of new bonds to finance local government building projects, and promote privately funded transport, oil and gas, and telecommunications projects. ANZ economists Raymond Yeung and Betty Wang said in a note. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government is sending a clear signal that it is preparing to defend growth, ... Premier Li may be concerned about the negative impact of deleveraging on growth,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The move comes just days after China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate dipped. It follows rising trade tensions with America, and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose tariffs on all Chinese imports. After months of losses, investors hailed the news. Shares jumped in Shanghai, sending the benchmark index up 1.5% - making its best three-day run in two years. Just in: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories kept growing last month, but bosses are slashing some investment plans as trade war and Brexit fears grow. The CBI has reported that UK manufacturing output rose in the last quarter. Around 35% of businesses reported an increase in new orders, and 20% reported a decrease, giving a balance of +15%. Firms reported that new orders continued to expand \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at a brisk pace\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with stronger demand from domestic customers making up for a slowdown in exports. However, firms are cautious; 18% of firms said they were more optimistic about the general business situation than three months ago and 21% were less optimistic, giving a balance of -3%. Tom Crotty, Group Director of Ineos and Chair of CBI Manufacturing Council, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great to see the manufacturing sector firing on all cylinders, with production revving up again after the slowdown earlier this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But rising trade tensions and ongoing uncertainty over our future trade and customs arrangements are clearly taking their toll on manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 confidence and investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With Donald Trump hiking tariffs, and Britain possibly heading for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno-deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exit from the EU, firms are axing their spending on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intangible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd assets, such as product &amp; process innovation and training and re-training. Investment in this area is expected to fall at a pace unseen since the global financial crisis, the CBI warns. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Serious Fraud Office has launched a new attempt to prosecute Barclays bank over its emergency fundraising from Qatar during the 2008 financial crisis. The SFO has applied to the High Court to get charges against Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank (which holds its banking licence to operate in different countries) reinstated. Barclays says it will defend the application brought by the SFO. Two months ago, the Crown Court dismissed charges that Barclays had conspired to commit fraud by false representations, and provided \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unlawful financial assistance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to Qatar over the fund-raising. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone slowdown, from Oxford Economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Angel Talavera: ...and from Piet Christiansen of Danske Bank: Trader Marc-Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Fongern points out how Germany is outperforming the rest of the eurozone this month: Growth across Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector is slowing this month, according to a new survey of purchasing managers across the region. Data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomposite output\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index has fallen to 54.3, from 54.9 in June, due to a slowdown in growth at service sector companies. Its manufacturing PMI index held steady at 54.2, but factory bosses reported the slowest growth in export orders in almost two years. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief business economist, Chris Williamson, says Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has entered July on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153soft footing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - amid worries about trade disputes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given the waning growth of new business and further slide in business optimism, the outlook has also deteriorated, notably in manufacturing, where the surveys saw worries about trade wars intensify markedly in July. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While there are signs that improving domestic demand in many countries is helping drive robust service sector expansion and support manufacturing, a worsening picture for export growth is clearly having an increasingly detrimental effect on manufacturing. Much of the growth came from Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest two members. Markit adds. Growth in the periphery hit its lowest level since autumn 2016, though. By country, faster growth in Germany contrasted with a slight slowing in France. Elsewhere, growth was the weakest for 21 months, slipping lower in both manufacturing and services. The rate of growth of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector economy rebounded from a 20-month low in May to a five-month high, driven by a stronger increase in manufacturing output. But France saw the second- weakest expansion in 18 months, stymied in particular by near-stagnant manufacturing. European stock markets have all opened higher, as Alphabet gives the technology sector a boost. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index has gained 0.4%, with the mining sector up 1% and tech gaining 0.5%. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s love for a (properly mixed) gin and tonic has swept mixer maker Fever-Tree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares to a fresh record high. They surged to \u00c2\u00a339.87 in early trading, up from $34.60 last night, after Fever-Tree posted a 45% jump in revenues this year. The company has also landed a deal with America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest wine and spirits distribution company, leaving it optimistic about the future. CEO Tim Warrillow declared: Given the strong performance in the first half of the year, the Board anticipates that the outcome for the full year will be comfortably ahead of its expectations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Anyone who had the foresight to buy Fever-Tree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares in 2014, when they were worth below \u00c2\u00a32, can afford a cheeky double G&amp;T tonight. Back in the UK, supermarkets are rubbing their hands after enjoying a boost from England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Cup run. Data firm Kantar reports that sales of alcohol at supermarkets surged to \u00c2\u00a3287 million during the week that the England football team played (and beat!) Colombia and Sweden. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a record, if you exclude Christmas and Easter. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153England may not have won the World Cup \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but its journey to the semi-finals not only helped to kickstart the summer, but supermarket sales to boot. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Over the past month, football-frenzied customers visited supermarkets an extra 13 million times as they hurried to stock up on World Cup-viewing essentials, with alcohol in particular the stand-out winner. Supermarkets also saw strong demand for BBQ products and sun cream: McKevitt adds: With the hot and sunny weather showing no signs of letting up, al fresco dining has continued to tempt shoppers. Over the past month, sales of firelighters and fresh burgers rocketed by 47% and 30% as customers honed their barbecuing skills. Meanwhile, sun care products and painkillers were both in demand: sales of sun creams jumped by 38%, while nearly a third of all households picked up pain-killing tablets over the past month. [Those pain killers might have something to do with those alcohol sales....] Financial analysts are impressed by the ability of Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company to keep growing fast, even with an EU antitrust case hanging over it. As Richard Kramer of Arete Research puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was never a question about Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominance of a buoyant digital ads market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd JMP Securities analyst Ron Josey agrees that Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core revenue stream, web adverts, remains strong: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153First and foremost, Google Sites revenue has continued to grow, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fourth quarter in a row of accelerating growth rates. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continued ability to reinvent or launch new ad products that have been adopted by advertisers, and that drives return on investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Forrester Research\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Collin Colburn said the $5bn fine imposed by commissioner Margrethe Vestager last week was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pretty big\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for most companies, but only a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slap on the wrist\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to Google. But Naeem Aslam of Think Markets argues that Google must avoid further financial penalties, for the sake of its reputation: Today, it is all about Alphabet; Google is the king of the advertisement and its ad business is in full throttle. The message is clear for its investors that the company is a monster in this arena and the EU regulatory backlash hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been able to damage its number in any significant way. The internet giant reported its earning number last night and it smashed all the estimates. The crown jewel, its ads business experienced growth of 24% and its second most important lucrative business; cloud services also added a strong number. The growth in the cloud services was 37%. When we look at the Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earning, it makes us comfortable that there is a moderate slowdown in spending. This means that the user acquisition cost is going down. This creates a more efficient environment for revenue growth. Having said this, the company cannot afford to have reputation damage and it still needs to bring fines under-control because eventually this would add go against Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s values. Last night, Google CEO Sundar Pichai reported that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s self-driving car division is making progress. He told investors: Waymo expanded its partnership with Fiat Chrysler with the option to add up to 62,000 Chrysler Pacifica minivans to its self-driving fleet. And lastly Waymo announced that it has driven more than 8 million fully autonomous miles with most of those on city streets. Pichai also revealed that Google Translate got a boost during the World Cup. Pichai told investors he was: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153...extremely proud to see the positive feedback on how useful Google Translate was for people who traveled to Russia\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In these simple moments, when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in an unfamiliar place or you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the language, Google is there to help with the right information at the right time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European investors are in cheerier mood today, after Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company smashed expectations last night. Alphabet shrugged off the impact of its penalty for breaking European competition rules, by posting revenues of $26.24bn in just the last three months, beating expectations of $25.5bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from $20.9bn a year earlier. Profits dipped to $2.8bn from $4.1bn, but they would have been a sparkling $7.8bn but for the $5bn fine imposed by the EU last week. Chief financial officer Ruth Porat declared the company had delivered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153another quarter of very strong performance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Wall Street agreed - Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares jumped by 4% in after-hours trading following the results. This is feeding through to Europe this morning, with shares rising in London: The results showed that Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grip on Web advertising remains extremely strong, with 58% more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclicks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on its mobile and YouTube adverts than a year ago. Non-advertising revenues (such as mobile apps, cloud computing and Google Home speakers) jumped to $4.4bn, up from around $3bn a year ago. Tech shares are expected to be in demand today after Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimpressive set of results\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, says Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group: It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just the headline figures impressing traders, but also a surprise drop in costs reported by Alphabet. Costs had been increasing at a concerning rate over previous quarters as Alphabet played catch up in areas such as developing its cloud business and consumer business. These higher costs had been squeezing margins causing concern particularly among short term traders. Unexpectedly lower costs have eased these fears, boosting demand for the stock in the process. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the results: Also coming up today There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flurry of corporate news today, as companies clear the decks before the summer holidays. Swiss Bank UBS posted a 12% rise in pre-tax profits in the last quarter, thanks to its investment banking arm. European carmaker PSA has reported record earnings, after the takeover of Opel-Vauxhall last year. But UK energy producer Drax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits fell 15% in the first half of the year, following various outages. And among the the smaller companies, tonic and mixer-maker Fevertree has posted another big jump in profits - adjusted earnings rose 35% in the last six months, to \u00c2\u00a334m. More on all hose shortly... On the economics side, we find out how Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies are faring this month when Markit releases its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Purchasing Managers Survey for July.

The departure of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EMEA head, Alfredo Altavilla, on Monday will make his job that bit harder, as will the escalating global trade war. As a Chrysler insider and the head of Jeep, Mr Manley is unlikely to want to follow through on previous rumours that FCA would spin off Jeep, or even sell the whole company.</p> <p>Instead, he will probably continue to put Jeep at the centre of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global strategy, and cement the overall group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shift away from small cars towards sports utility vehicles.

Trump and Juncker appear amiable at meeting aimed to avert trade war \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We agree today, first of all, to work together toward zero tariffs, zero, non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump told reporters. The statement came after Trump had threatened tariffs on car imports and reports that the EU is planning retaliatory measures. Trump said the US and EU will set up an executive working group to work on trade and assess existing tariffs \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to the betterment of both\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re starting the negotiation right now but we know very much where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Juncker said it his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intention to make a deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that would work towards zero tariffs on industrial goods. Trump added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was a very big day for free and fair trade, a very big day indeed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back in the morning to see how the European stock markets react. You might expect a rally.... however, the news that Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have tanked in afterhours trading (it missed Wall Street forecasts and lowered its outlook) could weigh on investors. Goodnight! GW Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to import a lot more liquified natural gas from America is quite interesting. During his visit to Europe this month, Donald Trump blasted Germany for signing up to a new natural gas pipeline link with Russia called Nord Stream 2. Trump claimed the deal made Europe dangerously reliant on Russia for its energy needs - a concern echoed by some experts. So does today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal fix that problem? Not according to former US ambassador Anthony Gardner, who doubts whether much more LNG will actually cross the Atlantic... I came, I talked, I got a deal, says Juncker on Twitter: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of presidents Juncker and Trump announcing they have agreed to work together on trade: European trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom says Washington and Brussels have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153turned a page\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in their relationship. Beijing may be looking at tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal nervously, says Reuters Noah Barkin: China, of course, is being threatened with tariffs on ALL its US sales, unless it makes concessions on trade. European Commission vice-president Jyrki Katainen has hailed the apparent breakthrough: Professor Steve Peers points out that the two sides have primarily agreed to negotiate on trade, rather than reach a concrete agreement (yet). The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Andrew Neil isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach Investor Christian Gagnon thinks Juncker has played his cards well: Jean-Claude Juncker told reporters that he had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good and constructive meeting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with Donald Trump. He added that the two sides had agreed not to impose any new tariffs while talks were taking place. That might mean that the threat of punitive tariffs being imposed on EU car sales into America may have receded.... Donald Trump also sounds optimistic following his talks with Juncker today. He tells reporters in Washington that the two side have agreed to work together to lower trade barriers Trump declares: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was a very big day for free and fair trade, a very big day indeed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump points out that the negotiations are only just starting, but both sides know where they want to get to. That includes working towards \u00e2\u20ac\u0153zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says the US president. He adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will also work to reduce barriers and increase trade in services, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical products, as well as soybeans; soybeans is a big deal, Europe would also become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a massive buyer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of liquefied natural gas from the United States, Trump adds proudly. The EC says it has launched a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new phase\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in its relationship with the US today. It is: ....a phase of close friendship, of strong trade relations in which both of us will win, of working better together for global security and prosperity, and of fighting jointly against terrorism. The EC adds that it hopes to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resolve the steel and aluminum tariff issues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd -- the levies imposed by Donald Trump on European metal imports earlier this year. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official: The European Union and the United States have reached an agreement that may calm fears of a trade war between the two sides. The breakthrough was reached during Jean-Claude Juncker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talks with Donald Trump at the White House. The two side have agreed to work together to lower trade barriers, and towards eliminating some tariffs. It will see Europe import more energy, and soy beans, from America. In a statement, the EU says it agreed four key points with the US today: First of all, to work together toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods. We will also work to reduce barriers and increase trade in services, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical products, as well as soybeans. This will open markets for farmers and workers, increase investment, and lead to greater prosperity in both the United States and the European Union. It will also make trade fairer and more reciprocal. Secondly, we agreed today to strengthen our strategic cooperation with respect to energy. The European Union wants to import more liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States to diversify its energy supply. Thirdly, we agreed today to launch a close dialogue on standards in order to ease trade, reduce bureaucratic obstacles, and slash costs. Fourthly, we agreed today to join forces to protect American and European companies better from unfair global trade practices. We will therefore work closely together with like-minded partners to reform the WTO and to address unfair trading practices, including intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, industrial subsidies, distortions created by state owned enterprises, and overcapacity. More to follow! US shares have jumped in late trading, following the report that Europe has made some trade concessions. The Dow surged by 150 points, on hopes that a trade war can be averted. NEWSFLASH: The Dow Jones newswire is reporting that Jean-Claude Juncker has proposed some concessions to Donald Trump at their talks today. It says the Europeans have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153agreed to lower industrial tariffs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and also to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153iimport more U.S. soybeans\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have more details, or confirmation yet.... Sky News have a video clip of Donald Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks at the White House earlier: Donald Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker have now vanished off for their trade talks. The two leaders appeared quite friendly as they sat side by side in the Oval Office. At one stage, Trump even reached over to give Juncker a friendly tap on the thigh. The optimistic noises from the two men have also helped to push shares higher on Wall Street, dragging the Dow Jones industrial average away from its earlier losses. President Juncker thanks Donald Trump for inviting him to the White House for talks on trade. America and Europe are close partners and allies, not enemies, he says, so we have to work together. [reminder, Trump recently claimed the EU was a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfoe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 when it comes to trade]. Juncker says that he believes talks should focus on decreasing tariffs, not increasing them. Trump says he agrees! The US would be very pleased if there were no tariffs, barriers or subsidies. We want reciprocal trade at a minimum, he insists, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re making tremendous strides\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd towards it. We hope to achieve something good, and when we do you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be the first to know, Trump concludes. The assembled press pack then shout questions. Some are on trade, but at least one was about the secret recording of Trump discussing buying the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story about her alleged affair with the president. None of the questions are answered. Donald Trump began by complimenting Jean-Claude Juncker on the way he represents EU citizens. We are looking for a fair trade deal, and hopefully we can sort something out, Trump tells reporters at the White House. The president then claims that America has been losing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hundreds of billions of dollars\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the EU over recent years [because it runs a trade deficit with Europe]. We just want a level playing field for American companies and farmers, Trump continues. Something that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for everybody, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we are going to discuss. Newsflash: European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has declared that America and Europe are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153friends, not enemies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as he sits down with Donald Trump for talks on trade. In response, Trump has told reporters at the White House that Juncker is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very smart\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tough\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as they prepare to lock horns about tariffs. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a media scrum at the White House as reporters prepare to hear from presidents Juncker and Trump. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting the two men will hold a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pool spray\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd* in the Oval Office (* - a chance for journalists to ask questions, not a refreshing blast from a hose) Donald Trump limbered up for his talks with Jean-Claude Juncker over trade today, by declaring he would show \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No weakness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. As explained in the introduction, the EU hope to talk Trump away from imposing tariffs on European car imports, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much hope of a big breakthrough today. Now this is interesting... Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, has told Fox News he held constructive talks with EU officials over trade yesterday. That could be an encouraging sign for the Trump-Juncker talks, which are due to start soon in Washington. In London, the FTSE 100 index of top shares has fallen 50 points, or 0.66% today, to close at 7658. Chinese president Xi has fired a warning to the White House not to launch a global trade war. Speaking at the annual summit of BRICS (emerging market) economies in Johannesburg, Xi warned that countries who pursue \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic hegemony\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will end up hurting themselves Xi declared that leaders must choose between cooperation and confrontation, adding. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unilateralism and protectionism are mounting, dealing a severe blow to multilateralism and the multilateral trading regime\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Trump, meanwhile has accused China of being \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvicious\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, by imposing retaliatory tariffs in response to his push for freer trade. Motor racing chief Jean Todt, who ran the Ferrari Formula 1 team for several years, says Sergio Marchionne was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153visionary leader\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Todt, now president of the FIA (F\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ration Internationale de l\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Automobile), writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is with great sadness that I learned that Sergio Marchionne tragically and unexpectedly passed away. Sergio achieved a colossal amount for the automotive industry and motor sport worldwide. He dedicated himself fully to turn around the FIAT-Chrysler group and put all his energy to bring Scuderia Ferrari back to the top. He was an endearing, upstanding and brave man, an unconventional and visionary leader. He was an eminent member of the FIA F1 Strategy Group and of the FIA High-Level Panel for Road Safety. His death is a considerable loss. On behalf of the entire FIA community, all my thoughts go out to his family, his friends and his Ferrari and Fiat-Chrysler group teams\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Another carmarker, General Motors, has spooked the markets by slashing its profit forecasts. GM blamed rising commodity costs -- following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to impose 25% tariffs on steel imports, and 10% on aluminium. That has pushed up GM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s raw materials bill, hitting profitability. Chuck Stevens, GM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive vice president and CFO says: Our operating performance was impacted by significant headwinds from commodity costs and currency devaluations in South America. For the rest of the year we will focus on flawlessly executing our full-size truck launches and continue managing the business with discipline in a more challenging environment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd GM now expects to make between $5.80 to $6.20 per share this year, down from $6.30 to $6.60 previously. This makes GM one of the biggest companies to warn that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade disputes are hurting business. The warning comes just a few hours before the president sits down with EC president Jean-Claude Juncker for talks to (possibly) stave off a trade war. Wall Street has taken the news badly; shares in GM are down almost 7% today. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cgil union has given a guarded tribute to Sergio Marchionne, reports Associated Press: The Cgil union, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful, praised Marchionne for having \u00e2\u20ac\u0153saved a dying company.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But it faulted him for having failed to negotiate with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an important sector of Italian workers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which it said created conflict and divisions that are still being felt. Cgil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fiom metalworkers union clashed with Marchionne over changes he brought to Italian plants to increase productivity. Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive chairman, Bill Ford, says the auto industry will miss Sergio Marchionne badly: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sergio Marchionne was one of the most respected leaders in the industry whose creativity and bold determination helped to restore Chrysler to financial health and grow Fiat Chrysler into a profitable global automaker. His extraordinary leadership, candor and passion for the industry will be missed by everyone who knew him. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family at this difficult time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The plunge in Fiat Chrysler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be directly attributed to Sergio Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death. His long stint as CEO actually ended last weekend, when the company announced his resignation following complications after shoulder surgery. Plus, Marchionne was already expected to step down next year. But..by lowering its profit and revenue forecasts today, FCA has reminded the markets that the auto sector is a tough place for new CEO Mike Manley to navigate. Shares in Fiat Chrysler have tumbled almost 10% at the start of trading in New York, after the firm cut its profit and revenue forecasts for this year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on Sergio Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death: Over in Turin, Fiat Chrysler has lowered its flags to half-mast today, as a sign of respect to Sergio Marchionne. Workers at Fiat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plant in Pomigliano, Italy, where the popular Panda car is produced, stopped production for 10 minutes, Associated Press reports. Ana Nicholls, Director of Industry Operations at the Economist Intelligence Unit, says the business world has lost one of its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153greatest turnaround managers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The death of Sergio Marchionne marks the passing of one of the greatest turnaround managers of the past century. His legacy is impressive: in saving both Fiat and Chrysler through clever deal-making and sheer hard work he not only ensured the survival two of the most venerable names in the auto industry, but also saved the jobs of tens of thousands of people. Mike Manley has a lot on his place, as he tries to step into Sergio Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shoes, she adds: The difficulty is understanding what comes next for FCA. Mr Marchionne famously said there was no script for after his departure and the new CEO, Mike Manley, is having to start improvising more quickly than expected. The departure of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EMEA head, Alfredo Altavilla, on Monday will make his job that bit harder, as will the escalating global trade war. As a Chrysler insider and the head of Jeep, Mr Manley is unlikely to want to follow through on previous rumours that FCA would spin off Jeep, or even sell the whole company. Instead, he will probably continue to put Jeep at the centre of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global strategy, and cement the overall group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shift away from small cars towards sports utility vehicles. But if tariff barriers continue to rise, he will have to find a way to re-engineer the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s product line-up so that fewer vehicles and parts need to cross borders, without undermining the savings the group was getting from greater global integration. That may mean fewer big deals and a lot more small-scale restructuring, but either way he will find Mr Marchionne a hard act to follow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The New York stock exchange have tweeted a nice picture of Sergio Marchionne on the day he floated Ferrari, a key milestone during his time at FCA. Here are a few more photos from the archive: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 This block was amended on 26 July 2018 because an earlier version misnamed Sergio Marchionne as Silvio. Fiat Chrysler Automobile\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new CEO, Mike Manley, has paid tribute to his predecessor, as he presents the car maker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new financial results to analysts. Manley says FCA learned this morning that Sergio Marchionne had passed away. Clearly this is a very sad and difficult time. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family, friends and colleagues. Manley explains that he worked with Marchionne for many years, so his death is heartbreaking on a personal level. There is no doubt that Sergio was a very special, unique man, and no doubt he will be sorely missed. Manley thanks the analysts for their warm messages and comments since Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surgery last week, and then held a minute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s silence. He then confirms that FCA has cut its guidance for this year, following a tougher time in China: Another top automobile boss, Mary Barra of General Motors, says Marchionne created a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remarkable legacy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Fiat Chrysler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results show the challenging facing Sergio Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successor, Mike Manley. FCA, whose brands include Jeep, Ram, Alfa Romeo, Dodge and Maserati, is aiming to double its profits over the next four years - and also make a bigger splash in the electric car sector. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgraded forecasts mean that will be a little bit harder. Manley, who took over last weekend after Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surgery, will present the results to analysts shortly. Newsflash: Fiat Chrysler shares have just tumbled, after the carmaker released its latest financial results to the markets. The company has reported that earnings shrank by 35% in the second quarter of 2018 (which turned out to be Sergio Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final period in charge). Net profits fell to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac754m, down from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.155bn a year earlier. The company says that sales in China fell, partly due to increased competition from domestic brands. Fiat-Chrysler has also cut its forecasts for 2018. It now expects net revenues of between \u00e2\u201a\u00ac115bn and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac118bn, down from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac125bn previously. It has also slashed its profit forecasts, predicting adjusted EBIT of between \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.5bn and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.0bn, down from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.7bn. This has alarmed investors; Fiat Chrysler shares have slumped by 10%: (The company was scheduled to release its results today, so this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t related to Sergio Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sad death). ActivTrades analyst Carlo Alberto De Casa says Marchionne turned an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153almost bankrupt Fiat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd into an international powerhouse. His heritage could be described in just a few numbers: in 2004 when Marchionne took over, Fiat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenue was close to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac47bn, today it exceeds \u00e2\u201a\u00ac140bn. The company profit almost trebled in the same period. Loved or hated Marchionne is the man who made FCA as we know it today: more successful and a little less Italian. It is still difficult to imagine FCA and Ferrari without the man and his unique style. He wore a sweater rather than the traditional suite and a tie as his everyday business attire and with is unconventional leadership style he managed to turnaround one of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and often most troubled - industrial realities. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Henry Foy points out just how much value Sergio Marchionne created at Fiat Chrysler: Back in January, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas made the same point to Marchionne on a conference call: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen anything like you. You took $2 billion, roughly, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve turned it into around $72 billion, and more important than that, there are many hundreds of thousands of families across many nations that are better off because of you and your team and you beat the sceptics every step of the way. So, I just had to say god bless you, Sergio. Chrysler workers should be grateful that Marchionne took the risk of helping the stricken auto company out of bankruptcy protection in 2009, says Autotrader.com analyst Michelle Krebs: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly unlikely that Chrysler would exist today had he not taken that gamble. The company was in such bad shape, being stripped of any kind of resources by the previous owners.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Anand Mahindra, chairman of Mahindra Group (the Indian conglomerate), has tweeted his admiration for Sergio Marchionne: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of affection for Sergio Marchionne on social media, including from fans of Ferrari (which he chaired until last weekend). Associated Press have dubbed Sergio Marchionne a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153charismatic and demanding leader\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The manager, known for his folksy, colourful turns of phrase and for his dark cashmere sweaters no matter the occasion, was the darling of the automotive analyst community. Even when expressing doubts at his audacious targets, they expressed admiration for his adept deal-making. That included getting GM to pay $2 billion to sever ties with Fiat, key to relaunching the long-struggling Italian carmaker, and the deal with the U.S. government to take Chrysler without a penny down in exchange for Fiat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small-car technology. Marchionne joined Fiat after being tapped by the Agnelli family to save the company. Fiat had for generations been a family-run enterprise, and having someone at the helm from outside Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clubby management circles even a dynamo like Marchionne was an enormous change. Other key corporate moves included the spinoff of the heavy industrial vehicle and truck maker CNH and of the Ferrari supercar maker. Both deals unlocked considerable shareholder value for Agnelli family heirs led by John Elkann. Elkann came into his own under Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stewardship, taking over as chairman in 2010 having been tapped more than a decade earlier by his grandfather, the late Gianni Agnelli, to run the family business. Fiat Chrysler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, John Elkann, has told staff to build on Sergio Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legacy, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The best way to honour his memory is to build on the legacy he left us, continuing to develop the human values of responsibility and openness of which he was the most ardent champion.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Marchionne was one of the boldest business leaders of his generation, says the Financial Times. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour of the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obituary, just published: The 66-year-old, who died from complications following surgery, was a consummate dealmaker, known for his nonstop work habit and razor sharp mind. A poker player, his entourage told of sleepless transatlantic flights where their chain-smoking boss always wanted to play \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and win \u00e2\u20ac\u201d another hand of cards. The same passion defined his improbable rescue of Fiat via an audacious merger with Chrysler that saved both companies and created the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seventh largest car group. He persuaded General Motors to pay $2bn to escape its alliance with a near bankrupt Fiat in 2005 before swooping on a distressed Chrysler in 2009 and executing a full takeover of the group in 2014. The FT also points out that Marchionne enraged Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unions by slashing costs, and jobs, as he pushed to return Fiat to profitability: He was demonised by Beppe Grillo, founder of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement for his closure of plants and job cuts. At one political rally in Milan, Grillo led the crowd in a chant: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153F**k you, Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In private, Marchionne was acutely aware of the ravages that globalisation had on those left behind. Sergio Marchionne deserves great credit for his work rescuing Fiat since becoming its CEO 14 years ago, says Bloomberg: Marchionne was handed an automaker that lost more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6bn ($7bn) in 2003. By 2005, he had returned the company to a profit by wringing some $2 billion from an alliance with General Motors Co., laying off thousands of workers, introducing new models, and slashing the time it took to get a new car to market to just 18 months, from four years. In 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration announced that Fiat would take control of Chrysler LLC, rescuing the American company from bankruptcy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care what a tough guy he was to work for, he saved our company,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Cass Burch, a Chrysler and Jeep dealer in Georgia. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He deserves a bronze statue.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: Sergio Marchionne, one of the titans of the global car industry, has died. This very sad news comes just four days after Marchionne, aged 66, suddenly resigned from Fiat Chrysler, the company he had run for 14 years, last weekend. He reportedly suffered an embolism while undergoing shoulder surgery. FCA Chairman John Elkann said in a statement: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unfortunately, what we feared has come to pass. Sergio Marchionne, man and friend, is gone. During a highly successful career, Marchionne turned Fiat around - including a merger with America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chrysler following the financial crisis. He was known as a passionate workaholic who turned two struggling carmakers into the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seventh largest automaker, through relentless negotiating and cost-cutting. As Bernstein analyst Max Warburton put it earlier this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sergio Marchionne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time as CEO of Fiat is already the stuff of legend.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Evercore analyst George Galliers agreed that Marchionne was a real talent, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Marchionne is good at execution, strategy and gamesmanship.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has slipped into the red this morning, as investors await the Trump-Juncker meeting in Washington DC. The blue-chip FTSE 100 has dropped by over 40 points, or 0.55%, wiping out much of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally. Mining stocks are among the top fallers, reflecting worries that global growth (and demand for commodities) will suffer from a trade war. Trade concerns are still prevalent in the markets, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets, adding: In focus today will be the Trump/Juncker US-EU meeting in Washington, an attempt to resolve the recent trade confrontation. Trump is looking for concessions on EU exports to the US (especially cars). Juncker wants a full suspension of US tariffs before any deal can be agreed. Trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom has tweeted that she had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with various US politicians. She met with Republican house senator Paul Ryan, and Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, yesterday to press Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case, ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crunch meeting with the president. Former officials expect today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s White House meeting between Trump and Juncker to be tense, says Politico. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The negotiating view of Donald Trump is unconditional surrender of the other side,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ivo Daalder, who served as the U.S. ambassador to NATO during the Obama administration. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a betting person, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not going to be a great meeting.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Paul Donovan of investment bank UBS has a game to play at home: try completing the phrase \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tariffs are the greatest... He explains: Yesterday US President Trump tweeted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tariffs are the greatest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The president may have been muddled, forgetting to finish the sentence. If implemented, tariffs are the greatest tax increase US consumers face this year. Tariffs are the greatest risk to US employment growth. Tariffs are the greatest threat to US and global economic growth. Trade war fears are already hurting German companies, according to a new survey just released. The IFO think tank reports that optimism among bosses fell this month, pulling down its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexpectations index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to 98.2 this month, from 98.6 in June. That suggests Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade policies are damaging Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. Ifo chief Clemens Fuest said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Companies were slightly more satisfied with their current business situation, but scaled back their business expectations slightly. The German economy continues to expand, but at a slower pace.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Expectations of car exports have fallen \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsignificantly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, IFO adds. This pulled IFO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business climate index down to 101.7, from 101.8. However its current economic assessment rose to 105.3, from June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 105.1. German broadcaster ZDF reckons there are three ways the Trump-Juncker talks can play out. Scenario 1: The EU proposes renegotiating all tariffs with the EU, alongside reform of the World Trade Organisation. In return, president Trump would drop his threat to tax EU cars. That would lead to lengthy negotiations, and isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the radical solution Trump would favour. Scenario 2: Juncker proposes a new plurilateral deal just on car sales, which would lower or even abolish all auto tariffs. However it would probably have to include other countries, such as Korea and Japan - complicating the chances of a quick deal. Scenario 3: No deal is reached, so Trump presses on with tariffs on EU car sales, and the EU retaliates. That would take the global economy closer to a full-blown trade war. We shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a big breakthrough on trade today, says Simon French of City firm Panmure Gordon. He writes: Today represents an important test case for the breadth and sustainability of trade frictions as European Commissioner Jean-Claude Juncker meets with US president Trump. We do not expect a positive read-out and retain our base case that trade frictions will continue to expand all the way to the US mid-term elections in November. Newsflash: Europe is preparing to impose tariffs on $20bn of US imports, EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom has revealed. These tariffs would be brought in if Donald Trump follows through on his threat to hit European car imports with new tariffs, says Malmstrom, as she raises the heat ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Malmstrom told Swedish daily Dagens Nyheteron (via Reuters). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We hope that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come to that and that we can a solution. If not, the EU Commission is preparing a rather long list of many of American goods. It would be around $20 billion.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a very diplomatic approach to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s White House meeting. But perhaps it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good way of getting Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention... Maybe Malmstrom has been reading Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Art Of The Deal, which recommended taking a tough attitude in negotiations: The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it. That makes the other guy smell blood, and then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re dead.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shawn Donnan, the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world trade editor, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion of abolishing all US-EU tariffs. He points out that some American farmers might be unhappy about a surge of imports from overseas, especially as China is now imposing new tariffs on US goods. Dutch MEP Marietje Schaake agrees that the idea is a stretch... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. They may need to lay out sponges and towels at the White House today, as Donald Trump hosts European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker for trade talks. It could be a bruising meeting. Juncker and trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m hope to dial down the rising tensions in the global economy, and ward off the threat of a full-blown trade war. The talks will centre on the car industry, with Trump threatening to impose tariffs on $50bn of EU car imports. That would hurt the German auto industry hard, and prompt retaliatory action from Brussels. Juncker could propose some concessions; there is talk that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plurilateral car deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could lower tariffs could address Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns. However, that would be politically tricky, for both sides -- America currently has a 25% levy on European trucks coming into the country, to protect jobs in its rust belt. Juncker has said his goal is to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153explain and find out how to prevent a trade war\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But the signs aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great. Earlier this week, Trump tweeted that tariffs are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and claimed America is being treated as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153piggy bank\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by countries who run a trade surplus with it. Overnight, the president has called for both sides to completely abolish tariffs, subsidies and other trade barriers. That would certainly shake globe trade up - but is hardly something that Juncker can sign off during a quick chat in the Oval Office. The stakes are high, though. Trump has already angered Europe by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminium, which led to Europe putting 25% tariffs on bourbon whiskey, peanut butter, motorcycles and blue jeans. A rocky meeting could shake the financial markets, warns Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM: With escalating trade tensions between the European Union and the United States still a key theme that continues to weigh on global sentiment, the outcome of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting could leave a lasting impact on the markets. If the talks prove unsuccessful and trade tensions end up escalating further, risk sentiment is likely to be negatively impacted. Market players should be prepared to expect the unexpected from the talks, especially when considering how highly unpredictable the Trump administration can be.

The market seems to be questioning the quality of growth seen in the past as Facebook spends more to address many of the concerns surrounding abuses on its platform and makes changes on the back of the GDPR regulations in Europe.

First, even with the lowered guidance, revenue is still most likely to grow in the mid to high 30% range going forward. The guide higher in expenses (and lower in margins) reflects an increase in predominantly fixed costs that will scale nicely as revenue continues to grow, so margins\u00e2\u20ac\u201deven though they will be lower over the next several years as these expenses ramp\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshould not be permanently impaired.

                "bodyText":"Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sparkling-looking results also includes a flurry of new achievements and milestones, from new Fire smart TVs and tablets to a French Alexa, Amazon Prime\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 22 Emmy nominations and some new cloud computing kit. But analysts really care about the guidance -- which shows that Amazon expects sales and profits to keep surging. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: Net sales are expected to be between $54.0 billion and $57.5 billion, or to grow between 23% and 31% compared with third quarter 2017. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is expected to be between $1.4 billion and $2.4 billion, compared with $347 million in third quarter 2017. The results are online here. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another big earnings night. Amazon has just posted a record quarter, with revenues up 39% to $52.9bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a huge sales performance, but actually $500m less than expected. But earnings per share have beaten forecasts. Shares have jumped in after hours trading. Boom! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official, Facebook has suffered the biggest loss of stock market value in a single day, ever. Shares in the social media giant just closed down almost 19%. That leaves them at $176.26, down $41.24 in a single painful session. That wipes more than $119bn off the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value, I think, and roughly $15bn off Mark Zuckerberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stake. It means Facebook has (reluctantly) taken the crown of the biggest one-day fall away from Intel. The news that Facebook missed Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenue and user growth targets last night, and slashed its forecasts, has clearly given traders a jolt. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no relief for Facebook shares, which are now down 19.5% - wiping around $120bn off the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value. Still, for every seller there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a buyer. So some investors think this is a good opportunity to snaffle a stake in Facebook. Jeff Henriksen, Founder and Managing Partner, Thorpe Abbotts Capital, explains why: First, the bad news. The market seems to be questioning the quality of growth seen in the past as Facebook spends more to address many of the concerns surrounding abuses on its platform and makes changes on the back of the GDPR regulations in Europe. This has had a negative effect on both costs and revenue growth and caused the market to question Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term prospects and the quality of its past performance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That said, I think the market is missing the larger picture here. First, even with the lowered guidance, revenue is still most likely to grow in the mid to high 30% range going forward. The guide higher in expenses (and lower in margins) reflects an increase in predominantly fixed costs that will scale nicely as revenue continues to grow, so margins\u00e2\u20ac\u201deven though they will be lower over the next several years as these expenses ramp\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshould not be permanently impaired. Ultimately these expenses will improve earnings quality and the sustainability of the business model. We believe that it is more likely than not that Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings will double over the next 5 years and provide a very satisfactory return for long term investors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Facebook is still on track to set an unwanted record tonight: After a very bruising morning, Facebook shares are still down over 18% in New York. This has pulled the Nasdaq index into the red too; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down around 1%, having hit record highs earlier this week. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a case for investing in Facebook, despite its setbacks and the challenges ahead. Ben Barringer, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Facebook is making the changes to ensure that its place as the leading social media network is maintained following considerable scrutiny in the press and on Capitol Hill. Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s user base remains large with over 2bn monthly active users and over 1.4bn daily active users. Ahead of the mid-term elections it is vital that it takes action on fake news, any political advertising on Facebook and of course data security. This involves considerable investment in staff and artificial intelligence and these costs will grow faster than revenue for the next 2 to 3 years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However for advertisers, the size and targeting offered by Facebook and increasingly Instagram, is highly attractive and this will continue to drive the growth of revenues and profits.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has suffered a staggering hit today. The value of Zuckerberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stake in Facebook has fallen by around $15bn today, or \u00c2\u00a311bn. That still leaves him with a personal fortune of around $72bn, due to his stake in the social media firm. This chart from Bloomberg shows how Facebook is facing the biggest loss of market value in cash terms ever: That $151bn loss is based on Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares dropping 24% (their worst point overnight). Currently they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still down 18%, which is a loss of around $113bn - so still the biggest rout in history (although that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not adjusted for inflation). Wall Street analysts are worried that Facebook suffered a slowdown in user growth last quarter. The number of North American daily active users on the site remained flat, while the European user base actually shrank -- following the Cambridge Analytics scandal, and new data protection rules. Bloomberg point out that several Facebook executives have been selling shares in recent months. A canny move, given today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout.... As you can see, Facebook missed several forecasts last night (although earnings per share were better than estimated) Facebook shareholders are suffering a historic loss of value today: Colin J Sebastian, analyst at Baird, says Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has been struck by two self-inflicted blows. Facebook dropped two \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bombshells\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the Q2 earnings call, a significant slowdown in revenue growth for Q3/Q4, followed by operating margin declines over the next 3+ years. Importantly, these are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self-inflicted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd issues to a large degree, as Facebook sacrifices core app monetization to drive usage/engagement of Stories. Lower margins will result from continuing large-scale investments in computing infrastructure and headcount, but without meaningful related revenue streams. While shares are moving to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153penalty box,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd we believe after-hours trading already embeds model changes. Maintain Outperform rating. At one stage, Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares were down a hefty 20% - wiping around $125bn off its value. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s basically the value of fast food chain McDonalds . Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nightmare\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd guidance of lower revenue growth and higher costs is causing the rout, says GBH Insights head of technology research Daniel Ives said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you look at their forecast for the second half of the year in terms of user growth, and the expense profile, it refuels the fundamental worries about Facebook post-Cambridge Analytica.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Facebook is tumbling in early trading on Wall Street, after the social network giant revealed the true cost of its data scandal last night. Shares in Facebook have plunged by 18% - an astonishing fall for a company of this size. They have fallen to $178.40 each, down from $217.50 before the company released its results last night. Bloomberg reckons this is Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record one-day fall (unless shares recover during today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session). Investors are unfriending the company after it missed revenue and user numbers in the last three months. But the real concern is that Facebook expects to be less profitable in the coming years, as it strives to clean up its network following the Cambridge Analytica revelations. David Wehner, Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief financial officer, spooked investors yesterday by predicting that the revenue slowdown will continue for some time. Facebook basically admitted that the cost of improving security, and driving out fake news, will make a big dent in profitability. Crucially, Wehner warned that Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operating margins will stop from their current rate of 44% (very tasty!) by around 10 percentage points. These quotes did the damage: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our total revenue-growth rates will continue to decelerate in the second half of 2018, and we expect our revenue-growth rates to decline by high-single-digit percentages from prior quarters sequentially in both Q3 and Q4.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking beyond 2018, we anticipate that total expense growth will exceed revenue growth in 2019,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Over the next several years, we would anticipate that our operating margins will trend towards the mid-thirties on a percentage basis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reaction to follow! Facebook shares have been hammered in pre-market trading....as traders prepare for the open of Wall Street.... Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group, argues that investors shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t totally lose faith in Facebook, despite yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointment. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Perhaps the data scandal is at last beginning to bite in Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings. Certainly, the frequent references to the other platforms available such as Instagram and the new revenue metric of how many people use at least one of the FB apps each month send a message that this is a company looking to find ways of becoming more than just a social media platform. High expectations can be a remarkable burden, and the reaction is often brutal when they are missed, but the revenue miss was slight, and $13.2 billion is not to be sniffed at. Facebook might have its wings clipped, but it is still a remarkable money-making machine. Fortune\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s David Meyer has a pithy explanation for how Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest results disappointed Wall Street last night: The company announced revenues and daily active user numbers that fell short of analyst estimates ($13.04 billion vs. $13.32 billion for the quarter, and 1.47 billion rather than 1.48 billion) and, more worryingly for investors, it warned that its increasing privacy efforts would hit its growth rate further in the second half of this year. Indeed, user numbers in North America are flat and those in Europe have actually fallen. So the expectation that Facebook was just going to shrug off Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard-hitting new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as well as the privacy scandals that have plagued it through much of the year so far, was way off the mark. These things are making a difference, and they will continue to do so. More here: Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market woes could go down in stock market history, says CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Santoli. Newsflash: The European Central Bank has left eurozone interest rates unchanged, at its meeting today. That means the headline borrowing rate remains at zero, an all-time low. Banks still face a negative interest rate (-0.4%) for leaving cash at the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaults rather than lending it. The ECB says it expects to leave interest rates on hold until the summer of 2019. It also affirmed that it intends to halt its asset-purchase stimulus scheme at the end of 2018 (a decision it took at its previous meeting). So no surprises here. President Mario Draghi will face the press in 45 minutes. He can expect questions about when summer starts and ends exactly (a tricky call if we get another heat wave next year). Market analyst David Jones points out that Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares hit record highs yesterday, before the company gave Wall Street a nasty shock after trading ended. Facebook shares remain on track for a massive slide when trading begins in New York, in less than two hours time. The stock is down around 20% in pre-market trading, after it missed Wall Street expectations last night and warned that profit margins will be thinner than expected in the years ahead. This would eliminate all Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains this year: Such a staggering selloff would wipe around $125bn off Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value, and drag founder Mark Zuckerberg down the list of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top billionaires. The French government has weighed in, seeking \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclarification\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the agreement reached between Juncker and Trump yesterday. Finance minister Bruno Le Maire sounds concerned that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s farmers could suffer, declaring firmly that agriculture should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153be kept outside the scope of the discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on lowering trade barriers. Le Maire says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have high sanitary, food and environmental standards as well as rules of production to which we are attached and that guarantee the protection and safety of our consumers. Europe will not compromise on these norms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Writing in the New Statesman, Stephen Bush argues that Jean-Claude Juncker outplayed Donald Trump yesterday: In reality, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a remarkable coup for Juncker. The EU is already seeking to buy more gas as part of the Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term efforts to wean the continent off Russian energy. The EU already has zero tariffs on soy in place, and American soybeans are currently at a low price thanks to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war with China making them attractive to European farmers anyway. But.... that might also threaten the agreement\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s viability. The president might rip it up, if he decides he got the rough end of the deal. One reason why Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s White House is so erratic is that the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind changes depending on which advisor is currently in favour: those wanting to avoid a trade war are currently on the up, but that could change. And that Juncker has conceded very little that the EU hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already conceded in practice may mean that Trump decides he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been had and that the whole mess is re-opened in the not too distant future. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Department for International Trade is hoping that America will soon lift its tariffs on EU steel and aluminium. In a statement, it says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We welcome the agreement by the U.S. and the EU to work together to reduce barriers to trade and to further increase trade and investment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We look forward to progress towards the removal of steel and aluminium tariffs and de-escalation of the tit-for-tat action that could harm businesses and jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Overnight, China has escalated its trade dispute with America by thwarting a $44bn takeover deal. Beijing regulators sunk chipmaker Qualcomm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempted takeover of Dutch rival NXP, by declining to approve the deal. Without a green light from China, the deal expired as the clocks struck midday in Beijing (midnight in New York) - even though eight other regulators around the globe had signed it off. This makes Qualcomm the biggest casualty yet of the Trump trade wars. It launched its takeover of NXP in October 2016, so the collapse of the deal is a serious blow. Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf admitted last night that the tensions between America and China were scuppering the deal, telling Bloomberg: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see anything in the near-term that would make it worthwhile to change the timing. There were probably bigger forces at play here than just us.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder to the White House that China can make things difficult for US companies if president Trump continues to impose tariffs on their imports. The Frankfurt stock market is leading the charge this morning, as trade war relief ripples through the trading floors. The German DAX has jumped by 1.4% this morning, or 172 points, to 12,751 . Automakers are continuing to rally, thanks to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge not to impose tariffs on car imports (in the near future, anyway). The Paris market is also upbeat, pushing France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC index up by 0.7%. Traders are pleased that the Juncker-Trump talk went rather better than expected, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx: While there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly much substance to what was announced, with the fact the relationship didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worsen being more notable than the plans to negotiate, it was enough to lift the spirits of the previously fearful markets. Alan Beattie of the Financial Times makes some good points about the EU-US trade announcement in this thread: Paul Donovan of UBS isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced by Juncker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to buy more American soybeans.... US President Trump tweeted that EU officials were going to buy more US soybeans. EU officials cannot do that. The US is already the largest exporter of soybeans to the EU. There are no subsidies, trade taxes or quotas on soybeans in the EU. Private farmers decide whether to buy more soybeans or not. Not everyone is cheering the news that America and Europe will co-operate on trade. Others noted that while the announcement marks a change in tone, it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily stop Trump from moving forward with auto tariffs later this year if he changes his mind. Phil Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, has pointed out that Donald Trump reached similar agreements with China in 2017 - only to hit them with tariffs months later. Levy explained (via Politico) that the agreement is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better than nothing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to solve any of the problems the president flagged \u00e2\u20ac\u201c trade deficits, tariffs, subsidies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It looks a lot like deals struck with China last year, which of course were a prelude to a full-blown trade war. Shares in European car makers are jumping sharply, as the threat of punitive tariffs fades away. Porsche, BMW, Fiat Chrysler and Volkswagen have all surged by at least 4% in early trading. Investors are relieved that Donald Trump has agreed not to slap any more tariffs on European imports - at least while officials try to hammer out closer trade ties. Before yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, manufacturers was bracing for America to impose 20% tariffs on European car imports, which would have made them much less competitive in the US. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says the US and EU presidents managed to stave off a transatlantic trade war yesterday. Traders do have every right to celebrate Juncker and Trump meeting because the tensions were high before the meeting as it was pretty much clear that we are heading towards a real trade war. But thanks to common sense which prevailed last night, and it eased tensions stoked by threats coming from both side. Under the agreement, both sides would hold off on other tariffs as the negotiation process continues. The joint statement by leaders did look like a fairy tale, both sides agreed to work towards zero tariffs. For Trump it does not matter what the final deal would like, but for now, it is enough for him to show the world that he delivered on his promise and he brought the Europeans to a point where he thinks that things are fair. European officials were pleasantly surprised by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attitude last night, reports the Financial Times: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it was another Trump we saw in there,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one senior EU official. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He was different from the tweets and the noise, different from all that brouhaha. He was focused and engaged and clearly looking for something to help with the markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Another person familiar with the discussions said Mr Trump was eager to find a solution to what had become a growing problem for both sides. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anyone who knows Donald Trump knows that he wants to make deals,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the person. European stock market have opened higher, as traders welcome the warming of relations between Washington and Brussels over trade. The Trump-Juncker agreement isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really a deal, but it could turn into a game changer. So says Holger Schmieding of Berenberg Bank, who is reassured that America won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impose tariffs on EU car imports while negotiations continue. He writes that the two sides have taken \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a step away from the brink\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The US-EU agreement to talk rather than to slug it out in a tit-for-tat escalation of trade barriers strengthens our base case: despite all the noise, the US will not levy new tariffs on car imports from the EU in the end. Instead, the trade tensions stoked by Trump will ease somewhat as the two sides either strike a deal fast (25%probability) or at least engage in serious negotiations (55% probability). If so, Eurozone business confidence can recover this autumn. This should allow the Eurozone to overcome its current soft patch with a return to annualised growth rates of around 2% from Q4 2018 onwards. According to Juncker, he and Trump agreed that the US and the EU should strive in their negotiations to: remove mutual tariffs on industrial goods, reform the World Trade Organization (WTO), and intensify trade in services. While the EU pledged to import more soybeans and liquefied natural gas from the US, the US will re-assess the tariffs it has already imposed on steel and aluminium imports from the EU. The EU would then lift its retaliatory measures. However, Trump isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exactly known for consistency\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, so the upcoming negotiations could still founder, Schmieding adds. The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director, Christine Lagarde, has welcomed Trump and Juncker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am pleased to learn that the United States and European Union reached agreement today to work jointly to reduce trade barriers and, together with other partners, strengthen the WTO. The global economy can only benefit when countries engage constructively to resolve trade and investment disagreements without resort to exceptional measures.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sense of relief in the markets today, after America and the European Union stepped away from a trade war. Following talks at the White House, Donald Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker emerged to announce they had agreed to work together towards \u00e2\u20ac\u0153zero\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tariffs, barriers and subsidies. Trump declared it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very big\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd day, after Europe agreed to buy more soya beans and natural gas from America. The two sides have also agreed to work together to reform the international rules on trade. In truth, details are a bit scant -- as we covered in last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liveblog, the two sides have mainly agreed to negotiate. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an improvement on threats being fired across the Atlantic over social media. Importantly, the two sides have agreed not to impose any more tariffs while they keep talking. That removes the threat of new punitive levies on European car imports. The two men even shared one of Juncker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s famous kisses in the Oval Office - a fitting way to seal the d\u00c3\u00a9tente. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic affairs minister, Peter Altmaier, has cheered the move, saying it will save jobs. Analysts are also optimistic, with Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada saying: This is more positive outcome than many had expected. Also coming up today Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares will get slammed when Wall Street opened, after the social media giant missed forecasts last night. It also warned that profitability will be hit by the cost of cleaning up its platform and fighting election interference. Wall Street threw something of a wobbly last night, sending Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares plunging in after-hours trading. The European Central Bank is meeting to set monetary policy. No fireworks are expected. The ECB has already agreed a plan to wind down its stimulus programme, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far from ready to raise interest rates. But still, president Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference could be interesting. Plus, there are new US trade figures - they might show whether Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs have had an impact. The agenda 12.45pm BST: ECB interest rate decision 1.30pm BST: ECB press conference with Mario Draghi 1.30pm BST: US trade balance figures",

In May, American companies announced a record $201bn in stock buybacks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where companies buy their own shares in order to boost the share price. The S&amp;P 500 companies are set to repurchase as much as $800bn in stock this year, a new record. But the majority of the benefit of those buybacks will go to the richest Americans. Some 84% of all stocks owned by Americans belong to the wealthiest 10% of households and the top 1% of households own nearly 38% of all stock, according to research by New York University economist Edward Wolff. In the meantime wage growth has remained lackluster, a trend that has continued unabated since the end of the recession and has so far been unaffected by the Trump presidency. Tax revenues have fallen and the US budget deficit is on course surpass $1tn by 2020, two years sooner than previously estimated, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, said it was difficult to assess the state of the US economy from one quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tax cuts have provided a bit of stimulus, particularly for people who own a lot of stock and are paying less tax,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Bivens said the impact of the cuts had yet to be seen in the wider economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Low wages are still the biggest puzzle in this economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.",

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clip of president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on the US economy: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good moment to wrap up. Have a good weekend. GW Snap verdict: president Trump is clearly taking today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figure as vindication of his economic policies. That means we can expect more of the same from the White House on trade, tax and spending. Larry Kudlow, the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic advisor, now speaks -- and he backs up Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the US economy will keep growing strongly. Kudlow insists: This is a boom that will be sustainable. Turning away from the economy, president Trump says that the remains of 55 Americans killed in the Korean war are returning to the US. He thanks Kim Jong-Un for sticking to his commitment. Onto trade...and president Trump criticises other countries for stealing US jobs and plundering its wealth. Our tariffs are bringing tariffs back to the US, he continues, saying that the burly steel workers he met in Illinois yesterday were in tears (of joy, presumably). Trump is insisting that his hard line on trade will bring jobs back to America (reminder: his administration is working on a $12bn bailout for US farmers hurt by the row with China) Giving his own trumpet a hearty toot, president Trump now says that his administration have achieved an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic turnaround of historic proportions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We are the envy of the entire world, he adds, saying that other world leaders are regularly congratulating him on the state of the US economy. President Trump is speaking on the economy now at the White House. He says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and that America is going to go a lot higher. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on track for the fastest growth rate in 13 years, the president declares. The US economy is growing much faster than under the previous two administrations, Trump continues. If the current growth rate is maintained, the US economy will double in size 10 years faster than it would have done under presidents Bush or Obama, Trump claims. He also points out that the trade deficit has dropped by over $50bn. Trump insists that the current growth rate is sustainable, and not a single shot boost (some analysts disagree, though) We have the official thumbs up from the White House: Even if this pacey growth doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last, it gives Donald Trump a boost going into the mid-term election this autumn. However, the feelgood factor could face if trade wars hurt the US economy in the coming months. Balraj Sroya, Sales Trader at Foenix Partners, explains: The words \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMake America Great Again\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 can be heard echoing from across the Atlantic this afternoon as the US economy grew 4.1% in the second quarter of 2018, which is the most robust pace in nearly 4-years. Strong export figures, aided by soybean exports in addition to consumer spending, helped the surge in the GDP print. Over the next quarter GDP figures will be scrutinised, as the threat of upcoming tariffs on US exports could dampen the next print. However, it gives Republicans a firm footing ahead of the Midterm elections, as GDP sitting above 3% has been a core pledge for the Trump administration since the beginning of his campaign. Our US business editor, Dominic Rushe, writes: The growth will be a major boon for the Trump administration, which pushed through $1.5tn in tax cuts at the start of the year with a promise that they would be paid for by economic growth. Ahead of the announcement on Thursday, Donald Trump teased that good news could be coming. Breaking with a tradition of presidents refraining from commenting on market sensitive government releases ahead of their release, the president told a rally in Illinois: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Somebody actually predicted today 5.3 [percent growth]. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to happen ... if it has a four in front of it, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re happy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But economists warned the growth spurt may be unsustainable and the evidence so far is that the benefits of the mini-boom have disproportionately gone to the wealthiest Americans. The last time the economy expanded at a comparable pace was in 2014, when growth hit 5.2% in the third quarter. The economic boost was driven by rising consumer spending, exports and business investment over the quarter. More here: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rob Hodgson, Senior Wealth Manager at GWM Investment Management, on the US GDP figures: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Economic Adviser told us it was going to be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fair to say that analysts were projecting some exciting figures. A 4.1% growth rate in Q2 is the strongest since the third quarter of 2014. Projections were ranging between 3 and 5 percent and business confidence remains upbeat so we were expecting a strong quarter of growth. We would suggest that 4.1% overstates the underlying pace of activity, but the tax cuts and impacts of deregulation are likely to keep economic growth accelerating from this point.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As this chart shows, America has just posted its strongest quarter since Donald Trump became president. However, growth was still stronger in the middle of 2014, during Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second term. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax reforms have spurred US growth in recent months: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US economy is showing the fastest growth since 2014. A strong labour market, benign inflation and strong corporate investment have contributed to this positive landscape for growth. The economy was already on the up before Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts added further fiscal fuel. The tax cuts are now filtering through to the real economy as companies have been empowered to increase investment spend, the lion share of which is going into technology and automation. Pablo Shah, economist at the CEBR think tank, says America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate was impressive in the last quarter: While much of the resurgence in US growth can be attributed to somewhat transitory factors, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures remain impressive. A strong labour market coupled with accommodative fiscal and monetary policies are set to sustain solid growth throughout the remainder of the year. However, he also suspects growth will fade over time: The US economy is likely to come off the boil in the coming quarters, as the boost to growth delivered by the tax cuts begins to wear off, trade restrictions and an overall slowing of the global economy start to weigh on exports, and further interest rate hikes tighten financial conditions. The dollar has dipped slightly, despite America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate jumping. That suggests investors don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think this growth rate is sustainable. US consumers drove America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US economic growth in the last three months. Consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 4% in the last quarter, up from just 0.5% in January-March. Business investment was 7.3% higher. Exports grew by 9.3%, while exports only expanded by 0.5% -- that will please the White House. NEWSFLASH: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew at an annual rate of 4.1% in the last three months, as growth accelerated. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fastest growth rate since 2014, and a very solid result (although not as high as some economists had hoped). It may show that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts have given the economy a boost. US growth in January-March has also been revised up, to an annual rate of 2.2% from 2%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot stronger than France, which grew at an annualised rate of 0.8% in the last quarter (or 0.2% quarter-on-quarter) More to follow! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly time to discover how fast America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew in the last quarter. Forecast range from an annualised growth rate of 2.6% all the way up to 4.8%, which would be very pacy. First Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares tumble after missing Wall Street forecasts, then Twitter follows suit. So has the social media boom hit a roadblock, or are investors simply over-reacting? Arguably, Wall Street should welcome signs that these companies are getting serious about tackling abuse, fake accounts and disinformation, even if it hits the bottom line. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says there are two theories why shares are tumbling: One, expectations for revenue growth are being fundamentally reset in the social media space. Two, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction is maybe overdone as investors have been spooked by the horrid earnings call from Facebook. Everyone knew that Twitter was full of fake accounts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c why their removal should be impacting the share price in the way is unclear \u00e2\u20ac\u201c investors may be better advised to keep a check on earnings and revenue growth instead. Both Facebook and Twitter have been affected badly by fake news, fake accounts and accusations of Russian meddling. But arguably Twitter looks in better shape as the efforts to monetise the platform are working, whilst we see fundamental concerns about Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advertising model.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Twitter says it is determined to tackle \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcproblem behaviour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, even if it does hurt user numers. It tells shareholders: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are making active decisions to prioritize health initiatives over near-term product improvements that may drive more usage of Twitter as a daily utility.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some snap reaction to Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results: NEWSFLASH: Twitter has just reported that its user numbers have fallen, as it got to grips with fake accounts. The social media/micro-blogging site says monthly users fell by one million in the last three months, to 353 million. Wall Street had expected a rise of one million. Twitter took steps to weed out abusive content providers, and so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbots\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, to (finally) address concerns from regulators, politicians and the public. But investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed, even though twitter also posted earnings of around $100m or $0.17 per share, in line with forecasts. Shares have slumped by 18% in pre-market trading, matching Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble earlier this week. City traders, mortgage holders, savers and borrowers all need to be alert for a UK interest rate rise next week. The Bank of England sets monetary policy next Thursday, and a rate rise is possible - but not certain. There are arguments to hike, but also to sit tight a bit longer. As Nicholas Wall of Old Mutual Global Investors puts it: For a nation that has endured the trials and tribulations of Love Island over the summer, the original unreliable boyfriend returns next week. Will the Bank of England governor Mark Carney deliver the 0.25% rate hike that the market expects? Here are Wall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122sa rguments for a rate hike: Growth may not be that strong, but is reasonable considering the reduced growth potential post-crisis Strong retail sales and manufacturing data (PMIs) High job creation While here are three reasons not to: Brexit uncertainty, which is likely to intensify this autumn Trade war fears - as America threatens China with new tariffs Weak real wages, with earnings only slightly ahead of inflation France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak growth this year could mean Paris misses its deficit reduction targets, and push the national debt higher, says economist Emanuele Canegrati: That would be problematic for president Macron as he tries to push for eurozone reforms. Germany will be less receptive of more risk-sharing between euro members if the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest member is struggling. Global stock markets remain upbeat, as traders count down to 1.30pm BST...when we learn how America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy fared in the last quarter. Ken Odeluga of City Index says Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peach deal between the US and EU on trade is helping, as are recent financial results. In Europe the stream of earnings is picking up, with a set of pleasing if not spectacular reports on Friday. The car sector remains in sharp focus as an epicentre of the trade conflict on this side of the Atlantic and after the apparent stay of execution due to EU-U.S. rapprochement. With Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MIB all just slightly higher and Paris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC slightly soft, the atmosphere is constructive for further potential strength though lacks catalysts. In the currency markets, the pound has dropped back below $1.31 against the dollar. Sterling weakened after Brussels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 negotiator Michel Barnier gave Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcChequers Plan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 a punch in the solar plexus. Barnier rejected the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s idea of collecting tariffs and duties on goods entering Britain and heading into the European Union, saying that the EU must keep control of its money and borders (sound familiar?....) France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has been a tale of two halves in the last year, as economist Shaun Richards points out. Christopher Dembik of Saxo Bank fears the French economy is facing a negative shock: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our energy correspondent, Adam Vaughan, explaining why BP will be pleased to have acquired BHP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Billiton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US shale assets... The deal gives BP a much bigger footprint in oil-rich onshore basins and was described by its chief executive, Bob Dudley, as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transformational acquisition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ...and why BHP will be delighted to have got rid of them: BHP first acquired shale assets in 2011 for more than $20bn with the takeover of Petrohawk Energy and shale gas interests from Chesapeake Energy Corp, but suffered as gas prices collapsed, forcing it to book massive writedowns. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was the wrong environment to have bought the assets when they did but this is the right market to have sold them in,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Craig Evans, the co-portfolio manager of the Tribeca Global Natural Resources Fund, said. This chart, from INSEE, shows how France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate slowed in the last six months, after a solid 2017: The IT meltdown at Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s TSB bank has hurt its parent company, Sabadell, rather badly. Sabadell reported this morning that it tumbled into the red in the last quarter, losing \u00e2\u201a\u00ac138.7m in April-June. That period was a nightmare for TSB, and its customers, when an IT migration to a new platform went disastrously wrong, locking customers out of their accounts for days (and in some cases weeks). Sabadell has taken a one-off charge of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac203m for the outage, a bigger hit than expected, to cover compensation and lost business. TSB CEO Paul Pester was heavily criticised for his handling of the crisis. He has told reporters this morning that he plans to stay at the bank, and is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153100 percent focused\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on putting things right. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak growth figures haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t alarmed investors. European stocks have opened higher with the FTSE 100 gaining almost 0.3%. The French CAC is 0.2% higher too. In London, consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser has surged by 9%. It raised its annual revenue growth target on Friday, following strong growth in its child nutrition business. Telecoms group BT is also leading the risers, up 3% after posting a 3% rise in adjusted profits. European stocks are benefiting from the drop in the euro on Thursday. It shed almost 1% to $1.164, after the European Central Bank sounded dovish about interest rate hike prospects. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Macroeconomic on the French GDP figures: Bloomberg says those French growth figures are a disappointment: The euro area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy had a rough start to the year, when it, along with much of Europe, saw output strangled by bad weather and snowstorms. While there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a general loss of momentum across many economies this year, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown was exacerbated when rail workers staged industrial action to protest President Emmanuel Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reform plans. The continued sluggishness in France is a handicap for the euro area amid a period of uncertainty marked by global trade tensions and the prospect of European Central Bank paring back its vast monetary stimulus. Important energy news: oil giant BP is buying US shale oil and gas assets from mining group BHP Billiton, in a $10.5bn deal. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a major deal for BP - its biggest in around two decades, giving it a much more powerful position in the US energy sector. CEO Bob Dudley says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a transformational acquisition for our Lower 48 business, a major step in delivering our upstream strategy and a world-class addition to BP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s distinctive portfolio. Effectively BP is catching up the ground it lost after the Deepwater Horizon disaster, in which 11 workers died when their rig in the Gulf of Mexico caught fire. Shares in BHP Billiton have jumped over 2% at the start of trading in London -- analysts had only expected these assets to sell for $8-$10bn. BP are down 2%. Economist Philippe Waechter of Ostrum Asset Management says France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP new figures are disappointing. It may mean Emmanuel Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government will fail to hit its growth targets this year. French factories had a lacklustre quarter, with goods production falling in the last three months. INSEE says: Production in goods and services barely accelerated in Q2 2018 (+0.2% after +0.1%). It fell back again in goods (\u00e2\u02c6\u20190.3% after \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.6%) while it continued to grow in services (+0.4% after +0.3%). Output in manufactured goods fell back again (\u00e2\u02c6\u20190.2% after \u00e2\u02c6\u20191.0%). Production in refinery stepped back (\u00e2\u02c6\u20199.9% after \u00e2\u02c6\u20191.6%) due to technical maintenance; production in electricity and gas dropped too (\u00e2\u02c6\u20191.7% after +1.9%). However, construction bounced back (+0.6% after \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.3%). A wave of strikes by French railway workers and Air France employees hurt growth in the last quarter, it seems. Stats body INSEE blames industrial action across the French transport system for a big drop in transport spending. It says: In services, the slow down was notably driven by the downturn in transport expenses (\u00e2\u02c6\u20193.2% after +1.0%), mainly in rail transport as a result of strikes. French rail workers walked out for 26 days between April and June, as part of protest against reforms to the SNCF rail company. This caused disruption to national services, and routes within Paris. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has failed to accelerate. New growth figures show that the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest economy only grew by 0.2% in the second quarter of 2018. That only matches the slow performance seen in the first three months of 2018, and is weaker than the 0.3% which economists expected. The data highlights how Europe has lost momentum this year, after a rollicking 2017. INSEE, the statistics body, says household spending fell in the last quarter. Trade also held back growth, with imports growing faster than exports: Household consumption expenditures faltered slightly (\u00e2\u02c6\u20190.1% after +0.2%), whereas total gross fixed capital formation recovered sharply (GFCF: +0.7% after +0.1%). Overall, final domestic demand excluding inventory changes contributed as much to GDP growth as in Q1 (+0.2 points). Imports bounced back this quarter (+1.7% after \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.3%) as did exports to a lesser extent (+0.6% after \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.4%). All in all, foreign trade balance contributed negatively to GDP growth, \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.3 points, after a neutral contribution in Q1. Conversely, changes in inventories drove GDP on (+0.3 points after 0.0 points). More details to follow... Investors are also desperate to learn how well America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy performed in the last quarter. US GDP, due at 1.30pm UK time is likely to show impressive growth, as president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts stimulate the economy. White House economic adviser Lawrence Kudlow told the markets to expecting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd number - that could mean an annual growth rate over 4%. Also coming up today Amazon has brought some calm to the markets last night by beating profit forecasts. The e-commerce giant racked up record revenues in the quarter, and made twice as large a profit as investors expected. On a conference call with investors, Brian Olsavsky, the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief financial officer, cited growth in Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153most profitable areas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, particularly the cloud-computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Olsavsky also pointed to the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advertising products as contributing to gross profit while \u00e2\u20ac\u0153growing at a rapid clip\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That made up for Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shocking performance a day earlier, which prompted the biggest one-day loss in Wall Street history.

Measured by the harmonized European consumer price index, headline inflation remained unchanged at 2.1%, suggesting that headline inflation in the entire Eurozone (to be released tomorrow) could have hit the 2%-mark for the fourth time in the last five years.<br></p> <p>Returning to Germany, headline inflation at around 2% YoY, however, is still less the result of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultra-loose monetary policy but rather the result of higher energy prices. In fact, where available, regional core inflation measures remained broadly unchanged and only slightly above 1%, indicating that underlying inflationary pressures in the German economy remain low. Judging from the available components, German inflation data still tells a two-sided story: while prices for consumer goods have gradually accelerated in recent months, inflation on services has slowed down and has even been negative for a couple of months for communication. Also, whether it was the World Cup effect or just the ordinary sales season is hard to tell, but prices for clothing and shoes were the biggest drag on headline inflation.</p> <p>Looking ahead, there are still little signs supporting the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general optimism that underlying inflation in the entire Eurozone is picking up. Despite a very long economic cycle, low unemployment and rising wages, the German economy shows little sign of overheating, not even a significant pick-up in underlying inflation. Instead, headline inflation is mainly dominated by external and one-off factors. In this regard, the current heatwave could push up food prices and hence headline inflation in the coming months. But with little upside pressure on underlying inflation, chances that headline inflation will fall back under 2% towards the end of the year are much higher than staying at, or closely above, the 2%-mark.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b5ef322e4b09ef967470779\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-30T11:17:23.589Z\">12.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Oil prices are moving higher, helped by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong growth figures from the US.</p> <p>The prospects of sanctions on Iran denting supply is also supporting the market, although the continuing trade tensions between the US and China are a dampening influence.</p> <p>Brent crude is currently up 0.75% at $74.85 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 1.76% better at $69.9. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b5ee9d2e4b0a09780004cd7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-30T10:36:18.726Z\">11.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Press Association on the UK lending figures:</p> <blockquote> <p>The number of mortgage approvals made to home-buyers jumped to a five-month high in June, Bank of England figures show.</p> <p>Some 65,619 mortgages got the green light for house purchase - the highest monthly total since January.</p> <p>Re-mortgage approvals fell by 7.3% month on month, with 47,895 loans approved in June.

The root causes of those plunges were the Eurozone debt crisis and fears of a Chinese slowdown, and while the latter of the two could in particular resurface in the not too distant future the early signs this time around, should another plunge occur, seem to be in US tech stocks.</p> <p>Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stunning drop in Facebook caught many off guard and serves as a timely reminder that the latest leg higher in US markets has come on a narrowing breadth and increasingly ambitious price multiples. There remains much to occur before we even get anywhere near the panic seen in previous August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s but there are a growing set of circumstance arising which may spark a period of heightened volatility. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b5ee0a9e4b0a09780004c95\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-30T09:56:41.349Z\">10.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Speaking of the Bank of England rate-setting meeting on Thursday, Stefan Koopman, market economist at Rabobank, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This meeting is Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leap of faith.

Economic sentiment decreased slightly in July, adding to the view that the current pace of 0.4% GDP growth QoQ is more or less the cruising speed for 2018. The PMI and ESI sent differing signals about the performance of industry and services. The PMI saw a decline in the services index, while the ESI saw improvements and while the PMI indicated stable manufacturing conditions, the ESI industry indicator dropped. Overall, the picture was less positive from a business perspective for both surveys, while the ESI indicated stable consumer confidence.</p> <p>While disappointment with current economic conditions seems to be par for the course at the moment, growth concerns seem to be overstating the current situation somewhat. The outlook for domestic demand remains quite bright with continued employment recovery and some improvements in wage growth. The outlook for the external environment remains uncertain thanks to trade war concerns, although recent developments have been more positive. Even though a trade war has far from been avoided, last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting between US President Trump and European Commission President Juncker at least cleared the air for the moment and could be positive for Eurozone sentiment. The Eurozone economy has shifted into a lower gear for now, but the expansion does not seem to be at risk.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b5ed997e4b0a09780004c67\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-30T09:31:50.177Z\">10.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Business confidence across Europe remained fairly stable in July with a particularly strong performance from the UK, according to the latest figures.</p> <p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/indicators-statistics/economic-databases/business-and-consumer-surveys/latest-business-and-consumer-surveys_en\">The EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic sentiment indicator</a> for the eurozone was down just 0.2 points at 112.1 while for the wider European Union it edged up 0.1 points to 112.3.

                "bodyText":"Markets remain edgy after technology shares remain unloved in the wake of disappointing updates last week from Facebook and Twitter. Investors are also cautious ahead of a raft of central bank meetings this week, including the Bank of Japan, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. The FTSE 100 is virtually flat while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 0.29% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has slipped 0.18%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.12% while the technology heavy Nasdaq index is down 0.49%. On the economics front, confidence across the European Union held up this month with the European Commission figures showing a pick-up in sentiment in the UK. Still with the UK, mortgage approvals hit a five month high while in Germany, inflation was steady in July. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Better than expected second quarter earnings from industrial giant Caterpillar have given some support to struggling US markets. The heavy equipment maker raised its outlook for the full year, easing fears that the continuing trade dispute between the US and China would badly damage corporate profits. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has edged up 13 points or 0.07% in early trading while the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.01%. But last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tech sell-off continues to undermine the Nasdaq Composite, which has dipped 0.27%. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate remained steady in July, above the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of 2%. Consumer prices rose 2.1% year on year, the same as the previous month, according to the Federal Statistics Office. That was the figure harmonised with the rest of the European Union - without that it was within the 2% target and down from 2.1% the previous month. Economist Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank said the figures provided little evidence of a sustainable increase in underlying inflation: Based on the results of seven regional states, German headline inflation recorded another marginal drop and slowed down to 2.0% year on year in July, from 2.1.% YoY in June and 2.2% YoY in May. Measured by the harmonized European consumer price index, headline inflation remained unchanged at 2.1%, suggesting that headline inflation in the entire Eurozone (to be released tomorrow) could have hit the 2%-mark for the fourth time in the last five years. Returning to Germany, headline inflation at around 2% YoY, however, is still less the result of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultra-loose monetary policy but rather the result of higher energy prices. In fact, where available, regional core inflation measures remained broadly unchanged and only slightly above 1%, indicating that underlying inflationary pressures in the German economy remain low. Judging from the available components, German inflation data still tells a two-sided story: while prices for consumer goods have gradually accelerated in recent months, inflation on services has slowed down and has even been negative for a couple of months for communication. Also, whether it was the World Cup effect or just the ordinary sales season is hard to tell, but prices for clothing and shoes were the biggest drag on headline inflation. Looking ahead, there are still little signs supporting the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general optimism that underlying inflation in the entire Eurozone is picking up. Despite a very long economic cycle, low unemployment and rising wages, the German economy shows little sign of overheating, not even a significant pick-up in underlying inflation. Instead, headline inflation is mainly dominated by external and one-off factors. In this regard, the current heatwave could push up food prices and hence headline inflation in the coming months. But with little upside pressure on underlying inflation, chances that headline inflation will fall back under 2% towards the end of the year are much higher than staying at, or closely above, the 2%-mark. Oil prices are moving higher, helped by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong growth figures from the US. The prospects of sanctions on Iran denting supply is also supporting the market, although the continuing trade tensions between the US and China are a dampening influence. Brent crude is currently up 0.75% at $74.85 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 1.76% better at $69.9. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Press Association on the UK lending figures: The number of mortgage approvals made to home-buyers jumped to a five-month high in June, Bank of England figures show. Some 65,619 mortgages got the green light for house purchase - the highest monthly total since January. Re-mortgage approvals fell by 7.3% month on month, with 47,895 loans approved in June. Despite the drop-off, the Bank said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153re-mortgaging approvals remain broadly in line with the average over 2018 so far\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd... The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Money and Credit report also said that, excluding mortgages, households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 annual growth in borrowing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remained stable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at 8.8% in June. It said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Credit cards have been accounting for an increasing share of consumer credit growth over the past couple of years and the growth rate of credit card lending has exceeded that of other loans and advances (which includes personal loans, overdrafts and car finance) since January 2018.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Annual credit card growth stood at 9.5% in June, compared with 8.5% annual growth in other loans and advances. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the continued strength in non-mortgage borrowing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is symptomatic of the pressure on consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 finances, rather than rising confidence about the outlook for their incomes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The recent volatility in tech shares could herald a tricky summer for markets, says David Cheetham, chief market analyst at online trading platform XTB: The summer months are often seen as doldrums as far as the markets are concerned with the perception dating back several centuries and characterised succinctly with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sell-in-May\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trading adage. However, there have been some large moves in recent years and there are growing signs that we could be set for another turbulent August as we saw in 2011 and 2015. The root causes of those plunges were the Eurozone debt crisis and fears of a Chinese slowdown, and while the latter of the two could in particular resurface in the not too distant future the early signs this time around, should another plunge occur, seem to be in US tech stocks. Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stunning drop in Facebook caught many off guard and serves as a timely reminder that the latest leg higher in US markets has come on a narrowing breadth and increasingly ambitious price multiples. There remains much to occur before we even get anywhere near the panic seen in previous August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s but there are a growing set of circumstance arising which may spark a period of heightened volatility. Speaking of the Bank of England rate-setting meeting on Thursday, Stefan Koopman, market economist at Rabobank, says: This meeting is Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leap of faith. He has led the markets to expect a rate rise, so he now has little choice but to follow through or risk losing credibility. The good news is that after disappointing economic data earlier in the year, we expect to see 0.4% GDP growth this quarter. With there being evidence to show that the Q1 dip was weather-related rather than a structural, the Bank appears to have the platform to push through a hike. The only plausible reason we could see behind interest rates remaining flat would be the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit. But if rates do stay at 0.5% this time, we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect another rise until there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more clarity around the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the European Union. The pound is having an uncertain time as investors try to decide whether or not an interest rate rise is coming this week. Against the dollar it has edged up 0.15% to $1.3122 while against the euro it is down 0.18% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1226. Sterling is of course being influenced not only by the prospect of a rate rise but the continuing Brexit discussions and the progress (or lack of it) being made by the government. Ahead of the latest eurozone GDP figures due on Tuesday, ING economist Bert Colijn said: We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP data for Q2 to have improved from the disappointing Q1 and it does not look like Q3 has started on a stronger footing. Economic sentiment decreased slightly in July, adding to the view that the current pace of 0.4% GDP growth QoQ is more or less the cruising speed for 2018. The PMI and ESI sent differing signals about the performance of industry and services. The PMI saw a decline in the services index, while the ESI saw improvements and while the PMI indicated stable manufacturing conditions, the ESI industry indicator dropped. Overall, the picture was less positive from a business perspective for both surveys, while the ESI indicated stable consumer confidence. While disappointment with current economic conditions seems to be par for the course at the moment, growth concerns seem to be overstating the current situation somewhat. The outlook for domestic demand remains quite bright with continued employment recovery and some improvements in wage growth. The outlook for the external environment remains uncertain thanks to trade war concerns, although recent developments have been more positive. Even though a trade war has far from been avoided, last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting between US President Trump and European Commission President Juncker at least cleared the air for the moment and could be positive for Eurozone sentiment. The Eurozone economy has shifted into a lower gear for now, but the expansion does not seem to be at risk. Business confidence across Europe remained fairly stable in July with a particularly strong performance from the UK, according to the latest figures. The EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic sentiment indicator for the eurozone was down just 0.2 points at 112.1 while for the wider European Union it edged up 0.1 points to 112.3. The commission said: Broadly unchanged euro-area sentiment resulted from decreases in industry and retail trade confidence, which were offset by an increase in the services sector. Confidence in construction remained broadly stable while it stayed unchanged among consumers. The marginally better outcome of the headline indicator for the EU (+0.1) was mainly due to the marked improvement of sentiment in the largest non-euro area EU economy, the UK (+1.6) More on the UK borrowing figures: Signs of life in the UK housing market, as mortgage approvals picked up last month. Bank of England figures showed approvals rising from 64,684 in May to 65,619, slightly better than expected and hitting a five month high. Net mortgage lending rose by \u00c2\u00a33.851bn while consumer lending increased by \u00c2\u00a31.567bn. Some bad news from Heineken, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest beer maker. Reuters reports: [The company] cut its full-year margin forecasts due to currency weakness in some more profitable markets and expansion in Brazil, knocking its shares on Monday. The brewer of Heineken lager, Tiger, Sol and Strongbow cider reported first-half earnings below market expectations and said its operating margin would decline by 20 basis points in 2018, compared with a previous forecast of a 25 basis point increase, after it fell sharply in the first six months. Overall, the brewer sold more beer in the first six months of 2018 than expected, with growth rose steepest in its two most profitable markets, Vietnam and Mexico, along with Brazil, Cambodia, South Africa, Ethiopia and Russia. Heineken shares traded down 6.0 percent at 86.84 euros, by far the weakest performers in the FTSEurofirst index of leading European shares. The Dutch brewer, whose Heineken lager is the top seller in Europe, said the new guidance was because of the negative translational hit from currencies concentrated more in its higher margin countries, such as Vietnam, and a larger dilutive effect of its expanding Brazilian business. Heineken acquired the loss-making Brazilian operations of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kirin in 2017 to become the number two player in the South America country, and had previously warned of an impact on its margins. The latest Twitter comments from the US president have moved away from trade disputes for the moments, which may give some relief to investors, says Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management: US President Trump has been active on Twitter. Most of the tweets are about media and the Mueller investigation, and do not matter to markets. However, there was also a threat of shutting down the US government if US President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big, beautiful wall\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is not approved by Congress. There is a 30 September budget deadline. Markets may be somewhat relieved that the political focus of the Trump Twitter Feed has shifted from trade to immigration. Both matter as long-term economic topics, but trade is a bigger threat to investors in the near term. The downbeat mood continues although it is by no means a rout. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The markets got off to a negative start on what is going to be a crazy busy week, with investors caught between last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US tech-sell-off and the Fed and Bank of England meetings on Wednesday and Thursday respectively. The FTSE \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is not only facing the much-awaited BoE decision, but the latest PMIs AND updates from nearly a fifth of its constituents \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fell 0.4% after the bell. That dragged the index back under 7700, a level it has struggled to substantially break beyond for most of July. Once again its commodity stocks proved to be an issue, especially its miners, led lower by a 1% drop from copper. While the FTSE struggled, the pound \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for which Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BoE interest rate decision could be a make or break event \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was fairly serene. Against both the dollar and the euro sterling rose around 0.1%, hitting $1.312 against the former and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.125 against the latter. As for the Eurozone indices, there were in a similar mood to their UK counterpart. The DAX dipped 35 points, taking it back under 12850, with the CAC slipping 20 points to slip below 5500. In comparison to the UK and US the region doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a huge amount going on this week, meaning its trading could be driven by the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship to the dollar and pound. GVC, the owner of bookmakers Ladbrokes and Coral, is topping the FTSE 100 risers after confirming a $200m deal with MGM Resorts, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest casino operator. GVC is currently up more than 5%. Our full story on the deal is here: As expected, European markets have begun the week on a downbeat note, following the tech sell-off on Wall Street on Friady. The FTSE 100 has fallen 25 points or 0.33%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 0.27%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has lost 0.4% and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is 0.42% lower. On the results front, London focused estate agency Foxtons has slumped into loss as the capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property market continues to struggle. It lost \u00c2\u00a32.5m in the first half compared to a \u00c2\u00a33.8m profit this time last year, and said the outlook was mixed with a subdued sales market. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: Sales are the real problem as the exodus of buyers in the wake of the Brexit vote continues, while higher stamp duty is biting. Sales revenues fell 23% to \u00c2\u00a317.2m. Chief executive Nic Budden finds comfort in London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstrong fundamentals as a global hub\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. So he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be pleased to see Deutsche Bank moving half of its euro clearing out of the capital to Germany. Deutsche is reported by the Financial Times to be moving almost half its euro clearing activities from London to Frankfurt (\u00c2\u00a3). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets are expected to open lower after a tech sell-off on Wall Street at the end of last week. Investors are beginning to wonder if the relentless rise of the FAANG companies - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (now owned by Alphabet) - could be over. More likely is that there will be increasing divergence between them. Amazon reported stellar results once more and Alphabet easily shook off the effects of a European Commission fine, but Facebook recorded the biggest ever one day loss in value on Thursday after its outlook statement unnerved the market. This followed disappointing results from Netflix a few days earlier. Meanwhile Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s user numbers saw a 1m fall and its shares plummeted 20% on Friday. So the tech heavy Nasdaq Compositie index lost nearly 1.5% on Friday, which has already fed through into declines in Asian markets. Europe, which on the whole put in a reasonable performance last week after Donald Trump and EC president Jean-Claude Juncker eased trade war fears after a better than expected meeting, is also on course for early losses. The falls in the US came despite news that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy had grown by 4.1% on an annualised basis. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: The US session at the end of last week left traders digesting 4.1% yoy economic growth in the US in addition to another round of tech stocks reporting. After Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing update and record breaking sell off, Twitter quickly followed suit. A beat in revenue but a drop off in user activity sent the stock plunging 12% on fears that the platform\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s user growth could be limited. Earnings season had set off to a good start, however tech stock headlines have quickly dominated, transforming perceptions and raising questions over valuations of FAANG stocks. With Netflix, Facebook and now Twitter disappointing with results, investors are seriously questioning these advertising revenues based or subscription-based models. On the other hand, Amazon beat earnings expectations comfortably, whilst Alphabet shrugged off a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 billion fine. This original FAANG trade, which petty much guaranteed impressive returns across previous years, suddenly looks a lot more complicated. Whilst prior to the year these stocks could do no wrong, suddenly that is no longer the case. Investors will now be looking ahead to Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results on Tuesday, with the iPhone maker expected to be closer to the Amazon end of the scale than Facebook, This week also sees a number of central bank meetings. The Bank of England is expected to sanction an interest rate rise on Thursday, but the US Federal Reserve is likely to hold fire a day earlier, albeit it could well give further hints at a September increase. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the turn of the Bank of Japan, US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England to guide on monetary policy, and while no surprises are expected from the FOMC, we could get some policy tweaks from the Bank of Japan after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interventions in the JGB market. We could also get a rate rise from the Bank of England on Thursday when they meet to run the rule over the UK economy and the latest inflation report. Back to today, and there are a few economic numbers to look out for.

Where you have personal guarantees for example \u00e2\u20ac\u201c small business owners putting personal assets on the line to secure a loan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then surely that should be deemed consumer, regulated lending. </p> <p>The FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision follows the announcement that RBS is shutting its redress scheme for GRG customers in the coming months. If you have 16,000 customers who are eligible to use the scheme and only 1,230 have complained, common sense dictates that the scheme needs to stay open for a good while yet, particularly as the bank is still receiving six GRG complaints a week.</p> <p>The FCA needs to publish its full findings as swiftly as possible.

The FCA have an obligation to release this information so that politicians can have a say in whether it is truly the case that no further actions can be applied.

Any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153behind the curve\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd thoughts that may have surfaced earlier this year can be parked.</p> <p>Whereas the decline in growth in Q1 was considered to be due to one-offs, it seems like excuses are running out to explain the even weaker Q2 reading. Perhaps still temporary, but factors with a longer shelf life seem to have brought Eurozone GDP growth down to a lower cruising speed for the moment. The confidence impact of a trade row and weaker real household income growth seem to be spoiling the European party for the moment.</p> <p>Trade uncertainty seems to have already had a significant effect on the Eurozone economy in Q2. While the impact on real export growth has likely been small over the second quarter, the confidence factor has been more important. With lower confidence among businesses and consumers, concerns have likely translated into somewhat weaker domestic demand growth. In an economy in which capacity constraints abound and credit conditions remain favourable, confidence is the likely factor keeping investment down.</p> <p>Lower consumer confidence has taken some of the wind out of the sails from consumption growth. This comes on the back of trade concerns, but also slowing growth in real household income per capita since mid-2017. The second quarter has added to this trend because the rapid pickup in fuel prices has likely outstripped wage growth. French data - the breakdown of GDP is already available in France - confirms that private consumption performed poorly as it declined by 0.1%.</p> <p>Inflation remained high despite the weaker growth path that the Eurozone economy is on in 2018 but mainly driven by higher energy prices. The energy index increased by 9.4% YoY. These effects will weaken over the coming months, bringing the inflation rate more in line with core inflation. The core rate picked up to 1.1%, which is where it was in May as well. This is still weak and very much in line with ECB expectations. As the energy effects are temporary, the high inflation rate should be taken with a grain of salt from a policy perspective at the moment, so will the ECB.</p> <p>The implications of the lower cruising speed of the Eurozone economy are quite clear. The weaker cyclical picture and low core inflation provide little reason for the ECB to increase rates before autumn next year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b602c38e4b0b2d8950df82e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-31T09:32:57.307Z\">10.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Royal Bank of Scotland has welcomed (unsurprisingly) the FCA statement.

Andrew Bailey, FCA chief executive said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given the serious concerns that were identified in the independent review it was only right that we launched a comprehensive and forensic investigation to see if there was any action that could be taken against senior management or RBS.

Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success. </p> <p>We have consulted with independent, external leading counsel who has confirmed that the FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conclusions are correct and reasonable. </p> <p>I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. </p> <p>The fact that we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS.

                "bodyText":"It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a busy day for economic and corporate news. And a good one for relieved executives at Royal Bank of Scotland, who have been told that the City watchdog does not have the powers to take action against them over the mistreatment of business customers by the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GRG division. The chair of the Treasury Select Committee said it was bewildering the Financial Conduct Authority could not act. Not such a good day for some Dixons Carphone customers. The company has admitted that a data breach means around data from around 10m accounts may have been accessed without authority. On the economic front, eurozone GDP grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter but headline inflation was higher than forecast. The Bank of Japan tweaked its economic stimulus package and said interest rates would remain low for an extended period of time. Results from British Gas owner Centrica and DIY group Travis Perkins were badly received, while overall it was a mixed day for European stock markets. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.95% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dipped 0.19%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 100 points in early trading. On that note, it is time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. US markets have made a positive start to the trading day, helped by a rebound in technology stocks and the upbeat consumer spending figures. Shares were also supported by talk that the US and China were looking to re-start discussions about the current trade dispute. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 95 points or 0.36% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.33% and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite added 0.37%. US consumers are continuing to spend, especially on restaurants and accommodation. The commerce department said consumer spending rose by 0.4% in June, in line with expectations. The May increase was revised upwards from 0.2% to 0.5%. The personal consumption expenditures price index - excluding food and energy - rose by 0.1%, compared to a 0.2% rise in May. Another call for the Financial Conduct Authority to publish its full report on the Royal Bank of Scotland/GRG scandal, this time from the Federation of Small Businesses. Its chairman Mike Cherry said: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing in the current legislative framework to stop another GRG-type scenario. As long as commercial lending remains unregulated, small firms will be vulnerable. The hope is that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as the FCA claims \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the new Senior Managers Regime will lead to a more responsible lending climate in future. Too often, the regulator doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recognise that small business owners have far more in common with consumers than big corporations. Where you have personal guarantees for example \u00e2\u20ac\u201c small business owners putting personal assets on the line to secure a loan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then surely that should be deemed consumer, regulated lending. The FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision follows the announcement that RBS is shutting its redress scheme for GRG customers in the coming months. If you have 16,000 customers who are eligible to use the scheme and only 1,230 have complained, common sense dictates that the scheme needs to stay open for a good while yet, particularly as the bank is still receiving six GRG complaints a week. The FCA needs to publish its full findings as swiftly as possible. The only way to restore trust between small firms and the big banks is to show that the wrongs of the past are being put right, and real change is happening to prevent unfair treatment in the future. The All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking, which includes members from both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, said the City watchdog should release all its information about the GRG case. In a statement, the group said: At the APPG we are extremely disappointed, but largely unsurprised, by [the FCA] announcement. It is simply not good enough from a regulatory perspective to say that the powers to hold individuals to account simply do not exist. Kevin Hollinrake MP, Co-Chair of the APPG, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The FCA should release all findings and evidence they have obtained in their investigation of RBS GRG, unredacted so that the individuals who are responsible for this misconduct are in the public domain. The FCA have an obligation to release this information so that politicians can have a say in whether it is truly the case that no further actions can be applied. As lawmakers we have an obligation to the public to ensure that those who are responsible are accountable and not untouchable, as indeed is the case now where the individuals responsible are protected by the regulatory inadequacy of our current system\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He also stated: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The FCA should release all of their findings so that the untouchable senior managers at RBS GRG, many who remain working in the banking sector, are held to account. The public, the press and indeed the financial sector themselves have a right to know who is responsible for this misconduct\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. What has to be made absolutely clear is that this is not the FCA giving RBS an innocent verdict in relation to their GRG unit. It is clear that the FCA do not have the powers to adequately investigate and discipline instances of misconduct to a degree which gives victims any confidence. In the wake of the Financial Conduct Authority saying it does not have sufficient powers to disciple Royal Bank of Scotland executives over the GRG scandal, the head of the Treasury Select Committee has called for a review into whether new legislation is needed. MP Nicky Morgan MP said: It will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs is regulated. The Government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters wrapping up the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone economic news: The euro zone economy grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter, preliminary data showed on Tuesday, but headline and core inflation accelerated with unemployment stabilizing at a lower level. The European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics office Eurostat estimated that gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro expanded 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter in the April-June period and was 2.1 percent higher against the same period of 2017. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.4 percent quarterly expansion and a 2.2 percent year-on-year rise. Headline consumer inflation accelerated to 2.1 percent year-on-year in July from 2.0 percent in June, mainly because of a spike in the cost of energy. Core inflation, which excludes energy costs as well as unprocessed food and which the European Central Bank looks at in policy decisions, also rose to 1.3 percent year-on-year from 1.2 percent in June, beating economists expectations. An even narrower core inflation measure that economists pay attention to, which excludes also the costs of alcohol and tobacco, also rose to 1.1 percent from 0.9 percent in July \u00e2\u20ac\u201d again, above expectations. The ECB wants to keep headline inflation below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term. Separately, Eurostat said unemployment in the euro zone was at 8.3 percent in June, unchanged from a downwardly revised 8.3 percent in May. Commenting on the eurozone inflation figures, Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG said: Eurozone inflation data has pushed pressure back onto Mario Draghi &amp; co, with headline CPI breaching the 2% target for the first time since 2012. While much of the rise in inflation can be attributed to the incredible 9.4% annual rise in the energy component, the fact that we have also seen core inflation jump 0.2% means that many of the underlying components are also being affected. With the ECB set to end their QE programme by the end of the year, markets will be keen to see Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response should inflation continue to push higher. The weaker than expected eurozone growth figures mean the European Central Bank is unlikely to raise rates before next autumn, says ING Bank senior economist Bert Colijn: The Eurozone economy grew by just 0.3% QoQ in the second quarter with inflation increasing to above 2%. Any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153behind the curve\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd thoughts that may have surfaced earlier this year can be parked. Whereas the decline in growth in Q1 was considered to be due to one-offs, it seems like excuses are running out to explain the even weaker Q2 reading. Perhaps still temporary, but factors with a longer shelf life seem to have brought Eurozone GDP growth down to a lower cruising speed for the moment. The confidence impact of a trade row and weaker real household income growth seem to be spoiling the European party for the moment. Trade uncertainty seems to have already had a significant effect on the Eurozone economy in Q2. While the impact on real export growth has likely been small over the second quarter, the confidence factor has been more important. With lower confidence among businesses and consumers, concerns have likely translated into somewhat weaker domestic demand growth. In an economy in which capacity constraints abound and credit conditions remain favourable, confidence is the likely factor keeping investment down. Lower consumer confidence has taken some of the wind out of the sails from consumption growth. This comes on the back of trade concerns, but also slowing growth in real household income per capita since mid-2017. The second quarter has added to this trend because the rapid pickup in fuel prices has likely outstripped wage growth. French data - the breakdown of GDP is already available in France - confirms that private consumption performed poorly as it declined by 0.1%. Inflation remained high despite the weaker growth path that the Eurozone economy is on in 2018 but mainly driven by higher energy prices. The energy index increased by 9.4% YoY. These effects will weaken over the coming months, bringing the inflation rate more in line with core inflation. The core rate picked up to 1.1%, which is where it was in May as well. This is still weak and very much in line with ECB expectations. As the energy effects are temporary, the high inflation rate should be taken with a grain of salt from a policy perspective at the moment, so will the ECB. The implications of the lower cruising speed of the Eurozone economy are quite clear. The weaker cyclical picture and low core inflation provide little reason for the ECB to increase rates before autumn next year. Royal Bank of Scotland has welcomed (unsurprisingly) the FCA statement. Chairman Howard Davies said: The Board welcomes the FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. The Board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now. As a reminder, here is our story from February which includes details of how RBS mistreated its business customers: Elsewhere, the Financial Conduct Authority has said it can take no action to discipline Royal Bank of Scotland management over the mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its Global Restructuring Group subsidiary. Andrew Bailey, FCA chief executive said: Given the serious concerns that were identified in the independent review it was only right that we launched a comprehensive and forensic investigation to see if there was any action that could be taken against senior management or RBS. It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success. We have consulted with independent, external leading counsel who has confirmed that the FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conclusions are correct and reasonable. I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. The fact that we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers. We feel strongly that those companies that have suffered loss as a result of how they were treated whilst in GRG must be appropriately compensated. We are closely monitoring the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, an independent third party, to ensure that things are put right. Meanwhile eurozone inflation has come in higher than forecast. The headline figure rose by 2.1% year on year in July compared to 2% the month before and expectations of an unchanged number. Eurozone GDP grew by 2.1% year on year in the second quarter, down from 2.5% and lower than the forecast 2.2%. On a quarter by quarter basis it grew by 0.3%, compared to expectations of a 0.4% rise. Two more big fallers after updates, this time in the mid-cap FTSE 250. Building materials group Travis Perkins is down nearly 10% after it warned 2018 operating profits would be at the lower end of expectations. The company, which owns the Wickes chain, blamed weak demand in the home DIY market. Meanwhile Games Workshop, whose shares have been strong performers recently, is down more than 6% despite reporting a near doubling of full year profits to \u00c2\u00a374.5m. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless total fell by 6,000 in July to 2.338m, compared to expectations of a 10,000 decline. The unemployment rate was steady at 5.2%, as forecast. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the Dixons Carphone data breach: Dixons Carphone said an investigation into a massive data breach has found personal data belonging to 10 million customers may have been accessed last year, nearly 10 times as many as initially thought. The electronics retailer had estimated the attack involved unauthorised access to 1.2m personal records, when it first reported the breach in June. It said there was no evidence of any fraud. Alex Baldock, chief executive, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since our data security review uncovered last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breach, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been working around the clock to put it right. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s included closing off the unauthorised access, adding new security measures and launching an immediate investigation, which has allowed us to build a fuller understanding of the incident that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re updating on today. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Again, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re disappointed in having fallen short here, and very sorry for any distress we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve caused our customers. I want to assure them that we remain fully committed to making their personal data safe with us.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The company said records containing personal data such as names, addresses or email addresses had been accessed, but not financial information. It is writing to customers to apologise for the data breach, but does not plan to pay compensation as there is no evidence that anyone has suffered any financial loss. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While there is no evidence that some of this data may have left our systems, these records do not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence that any fraud has resulted,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dixons said. The full report is here: Some big falls on the FTSE 100 from company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reporting results. Rentokil Initial is down 4.4% after half year profits dropped 81.5% although last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure included a one off \u00c2\u00a3462m profit on the disposal of its workwear business. Revenues fell 4.7%. Standard Chartered is 3.4% lower despite a 34% rise in profits, as worries about a trade war unsettle investors. And British Gas owner Centrica is down 3.5% as it reported a 20% fall in profits at its consumer division and announced the loss of another 226,000 customers or 1% in the first half. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com said: Centrica results make for some grim reading again but management does sound a little more confident than the talk of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmaterial uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 we got at the start of the year... The UK Consumer division is leaking cash and customers. Although the customer churn has slowed with accounts down just 1%, profits there fell 20%. The cold snap could have been good for Centrica but higher wholesale costs, fewer customer accounts and the prepayment cap all weighed on profits. And while it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing, the loss of customers needs to be arrested fast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cutting costs is working for now but is not sustainable longer term. Centrica lost 226,000 customers in the first half and the fact that this is flagged as a better performance than previously shows just how bad the situation is. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a cautious opening for European markets, with a raft of company results, some key economic data ahead and continuing concerns about valuations in the technology sector after major falls for Facebook and Twitter. The FTSE 100 is up 0.07%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged 0.1% higher but France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac fell 0.1% and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB dipped 0.04%. The Bank of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions today continue its dovish tendencies. Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING Bank said: When it comes to the July BoJ meeting, there was more than meets the eye \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the central bank making subtle, yet curious, tweaks to its unconventional policy artillery. But if anyone was in doubt, the super-easy BoJ policy is still very much in place; while officials will allow for greater flexibility in long-term yields, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to stress the two-way flexibility here (not just upwards, but also downwards). In fact, by firmly restating the annual \u00c2\u00a580trn JGB purchase target, the BoJ are showing no real appetite for a rapid rise in long-term yields (there was explicit aversion to this in the statement). What sealed the dovish deal was the guidance that the BoJ will \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmaintain very low rate levels for an extended period of time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is not too dissimilar to what the ECB stated last month. Back in the UK, and Dixons Carphone had previously announced it had found unauthorised access to some of its data. Now it says that around 10m records containing personal data may have been affected in 2017. It says there is evidence some of this data may have left its systems but it maintains these records did not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence of any fraud being committed. It is now contacting all of its customers to apologise and advise them of the steps they need to take to minimise the risk of fraud. German consumers are spending freely according to the latest retail sales figures. They rose 3% year on year in June, up from a 1.2% rise in May and much better than the 1.5% increase expected by analysts. The month on month figure showed a 1.2% increase, compared to a 1.5% decline in May. Here are the opening calls for the European markets from IG: In Asia the Hang Seng is down 0.53% while the Nikkei 225 is up 0.039%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors will be anticipating another nervy day on the markets after a weak start to the week. The technology drop which followed last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor results from Facebook and Twitter continued on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite recording its third decline of more than 1% in a row. Will Apple, which reports later, be able to turn the tide? Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Apple shares managed to outperform [on Monday], only declining 0.5%, but only because investors are looking ahead to tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Q3 earnings announcement, but even here there may be cause for concern. Lower average selling prices at its Q2 update suggested that buyers were opting for cheaper models, perhaps indicating that iPhone X sales may have peaked. Whether this is true or not is likely to be difficult to determine given that Q3 tends to be a weak quarter in any case, as it tends to be a precursor to a range of new product launches or updates, which tend to happen in Q4. Of more importance will be its burgeoning services business, which includes music, games, apps and Apple pay fees, and which has slowly grown in importance, and has seen revenues rise consistently since 2012. It is a busy day for company results ahead of the start of the summer lull, with BP already reporting its first dividend hike since 2014. On the economic front we have eurozone GDP figures, with the second quarter expected to show a dip from 2.5% to 2.2% on an annualised basis. Initial July inflation figures for the bloc are forecast to remain at 2% on a headline basis, with the core number edging back to 1%. Hewson said: Last week the European Central Bank signed off for its summer break by playing down expectations that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d see a rate rise much before the end of Q3 next year, and this candour from President Mario Draghi went some way to help push the euro down towards the bottom end of its recent range. Since then we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen it start to edge back up again despite a strong US Q2 GDP number, which has seen US rates edge back up again, and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest preliminary flash EU CPI number for July could well prompt a further recovery towards the 1.1800 area. Inflation pressures have popped higher in recent months, helped by rising energy prices, however these do appear to have stalled a little, particularly given that core prices dropped below 1% in June to 0.9%.
