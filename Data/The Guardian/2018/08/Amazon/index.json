Markit said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>US manufacturing firms signalled a strong improvement in operating conditions in July, despite the headline PMI falling to a five-month low. Weaker rises in output and employment were seen in July, while export sales fell for the second month in a row. Meanwhile, companies reported the greatest deterioration in vendor performance since the series began and a faster rate of input cost inflation. That said, business confidence remained strongly positive, and was supported by hopes of further increases in overall new orders. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"229fcaf4943b426b3e0f5d17bf54c1384b6c92c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/229fcaf4943b426b3e0f5d17bf54c1384b6c92c5/0_0_873_518/500.jpg\" alt=\"uspmi1aug\" width=\"500\" height=\"297\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US manufacturing sector continued to expand in July, but shows increasing signs of struggling against headwinds of supply shortages, rising prices and deteriorating exports. </p> <p>The latest survey showed output rising at a rate roughly equivalent to an annualised 1% pace of expansion, which is the weakest since late last year. While a weakening of new export orders for a second successive month suggested foreign demand has waned compared to earlier in the year, the slowdown can be also in part attributed to increased difficulties in sourcing sufficient quantities of inputs. Suppliers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 delivery delays were more widespread than at any time in the survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history. With producers often scrambling to buy enough raw materials, suppliers enjoyed greater pricing power. Not surprisingly, with tariffs also kicking in, cost pressures spiked higher again.</p> <p>Some relief for manufacturers came from strong domestic demand, which meant firms were increasingly able to pass higher costs on to customers. Average prices charged for goods consequently rose at the steepest rate for seven years, which is likely to feed through to higher consumer prices in coming months.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b61b799e4b0081aec3b9962\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T13:38:50.581Z\">2.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise has helped lift technology stocks on Wall Street, pushing the Nasdaq Composite 0.39% higher.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average - which also includes Apple - is marginally higher, up 0.04% while the S&amp;P 500 has opened 0.17% higher.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b61b0b8e4b0081aec3b991c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T13:31:22.438Z\">2.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Apple shares open up 4.4%</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Following its forecast-beating results and upbeat outlook, Apple shares have jumped 4.4% to $198.4. at the start of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading, helping support a US market rattled by renewed concerns about a damaging trade war between the US and China.</p> <p>The move means Apple is close to becoming the first company to be valued at $1tn.

Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Apple shares leapt 4% in after-hours trade and are set to open at a record high just shy of the $200 level. Although it would be a bit of a stretch, a push up to the $1tn mark today is a possibility - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a matter of time before it achieves a valuation of $1tn. If it does, cue some big profit taking but it would be a moment to savour for Tim Cook.</p> <p> We need the share price to break $203 to hit $1tn in market cap \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a little more than $5 above the after-hours level at $197-$198. Rather like the Dow at 25k, you kind of get the feeling investors will conspire to nudge it over the line. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in FAANGs now I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see why you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rotate some equity out of more exposed companies like Facebook and Netflix and opt for relative safety in Apple, whose multiples remain well short of FAANG peers. What might weigh today is broader market fears about trade wars with China as the White House sets out fresh tariff plans on $200bn of Chinese goods. Tim Cook was pretty circumspect on trade and tariffs on the call.</p> <p> Results were very impressive with a beat on revenues and EPS. iPhone sales were a shade weaker than forecast but on a number of important fronts we saw excellent numbers.</p> </blockquote> <p>The FAANGs - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-owner Alphabet - and the wider technology sector have been under pressure in recent days after poor results from Facebook and Twitter.

But the downbeat survey is unlikely to discourage the Bank of England from raising interest rates on Thursday, he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At 54.0, the latest UK manufacturing PMI is the lowest in three months and is a far cry from the levels seen towards the end of 2017. Weaker domestic demand saw new orders fall and the rate of output growth slip to the lowest in 16 months. Interestingly though, demand from abroad hit a six-month high, implying that firms are still reaping the rewards of better global growth, despite the recent moderation in Europe.</p> <p>But over coming months, life for manufacturers is unlikely to get any easier. The recent escalation in trade tensions is clearly a challenge, but increasingly the biggest headache for businesses is likely to be the threat of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit. This scenario would likely see huge congestion at ports and disruption to supply chains. While we suspect the probability of the UK leaving without an agreement in March next year is relatively low, an agreement may not come until late in the day.</p> <p>Until then, confidence could begin to fall as uncertainty increases \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the latest PMI suggests the degree of positive sentiment is already at a 21-month low.</p> <p>Having said all of that, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slip in the PMI is unlikely to faze Bank of England policymakers ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. Representing around 10% of output, manufacturing is a relatively small part of the UK growth mix. Importantly, the recent data flow \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly in the much larger service sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has largely backed up the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view that the economy has regained poise after the weak first quarter.</p> <p>For that reason, we think the Bank of England will increase interest rates this week. But the key thing to watch is what the Bank has to say on its next steps. In an ideal world, we think policymakers would like to hike rates again much sooner than markets are currently pricing (towards the end of 2019). But with Brexit uncertainty considerably ramping up, realistically we think the Bank will struggle to raise rates again before the UK leaves the EU next March.</p> <p>After Thursday, we currently don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anticipate another hike before May 2019.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b61725ee4b0353e1304fc95\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T08:43:22.623Z\">9.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The prospect of a trade war between the US and China is the biggest worry for UK manufacturers, says Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The dip in the [PMI] reading comes after an eventful month politically. But if manufacturers are not completely ignoring the Brexit uncertainty, they are nevertheless ploughing on regardless.</p> <p>If anything, the biggest current worry for a sector with so many exporters is the prospect of an all-out trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. The fear is that UK manufacturers become collateral damage in any tit-for-tat tariffs that are imposed at a time when firms are benefiting from their exposure to the still relatively buoyant global economy.</p> <p>The automotive industry is facing a particularly anxious time grappling as it is with weaker consumer sentiment, ambivalence towards diesel engines and uncertainty about those future trade arrangements. This is a real worry given the number of jobs and exports supported by the sector.</p> <p>But by contrast, UK aerospace enjoyed a good July, boosted by the Farnborough Airshow.

Overall production slowed, whilst new order growth took a leisurely pace, and it was the unbalanced reliance on export orders that kept the sector afloat with domestic clients keeping their distance. </p> <p>This general manufacturing malaise was compounded by a scarcity of essential raw materials and vendor delivery times lengthened at a pace not seen for ten months as supply chains stuttered and stumbled to meet contractual obligations. </p> <p>On the price front, firms raised client prices again in a bid to prevent another sudden increase in their own costs from gnawing away at hard-won profits. But, this strategy may not offer long-term solutions as uncertainty remains enemy no.1. Should operating conditions remain unchanged, this damp squib of a performance may persist and the UK has to look to other sectors to inject some vitality into its economic performance.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T09:23:48.300Z\">at 10.23am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b616f9fe4b0353e1304fc7b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T08:32:02.873Z\">9.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK manufacturing worse than expected</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories have performed slightly worse than forecast in July.</p> <p>IHS Markit/CIPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 54 last month, less than the 54.2 expected.

                "bodyText":"A host of manufacturing surveys for July showed a disappointing outcome for the UK, while eurozone growth was also sluggish. Over in the US factory growth slipped in July, while a jobs report was better than expected although it came with a warning on the outlook. The latest UK housing market report from Nationwide showed a 2.5% annual rise in July ahead of an expected Bank of England interest rate rise on Thursday. Overall markets were subdued after reports of an escalation in the trade dispute between the US and China, with President Trump said to be considering raising the existing 10% tariff on $200bn of imports from China to 25%. And following its positive results on Tuesday, Apple shares opened up 4.4%, pushing the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value close to a record $1tn. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. US factory growth dipped slightly in July, according to the latest manufacturing survey, partly due to falling exports and supply problems. The IHS Markit US manufacturing PMI came in at 55.3 last month, down from 55.4 and lower than the initial estimate of 55.5. Markit said: US manufacturing firms signalled a strong improvement in operating conditions in July, despite the headline PMI falling to a five-month low. Weaker rises in output and employment were seen in July, while export sales fell for the second month in a row. Meanwhile, companies reported the greatest deterioration in vendor performance since the series began and a faster rate of input cost inflation. That said, business confidence remained strongly positive, and was supported by hopes of further increases in overall new orders. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: The US manufacturing sector continued to expand in July, but shows increasing signs of struggling against headwinds of supply shortages, rising prices and deteriorating exports. The latest survey showed output rising at a rate roughly equivalent to an annualised 1% pace of expansion, which is the weakest since late last year. While a weakening of new export orders for a second successive month suggested foreign demand has waned compared to earlier in the year, the slowdown can be also in part attributed to increased difficulties in sourcing sufficient quantities of inputs. Suppliers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 delivery delays were more widespread than at any time in the survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history. With producers often scrambling to buy enough raw materials, suppliers enjoyed greater pricing power. Not surprisingly, with tariffs also kicking in, cost pressures spiked higher again. Some relief for manufacturers came from strong domestic demand, which meant firms were increasingly able to pass higher costs on to customers. Average prices charged for goods consequently rose at the steepest rate for seven years, which is likely to feed through to higher consumer prices in coming months. Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise has helped lift technology stocks on Wall Street, pushing the Nasdaq Composite 0.39% higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average - which also includes Apple - is marginally higher, up 0.04% while the S&amp;P 500 has opened 0.17% higher. Following its forecast-beating results and upbeat outlook, Apple shares have jumped 4.4% to $198.4. at the start of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading, helping support a US market rattled by renewed concerns about a damaging trade war between the US and China. The move means Apple is close to becoming the first company to be valued at $1tn. It would need to hit $203.25 to reach that level. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IG index on the expected opening for Wall Street: In pre-trading Apple shares are currently up around 4%, not quite enough so far to push it above a $1tn valuation. US private sector employers took on more workers than expected in July, according to a new report, partly due to this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hefty tax cuts. Ahead of the non-farm payroll numbers on Friday, ADP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment report showed a 219,000 increase in private sector jobs last month, compared to expectations of a 185,000 rise. Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of the ADP Research Institute, said: The labour market is on a roll with no signs of a slowdown in sight. Nearly every industry posted strong gains and small business hiring picked up. But there could be storm clouds ahead given President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariff plans and trade disputes. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Analytics which helped compile the report, said: The job market is booming, impacted by the deficit-financed tax cuts and increases in government spending. Tariffs have yet to materially impact jobs, but the multinational companies shed jobs last month, signalling the threat. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all good news for Apple despite its upbeat results and its approach towards a $1tn valuation. Samuel Gibbs reports: Huawei overtook Apple to become the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest smartphone seller behind Samsung in the second quarter, the first time in seven years that any contender has managed to split the top two. Multiple market analysts said that Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise came as the slowdown in China, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest market for smartphones, eased, with growing market share in Europe. Huawei failed in its recent bid to launch in the US after government action against companies deemed a security threat. Despite Apple being historically weak in the second quarter, analysts described the rise of Huawei as significant. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The importance of Huawei overtaking Apple this quarter cannot be overstated,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Canalys analyst Ben Stanton. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is the first time in seven years that Samsung and Apple have not held the top two positions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Our full report is here: The FTSE 100 has taken a turn for the worse in the course of the morning. Trade tensions are uppermost in investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds following reports that the US plans to raise the tariffs it plans of $200bn worth of imports from China from the original 10% to 25%. So commodity stocks are among the leading fallers on concerns that any slowdown in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy would hit the sector hard. Sharp falls in the likes of Next, Direct Line and Rio Tinto after their latest updates is also hitting the market, leaving the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index 1% or 77 points lower at 7671. So is this the day Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market value hits $1tn? All eyes will be on Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open to see how the better than expected results are received. Will investors push Apple higher or decide to take profits? Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, says: Apple shares leapt 4% in after-hours trade and are set to open at a record high just shy of the $200 level. Although it would be a bit of a stretch, a push up to the $1tn mark today is a possibility - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a matter of time before it achieves a valuation of $1tn. If it does, cue some big profit taking but it would be a moment to savour for Tim Cook. We need the share price to break $203 to hit $1tn in market cap \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a little more than $5 above the after-hours level at $197-$198. Rather like the Dow at 25k, you kind of get the feeling investors will conspire to nudge it over the line. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in FAANGs now I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see why you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rotate some equity out of more exposed companies like Facebook and Netflix and opt for relative safety in Apple, whose multiples remain well short of FAANG peers. What might weigh today is broader market fears about trade wars with China as the White House sets out fresh tariff plans on $200bn of Chinese goods. Tim Cook was pretty circumspect on trade and tariffs on the call. Results were very impressive with a beat on revenues and EPS. iPhone sales were a shade weaker than forecast but on a number of important fronts we saw excellent numbers. The FAANGs - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-owner Alphabet - and the wider technology sector have been under pressure in recent days after poor results from Facebook and Twitter. But Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures could give some badly needed support to the sector. The pound is not getting much help from the prospect of an interest rate rise on Thursday. Against the dollar it is down 0.05% at $1.3117, while against the euro is has edged up 0.05% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1229. The survey is positive about exports but less so about domestic demand, says Helena Sans, head of manufacturing at Barclays: A disappointing result for the manufacturing sector in July with PMI at a three-month low, although still firmly in positive territory. Of more concern is the weakest business confidence score for 21 months, indicating that the industry is desperate for a degree of clarity and progress on the Brexit negotiations and a better understanding of what the final outcome will mean for manufacturers. It looks like a tale of two markets at the moment, with export growth accelerating but domestic demand struggling to keep pace. Aside from the encouraging news for exporters, the only other real bright spot was more job growth, with two full years of consecutive monthly employment increases no mean feat. Following the weaker than expected UK manufacturing report, things are unlikely to improve in the immediate future, says ING Bank economist James Smith. But the downbeat survey is unlikely to discourage the Bank of England from raising interest rates on Thursday, he says: At 54.0, the latest UK manufacturing PMI is the lowest in three months and is a far cry from the levels seen towards the end of 2017. Weaker domestic demand saw new orders fall and the rate of output growth slip to the lowest in 16 months. Interestingly though, demand from abroad hit a six-month high, implying that firms are still reaping the rewards of better global growth, despite the recent moderation in Europe. But over coming months, life for manufacturers is unlikely to get any easier. The recent escalation in trade tensions is clearly a challenge, but increasingly the biggest headache for businesses is likely to be the threat of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit. This scenario would likely see huge congestion at ports and disruption to supply chains. While we suspect the probability of the UK leaving without an agreement in March next year is relatively low, an agreement may not come until late in the day. Until then, confidence could begin to fall as uncertainty increases \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the latest PMI suggests the degree of positive sentiment is already at a 21-month low. Having said all of that, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slip in the PMI is unlikely to faze Bank of England policymakers ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. Representing around 10% of output, manufacturing is a relatively small part of the UK growth mix. Importantly, the recent data flow \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly in the much larger service sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has largely backed up the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view that the economy has regained poise after the weak first quarter. For that reason, we think the Bank of England will increase interest rates this week. But the key thing to watch is what the Bank has to say on its next steps. In an ideal world, we think policymakers would like to hike rates again much sooner than markets are currently pricing (towards the end of 2019). But with Brexit uncertainty considerably ramping up, realistically we think the Bank will struggle to raise rates again before the UK leaves the EU next March. After Thursday, we currently don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anticipate another hike before May 2019. The prospect of a trade war between the US and China is the biggest worry for UK manufacturers, says Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking: The dip in the [PMI] reading comes after an eventful month politically. But if manufacturers are not completely ignoring the Brexit uncertainty, they are nevertheless ploughing on regardless. If anything, the biggest current worry for a sector with so many exporters is the prospect of an all-out trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. The fear is that UK manufacturers become collateral damage in any tit-for-tat tariffs that are imposed at a time when firms are benefiting from their exposure to the still relatively buoyant global economy. The automotive industry is facing a particularly anxious time grappling as it is with weaker consumer sentiment, ambivalence towards diesel engines and uncertainty about those future trade arrangements. This is a real worry given the number of jobs and exports supported by the sector. But by contrast, UK aerospace enjoyed a good July, boosted by the Farnborough Airshow. Bumper orders for the major aircraft manufacturers will help the small- and medium-sized businesses in their supply chains and the launch of the new Tempest fighter jet has the potential to safeguard thousands of highly-skilled jobs. The weaker than expected figures could give the Bank of England second thoughts if it really is planning to raise UK interest rates on Thursday, suggests IHS Markit director Rob Dobson: The financial markets still seem to have an interest rate increase nailed on for August. However, if the combination of weaker growth and a softening of pipeline cost pressures at manufacturers is mirrored in the larger service sector, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision will be far from unanimous and they may even yet find some cause for pause. The figure of 54 for July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK manufacturing PMI is a three month low, albeit that any number over 50 shows the sector is expanding. Markit said: The softer growth patch of the UK manufacturing sector continued at the start of the third quarter. July saw slower rates of expansion in both output and new orders, as weaker growth of new work from domestic sources offset a stronger increase in new export orders. Price pressures also remained elevated as a strong increase in average input costs led to the steepest rise in selling prices since February... July saw the degree of positive sentiment dip to a 21-month low, amid reports of uncertainty regarding both Brexit and the exchange rate. Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply which co-compiles the survey, said: There was a flatline feel to manufacturing this month, as the sector held its ground, but only just. Overall production slowed, whilst new order growth took a leisurely pace, and it was the unbalanced reliance on export orders that kept the sector afloat with domestic clients keeping their distance. This general manufacturing malaise was compounded by a scarcity of essential raw materials and vendor delivery times lengthened at a pace not seen for ten months as supply chains stuttered and stumbled to meet contractual obligations. On the price front, firms raised client prices again in a bid to prevent another sudden increase in their own costs from gnawing away at hard-won profits. But, this strategy may not offer long-term solutions as uncertainty remains enemy no.1. Should operating conditions remain unchanged, this damp squib of a performance may persist and the UK has to look to other sectors to inject some vitality into its economic performance. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories have performed slightly worse than forecast in July. IHS Markit/CIPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 54 last month, less than the 54.2 expected. This was lower than the June figure of 54.3, itself revised down from the initial estimate of 54.4. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s country by country manufacturing PMIs for July: The overall eurozone manufacturing sector was subdued in July, according to IHS Markit, and there could be worse to come. The final purchasing managers index edged up from 54.9 in June to 55.1 as trade tensions and rising prices dented optimism. The final figure was unchanged from the initial estimate, and follows disappointing second quarter eurozone GDP figures released on Tuesday. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: A marginal uptick in the PMI provides little cause for cheer given it is the second weakest number for more than one-and-a-half years. The past two months have seen the most subdued spell of factory output growth since late-2016. Worse may be to come. Even this reduced rate of output growth continued to outpace order book growth, resulting in the smallest rise in order book backlogs for two years. The clear implication is that manufacturers may have to adjust production down in coming months unless demand revives. Clues to the current soft patch lie in the export growth trend, which has deteriorated dramatically since the start of the year across all member states to reach a near-two year low, with France and Austria seeing exports fall into decline in July. The survey responses indicate that the slowdown likely reflects worries about trade wars, tariffs and rising prices, as well as general uncertainty about the economic outlook. Optimism about the future remained at one of the lowest levels seen over the past two years. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector recovered from June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 18 month low last month, albeit more slowly than initial estimates. IHS Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s purchasing managers index rose from 55.9 in June to 56.9, lower than the initial reading of 57.3. IHS Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economist Sian Jones said: The beginning of the second half of the year brought a faster rise in manufacturing growth among German manufacturers. Following a dip in overall performance in June, the upturn in output and new orders strengthened. That said, the increase in production continued to outpace that of new orders as firms expanded their efforts to clear backlogs. Although slightly weaker than June, employment growth continued to grow sharply, with greater production requirements a key factor behind sustained job creation. Panellists also reported stronger optimism towards future output growth, the most robust since April. Concerns were raised however, with some respondents noting uncertainty surrounding tariffs and further marked rises in input costs as risks to future growth. In turn, pressure on supply chains remained significant as firms continued to comment on bottlenecks at suppliers. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories did better in July than analysts had been expecting. IHS/Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing purchasing managers index climbed from 52.5 in June to 53.3, compared to an initial reading of 53.1. Output and new orders increased but exports fell back amid global trade tensions. IHS Markit economist Alex Gill said: July saw renewed growth momentum in the French manufacturing sector, with output and new orders rising at sharper rates, moving off their recent lows seen in June. Stronger client demand encouraged firms to take on additional staff, raise their purchasing activity and boosted hopes of further near-term growth. The only slight blip was a first fall in new export orders since September 2016, as global trade tensions hamper foreign demand. With trade tensions on the rise again, investors are in a cautious mood despite Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than expected results. The FTSE 100 is down 0.44%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has edged up 0.21% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.35%. Among the companies reporting, Lloyds Banking Group is leading the FTSE 100 risers, up 1.8% but Next is down nearly 6% despite a good second quarter as it expressed caution about the prospects for August sales. Among the mid-caps in the FTSE 250, BBA Aviation has slumped 15% after saying it expected \u00e2\u20ac\u0153modest growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd this year. Outsourcing group Capita is down 9.5% as it said its turnaround plan was on track after a collapse in profits but it would be a long road ahead. Commenting on the Nationwide house price index, Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, said: Two steps forward, one step back \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual rate of price growth has barely shifted from where it was a year ago. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tempting to see such a meandering market as the fruit of a cautious consensus. Instead it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a byproduct of the collision of three conflicting forces; pent-up demand, low supply and patchy confidence. With activity levels slowly picking up, the rising tension is creating some big regional anomalies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c making the national average as misleading as it is insipid. The future course of the market is balanced on a knife edge. With the Bank of England set to notch up interest rates tomorrow, the prospect of more expensive mortgages should jolt some previously hesitant buyers into action. Yet any extra impetus is likely to be immediate but ephemeral. By contrast, the forces holding back the market will get steadily stronger if the UK sleepwalks into a no-deal Brexit. If the prospect of Britain crashing out of the EU continues its shift from long shot to likely, the top end of the market could slip into full retreat as investment buyers go into lockdown. For everyone else, softening prices and better affordability will create buying opportunities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly for the bold and strategic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in what will become an increasingly fractured market. Signs of strength in the UK housing market. The Press Association reports: Annual house price growth accelerated in July as the average property value hit a new record high of \u00c2\u00a3217,010, according to an index. Across the UK, house prices were up by 2.5% annually in July, compared with a 2% annual increase in June, Nationwide Building Society said. House prices increased by 0.6% month on month in July - the second month of increases in a row following a 0.7% upturn in June. With speculation that the Bank of England base rate could edge up on Thursday from 0.5% to 0.75%, Nationwide said a 0.25 percentage point rise is likely to have only a modest immediate impact on borrowers, many of whom are locked into fixed-rate deals. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Providing the economy does not weaken further, the impact of a further small rise in interest rates on UK households is likely to be modest. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is partly because only a relatively small proportion of borrowers will be directly impacted by the change. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most lending on personal loans and credit cards is fixed or tends to be unaffected by movements in the bank rate. Similarly, in recent years, the vast majority of new mortgages have been extended on fixed interest rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But, he continued: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the impact for most borrowers is likely to be modest, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to note that household budgets have been under pressure for some time because wages have not been rising as fast as the cost of living. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Indeed, in real terms (after adjusting for inflation) wage rates are still at levels prevailing in 2005.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mr Gardner said that, overall, Nationwide continues to expect house prices to increase by 1% over the course of 2018. Here are IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening calls for European markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Will Apple become the first company in history to be valued at $1tn? The company reported better than expected results after the market closed on Tuesday, helped by strong sales of the higher-cost iPhone X profits jumped 32%, and its shares rose 4% in the after-market, putting it tantalisingly close to the magic $1tn figure. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: Traders breathed a sigh of relief as Apple reported strong earnings after the close, putting a spark back into the Nasdaq... What was there not to like about these numbers? This was the news that the markets had been hoping for; there had been concerns going into this release that the iPhone X numbers just weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to stack up, but that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the case and Apple has managed to pull it out of the bag again, proving why it should be the first trillion-dollar company. The final 7% lift in the share price required to hit that trillion-dollar level shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be so tough achieve after a set of figures like that. Here is our report on the Apple numbers: Elsewhere it is another big day for company results, with Lloyds Banking Group reporting a 23% rise in pre-tax profit and Next defying the current retail blues with a 2.8% increase in second quarter full-price sales, helped by the warm weather boosting demand for summer outfits. We will also get the first snapshot of how the manufacturing sector has performed in July, with PMI figures from the UK, Europe and US. China has already reported, with its manufacturing sector growing at the slowest pace in eight months, with exports declining amid trade tensions. The Caixin/Markit PMI fell from 51 in June to 50.8 last month. The UK numbers are also expected to see a slight dip, from 54.4 to 54.2. But any figure above 50 shows expansion, and the decline is unlikely to deter the Bank of England if it really wants to raise interest rates on Thursday. As for Europe, Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also set to be another important day for economic data especially in light of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing EU Q2 GDP numbers which came in unexpectedly lower than anticipated. For most of this year we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been told that the slowdown that we saw in Q1 was going to be temporary, and likely weather related. The weak Q2 French GDP numbers and yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker than expected EU numbers would appear to give the lie to that perception, and more worryingly inflation appears to be showing signs of picking up. This is likely to be a concern for the European Central Bank especially if we see no evidence that Q3 is gearing to pick up the slack, with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s July manufacturing PMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taking on a much greater importance in terms of looking for a rebound in economic activity after the weaker readings we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen so far this year. Early indications aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t particularly encouraging if last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flash numbers from Germany and France are any guide though Germany did show some improvement, which should be confirmed at 57.3. France slowed to 53.1, while Spain and Italy are also expected to do the same, coming in at 53.1 and 53 respectively, both lower than their June readings. Much later the US Federal Reserve will announce its latest rate decision, although no change is expected this month, with an increase more likely in September. Markets remain edgy, especially with the latest reports suggesting an escalation in the current trade tensions. The US is said to be considering increasing its 10% tariffs on $200bn worth of Chinese imports to 25%.

But it also changed the company on a fundamental level, turning it from a computer manufacturer into a consumer electronics designer.</p> <p>In January 2007, the company completed this transformation, announcing that it was changing its name from Apple Computer to Apple Inc.

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meteoric rise: Goodnight. GW Apple has beaten several tech rivals for the crown of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first trillion dollar company. At one stage it looked like Amazon could get their first, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently \u00e2\u20ac\u0153only\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd worth around $880bn. Alphabet, Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, is close behind with a market capitalisation of around $850bn. Facebook, though, dropped firmly out of the running after it slashed profitability forecasts last week. One important aspect about Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revival since its 1990s slump is that it started perfecting, rather than creating, new product types. Apple wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t first with a smartphone or a digital music player, but it created compelling devices that trumped what had gone before. Our tech writer Alex Hern explains: MP3 players already existed, such as Malda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nomad Jukebox, and they were technically better, with larger hard drives, replaceable batteries, and compatibility with both Windows and Mac (the iPod would take another year to come to Windows). What did Apple have to offer? With hindsight, the answer is obvious. The iPod looked cool: it had a sleek aluminium shell half the size of its competitors, and a physical scroll wheel that could zoom through the trademark \u00e2\u20ac\u01531,000 songs in your pocket\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. By 2003 Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advertising agency, Chiat/Day, had come up with silhouette adverts to promote the iPod. The ads were almost too successful, turning the iPod\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s white earphones into such a marker of desirability that the Metropolitan police blamed them for a 26% rise in street robberies in 2005. The iPod revolutionised Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fortunes, kicking off a five-fold increase in its share price over the following five years, and providing a gateway drug for winning round Windows users to its Mac ecosystem. But it also changed the company on a fundamental level, turning it from a computer manufacturer into a consumer electronics designer. In January 2007, the company completed this transformation, announcing that it was changing its name from Apple Computer to Apple Inc. That same day, it also announced something else: the iPhone. More here: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impressive track record over the years: Apple has seen off plenty of critics on its march towards a trillion dollars, particularly in the 1990s when it was losing the Desktop PC battle to cheaper Windows machines. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shira Ovide has some examples: Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise to become America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most valuable publicly quoted firm began more than 40 years ago, when Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak began a company that would help kickstart and drive the computer revolution. Today, the firm behind the Macintosh, the iMac, the iPhone and the App Store is now worth more than Exxon Mobil, Procter &amp; Gamble (PG.N) and AT&amp;T put together. Reuters points out how the return of the late Steve Jobs two decades ago was crucial: . One of three founders, Jobs was driven out of Apple in the mid-1980s, only to return a decade later and rescue the computer company from near bankruptcy. He launched the iPhone in 2007, dropping \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Computer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name and super-charging the cellphone industry, catching Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O), Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Nokia off guard. That put Apple on a path to overtake Exxon Mobil in 2011 as the largest U.S. company by market value. The Silicon Valley stalwart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock has surged more than 50,000 percent since its 1980 initial public offering, dwarfing the S&amp;P 500\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approximately 2,000-percent increase during the same almost four decades. During that time, Apple evolved from selling Mac personal computers to becoming an architect of the mobile revolution with a cult-like following. More here. Newsflash: Apple has become the first US listed company to be worth one trillion dollars. The technology giant hit a $1 trillion market cap as its shares rallied following strong earnings results earlier this week. Apple shares jumped 3% to hit a session high of $207.05 , enough to reach the magic $1trn figure. More to follow.... Richard Flax, Chief Investment Officer at Moneyfarm, thinks today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise is hard to justify: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fact the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted in favour of a hike itself is notable. At the last meeting in June, the MPC voted by 6-3 to keep rates where they are. If anything, since then the case for rate hikes has gotten weaker not stronger. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t require too much cynicism to see the unanimous vote as some sort of message. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank and its governor are in an unenviable position - with a combination of low interest rates, low unemployment / low wage growth, sluggish economic growth, declining inflation and massive policy uncertainty around Brexit. They clearly want to normalise interest rate policy if they can - but the data hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t made it easy to justify.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reuters agrees... Higher interest rates will eat into the profits of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s buy-to-let lenders. Paul Haywood-Schiefer of accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise is a blow to the sector: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For many people who were getting no return on their capital due to long term low interest rates and decided to invest in buy to let properties this will be another blow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They wanted to get better returns and for many it was also part of their retirement plans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One solution is to push up rents, of course. And one controversial buy-to-let landlord has swiftly passed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise onto new tenants. Fergus Wilson, who owns hundreds of properties across Ashford and Maidstone in Kent, has announced: Following the interest rate rise I have increased rents in all our properties by \u00c2\u00a350 per month (fifty pounds). It is merely passing onto the tenant the additional mortgage charge. This increase starts immediately. I think this will only apply to new tenants, or when existing tenancies come up for renewal. Wilson was heavily criticised by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equality watchdog last year, as we reported: The buy-to-let mogul Fergus Wilson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ban on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coloured\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tenants because they allegedly left curry smells in his properties has been overturned in a court victory for the Equality and Human Rights Commission. At Maidstone county court, the judge, Richard Polden, granted an injunction against the landlord. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This policy clearly amounts to discrimination,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Polden said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I find the policy is unlawful. Such a policy has no place in our society.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ed Hall, director at law firm Gowling WLG, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise could hurt the economy, if it spooks consumers and businesses: Given that a quarter point rise is perceived to have a limited long-term impact on most business, the move would seem to make sense in terms of longer term strategy. However, in a period of increasing political and economic uncertainty, it can be argued that this move could damage confidence in what could be perceived as an already fragile economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Charles Hepworth, investment director at GAM, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153punchy move\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, given the uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU: Growth in the economy could hardly be described as above trend so members may have realised that this could be the last chance to move ahead before reaching the final Brexit end state. In any case the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response in a few months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time could look very different should the Brexit cliff edge slip nearer despite them saying more hikes will be needed. The currency markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t totally buying the hawkish message otherwise the pound would be rising, which it most certainly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Indeed. As you can see, the pound has dropped to its lowest level since 20th July today - not the move you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect after a rate hike. UK interest rates won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise again until at least March 2019, predicts Dean Turner, UK Economist at UBS Wealth Management. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to see further moves from the Bank ahead of Britain leaving the EU. Monetary policy is unlikely to be the key driver for sterling in the markets in the short term, as the spotlight returns to the Brexit saga. The real surprise is that all nine Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers voted to raise interest rates today. Before noon, many experts were predicting an 8-1 split, or even 7-2, with the most dovish MPC members pushing to keep rates on hold. Our Larry Elliott suggests the data doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t support such unanimity: Threadneedle Street has been overestimating wage inflation for years, and the former MPC member and labour market expert David Blanchflower says it is still doing so [something Carney rejected earlier] Recent official data has shown growth in total pay falling not rising. The economy, despite bouncing back in the second quarter, is far from booming. Retail sales were weak in June, the housing market is dead and inflation is coming back toward its 2% target more quickly than the Bank expected. In such circumstances, it is strange, even a little troubling, that not one MPC member opposed a rate hike. The inflation report makes it sound as if higher interest rates are a no-brainer. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a lot riskier than the Bank appears to think. Jon Ostler, UK CEO at price comparison site Finder.com, says savers need to be proactive to benefit from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s particularly good news for savers, who have suffered ultra-low interest rates for the past decade. They can expect a rise to their savings, albeit a small one. Now is a good time to consider switching your banking products, as banks will be reviewing their rates. Make sure you keep an eye on which banks are offering the best interest rates as not all of their products will increase by the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 25 basis points. Mortgage holders, and other borrowers, face a hit, through, he adds: For example, those paying off the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s average mortgage debt with a variable rate mortgage face paying an extra \u00c2\u00a317-\u00c2\u00a318 per month, which adds up to an extra \u00c2\u00a3200 per year or more than \u00c2\u00a36,000 over the life of a 30-year loan term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Time for a quick recap. The Bank of England has raised UK interest rates for only the second time since the financial crisis, despite concerns that Brexit could hurt the economy. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously to raise borrowing costs to 0.75%, from 0.5%, arguing that a modest increase is needed to keep inflation on target. Governor Mark Carney has defended the move. He told reporters that the economy is in a much healthier place than August 2016, when the BoE cut rates from 0.5% to 0.25%. Carney argued that: UK households were well-prepared for the rise, and that the poorest families would suffer most if the Bank allowed inflation to spike. The Bank was ready for all possibly Brexit outcomes, including Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal Monetary policy needed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153walk, not run\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to keep inflation on target and the economy growing. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a hint that future rate rises will be modest. Banks might not pass the entire increase onto savers The Bank might actually CUT rates, if Brexit negotiations go badly. The move has received a mixed reception, with business leaders criticising it and debt charities fearing that poor families will be dragged into financial difficulties. There is relief in the City that the Bank didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back away from pushing the button, having given plenty of hints that rates would rise today. But... Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious words have hit sterling; the pound is still in the red against the dollar, at $1.3050. Balraj Sroya, Sales Trader at Foenix Partners, explains why: Today the Bank of England defied Brexit uncertainty and brought music to the ears of Sterling bulls as the MPC voted unanimously to increase interest rates to 0.75%. Unfortunately, Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally higher was halted by the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd stating that the monetary policy needs to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153walk, not run, to stand still\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as the interest rates\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 natural level rises gradually. And finally, an important but technical question from the Financial Times. Q: does the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low estimate of the equilibrium level of interest rates (R*) means that quantitative easing is becoming a standard tool of economy policy, rather than just for emergencies? [explainer: if R* is really between zero and 1% today, as the Bank believes, rates might never get high enough to allow the Bank to start selling off the \u00c2\u00a3435bn of bonds it bought through QE during the crisis to stimulate the economy]. Mark Carney says this is a good question, to which he gives a long answer. The upshot is that Bank still expects to start unwinding QE when rates have risen to 1.5%. So if R* rises towards 2-3%, then this plan would still hold. Upshot: the MPC does not expect to keep holding its QE assets on its balance sheet indefinitely. Back on Brexit, and Mark Carney is defending the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach over the last two years. After the referendum, the BoE decided to take the hit in higher inflation (by cutting rates) rather than pushing unemployment up (by raising rates to strengthen the pound), he says. Q: But wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it be better to have waited a few months until we know how Brexit will pan out? No, governor Carney replies. We need a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmodest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 adjustment to policy now because wages are rising faster than inflation. He then explains that rates could rise, stay on hold, or even be cut depending how UK-EU negotiations play out. There are a wide range of Brexit outcomes, but in many of them interest rates will be at least as high as they are today. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to keep our powder dry for that. There are certain circumstances where it would be appropriate to either keep rates the same or lower them. If that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the case, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what the MPC will do. It would be a mistake to wait, wait, wait until you have perfect certainty, because you never know when that point will arise, he concludes. Q: What do you say to business groups who think this rate rise is a mistake? We have a good sense of the challenges faced by British businesses, Carney replies. The Bank knows that this has been the shallowest investment recovery in decades. But...the overwhelming issue for businesses is the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. They should be confident that we will focus on our responsibilities, keeping inflation on target while ensuring the economy is prepared for whatever the outcome is. Christopher Vecchio of DailyFX says Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious guidance on future rate rises is hitting the pound. On trade wars, Carney says the tariffs imposed by the US, China and Europe on each others imports are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of the reasons that global growth is little weaker.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Bank doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see a material impact on the UK economy, yet, but it would be hurt by a slump in global confidence and investment. Mark Carney is now giving a long explanation about the equilibrium interest rate in the UK (known as R*). This is the level at which interest rates should be set to ensure the economy stays at an even keel. The Bank has estimated today that R* is zero to 1 percent, more than 2 percentage points below its pre-financial crisis level. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because UK productivity, fiscal headwinds and economic uncertainty are all pulling R* down. If they improve, R* could move closer to the 2-3% range, Carney explains. Danny Blanchflower has hit back at Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jibe, pointing out that UK wage growth has slowed recently - and is nowhere near 3% per year today. Our economics editor Larry Elliott goes next. Q: The Bank thinks the natural rate of unemployment is 4.25% (slightly above the current rate of 4.2%), which is why you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve raised interest rates. But some experts disagree; former MPC member professor Danny Blanchflower thinks it could be 3%. Why is he wrong, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right? Where do I begin, mutters Mark Carney (somewhat recklessly), before adding that he has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great respect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Prof B, but his time on the MPC has passed. Carney then explains that policymakers need to reorientate to new reality. He points out that labour cost growth is rising, and productivity growth remains disappointing, thus the UK needs higher borrowing costs to keep inflation on target. [historical note: Danny Blanchflower called, in vain, for UK interest rate cuts before the financial crisis struck, when the rest of the MPC was more worried about inflation] Q: Will this rate rise be passed onto savers, and what will the Bank do to help on this? Mark Carney says that savers have suffered over the course of the last decade from the absolutely necessary low interest rates. But he then suggests that banks might not pass today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise on in full. H explains that when rates hit record lows after the crisis, the spread between bank lending and borrowing rates were compressed. (That ate into bank profitability, so they will want to repair that by raising borrowing costs more than saving rates). As rates move up, one should expect more of them to be passed along, Carney adds. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden weighs in, saying: Historically you never get full pass-though of interest rate changes. Q: Surely poorest households are going to suffer from this rate rise? Mark Carney rebuts this, arguing that the Bank has a responsibility to keep inflation under control. The households that are most affected by high or volatile inflation, and most likely to be out of work, unfortunately, are poorer households. The best thing we can do is keep inflation sustainably on target, and keep the economy on track, he adds. Ouch! Sterling has just dropped against the US dollar, and is now down a whole cent at $1.303. The selloff began as Mark Carney explains that monetary policy needs to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153walk not run to stand still\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as the natural level of interest rates slowly rises. That looks like a hint that borrowing costs will not rise sharply in the next couple of years. Onto questions: Q: Are households ready for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise, particularly the poorest? Governor Carney says the Bank of England has been saying for a while that interest rates will go up, at a modest rate. That \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcforward guidance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was meant to give households and businesses clarity. And it worked, Carney says, with three-quarters of households expecting interest rate to go up over the next year. The important thing to recognise is that UK households have worked hard over the last decade to get into a better financial position, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve paid down debt and put themselves in a better position to service their debts. It would take another 100 basis point increase (to 1.75%) to bring the UK debt servicing burden back to the historic average. There is a lot more capacity for UK households to service their debts, Carney concludes. He also cited new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmortgage affordability\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tests that are meant to prevent reckless borrowing. Mark Carney insists that the Bank of England is well prepared for a wide range of Brexit outcomes. The banking system has enough money to keep lending through a cliff-edge Brexit, however unlikely that will be, the governor says. We are working with the Treasury and the European Central Bank to address risks that the banks can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t solve themselves, he adds. Onto Brexit. Mark Carney says that talks between the UK and the EU are at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153critical period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Households have been resilient but not indifferent to Brexit uncertainty, he adds, but there are signs that business confidence is softening again. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts are based on a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrelatively smooth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd transition period, the governor points out (implying it could take action if we end up with a No-Deal Brexit). Carney signals that further interest rate rises will be needed. If interest rates stay at 0.75%, then inflation will be over the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target over the next three years, he explains. Mark Carney says UK exporters are in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a sweet spot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with sterling down 17% compared to its pre-Brexit levels. He adds that the UK labour market is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with signs that earnings growth will accelerate later this year. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is giving a press conference now. Carney begins by referencing a famous quote from Harold Wilson, saying: If a week is a long time in politics, then two years is an eternity in monetary policy. He reminds us that the Bank cut borrowing costs to a record low of 0.25%, after the Brexit vote. Back in 2016, there was substantial spare capacity in the economy, business confidence was its lowest since the financial crisis, and inflation was due to overshoot its target \u00e2\u20ac\u0153entirely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd due to Brexit fears which had driven the pound down. Now, though, the economy is strong enough to justify an interest rate rise to 0.75%. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, says Mark Carney and colleagues have taken a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bold move\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by raising borrowing costs today. By early 2019, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll know if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right, he adds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank has so clearly telegraphed this rate rise that markets would have been shocked had rates been left on hold. The unanimity of the decision probably reflects the view that the UK is, quite simply, running out of spare capacity. But sub-trend growth and a cloudy outlook hardly make a compelling case for a higher UK rates. In six months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time this decision will look either prescient or premature. Either way it is bold move.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Oof! Suren Thiru, Head of Economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), says the Bank of England was wrong to raise interest rates today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decision to raise interest rates, while expected, looks ill-judged against a backdrop of a sluggish economy. While a quarter point rise may have a limited long-term financial impact on most businesses, it risks undermining confidence at a time of significant political and economic uncertainty. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The increase reinforces a concerning aspect of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent approach to monetary policy, which appears to be overly focused on reinforcing an idealised direction for rates, rather than on economic reality \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an approach that unnecessarily risks UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth prospects. The central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assumption that the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speed limit has slowed is unduly pessimistic, as sustained action to fix the fundamentals at home, from closing the skills gap to greater infrastructure investment, would materially help lift the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth potential. Thiru hopes the Bank won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raise borrowing costs again anytime soon: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The MPC must carefully consider what happens next. The most preferential option would be for a sustained period of monetary stability amid the current economic and political uncertainty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Simon Underwood, business recovery partner at accountancy firm, Menzies LLP, fears that this rate rise will hurt businesses - especially those reliant on consumer spending. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The MPC may have been swayed by the summer heatwave and England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success in the World Cup, which have had a positive impact on consumer behaviour, boosting retail sales temporarily. However, it is unlikely this positive sentiment will be maintained and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to increase rates will impact consumer spending ahead of the critical final quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For businesses serving consumers in the retail and hospitality &amp; leisure sectors, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision will be very unwelcome news and we should expect more turmoil on the high street in the short to medium term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd My colleague Richard Partington reports from the Bank of England: The Bank of England has raised interest rates above the emergency level introduced straight after the financial crisis, despite mounting fears over Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal. Signalling the gradual return of higher borrowing costs, Threadneedle Street raised interest rates to 0.75% from 0.5% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the level they were dropped to in March 2009 as the economy lurched through the last recession. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee judged the economy could withstand higher interest rates, which it believes are required to curb persistently high inflation above its 2% target set by the government. An extra 0.25% interest will add \u00c2\u00a312 a month to a \u00c2\u00a3100,000 repayment mortgage and \u00c2\u00a325 on a \u00c2\u00a3200,000 loan. However, nearly 70% of homebuyers now have fixed rate mortgages so will be unaffected. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our Q&amp;A on how higher UK interest rates will affect you: Although today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise is modest, it will hurt families who are already forced to borrow to pay for the essentials. Phil Andrew, chief executive at StepChange Debt Charity, says politicians need to provide more help to theses households: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whilst a rise in interest rates might be right for the wider economy, from a consumer debt perspective many households are walking a precarious budget tightrope, as their incomes don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stretch to cover the basics each month. These are the households that a rate rise will affect most. Policymakers mustn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lose sight of what a rate rise means for real people on a tight budget. The fact that the wider economy can cope doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always mean individual households can. Government and policymakers need to take parallel steps to ensure support is there for those who are negatively affected, especially if more rate rises are coming.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I mentioned earlier this morning that Mark Carney was known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for failing to stick to his promises. Calum Bennie, savings specialist at Scottish Friendly, thinks the governor has turned over a new leaf by raising rates today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise means that Mark Carney has probably shaken off his tag of being the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for good. While the decision indicates the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is picking up steam, it also means higher borrowing costs, so households must be even more prudent to absorb the additional cost. The move is good news for savers but still cash account rates are unlikely to beat inflation, so stocks and shares Isas remain better for those looking to grow their savings long-term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much reaction in the financial markets to the rate hike - which figures, as it was widely expected. The pound has clawed back some of its losses, but is still slightly lower against the US dollar today at $1.31. Shares are still being pummelled by those trade war fears, leaving the FTSE 100 down 93 points or 1.2%. The Bank of England has hinted that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in no rush to raise interest rates again in the coming months. It say that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153any future increases in Bank Rate are likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Bank of England also has also warned that Brexit could damage the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery: The MPC continues to recognise that the economic outlook could be influenced significantly by the response of households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal. The Bank of England says it is raising interest rates because the economy has recovered from its slowdown during last snowy winter. The minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting says: Recent data appear to confirm that the dip in output in the first quarter was temporary, with momentum recovering in the second quarter. The labour market has continued to tighten and unit labour cost growth has firmed. The MPC continues to judge that the UK economy currently has a very limited degree of slack. Unemployment is low and is projected to fall a little further. The BoE also points out that prices are rising faster than its target (2%), so it is raising borrowing costs to squeeze inflation. CPI inflation was 2.4% in June, pushed above the 2% target by external cost pressures resulting from the effects of sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s past depreciation and higher energy prices. The contribution of external pressures is projected to ease over the forecast period while the contribution of domestic cost pressures is expected to rise. Every member of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nine-strong monetary policy committee voted to raise interest rates. NEWSFLASH: The Bank of England has voted to raise UK interest rates to their highest level in almost a decade. The BoE is raising Bank rate to 0.75%, from 0.5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level since March 2009, and only the second rise since the financial crisis struck a decade ago. More to follow! An interest rate rise would obviously be a blow to borrowers, as it would push up the cost of repaying debts. This chart from Resolution Foundation shows how a rise to 0.75% would force a small number of mortgage owners to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctake action\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in some way: Back in June, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MPC was split six-three -- with a trio of policymakers voting to raise interest rates. Danielle Haralambous, UK Analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts that the majority will vote to hike today, but it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a 9:0 win for the hawks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect the MPC to raise the policy rate to 0.75% today, although it is unlikely to be a unanimous vote. Some of the economic data has softened in recent months, notably core inflation and wage growth, which may prevent some MPC members from changing their vote in favour of higher interest rates. Our economics correspondent, Richard Partington, explains why the Bank of England will (probably) raise borrowing costs today: Inflation has remained stubbornly above the 2% target set for the Bank by the government, after having risen sharply straight after the EU referendum result. Some rate setters on the MPC, including the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Andy Haldane, also believe wage growth is just around the corner for workers, amid the lowest levels of unemployment since the mid 1970s, a factor that could help boost workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bargaining power for higher pay. The summer heatwave, royal wedding and England progressing to the semi-final of the World Cup helped boost the economy, triggering stronger retail sales in April and May before they unexpectedly fell back in June. The Office for National Statistics found that the warmer weather helped the economy rebound from a slowdown earlier this year after heavy snowfall from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beast from the east\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More here: Tension is rising in the City, with around 30 minutes to wait until the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision. Traders broadly expect borrowing costs to rise at noon today, to a nine-year high of 0.75%. But this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t giving the pound any love. Sterling is still bobbing at a two-week low against the dollar, with some investors speculating that the Bank could dampen expectations of further interest rate rises any time soon. John Goldie, FX Strategist at Argentex, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank of England are firmly expected to raise rates this lunch time, only the second hike since 2007. However, most commentators are expecting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dovish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hike with perhaps some dissenters within the committee (one or two may vote to keep rates on hold still) and/or the statements to play down further hiking expectations in the near term. Plus, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discount the possibility that the Bank sits on its hands again. But that would badly hurt its credibility, given its recent guidance that a rate rise is close. Sue Kershaw, managing director of major project advisory at KPMG, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders benefitted from the hot summer, but warns that Brexit could derail the recovery seen last month. She writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Seeing housebuilding come back to good health is hugely positive. As the longstanding driver of activity, the weakening demand we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d seen in recent months did cause some concern and raised questions as to whether residential construction had peaked and was heading for a steady decline. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But supply chain and cost pressures still remain a cause for concern. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing input costs continue to creep up and the outcome of Brexit negotiations is still far from clear. Those with infrastructure arms will also be concerned about the sluggish-looking civil engineering market, traditionally quite a reliable source of activity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Phil Harris, Director at BLP Insurance, fears that the collapse of the merger between shopping centre groups Hammerson and Intu could hurt construction. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153July was another strong month for commercial activity but the sector remains vulnerable to volatility. British retailers continue to close shops at a pace and the full impact of shopping centre developer, Hammerson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failed takeover of rival Intu may have yet to be fully felt. With many predicting the closure of more Hammerson sites, growth in July may prove a false dawn.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brendan Sharkey, head of construction and real estate at accountancy firm MHA MacIntyre Hudson, points out that Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock collapse in January has caused less damage than feared. However, a hard Brexit might not be shaken off as easily: Construction has been relatively slow to wake up to the dangers posed by Brexit. Given the industry doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t depend on exports, the potential pitfalls of a no-deal Brexit have perhaps been easier to overlook. Yet construction does depend on the import of raw materials, and crucially on the free movement of labour. Over the next few months we will see more focus on contingency planning and demand for additional information and support from the government. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The consequences of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse were over-hyped but only a very foolhardy captain of industry can assume the same will be true about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: China has hit back at America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threats to impose steep tariffs on its goods (see earlier post). Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commerce ministry has told reporters it is fully prepared to fight back, if America delivers on Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose 25% tariffs. This is driving financial markets deeper into the red. The FTSE 100 is now down 80 points, with mining stocks leading the selloff. Trivia corner: UK interest rate have never been pegged at 0.75%, since the Bank of England was established in 1694. Back in July 2007, the BoE raised interest rates to 5.75% just as the credit crunch began. It was began cutting as the financial crisis kicked in, including a monster Bank Rate cut from 4.5% to 3% in November 2008. In March 2009 it halved borrowing costs to 0.5%, where they remained until the Brexit vote prompted a cut to 0.25%, which was reversed in November 2017. The pick-up in building activity in July will reassure the Bank of England, as it suggest the construction sector could handle higher borrowing costs. However, yesterday we heard that manufacturing growth slowed a little last month, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mixed picture. The opposition Labour party is concerned that consumers will be hurt by higher borrowing costs. John McDonnell MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chancellor, has warned that higher interest rates will push more people into debt: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With wages still below 2010 levels and the gap between people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s income and outgoings at record levels, the concern must be that a pattern of interest rate rises will push more families into higher levels of debt. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government needs to end its counterproductive austerity programme and raise people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incomes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey of purchasing managers at UK construction firms: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders achieved an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153impressive turnaround\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in July, says Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit. He sees several signs that the construction sector has strengthened this summer: New business volumes expanded at the strongest rate since May 2017, while workforce numbers increased to the greatest extent for just over two- and-a-half years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153House building was the bright spot for construction growth in July, alongside a stronger upturn in commercial development projects. Residential activity and commercial work both increased at the sharpest pace since December 2015, which contrasted with another subdued month for civil engineering. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector has recorded its fastest growth in 14 months. Data firm Markit reports that builders picked up pace in July, led by a surge in housebuilding. This pushed Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI, which measures growth in the sector, up to 55.8 from 53.1. Anything over 50 shows growth, and this is the highest reading since May 2017. Housebuilders reported the strongest pick-up in growth since the end of 2015. More to follow.... Stock markets around the globe are sliding today, thanks to the threat of a US-China trade war. Investors have been spooked by the news that the Trump administration is considering a 25% tariff on $200bn of Chinese imports - previously it had been planning a 10% levy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest shot in an increasingly bitter and protracted trade spat between Washington and Beijing. CNN explains: The United States has already slapped 25% tariffs on Chinese goods worth $34 billion to punish Beijing for what it says are its unfair trade practices, such as forcing American companies to hand over valuable technology. China immediately responded with equal measures. In the latest step, President Donald Trump has directed US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to consider increasing the proposed tariff level on fruit and vegetables, handbags, refrigerators, and more. The trade office has extended its previous deadline of Aug. 30 to allow the public more time to comment on the new plan. Those comments are now due on September 5. In London the FTSE 100 has shed 32 points, or 0.4%, to 7620, its lowest level in over two weeks. There are heavier falls across Europe, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX shedding 1.3%. Over in Asia, the Chinese markets have tumbled by around 2%. Other markets also in the red as traders fear an escalating trade dispute will hurt growth and exports across the region. Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale says the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision is the main event of the day: Bloomberg polled 58 forecasts...10 expect no change, and 48 expect a 25 basis point hike (including us). Sterling meanwhile, continues to bump along the bottom of its historic trade-weighted range. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t nearly enough good news in a much-anticipated rate hike to propel it higher, but the downside is limited. An interest rate rise today would be risky, argues our economics editor Larry Elliott. He points out that many UK households are struggling, meaning incomes are lagging spending for the first time in three decades. Households are not borrowing because they are brimful of confidence. In many cases they are borrowing to make ends meet. The MPC knows this and will go out if its way to reassure consumers and businesses that any further policy tightening will be both modest and gradual. Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise is supposed to prevent wage inflation from taking off, underpin sterling and boost the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credibility without harming growth. The next eight months will see Brexit negotiations come to a climax and the inevitable period of uncertainty means this is the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last opportunity to raise rates for some time. Yet the fact remains that this is an ill-timed and risky venture, not least for the millions overburdened with debt. The pound will tumble if the Bank of England leaves interest rates on hold today, says Miles Eakers of global payments, FX and Treasury management firm Centtrip: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A hawkish hike will boost the Pound but only for the short term. That said, Mark Carney may catch market participants off-guard again and not increase rates, which will weaken the Pound substantially and could fall as low as its yearly nadir of $1.2956 or even below. Even if the BoE does hike, the Brexit negotiations are still under way, keeping the Pound under pressure for the foreseeable future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound is dropping this morning, as the City braces for the Bank of England interest rate decision at noon. Sterling has lost half a cent against the US dollar to $1.3068, its lowest in nearly two weeks. Normally you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect a currency to rally when interest rates go up. But there may be some anxiety over whether the Bank will actually do the deed today. Traders may also be anticipating a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdovish hike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - the BoE could raise borrowing costs to 0.75%, but hint that the next rise is a long way away. This chart shows how sterling has struggled, even as an August rate hike looked more likely. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, suspects uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is hurting the pound: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThursday could be a hugely symbolic day if the Bank of England decides to raise interest rates above 0.5% for the first time since the financial crisis. However it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually change too much on the ground. Markets are already expecting a rise, and from here on in, further hikes are going to be few and far between because UK economic growth is so fragile. We could see some reaction from sterling though, which has remained resolutely weak against the dollar, despite rising expectations of a rate rise. That probably reflects the fact that economic data hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been resoundingly positive in the lead up to this interest rate decision, plus of course the prospect of a no-deal Brexit has raised its head in recent weeks. He also points out that rates could yet be cut, if the economy falters. Even though rates are very low and will remain so for the foreseeable future, they can still move down if there is an economic shock to the system. Few people thought rates would ever be cut from 0.5%, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exactly what happened following the EU referendum result. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With Love Island finally off our screens, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favourite unreliable boyfriend to show if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mended his ways, or is as fickle as ever. The Bank of England will announce today whether UK interest rates are going up, for only the second time in a decade. The City widely expects a hike, after governor Mark Carney declared last month that the economy seems to have recovered from its slowdown at the start of 2018. The City is pricing a 91% chance of an interest rate rise today. That would take borrowing costs up to 0.75% today -- their highest level since March 2009 (but still low in historic terms). But traders are edgy. Carney has a long track record of capriciousness \u00e2\u20ac\u201c promising that a rate hike is imminent only to back away when the big day arrives. So there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a possibility that the Bank will shy away from pressing that rate hike button today. The decision is unlikely to be unanimous, as some monetary policy committee members are concerned that the economy may not be strong enough to handle higher borrowing costs. Kathleen Brooks of Capital Index explains: The market is currently expecting an 8-1 split in favour of a hike, with Sir Jon Cunliffe the only member expected to dissent and vote against a hike. However, if we get more MPC members voting against a hike then sterling could come under pressure, as it would suggest a future dovish stance by the BOE. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s four years since Labour MP Pat McFadden gave Carney his \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tag, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a title the governor appreciates. He would argue that businesses and households have understood his message -- that interest rates will rise at a modest pace as the recovery allows. Also coming up Data firm Markit will report how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector performed last month. Economists predict that growth slowed, as the bounceback after the winter freeze fades. Trade war fears are weighing on the markets again. There are reports that Donald Trump is considering slapping a 25% tariff on Chinese imports into the US, which would have a hefty impact on world trade.

                "body":"<p>Wall Street investors are still hot for music technology \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least that was the message Sonos Inc broadcast this week after its stock SONO surged 33% above its IPO price in its market debut. </p> <p>Shrugging off lacklustre opening trading, the maker of popular, high-end wireless and voice recognition speakers, closed out the day at over $19 a share on Thursday, giving the 16-year-old Californian company an implied market value of $1.95bn .</p> <p>If it holds, Sonos flotation could end a curse that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been hanging over commodity technology since companies like <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/stocks/fit/\">Fitbit</a> and<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/investing/gopro-stock-sinks-losses-increase/\"> GoPro</a> surged at IPO and then crashed. What makes Sonos different, company executives argued last week, is that unlike, say, smartphones and headphones, their speakers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t locked into updating cycles. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are used to buying commodity tech that needs to be replaced, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re differentiated because our product persists,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mike Groeninger, Sonos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vice president of finance, told <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/news/market-watch/TDJNMW_20180802677/why-sonos-thinks-its-hardware-ipo-will-be-different.html\">Marketwatch.</a></p> <p>With Sonos, the argument goes, consumers perceive brand loyalty because the Sonos systems are of high quality and will simply add to existing systems when they move or add music-streaming to new areas of the homes. </p> <p>Sonos backs up that argument with data showing that said 27% of Sonos households own four or more products, and more than 61% of its households have registered more than one device.</p> <p>Where Sonos products need to be replaced, Groeninger continued, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because its hardware can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t support advances in streaming technology. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not forcing obsolescence,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he pointed out. </p> <p>But if that were all true, and Sonos was uniquely blessed with longterm customer loyalty, then stock analysts could reasonably expect Sonos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 first day numbers to come in more robustly. </p> <p>One potential problem is that Sonos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 greatest asset in partnering with streaming services Amazon, Apple, Google and Spotify is also its most glaring consumer tech weakness: those companies could decide to move into the hardware business. </p> <p>Jordan Hiscott, chief trader at Ayondo markets, commented that despite Sonos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 opening day performance his main concern is that Sonos will experience a negative share price performance similar to Fitbit.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fitbit is another well-run company with popular products, yet its future profitability can be heavily affected when tech conglomerates, like Apple or Google, decide to produce and manufacture similar, niche devices themselves, which consequently undermines market share.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vulnerability to Amazon, for instance, was revealed earlier this month when it was revealed in an SEC filing that the e-shopping giant could disable its Alexa voice recognition technology on Sonos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 speakers on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153limited notice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>In its filing, Sonos also acknowledged that not only could Amazon disable Alexa integration but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Amazon could also begin charging us for this integration which would harm our operating results\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the filing, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just been very upfront about the fact that we could turn off people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service, they could turn them off.

                "bodyText":"Wall Street investors are still hot for music technology \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least that was the message Sonos Inc broadcast this week after its stock SONO surged 33% above its IPO price in its market debut. Shrugging off lacklustre opening trading, the maker of popular, high-end wireless and voice recognition speakers, closed out the day at over $19 a share on Thursday, giving the 16-year-old Californian company an implied market value of $1.95bn . If it holds, Sonos flotation could end a curse that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been hanging over commodity technology since companies like Fitbit and GoPro surged at IPO and then crashed. What makes Sonos different, company executives argued last week, is that unlike, say, smartphones and headphones, their speakers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t locked into updating cycles. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are used to buying commodity tech that needs to be replaced, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re differentiated because our product persists,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mike Groeninger, Sonos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vice president of finance, told Marketwatch. With Sonos, the argument goes, consumers perceive brand loyalty because the Sonos systems are of high quality and will simply add to existing systems when they move or add music-streaming to new areas of the homes. Sonos backs up that argument with data showing that said 27% of Sonos households own four or more products, and more than 61% of its households have registered more than one device. Where Sonos products need to be replaced, Groeninger continued, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because its hardware can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t support advances in streaming technology. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not forcing obsolescence,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he pointed out. But if that were all true, and Sonos was uniquely blessed with longterm customer loyalty, then stock analysts could reasonably expect Sonos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 first day numbers to come in more robustly. One potential problem is that Sonos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 greatest asset in partnering with streaming services Amazon, Apple, Google and Spotify is also its most glaring consumer tech weakness: those companies could decide to move into the hardware business. Jordan Hiscott, chief trader at Ayondo markets, commented that despite Sonos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 opening day performance his main concern is that Sonos will experience a negative share price performance similar to Fitbit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fitbit is another well-run company with popular products, yet its future profitability can be heavily affected when tech conglomerates, like Apple or Google, decide to produce and manufacture similar, niche devices themselves, which consequently undermines market share.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vulnerability to Amazon, for instance, was revealed earlier this month when it was revealed in an SEC filing that the e-shopping giant could disable its Alexa voice recognition technology on Sonos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 speakers on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153limited notice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In its filing, Sonos also acknowledged that not only could Amazon disable Alexa integration but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Amazon could also begin charging us for this integration which would harm our operating results\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the filing, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just been very upfront about the fact that we could turn off people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service, they could turn them off. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re transparent by nature, so that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in there,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sonos CEO Patrick Spence told CNBC on Thursday. Morgan Stanley recently estimated that more than 70% of US households will own a smart speaker with voice commerce capabilities by 2022 and half of all web searches will be voice activated. The category will become so important to the data tech giants, the report recommended, that Google should give away a free Home Mini smart speaker to every US household. The $3.3bn this would cost Google parent Alphabet to execute would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153small price to pay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the opportunity, it added, since the potential to make money off the trend will likely go to Amazon and Google because of their dominance in their voice recognition technologies and smart speaker technology. For Sonos, then, perhaps the best policy would be to remain on good terms. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales have been increasing, albeit modestly from a loyal customer base that drove sales to nearly $1bn last year.

                "body":"<p>It has been a tumultuous couple of weeks for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high-flying technology stocks, even by their own unique standards. Their shares have been soaring since the start of the year, despite being buffeted by trade war fears as President Trump talked of limiting Chinese investments in the US and restricting American technology imports to China.</p> <p>But now there are signs that cracks may be starting to appear in some of the biggest firms in the sector. Facebook suffered the biggest ever one-day drop in a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c losing more than \u00c2\u00a390bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after its growth slowed in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p> <p>Twitter lost 20%, or $5bn, as it reported a surprise fall in active monthly users, while streaming service Netflix missed its targets for subscriber numbers.</p> <p>On the other hand, electric car specialist Tesla managed to head in the right direction despite making a $717m second-quarter loss, as its controversial chief executive, Elon Musk, regained investor confidence after apologising for previous outbursts. That was in marked contrast to a conference call for the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous set of figures, when he accused a Wall Street analyst of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boring bonehead questions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and ignored queries from investors.</p> <p>But the pick of the bunch remains Apple, which beat Amazon and Google to reach the landmark $1 trillion valuation on Thursday.</p> <p>Despite the recent rollercoaster ride, the five key tech stocks, known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Faangs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet-owned Google \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have reached breathtaking heights. The total value of the five companies amounts to a staggering 19% of total US GDP. But their surge in value has prompted fears of a re-run of the dotcom boom of the late 1990s, when technology businesses dominated the stock market before coming crashing to earth.</p> <p>Russ Mould at investment group AJ Bell says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That [19%] compares to the 15.5% of US GDP reached by the five biggest companies by value at the US stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peak in the fourth quarter of 1999, just before the technology, media and telecoms bubble burst and that particular mania came to grief.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Here we look at where the big names stand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and where they could go from here.</p> <h2>Facebook</h2> <p>The social network\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market value <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/29/facebook-results-running-out-new-users-goodwill\">plunged by more than \u00c2\u00a390bn</a> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the largest one-day drop in corporate history \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it felt the effect of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\">Cambridge Analytica data scandal</a>. The group made more than $5bn (\u00c2\u00a33.8bn) profit in the last three months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slightly ahead of expectations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but some 3 million Europeans quit the website amid concerns about what Facebook does with personal data. Finance chief David Wehner warned revenue growth was likely to slow, while costs soared by 50% to $7.4bn as the company spent vast sums on improving data security.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-3902HEHbgs63337q/\" data-alt=\"Facebook shares\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-3902HEHbgs63337q/\">Facebook shares</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Verdict </strong>For all the bluster around the largest one-day fall in history, the reasons behind it make the case for a founder-leader with absolute control better than anything else Mark Zuckerberg has done in the past decade. Facebook, shaken by Cambridge Analytica and the election interference scandal, decided to slash its profits in half in order to fund a response: 50,000 new moderators, a substantial investment into its trust and safety engineering, and a commitment to carry on doing the same for at least another year. Wall Street, predictably, hated it, but it was the right thing to do. A weaker leader could have been toppled for doing it, or might never have tried in the first place. Yes, Zuckerberg led the company into this swamp, but maybe he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the only one who can get it back out.</p> <p>However, there are storm clouds on the horizon as well. In the future, look out for the shift from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feeds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to self-deleting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stories\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which could be as momentous as its shift from desktop to mobile. Facebook believes it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be that long before the majority of content across its four platforms is shared as stories, the format it cloned from Snapchat two years ago, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling to achieve advertiser buy-in.</p> <h2>Alphabet</h2> <p>Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company smashed Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit expectations, sending its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/23/google-alphabet-profits-5bn-fine-shares-surge\">shares soaring to a record high</a>. Net profit was actually lower than last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down from $4.9bn to $3.5bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but that included a $2.7bn fine levied on Google by the European commission for anti-competitive behaviour. The company is set to appeal, so could still get its money back. The business raked in more than $26bn of revenue in the three-month period \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well up on the $21bn recorded in the same period last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-39023vu72D1VPfPJ/\" data-alt=\"Alphabet shares\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-39023vu72D1VPfPJ/\">Alphabet shares</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Verdict </strong>Even though the general tech sell-off hit Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, and profits fell year-on-year, the future looks fairly bright for Alphabet. Yes, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine over Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Android monopoly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good for the company, and it was large enough to hit profits directly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for the $2.7bn penalty, Alphabet would have actually seen profits grow this quarter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the most significant wrongs that Google was accused of are largely in the past, and it is unlikely to feel too constrained going forward.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the search business prints money. Almost every open-ended query on the web starts at Google, and that makes its advertising revenues enormous and secure. YouTube could be a shining gem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and certainly seems to be if you speak to anyone under 20, for whom it, not Netflix, is the new TV \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it will have problems down the line over the same dodgy content now causing such pain for Facebook.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"931af6ffd10fe477756d17cf40862818ea649179\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/931af6ffd10fe477756d17cf40862818ea649179/0_141_4644_2787/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon Web Services inflatable display at a trade fair\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cloud computing division has seen extraordinary growth in profits.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mauritz Antin/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Amazon</h2> <p>The globe-spanning online retailer announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/26/amazon-profit-second-quarter-2018-advertising-cloud\">record quarterly profits of $2.5bn</a> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c double the level Wall Street experts had expected \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sending the share price to an all-time high.

Well, Amazon is the AWS (Amazon Web Services) company now. The record profits of the cloud-computing division led to an astonishing 1,286% year-on-year growth in overall profits, thanks to the extremely high margins that Amazon makes on selling computing time. It now stretches from its own consumer retail business to the Marketplace platform \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building a shopping mall of internet stores \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to AWS, which provides the backbone to the internet. And don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget its bets on the future, particularly with Echo and Alexa. Voice control may yet prove to be a dead-end in the annals of computing, but if not, Amazon could well own the iPhone of the 2020s.</p> <h2>Apple</h2> <p>Apple made history on Thursday, becoming the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">first public company to be valued at $1 trillion</a>, reaching the landmark 42 years after the company was founded and two decades after it almost went bust. Financial results for the most recent three months, filed earlier in the week, showed revenues topped $53bn. The company shipped more than 41m phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slightly less than anticipated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but because the expensive iPhone X has proved popular, the average price consumers paid for them went up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-3902KmLt1o6pmxWJ/\" data-alt=\"Apple shares\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-3902KmLt1o6pmxWJ/\">Apple shares</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Verdict</strong> Making nice things and selling them for a lot of money to tens of millions of people is a very good business to be in. The engine of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business, the iPhone, generated 60% of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits, and it shows no sign of letting up.</p> <p>The iPhone X has been a resounding success, proving the hypothesis that millions of people will pay whatever Apple asks for the best phone on the planet. The average selling price of an iPhone is now more than $700. More promisingly still, that has held up in the second quarter, usually the time when sales fall off as savvy customers hold on for the inevitable upgrade in September.</p> <p>But while the iPhone provides the reliable profit, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the growth opportunity. That lies in the two lines at the bottom of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153services\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153other products\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Services \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which include the App Store, Apple Pay and income from Apple Music \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have been growing rapidly since the company stopped viewing them just as a tool for boosting phone sales and started seeing them as a business. Apple invented the idea of the App Store and is taking a 30% cut on everything in it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32d8f9963390ea58bbfb94ee79ad4680315df206\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32d8f9963390ea58bbfb94ee79ad4680315df206/0_46_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elon Musk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elon Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent outbursts have worried investors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gene Blevins/ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Tesla</h2> <p>Tesla has had a difficult few months, with increasing concerns about the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sustainability and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/18/elon-musk-apologises-for-calling-thai-cave-rescue-diver-a-pedo\">outbursts from its billionaire founder Elon Musk</a> that have seen him labelled the Trump of Tech.

                "bodyText":"It has been a tumultuous couple of weeks for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high-flying technology stocks, even by their own unique standards. Their shares have been soaring since the start of the year, despite being buffeted by trade war fears as President Trump talked of limiting Chinese investments in the US and restricting American technology imports to China. But now there are signs that cracks may be starting to appear in some of the biggest firms in the sector. Facebook suffered the biggest ever one-day drop in a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c losing more than \u00c2\u00a390bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after its growth slowed in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Twitter lost 20%, or $5bn, as it reported a surprise fall in active monthly users, while streaming service Netflix missed its targets for subscriber numbers. On the other hand, electric car specialist Tesla managed to head in the right direction despite making a $717m second-quarter loss, as its controversial chief executive, Elon Musk, regained investor confidence after apologising for previous outbursts. That was in marked contrast to a conference call for the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous set of figures, when he accused a Wall Street analyst of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boring bonehead questions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and ignored queries from investors. But the pick of the bunch remains Apple, which beat Amazon and Google to reach the landmark $1 trillion valuation on Thursday. Despite the recent rollercoaster ride, the five key tech stocks, known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Faangs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet-owned Google \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have reached breathtaking heights. The total value of the five companies amounts to a staggering 19% of total US GDP. But their surge in value has prompted fears of a re-run of the dotcom boom of the late 1990s, when technology businesses dominated the stock market before coming crashing to earth. Russ Mould at investment group AJ Bell says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That [19%] compares to the 15.5% of US GDP reached by the five biggest companies by value at the US stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peak in the fourth quarter of 1999, just before the technology, media and telecoms bubble burst and that particular mania came to grief.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here we look at where the big names stand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and where they could go from here. Facebook The social network\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market value plunged by more than \u00c2\u00a390bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the largest one-day drop in corporate history \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it felt the effect of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. The group made more than $5bn (\u00c2\u00a33.8bn) profit in the last three months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slightly ahead of expectations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but some 3 million Europeans quit the website amid concerns about what Facebook does with personal data. Finance chief David Wehner warned revenue growth was likely to slow, while costs soared by 50% to $7.4bn as the company spent vast sums on improving data security. Verdict For all the bluster around the largest one-day fall in history, the reasons behind it make the case for a founder-leader with absolute control better than anything else Mark Zuckerberg has done in the past decade. Facebook, shaken by Cambridge Analytica and the election interference scandal, decided to slash its profits in half in order to fund a response: 50,000 new moderators, a substantial investment into its trust and safety engineering, and a commitment to carry on doing the same for at least another year. Wall Street, predictably, hated it, but it was the right thing to do. A weaker leader could have been toppled for doing it, or might never have tried in the first place. Yes, Zuckerberg led the company into this swamp, but maybe he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the only one who can get it back out. However, there are storm clouds on the horizon as well. In the future, look out for the shift from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feeds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to self-deleting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stories\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which could be as momentous as its shift from desktop to mobile. Facebook believes it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be that long before the majority of content across its four platforms is shared as stories, the format it cloned from Snapchat two years ago, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling to achieve advertiser buy-in. Alphabet Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company smashed Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit expectations, sending its shares soaring to a record high. Net profit was actually lower than last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down from $4.9bn to $3.5bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but that included a $2.7bn fine levied on Google by the European commission for anti-competitive behaviour. The company is set to appeal, so could still get its money back. The business raked in more than $26bn of revenue in the three-month period \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well up on the $21bn recorded in the same period last year. Verdict Even though the general tech sell-off hit Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, and profits fell year-on-year, the future looks fairly bright for Alphabet. Yes, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine over Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Android monopoly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good for the company, and it was large enough to hit profits directly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for the $2.7bn penalty, Alphabet would have actually seen profits grow this quarter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the most significant wrongs that Google was accused of are largely in the past, and it is unlikely to feel too constrained going forward. Meanwhile, the search business prints money. Almost every open-ended query on the web starts at Google, and that makes its advertising revenues enormous and secure. YouTube could be a shining gem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and certainly seems to be if you speak to anyone under 20, for whom it, not Netflix, is the new TV \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it will have problems down the line over the same dodgy content now causing such pain for Facebook. Amazon The globe-spanning online retailer announced record quarterly profits of $2.5bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c double the level Wall Street experts had expected \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sending the share price to an all-time high. Advertising and cloud computing were the big growth areas. Verdict Remember when it just sold books? Well, Amazon is the AWS (Amazon Web Services) company now. The record profits of the cloud-computing division led to an astonishing 1,286% year-on-year growth in overall profits, thanks to the extremely high margins that Amazon makes on selling computing time. It now stretches from its own consumer retail business to the Marketplace platform \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building a shopping mall of internet stores \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to AWS, which provides the backbone to the internet. And don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget its bets on the future, particularly with Echo and Alexa. Voice control may yet prove to be a dead-end in the annals of computing, but if not, Amazon could well own the iPhone of the 2020s. Apple Apple made history on Thursday, becoming the first public company to be valued at $1 trillion, reaching the landmark 42 years after the company was founded and two decades after it almost went bust. Financial results for the most recent three months, filed earlier in the week, showed revenues topped $53bn. The company shipped more than 41m phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slightly less than anticipated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but because the expensive iPhone X has proved popular, the average price consumers paid for them went up. Verdict Making nice things and selling them for a lot of money to tens of millions of people is a very good business to be in. The engine of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business, the iPhone, generated 60% of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits, and it shows no sign of letting up. The iPhone X has been a resounding success, proving the hypothesis that millions of people will pay whatever Apple asks for the best phone on the planet. The average selling price of an iPhone is now more than $700. More promisingly still, that has held up in the second quarter, usually the time when sales fall off as savvy customers hold on for the inevitable upgrade in September. But while the iPhone provides the reliable profit, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the growth opportunity. That lies in the two lines at the bottom of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153services\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153other products\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Services \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which include the App Store, Apple Pay and income from Apple Music \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have been growing rapidly since the company stopped viewing them just as a tool for boosting phone sales and started seeing them as a business. Apple invented the idea of the App Store and is taking a 30% cut on everything in it. Tesla Tesla has had a difficult few months, with increasing concerns about the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sustainability and outbursts from its billionaire founder Elon Musk that have seen him labelled the Trump of Tech. On Wednesday the electric-car maker reported a record $717m loss for the last three months, but the shares climbed because revenue hit $4bn and Musk promised profitability later this year. He said there had been a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mind-blowing leap forward\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the number of cars rolling off the lines. Verdict Elon Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s responsible-boss routine on Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings call appeared to restore investor confidence following his disastrous performance three months ago, when he rejected \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boring bonehead questions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from Wall Street analysts concerned about Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fundamentals. But whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a responsible boss or an unpredictable tech genius, Musk still has an uphill struggle on his hands, turning Tesla from a niche maker of expensive cars for the Silicon Valley set into a mass-market manufacturer of electric cars that can compete on equal terms with the likes of BMW and Nissan. Tesla is finally producing its self-imposed quota of 5,000 of its mass-market Model 3s a week, but to do so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had to shift production to an external \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and take a record $700m loss for the quarter. And simply matching its legacy competitors on one mass-market vehicle isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to justify its sky-high valuation (Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock-market value is roughly the same as BMW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to deliver on at least one of its moonshots: self-driving cars, a radically redesigned charging infrastructure, or the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first commercially feasible electric truck. Twitter Twitter lost more than a fifth of its value in two days, despite reporting a record profit, because investors were worried about hugely disappointing forecasts for user numbers. It lost 1 million users in the last three months and predicted a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mid-single-digit millions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd decline in the next three-month period. The social media service reported net income of $100m during the second quarter, but tech companies need to show they can deliver uninterrupted growth to impress Wall Street. Verdict In 2016, Twitter moved its app from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153social networking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd section of the App Store to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd section.

The deal will protect 16,000 jobs for the time being.</p> \n<p>Speaking on Friday, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to ensure that the high street remains resilient, and we also make sure that taxation is fair between business doing business the traditional way, and those doing business online. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/aug/10/harrods-of-the-high-street-maybe-not-but-mike-ashleys-mission-could-succeed\">Harrods of the high street?

The business rates bill for House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 59 outlets last year was just over \u00c2\u00a330m, according to the property advisers Altus Group. House of Fraser had total sales of \u00c2\u00a3787m. By comparison, Amazon had UK sales of nearly \u00c2\u00a39bn, but paid only \u00c2\u00a333m in business rates because it operates from low value warehouse property rather than prime high street locations.</p> \n<p>Last week it was revealed that Amazon UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual corporation tax bill \u00e2\u20ac\u201c levied on profits from its warehouse business \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was just \u00c2\u00a34.6m. That was a reduction on the previous year, even though its profits were up from \u00c2\u00a324m to \u00c2\u00a372m. It was also able to defer a chunk of the total bill, so only paid \u00c2\u00a31.7m. Its actual sales are recorded in Luxembourg.</p> \n<p>There have been a run of high street failures and closures this year, taking about 30,000 retail jobs with them. Toys R Us, Poundworld and Maplin have collapsed, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/07/new-look-considers-shutting-60-stores-across-the-uk\">New Look</a>, Mothercare, Marks &amp; Spencer and Carpetright have announced plans to close hundreds of stores as weak consumer confidence is compounded by the online shopping boom.</p> \n<p>On Friday, Sports Direct confirmed it had bought House of Fraser for \u00c2\u00a390m in cash. Ashley, who also owns Newcastle United, promised to turn the struggling chain into \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Harrods of the high street\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, keeping as many stores open as possible.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/07/high-street-woes-a-list-of-lost-shops-and-jobs\">High street 2018: a tale of lost shops and at least 35,000 jobs at risk</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The chain was put into administration after talks with its creditors, which went on until 3am in the morning, failed to produce a better option.</p> \n<p>The loss-making retailer had \u00c2\u00a3400m of debt. The deal will mean its secured lenders, who are at the front of queue to be paid in the event of administration, recoup abound 22p in the pound. The store chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suppliers, who were due to be paid about \u00c2\u00a360m next week, are expected to get only 3p in the \u00c2\u00a31.</p> \n<p>House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension fund will now be assessed by the pension protection fund (PPF), the industry-backed lifeboat scheme.

In 1953, still owned by the Fraser family, the group extended its geographic reach across Scotland and into north-east England and Carlisle with the purchase of the Binns chain, which had its origins in an early 19th century Sunderland drapery business.

                "bodyText":"The government has hinted it could impose an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Amazon tax\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on online sales as House of Fraser became the latest high street retailer to go into administration. The stricken department store chain, shorn of its debts and pension fund, was immediately snapped up by Sports Direct, the sportswear chain controlled by Mike Ashley, in a \u00c2\u00a390m rescue deal. The deal will protect 16,000 jobs for the time being. Speaking on Friday, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to ensure that the high street remains resilient, and we also make sure that taxation is fair between business doing business the traditional way, and those doing business online. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We may have to look at temporary tax measures to rebalance the playing field until we can get international agreements sorted out.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Traditional retailers face much higher tax charges than their online rivals. The business rates bill for House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 59 outlets last year was just over \u00c2\u00a330m, according to the property advisers Altus Group. House of Fraser had total sales of \u00c2\u00a3787m. By comparison, Amazon had UK sales of nearly \u00c2\u00a39bn, but paid only \u00c2\u00a333m in business rates because it operates from low value warehouse property rather than prime high street locations. Last week it was revealed that Amazon UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual corporation tax bill \u00e2\u20ac\u201c levied on profits from its warehouse business \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was just \u00c2\u00a34.6m. That was a reduction on the previous year, even though its profits were up from \u00c2\u00a324m to \u00c2\u00a372m. It was also able to defer a chunk of the total bill, so only paid \u00c2\u00a31.7m. Its actual sales are recorded in Luxembourg. There have been a run of high street failures and closures this year, taking about 30,000 retail jobs with them. Toys R Us, Poundworld and Maplin have collapsed, while New Look, Mothercare, Marks &amp; Spencer and Carpetright have announced plans to close hundreds of stores as weak consumer confidence is compounded by the online shopping boom. On Friday, Sports Direct confirmed it had bought House of Fraser for \u00c2\u00a390m in cash. Ashley, who also owns Newcastle United, promised to turn the struggling chain into \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Harrods of the high street\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, keeping as many stores open as possible. The chain was put into administration after talks with its creditors, which went on until 3am in the morning, failed to produce a better option. The loss-making retailer had \u00c2\u00a3400m of debt. The deal will mean its secured lenders, who are at the front of queue to be paid in the event of administration, recoup abound 22p in the pound. The store chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suppliers, who were due to be paid about \u00c2\u00a360m next week, are expected to get only 3p in the \u00c2\u00a31. House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension fund will now be assessed by the pension protection fund (PPF), the industry-backed lifeboat scheme. As the fund is in surplus by about \u00c2\u00a320m as measured by the PPF, it is possible the scheme could be taken over by an insurance firm. However, any deal is still likely to fall short of previously promised benefits. All 59 House of Fraser stores will come under Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s control and all 16,000 staff are being transferred on the same employment terms and conditions. However, Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for the business are unclear, and some stores may close in the future. House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous owner Nanjing Cenbest, part of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sanpower conglomerate, had planned to close 31 of the stores using a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), an insolvency procedure, but that deal lapsed when the 169-year-old department store chain went into administration. Ashley, whose business empire also includes a US sports business and a luxury London property development, has long wanted to take control of House of Fraser. He bought an 11% stake in 2014, when 89% of the business was sold to Sanpower in a deal worth \u00c2\u00a3480m. He also has a 29.7% stake in House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rival Debenhams. The addition of House of Fraser to the Sports Direct group will create a new force in high street retailing with annual sales of \u00c2\u00a34.1bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bigger than fashion and homewares chain Next. Sports Direct also owns the London sportswear store Lillywhites and the designer fashion chain Flannels. Scott Lennon, a regional officer at Unite, said the union was worried about how the Sports Direct takeover would affect working conditions at the House of Fraser: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The staff are entering a period of great uncertainty and worry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A Guardian investigation in 2015 found workers at Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shirebrook warehouse operation in the east Midlands effectively receiving hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sports Direct is a leopard that has not changed its spots and we hope that its poor record on pay and employment practices are not transferred to the House of Fraser,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lennon said.

This includes in other emerging markets [EMs], which tend to have limited trade and financial ties with, as well as smaller current account deficits than, Turkey. Meanwhile, the fragilities in Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector that are now grabbing attention are more acute than in most other EMs. </p> \n   <p>Having said all of this, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes are another headwind facing EMs that has arisen in the past few months: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is now slowing, EMs are now tightening monetary policy and the trade war is escalating. So the situation in Turkey could worsen sentiment towards EMs and also strengthens our view that EM growth will weaken.</p> \n   <p>Of course, investors are also worried about the implications of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems for the euro-zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking system and economy. But while these concerns add to the long list of recent headwinds for the euro, neither the overall exposure of banks in the euro-zone to Turkey nor the direct links between the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and the country is large.</p> \n   <p>This is also the case for the wider world. The exposure of US and UK banks to Turkey is negligible. And Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy accounts for just one percent of the global economy at market exchange rates. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5b6daeb1e4b048f8247cc449\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-10T15:28:34.389Z\">4.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Heading into the market close in Europe, and investors have taken fright at the Turkish problems, with worries about contagion uppermost in their minds.

Any emerging market investor who has done even a modicum of due diligence will be aware of the monetary policy problems Turkey has been running for years. President Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consistent pressure on the central bank to keep interest rates low \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a product of his erroneous belief that high interest rates lead to inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has brought Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s macroeconomic situation into serious imbalance, hence placing the country in a vulnerable position. The chickens have now come home to roost.</p> \n   <p>US President Donald Trump has, in typical fashion, wasted no time in exploiting a minor diplomatic spat over an American pastor jailed in Turkey to add insult to Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largely self-inflicted injuries by slapping tariffs on Turkey \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which will further exacerbate today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide.</p> \n   <p>The outlook for Turkey from here remains bleak. Ten years of macroeconomic mismanagement will take a long time to fix even if Turkey begins to follow sensible economic policies from here on out. A recession, and possibly a banking crisis, now look extremely likely. Does Erdogan understand how serious the situation has become? Does he suffer from the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdictator problem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, in which his advisers are scared to give him bad news and prudent advice? One thing seems clear now: if Erdogan continues to blame \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe economic war\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinterest rate lobby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 then the outlook is even more complicated and any macroeconomic improvement less plausible.</p> \n   <p>We remain underweight Turkey as we have done for some time, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to remember that this is almost entirely a self-inflicted Turkish issue. No other emerging market country has a president who believes higher rates cause inflation. Investor sentiment towards EM more widely can temporary weaken, which is normal in periods of risk aversion, but such price action is not justified. If asset prices decline in other EMs just because Turkey does not have its house in order this should be viewed as a buying opportunity and exploited ruthlessly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5b6da2e7e4b048f8247cc392\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-10T14:37:36.966Z\">3.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Earlier Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister - and Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son-in-law had also tried to ease fears about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, including concerns about the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence.

                "bodyText":"The Turkish lira was already under pressure this week on concerns about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, but Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweet threatening to double tariffs on steel and aluminium sent the currency tumbling to new lows. The fallout saw European markets fall sharply, with investors worried about contagion effects, particularly on banks exposed to the Turkish currency. The escalation of yet another trade dispute hit not only European and emerging markets but Wall Street as well. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 74.76 points or 0.97% to 7667.01 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.99% to 12,424.35 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 1.59% lower at 5414.68 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished down 2.51% at 21,090.78 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.56% lower at 9602.1 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.45% to 743.73 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 191 points or 0.75%. On the currency markets the Turkish lira, down 20% at one point, is 15.6% lower. The pound is also under pressure, as continuing Brexit concerns outweighed improving growth figures (although manufacturing moved into recession). Against the dollar sterling is down 0.6% at $1.2742 but it improved 0.5% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1183 against a euro which has been weakened by worries about European banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exposure to Turkey. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems: Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unfolding economic crisis has deepened further after Donald Trump announced he is doubling US import tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium, stoking the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency freefall and rattling financial markets. The Turkish lira plunged by more than 20% against the dollar after the president announced the move, amid a widening dispute between Washington and Ankara over the imprisonment of the US pastor Andrew Brunson. Pressure has been applied on the country in recent days to stage an emergency interest rate rise to avert further economic damage. Revealing an increase in US taxes on Turkish steel imports to 50% and on aluminium to 20%, the president tweeted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The full report is here: The fallout from Turkey is unlikely to be felt too strongly elsewhere despite fears of contagion, says John Higgins at Capital Economics: Our view is that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems will continue to mount in the face of excessively loose monetary and fiscal policy...Despite a vague acknowledgement by the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister of the need for somewhat tighter policy, Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan was devoid of detail and followed an anti-market diatribe from President Erdogan. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing difficulties will cause a lot of trouble elsewhere, though. This includes in other emerging markets [EMs], which tend to have limited trade and financial ties with, as well as smaller current account deficits than, Turkey. Meanwhile, the fragilities in Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector that are now grabbing attention are more acute than in most other EMs. Having said all of this, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes are another headwind facing EMs that has arisen in the past few months: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is now slowing, EMs are now tightening monetary policy and the trade war is escalating. So the situation in Turkey could worsen sentiment towards EMs and also strengthens our view that EM growth will weaken. Of course, investors are also worried about the implications of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems for the euro-zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking system and economy. But while these concerns add to the long list of recent headwinds for the euro, neither the overall exposure of banks in the euro-zone to Turkey nor the direct links between the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and the country is large. This is also the case for the wider world. The exposure of US and UK banks to Turkey is negligible. And Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy accounts for just one percent of the global economy at market exchange rates. Heading into the market close in Europe, and investors have taken fright at the Turkish problems, with worries about contagion uppermost in their minds. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: European stock markets have been rocked by the plunge in the Turkish lira. The European Central Bank (ECB) warned that a number of eurozone banks might be exposed to the sharp decline in the Turkish lira. A number of Spanish, French and Italian banks are connected to Turkey in the form of foreign denominated loans, and if the Turkish borrowers haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hedged their exposure it might spark defaults. Should European banks incur write-downs on account of the Turkish currency crisis, investment sentiment is likely to be weak. Many financial institutions in Europe have their own non-performing loans to contend with, and they could be facing a similar situation in Turkey. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jamie McGeever has put today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall in the Turkish lira into context: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy editor on Turkish steel exports, which will now be hit by the new Trump tariffs: Erdogan is now repeating his previous pleas to buy lira: The situation for Turkey looks bleak and it is entirely of its own making, says Jan Dehn, head of research at investment manager Ashmore Group: The situation unfolding in Turkey is fluid, but essentially unsurprising. Any emerging market investor who has done even a modicum of due diligence will be aware of the monetary policy problems Turkey has been running for years. President Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consistent pressure on the central bank to keep interest rates low \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a product of his erroneous belief that high interest rates lead to inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has brought Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s macroeconomic situation into serious imbalance, hence placing the country in a vulnerable position. The chickens have now come home to roost. US President Donald Trump has, in typical fashion, wasted no time in exploiting a minor diplomatic spat over an American pastor jailed in Turkey to add insult to Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largely self-inflicted injuries by slapping tariffs on Turkey \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which will further exacerbate today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide. The outlook for Turkey from here remains bleak. Ten years of macroeconomic mismanagement will take a long time to fix even if Turkey begins to follow sensible economic policies from here on out. A recession, and possibly a banking crisis, now look extremely likely. Does Erdogan understand how serious the situation has become? Does he suffer from the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdictator problem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, in which his advisers are scared to give him bad news and prudent advice? One thing seems clear now: if Erdogan continues to blame \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe economic war\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinterest rate lobby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 then the outlook is even more complicated and any macroeconomic improvement less plausible. We remain underweight Turkey as we have done for some time, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to remember that this is almost entirely a self-inflicted Turkish issue. No other emerging market country has a president who believes higher rates cause inflation. Investor sentiment towards EM more widely can temporary weaken, which is normal in periods of risk aversion, but such price action is not justified. If asset prices decline in other EMs just because Turkey does not have its house in order this should be viewed as a buying opportunity and exploited ruthlessly. Earlier Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister - and Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son-in-law had also tried to ease fears about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, including concerns about the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence. Associated Press reports: In a bid to ease investor concerns about Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policy, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister says the government will safeguard the independence of the central bank. Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak on Friday also vowed sustainable and healthy economic growth as well as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong struggle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd against inflation, which currently stands at close to 16 percent. Albayrak was speaking at a conference where he outlined his ministry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new economic policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as the currency plunged, raising questions about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of our principles will be ensuring the full independence of monetary policy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Investors are worried about the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unorthodox economic policies, pressure exerted on the central bank, and a dispute with the United States that has led to sanctions. Before his second speech and after Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech, Erdogan was reportedly in contact with Russia: Turkish president Erdogan is making a second speech at the moment. He is currently talking about infrastructure spending, including better roads and tunnels. He says forget the lira, forget currencies and talks about being in love with the Turkish people. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, also sees echoes of the Greek troubles: If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a black swan event, this could be it, although we must stress that so the panic is very much confined to Turkey. Nevertheless, ghosts of Greece are still vivid in the memory for European investors and today is the first sign that the problem with Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s larger dollar debts is no longer confined to its borders. Three summers ago, Greece was forced to impose capital controls to prevent a run on its banks, as its future in the eurozone hung in the balance. Gavin Friend, senior market strategist at National Australia Bank, believes Turkey could soon be forced into similar measures: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Though hiking rates would be the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred option for Turkey to stem this crisis and help deal with inflation this seems unlikely given what we heard from President Erdogan today. If we assume IMF assistance is out of the question from both sides, that leaves capital controls. That is problematic given Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s need for foreign inflows - but of course they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be coming for now and stemming the flow the other way is the issue. This won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help in building trust between Turkey and international investors. Paul McNamara, investment director at asset management firm GAM, has written a fine explanation of the causes of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic woes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think that Turkey has a toxic combination of a weak external position (current account deficit), excessive private sector debt and a high level of foreign funding in the banking system. This is coming to a head as a much-needed demand slowdown is causing asset quality problems in the banks. The role of construction in the economy for example is comparable with that in Spain or Ireland ahead of the European bust. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think the Turks have exhausted the possibilities of rate hikes, and are backed into a corner by their inadequate level of currency reserves (the IMF thinks that Turkey has the least adequate level of reserves of the major EM economies. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politics are also a problem with the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son-in-law as Finance Minister and perception of political interference with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153independent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Central Bank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s developments have been very negative: President Erdogan made a belligerent speech with no reference to the need of a change of course. Finance Minister Albayrak made a content-free speech full of consultant platitudes. Finally, US President Trump doubled tariffs on Turkish metal exports \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is likely symbolic, but symbolising a lack of US support for the Ankara regime. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our strongly-held negative view on Turkey remains intact and we have not covered any risk.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deepening currency crisis is sending fear sweeping through the financial markets. All the main European stock markets are in the red, led by financial shares. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark stock index has sunk by 3% today. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has shed 2%, while Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is down 60 points, or 0.8%. Several European banks have significant operations in Turkey, such as Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BBVA, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UniCredit and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BNP Paribas. Unicredit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have fallen by 5.6%, closely followed by BBVA (-5.4%) Deutsche Bank (-5.3%), ING (-5%) and BNP Paribas (-4.2%) According to the Financial Times, the European Central Bank is worried that Turkish borrowers might not be hedged against the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness and begin to default on foreign currency loans. Those loans make up about 40% of the Turkish banking sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets, and are now a lot more expensive to repay following the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency crisis could force president Erdogan to impose capital controls, or seek help from the International Monetary Fund, says Brad Bechtel of investment bank Jefferies: Turkey has a handful of options including seeking an IMF program, capital controls, rate hikes, yield to American demands or do nothing and so far the only option he seems to be leaning towards is do nothing. His stubborn stance against the US and twisted view of the IMF combined with a fear of higher interest rates make the situation untenable. The complete loss of credibility in the central bank was the final shoe to drop and spark for the latest rout we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in the currency. Until decisive action is taken, they will continue to spiral out of control. Turkey is now suffering one of the most painful and intense currency crises in many years: The Turkish lira is plunging to new record lows following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweet. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now down 18% (!!) today, at over 6.5 lira to the dollar, compared with 5.5 lira last night. That means the currency has lost nearly a third of its value this week. A truly shocking plunge, suggesting Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is getting into serious trouble. NEWSFLASH: Donald Trump has announced he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doubling the tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium imports, as the diplomatic row between Turkey and the US deepens. Trump announced the move in a tweet, claiming it was in response to the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent slump. This further intensifies the battle between the two countries over US pastor Andrew Brunson, who is currently imprisoned over terrorism charges. The moves comes shortly after Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president claimed there was a campaign to harm Turkey by weakening the lira. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move has sent the lira sliding deeper into trouble. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now down almost 14% today at 6.3 lira to the dollar (a month ago it traded at 4.8). Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency crisis has deepened today, as president Erdogan attempting to calm the situation with a defiant address to the nation. After watching the lira fall to record lows in recent days, Erdogan declared that Turkey is facing an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic war\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which he vowed not to lose. Erdogan also urged Turkish citizens to help, by swapping any foreign currency for lira to help stem its losses. If there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anyone who has dollars, gold or euros under their pillow, I am asking them to take them to the bank and exchange them for Turkish lira. Turkish assets have been slumping in recent days, for several reasons 1) A standoff with the U.S. over a detained American pastor that Turkey, a NATO ally, has put on trial for espionage and terror-related charges linked to a failed coup attempt in the country two years ago. Washington has imposed financial sanctions on two Turkish ministers and warned of additional measures unless the pastor is released 2) Investors are worried about the Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policies since his election win in June. He has long pushed the Turkish central banks to cut interest rates, claiming this would lower inflation (most economists take the opposite view). The lira has slumped by around 10% today, extending yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deep losses. Paul Greer, portfolio manager at Fidelity International, argues that Turkey actually needs a massive interest rate hike of perhaps 10 percentage points, to restore market confidence. However, such a move would also probably drag Turkey into recession. Greer says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s macro challenges are numerous and well known - an overheating economy, a sizable external financing requirement, an outsized structural current account deficit, persistent double digit inflation, low net FX reserves and a large private sector debt burden. As a result of this, investor confidence in President Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regime has been waning for much of the past year but key cabinet changes made after the June 24th elections have been particularly damaging for sentiment..... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fundamental challenges are numerous, there are plenty of straightforward textbook solutions which, if implemented, can halt the downward spiral of investor confidence and asset prices. An aggressive interest rate hike from the Central Bank would be a good start, something of the order of +1,000bp that Argentina delivered back in May would be appropriate at this juncture. This would help slow the economy, probably into a recession, which would help crunch the relentless demand for imports and thereby alleviate some of the current account deficit problem. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics correspondent Richard Partington on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures: Warmer weather helped the British economy grow at a faster pace in the three months to the end of June, despite official figures revealing the manufacturing sector slumped into recession for the first time since the Brexit vote. The Office for National Statistics said GDP increased by 0.4% in the second quarter from a rate of 0.2% in the previous three months, helped by stronger retail sales and good weather enabling the construction industry to make-up lost ground from the heavy snow earlier this year. The better news for the economy comes after the Bank of England lifted interest rates to 0.75% last week, their highest level since the financial crisis a decade ago. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are working hard to build a stronger, fairer economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c dealing with the deficit, helping people into work, and cutting taxes for individuals and businesses.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Service industries experienced robust growth of 0.5% in the second quarter, with the retail and wholesale sectors providing the strongest contribution, helped by the warm weather tempting shoppers back to the high street. However, the latest snapshot from the ONS painted an increasingly lopsided picture for economic growth, with Britain reliant on the services sector amid a downturn for factory output. There were also indications of slowing growth in June, with the ONS revealing May was the strongest month of the second quarter. More here: Philip Hammond also dropped a loud hint that the UK government could push for new taxes on online retailers: Asked about House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lurch into administration today, and the wider problems in the high street, he told Sky News that: We want to ensure that the high street remains resilient, and that we also make sure that taxation is fair between businesses doing business the traditional way, and those doing business online. That requires us to renegotiate international tax treaties because many of the big online businesses are international companies. The EU has been talking about a tax on online platform businesses, based on the value generated. Chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond, has blamed Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slow growth in recent quarters on Brexit uncertainty. Speaking in Coventry today, Hammond told reporters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Clearly that uncertainty is having a depressing effect on economic growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hammond has been pushing for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, under which Britain maintained close links with the European Union. Back in January, he called for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continued cross-border flow of ideas, goods, services, people and capital\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, annoying cabinet colleagues who favour a hard break with the EU. The TUC make a very important point -- if you adjust for population increases, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth has been extremely poor since the financial crisis. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady blames weak investment over the last decade, which has meant earnings growth has been poor too: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest figures cap a dismal decade for the economy. But we should not accept weak growth as the new normal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the result of bad management of the economy. There has been too little investment and a failure to focus on getting wages rising. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we want a stronger decade ahead, the UK must catch up with the levels investment we see in other OECD nations. And the government must put action to get wages rising at the heart of its plans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However...Rebecca Long Bailey MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Business Secretary, is concerned that Sports Direct now has control of House of Fraser. She argues that the UK must reform its business rates system, to help high street chains compete with online retailers. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIt is unforgivable that the Conservatives have stood by and done nothing while tens of thousands of jobs have been put at risk. Their inaction has prepared the ground for the likes of Mike Ashley, notorious for his company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor treatment of workers, to hoover up businesses. Staff will undoubtedly be concerned about what the sale means for their wages and conditions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How many more of our most recognisable high street brands have to go under before the Prime Minister steps up and addresses the broken business rates system which is turning our high streets into ghost towns? Financial experts are pleased that House of Fraser has been saved from the abyss by Sports Direct - even though we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term plans for the retailer. Simon Underwood, business recovery partner at accountancy firm, Menzies LLP, says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153welcome outcome\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is possibly the best news from the High Street this year and a positive indicator for other ailing retailers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153House of Fraser is a strong brand and this \u00c2\u00a390m bid from Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley means many of its stores will be saved and its operations streamlined. The fate of the remaining stores is uncertain - some may be sold off separately and others will be closed. The new owners will bring a timely injection of cash, ensuring a future for the various concessions and providing a more stable platform for the business to restructure its operations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In a very fast-moving set of circumstances, this is a welcome outcome for both House of Fraser and UK consumers. It shows that there is light at the end of the tunnel and at least for the moment, a mainstay of the British High Street has been saved from the brink.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Michael Mulligan, insolvency specialist at Shakespeare Martineau, thinks it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for suppliers and staff: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now that Sports Direct has acquired the House of Fraser brand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including all of the stock in the business - it will allow continued operation with a likely focus on the flagship stores. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will be welcome news not only for suppliers who rely on House of Fraser for their livelihoods, but also for all employees involved. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is yet another significant High Street rescue mission and the crisis shows no sign of abating. With interest rates rising and less money in the pocket of the UK consumer, more household names may be at risk.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is still \u00e2\u20ac\u0153struggling to gain momentum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd despite growing faster in April-June, says Mike Jakeman, senior economist at PwC, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The improvement was partly driven by one-off events, such as higher consumer spending on food and drink around the World Cup, the heatwave and the Royal Wedding. However, there was also some evidence that hot weather and wall-to-wall football deterred shoppers from buying goods other than food or drink. The net effect was that household consumption grew at the same pace as in Q1. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Instead, the acceleration was driven by investment, which rebounded after a very poor first quarter, but only to the level seen at the end of 2017. Brexit-related uncertainty is still deterring large, export-focused firms from committing to investment plans. Net trade also subtracted from growth for the first time since late 2016, as a result of weaker exports of cars and planes. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK GDP report is rather mixed: Although the 0.4 quarter on quarter per cent growth for 2018Q2 is in line with expectations, the annual growth reading of 1.3 per cent is slightly lower than that the 1.41 per cent estimate (based on market interest rate expectations) by BoE policymakers and even lower than the 1.5 per cent \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctrend growth\u00c2\u00b4 considered by the Bank as our new economic \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnorm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. So does that mean that the Bank of England was wrong to raise interest rates to 0.75% last week? Not at all, he explains: What BoE policymakers have decided to do is store up interest rate \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcammunition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 should Brexit-related developments over the next few months require deep interest rate cuts to revive the economy. It is vital that financial markets and traders see all this so that selling pressure on the sterling currency recedes. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics makes an important point -- the slump in sterling since the Brexit vote has not healed the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade woes: Anthony Gillham, head of investment at City firm Quilter Investors, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very impressed with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth report. He warns that the UK is still \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcplaying catch-up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 after slowing last winter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While growth has improved slightly, it does so from a low starting point. Over the medium term, UK growth has been thoroughly unspectacular, with the domestic economy expanding at a slower pace than most developed countries. So with the pound at a 13-month low this morning, Gillham warns that imports will become more expensive.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a real risk of stagflation on the horizon, with the recent interest rate hike failing to address the fall in the pound, and the sentiment of Mark Carney and Liam Fox even talking the value of Sterling to its lowest point against the dollar in a year. The UK finds itself in a difficult situation where the Bank of England is hiking rates to try and keep a lid on import costs that drive up inflation, but it is doing so against the backdrop of weak economic growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The general climate of uncertainty that pervades is discouraging households form making big ticket purchases, while business investment is also stifled as a result of CEOs feeling cautious about starting big projects before they have more certainty about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future relationship with European trading partners. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate remains lacklustre. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s particularly concerned by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade figures, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The higher growth in the second quarter was largely due to stronger service sector output, which helped offset a contraction in industrial output and a widening trade deficit. While there was pick-up in construction output, the improvement was from a low base, and the sector continues to add little to overall UK growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The widening of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit in the quarter is disappointing, and reflects both a decline in goods exports and a rise in imported goods. The deterioration in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net trade position is further confirmation that we are still some way from achieving a rebalancing of our economy. These charts show how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit widened last quarter, and how it became MORE reliant on trade with the EU over the last year: UK economic growth is still \u00e2\u20ac\u0153way below the gains we were used to before the financial crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Rob Hodgson, Head of Wealth Management at GWM Investment Management. Economics journalist Dharshini David agrees that 0.4% growth isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t something to shout about John McDonnell MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chancellor, says the economy is suffering from Brexit uncertainty, and years of government cutbacks: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153More than eight years of unnecessary ideologically-driven austerity has created an economy unable to cope with the instability brought about by the Tories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mismanagement of the Brexit negotiations. The result is low growth and stagnant pay. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grow this anaemic, councils are going bankrupt and the NHS is now in permanent crisis while holidaymakers are being hit by the Tories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 falling pound. Labour will bring stability to the economy and rising living standards with long term stable planning and investment and by securing a Brexit deal that puts jobs and the economy first.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chancellor Philip Hammond has tweeted: Back on GDP, and this chart shows how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers had a tough few months: Newsflash: Sports Direct has bought House of Fraser for \u00c2\u00a390m, just a couple of hours after it fell into administration. The retailer, run by Mike Ashley, is acquiring all of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 51 stores, and its stock. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear what this means for the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 17,000 staff, though. In a statement, it says: Sports Direct International plc (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Company\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Group\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) announces the acquisition of the business and assets of House of Fraser from the administrators of House of Fraser Limited, House of Fraser (Stores) Limited and James Beattie Limited, the House of Fraser group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main operating companies (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Operating Companies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), for a cash consideration of \u00c2\u00a390 million (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Transaction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). Pursuant to the Transaction, the Group has acquired all of the UK stores of House of Fraser, the House of Fraser brand and all of the stock in the business. For the year ended 28 January 2017 (the last date to which statutory accounts are available for the parent company of the Operating Companies and prior to the appointment of the administrators), the House of Fraser group had gross assets of \u00c2\u00a3946.3m and made \u00c2\u00a314.7m net profit. Although Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate picked up in the last quarter, it has been modest for the last 18 months: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the breakdown sector-by-sector, confirming that Britain relied on its service sector for growth in the last three months, with construction also making a positive contribution. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rob-Kent Smith, head of national accounts at the ONS, on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The economy picked up a little in the second quarter with both retail sales and construction helped by the good weather and rebounding from the effects of the snow earlier in the year. However, manufacturing continued to fall back from its high point at the end of last year and underlying growth remained modest by historical standards. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit noticeably worsened as exports of cars and planes declined sharply while imports rose.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade gap has worsened, as the country continues to import much more than it exports to the rest of the world. The total UK trade deficit widened by \u00c2\u00a34.7bn to \u00c2\u00a38.6bn in the three months to June 2018, due mainly to falling goods exports and rising goods imports. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector drove growth in the last quarter, growing by 0.5%. The construction sector also had a good quarter, expanding by 0.9%. But the industrial sector shrank by 0.8% in April-June. That includes a 0.9% contraction across the UK manufacturing base. That means UK manufacturing is now in recession.... Breaking! The UK economy grew by 0.4% in the second quarter of 2018. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 0.2% in the first three months of the year, as the economy got back up to speed after the bad wintery weather. More to follow! The pound has fallen to a fresh 13-month low against the US dollar this morning. Sterling shed three quarters of a cent in nervy trading to hit $1.2740, its lowest level since June 2017. This means that the pound has shed 10% of its value since April, as worries over a hard Brexit have intensified. But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls are also due to the US dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength. Nervous traders are piling into the dollar, in the face of a mounting financial crisis in Turkey. The Turkish lira has gone through the floor this morning, tumbling a staggering 12%. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister (who happens to be the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son in law) is due to unveil \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a new economic model\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on Friday, which will include plans to cut the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit. Investors, though, are losing faith - and increasingly alarmed about the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence. As Charlie Robertson of Renaissance Capital puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The markets have lost confidence in the triumvirate of President Erdogan, his son-in-law as finance minister and the [central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] ability to act as it needs to.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Overnight, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned that Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy expanded by 0.5%, thanks to a pick- up in consumer spending. Can the UK match it? Michael Hewson of CMC Markets predicts that the UK economy rebounded strongly in the last quarter: A decent recovery across construction, manufacturing and services is expected to show 0.4% growth, with the timing of Easter, a Royal Wedding and warm weather set to paint a decent picture of economic activity. In an hour we discover if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right.... Retail expert Nick Bubb thinks some parts of House of Fraser can still be saved, saying: Hopes of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pre-pack\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd deal to salvage parts of the business (with Sports Direct?) still seem high\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The House of Fraser story is moving fast. Sky News are reporting that Mike Ashley, founder of Sports Direct, is close to agreeing a deal to take control of the company. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear, though, how many of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stores he would take on. Frank Slevin, chairman of House of Fraser, says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hopeful that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future will be sorted out soon. He told investors this morning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This has been an extraordinarily challenging six months in which the business has delivered so many critical elements of the turnaround plan. Despite the very recent termination of the transaction between Cenbest and C.Banner, I am confident House of Fraser is close to securing its future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd High street chain House of Fraser has confirmed it is appointing administrators after negotiations between investors and creditors failed to reach a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153solvent solution.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The retail chain, which employs over 17,000 people, has been forced to turn to Ernst &amp; Young as administrators after days of negotiations with billionaire tycoons Mike Ashley and Philip Day, and the retail turnaround fund Alteri Investors. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 59 stores are all set to open as usual on Friday, while EY attempts to arrange a sale. Some 31 stores were previously earmarked for closure under an earlier restructuring plan, so HoF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff now face fresh uncertainty. In a statement to investors, the company says: Court hearings are expected to take place at 7:30 am today, at which orders will be sought appointing individuals from Ernst &amp; Young LLP as administrators of each of the Operating Companies with immediate effect. Significant progress has been made towards completing a sale of the Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business and assets. The proposed administrators are expected to continue to progress those discussions with a view to concluding a transaction shortly after their appointment. My colleague Sean Farrell explains how HoF could now be broken up: The group needs about \u00c2\u00a350m after C.banner, the Hong Kong-listed owner of Hamleys, pulled out of plans to raise \u00c2\u00a370m to invest in House of Fraser. Most industry experts expected any rescue to involve putting House of Fraser into administration to allow a new investor to buy its most attractive stores without taking on loss-making sites. Plum locations include shops in Glasgow as well as Bluewater in Kent, Manchester, Belfast and Meadowhall in Sheffield. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we discover how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is faring, when growth figures for the second quarter of 2018 are released. Economists expect that GDP increased by 0.4% in April-June, as businesses got back up to speed after the Beast from the East hit growth. If they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right, this would mean the economy grew twice as fast as in the first quarter of the year. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still lacklustre growth in historic terms, extending the generally weak growth since the Brexit referendum in 2016 Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says growth should have picked up in the last few months - even though consumer confidence is subdued. The second quarter was altogether brighter, with good weather, a Royal Wedding and the World Cup all driving consumer behaviour. The latest ONS retail sales data suggests that food and drink sales have been positively impacted by the sunshine and the football, while spending in pubs also increased by 9.5% year on year in June according to Barclaycard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer analysis. Not all parts of the UK economy have been making hay in the sunshine however, with big ticket items particularly under pressure. Household appliance sales fell 14.8% in the year to June according to Barclaycard, and the football combined with the warm weather led to a June drop in sales for non-food retailers according to the ONS. Also coming up today... Department chain House of Fraser is fighting for survival, after days of increasingly frantic rescue talks to secure new funding for the company. The company is going into administration, following all-night talks with potential bidders such as Mike Ashley, the owner of Sports Direct, Philip Day, the owner of Edinburgh Woollen Mill, and restructuring expert Alteri. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK growth figures for the second quarter of 2018 9.30am BST: UK trade and industrial production data for June 1.30pm BST: US inflation figures for July",

Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate tax cuts have boosted US corporate profits, helping to drive the stock market higher. The president celebrated stocks reaching record levels earlier this year, tweeting: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dow just crashes through 25,000. Congrats! Big cuts in unnecessary regulations continuing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The bull market run has, however, included sharp corrections \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when shares fall by at least 10% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although it maintained its status because the declines did not exceed 20%. Little more than a month after the US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweet, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by more than 1,000 points amid fears over rising inflation that could have prompted the Fed to raise interest rates faster than expected. Concerns over a global trade war instigated by Washington have also rocked markets in recent months and could still pose a threat. Analysts said US stocks could continue rising over the course of this year, although warned against placing faith in arbitrary definitions of strength, such as markets having risen for a period or reaching certain levels.",

Around 70% of Homebase branches make a loss, according to a report in the <em>Financial Times</em>.</p> <p>Agreeing a CVA can dramatically reduce overheads for bricks-and-mortar chains paying rent on dozens or hundreds of properties around the country. Landlords considering whether to back such deals must weigh up whether they would rather help valued tenants survive to pay rent another day, albeit at reduced rates, or risk seeing them collapse altogether. It seems like a no-brainer. Some rent is better than no rent after all, particularly when an uncertain economic backdrop means finding new tenants could prove tricky.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/27/landlords-to-fight-use-of-cvas-by-retailers-seeking-rent-cuts\">Landlords to fight use of CVAs by retailers seeking rent cuts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the sheer volume of CVAs has become almost farcical, with applicants so far this year including House of Fraser, Carluccio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Mothercare, Jamie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian, Prezzo, Byron, New Look and Carpetright. This has led to accusations from the property industry that retailers see CVAs as a cheap and easy way to force landlords to bail them out, when other remedies might be available.</p> <p>Amid building anger, Homebase needs to secure the support of 75% of its landlords for the CVA to go ahead. Even if Homebase gets the votes it needs, the burgeoning list of CVAs is a symptom of wider malaise on the high street that shows no sign of abating given industry trends. Traditional retailers are under threat from online competitors with low overheads, particularly Amazon.</p> <p>The globe-straddling retail colossus could now benefit from the conditions it has helped to create. Amazon is reportedly keen to snap up some of the sites vacated by Homebase which, unlike town-centre retailers, owns many of its properties. Amazon could use these handily situated venues as mini-warehouses to boost its ability to deliver within short timeframes. A spokesperson declined to comment on whether Amazon would bid on any of the properties but it has plenty of cash to do so, having halved its already meagre UK corporation tax contribution to just \u00c2\u00a34.5m last year.</p> <p>One major area of expansion for Amazon is food delivery and supermarkets are reportedly nervous. How long before traditional supermarkets, like high street shops before them, fall victim to a ruthlessly efficient competitor with tiny overheads and a minuscule tax bill?</p> <p>The comic writer and producer Armando Iannuci once wrote a sketch that envisaged a future in which Tesco was so ubiquitous that it ran out of space in the UK and was forced to invade Denmark.

In this case, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather a lot of them. Around 70% of Homebase branches make a loss, according to a report in the Financial Times. Agreeing a CVA can dramatically reduce overheads for bricks-and-mortar chains paying rent on dozens or hundreds of properties around the country. Landlords considering whether to back such deals must weigh up whether they would rather help valued tenants survive to pay rent another day, albeit at reduced rates, or risk seeing them collapse altogether. It seems like a no-brainer. Some rent is better than no rent after all, particularly when an uncertain economic backdrop means finding new tenants could prove tricky. But the sheer volume of CVAs has become almost farcical, with applicants so far this year including House of Fraser, Carluccio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Mothercare, Jamie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian, Prezzo, Byron, New Look and Carpetright. This has led to accusations from the property industry that retailers see CVAs as a cheap and easy way to force landlords to bail them out, when other remedies might be available. Amid building anger, Homebase needs to secure the support of 75% of its landlords for the CVA to go ahead. Even if Homebase gets the votes it needs, the burgeoning list of CVAs is a symptom of wider malaise on the high street that shows no sign of abating given industry trends. Traditional retailers are under threat from online competitors with low overheads, particularly Amazon. The globe-straddling retail colossus could now benefit from the conditions it has helped to create. Amazon is reportedly keen to snap up some of the sites vacated by Homebase which, unlike town-centre retailers, owns many of its properties. Amazon could use these handily situated venues as mini-warehouses to boost its ability to deliver within short timeframes. A spokesperson declined to comment on whether Amazon would bid on any of the properties but it has plenty of cash to do so, having halved its already meagre UK corporation tax contribution to just \u00c2\u00a34.5m last year. One major area of expansion for Amazon is food delivery and supermarkets are reportedly nervous. How long before traditional supermarkets, like high street shops before them, fall victim to a ruthlessly efficient competitor with tiny overheads and a minuscule tax bill? The comic writer and producer Armando Iannuci once wrote a sketch that envisaged a future in which Tesco was so ubiquitous that it ran out of space in the UK and was forced to invade Denmark. Somewhere along the way, ran the skit, its slogan changed from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every little helps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We control every aspect of your lives\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Perhaps the premise of the satire wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so far-fetched \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he just chose the wrong company?",

                "bodyText":"The US economy recorded its strongest economic growth in nearly four years in the three months to the end of June, according to revised figures. Gross domestic product increased at a 4.2% annualized rate, the commerce department said on Wednesday after revising its second-quarter calculations, establishing the quarter as the strongest in terms of growth since late 2014. Many economists had forecast a downward revision of growth to about 4%. The figures helped send Wall Street to new highs on Wednesday. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq indexes both broke records for the fourth consecutive session, boosted by gains for technology companies including Amazon and Alphabet. Amazon rose 3.4% as the online retailer edged closer to becoming the second US company after Apple to be worth $1tn. Its market value stands at $971bn. After the initial calculation of 4.1% was announced in July, Donald Trump hailed the figures as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an economic turnaround of historic importance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. On Wednesday, the US treasury department attributed the revisions to higher levels of spending by businesses on software and a decline in imports, including petroleum. Balanced out against out against GDP numbers for previous quarters, the revision puts the US economy on track to hit the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of 3% annual growth. But economists warn that the growth is unlikely to be sustained as the quarter reflected unique boosters, including Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $1.5tn tax cut package, which helped tweak consumer spending upwards, and revenue from soya bean exports to China ahead of raised tariffs coming into effect. Economists had expected second-quarter GDP growth would be revised down one-tenth of a percentage point to a 4% pace in anticipation of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153America First\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd policies, including tit-for-tat tariff hikes between the US, China, the EU, Canada and Mexico coming into effect. On the downside, growth in consumer spending was lowered to 3.8% in the second quarter instead of the previously reported 4%. But the trends may be reversed in the coming months. The US Conference Board, which measures consumer confidence, a solid indicator of consumer spending which accounts for two-thirds of US economic activity, said its confidence index had hit its highest level since October 2000. The index climbed to 133.4 in August, despite expectations from a survey of Reuters economists that it would fall to 126.7, as consumers reported short-term economic optimism. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These historically high confidence levels should continue to support healthy consumer spending in the near term,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board. The rise in consumer confidence comes as US stocks hit record highs after a six-month climb back from February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market correction \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the S&amp;P 500 index has jumped 3% in the past two weeks. Trump tweeted to trumpet the news: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumer confidence pops in August to highest level since October 2000.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A plentiful job supply, coupled with a rise in the percentage of US households describing current business conditions as improving to 40.3%, from 38.1% a month earlier, are key components for the overall rise in consumer confidence. In a note to clients, Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, noted that consumer optimism \u00e2\u20ac\u0153suggests a degree of skepticism about trade, inflation or anything else knocking the economy off track\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Baird warned however that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consumers may be caught by surprise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd should any of those develop into a larger problem.",
