Markit said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>US manufacturing firms signalled a strong improvement in operating conditions in July, despite the headline PMI falling to a five-month low. Weaker rises in output and employment were seen in July, while export sales fell for the second month in a row. Meanwhile, companies reported the greatest deterioration in vendor performance since the series began and a faster rate of input cost inflation. That said, business confidence remained strongly positive, and was supported by hopes of further increases in overall new orders. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"229fcaf4943b426b3e0f5d17bf54c1384b6c92c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/229fcaf4943b426b3e0f5d17bf54c1384b6c92c5/0_0_873_518/500.jpg\" alt=\"uspmi1aug\" width=\"500\" height=\"297\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US manufacturing sector continued to expand in July, but shows increasing signs of struggling against headwinds of supply shortages, rising prices and deteriorating exports. </p> <p>The latest survey showed output rising at a rate roughly equivalent to an annualised 1% pace of expansion, which is the weakest since late last year. While a weakening of new export orders for a second successive month suggested foreign demand has waned compared to earlier in the year, the slowdown can be also in part attributed to increased difficulties in sourcing sufficient quantities of inputs. Suppliers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 delivery delays were more widespread than at any time in the survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history. With producers often scrambling to buy enough raw materials, suppliers enjoyed greater pricing power. Not surprisingly, with tariffs also kicking in, cost pressures spiked higher again.</p> <p>Some relief for manufacturers came from strong domestic demand, which meant firms were increasingly able to pass higher costs on to customers. Average prices charged for goods consequently rose at the steepest rate for seven years, which is likely to feed through to higher consumer prices in coming months.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b61b799e4b0081aec3b9962\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T13:38:50.581Z\">2.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise has helped lift technology stocks on Wall Street, pushing the Nasdaq Composite 0.39% higher.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average - which also includes Apple - is marginally higher, up 0.04% while the S&amp;P 500 has opened 0.17% higher.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b61b0b8e4b0081aec3b991c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T13:31:22.438Z\">2.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Apple shares open up 4.4%</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Following its forecast-beating results and upbeat outlook, Apple shares have jumped 4.4% to $198.4. at the start of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading, helping support a US market rattled by renewed concerns about a damaging trade war between the US and China.</p> <p>The move means Apple is close to becoming the first company to be valued at $1tn.

Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Apple shares leapt 4% in after-hours trade and are set to open at a record high just shy of the $200 level. Although it would be a bit of a stretch, a push up to the $1tn mark today is a possibility - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a matter of time before it achieves a valuation of $1tn. If it does, cue some big profit taking but it would be a moment to savour for Tim Cook.</p> <p> We need the share price to break $203 to hit $1tn in market cap \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a little more than $5 above the after-hours level at $197-$198. Rather like the Dow at 25k, you kind of get the feeling investors will conspire to nudge it over the line. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in FAANGs now I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see why you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rotate some equity out of more exposed companies like Facebook and Netflix and opt for relative safety in Apple, whose multiples remain well short of FAANG peers. What might weigh today is broader market fears about trade wars with China as the White House sets out fresh tariff plans on $200bn of Chinese goods. Tim Cook was pretty circumspect on trade and tariffs on the call.</p> <p> Results were very impressive with a beat on revenues and EPS. iPhone sales were a shade weaker than forecast but on a number of important fronts we saw excellent numbers.</p> </blockquote> <p>The FAANGs - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-owner Alphabet - and the wider technology sector have been under pressure in recent days after poor results from Facebook and Twitter.

But the downbeat survey is unlikely to discourage the Bank of England from raising interest rates on Thursday, he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At 54.0, the latest UK manufacturing PMI is the lowest in three months and is a far cry from the levels seen towards the end of 2017. Weaker domestic demand saw new orders fall and the rate of output growth slip to the lowest in 16 months. Interestingly though, demand from abroad hit a six-month high, implying that firms are still reaping the rewards of better global growth, despite the recent moderation in Europe.</p> <p>But over coming months, life for manufacturers is unlikely to get any easier. The recent escalation in trade tensions is clearly a challenge, but increasingly the biggest headache for businesses is likely to be the threat of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit. This scenario would likely see huge congestion at ports and disruption to supply chains. While we suspect the probability of the UK leaving without an agreement in March next year is relatively low, an agreement may not come until late in the day.</p> <p>Until then, confidence could begin to fall as uncertainty increases \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the latest PMI suggests the degree of positive sentiment is already at a 21-month low.</p> <p>Having said all of that, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slip in the PMI is unlikely to faze Bank of England policymakers ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. Representing around 10% of output, manufacturing is a relatively small part of the UK growth mix. Importantly, the recent data flow \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly in the much larger service sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has largely backed up the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view that the economy has regained poise after the weak first quarter.</p> <p>For that reason, we think the Bank of England will increase interest rates this week. But the key thing to watch is what the Bank has to say on its next steps. In an ideal world, we think policymakers would like to hike rates again much sooner than markets are currently pricing (towards the end of 2019). But with Brexit uncertainty considerably ramping up, realistically we think the Bank will struggle to raise rates again before the UK leaves the EU next March.</p> <p>After Thursday, we currently don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anticipate another hike before May 2019.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b61725ee4b0353e1304fc95\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T08:43:22.623Z\">9.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The prospect of a trade war between the US and China is the biggest worry for UK manufacturers, says Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The dip in the [PMI] reading comes after an eventful month politically. But if manufacturers are not completely ignoring the Brexit uncertainty, they are nevertheless ploughing on regardless.</p> <p>If anything, the biggest current worry for a sector with so many exporters is the prospect of an all-out trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. The fear is that UK manufacturers become collateral damage in any tit-for-tat tariffs that are imposed at a time when firms are benefiting from their exposure to the still relatively buoyant global economy.</p> <p>The automotive industry is facing a particularly anxious time grappling as it is with weaker consumer sentiment, ambivalence towards diesel engines and uncertainty about those future trade arrangements. This is a real worry given the number of jobs and exports supported by the sector.</p> <p>But by contrast, UK aerospace enjoyed a good July, boosted by the Farnborough Airshow.

Overall production slowed, whilst new order growth took a leisurely pace, and it was the unbalanced reliance on export orders that kept the sector afloat with domestic clients keeping their distance. </p> <p>This general manufacturing malaise was compounded by a scarcity of essential raw materials and vendor delivery times lengthened at a pace not seen for ten months as supply chains stuttered and stumbled to meet contractual obligations. </p> <p>On the price front, firms raised client prices again in a bid to prevent another sudden increase in their own costs from gnawing away at hard-won profits. But, this strategy may not offer long-term solutions as uncertainty remains enemy no.1. Should operating conditions remain unchanged, this damp squib of a performance may persist and the UK has to look to other sectors to inject some vitality into its economic performance.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T09:23:48.300Z\">at 10.23am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b616f9fe4b0353e1304fc7b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T08:32:02.873Z\">9.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK manufacturing worse than expected</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories have performed slightly worse than forecast in July.</p> <p>IHS Markit/CIPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 54 last month, less than the 54.2 expected.

                "bodyText":"A host of manufacturing surveys for July showed a disappointing outcome for the UK, while eurozone growth was also sluggish. Over in the US factory growth slipped in July, while a jobs report was better than expected although it came with a warning on the outlook. The latest UK housing market report from Nationwide showed a 2.5% annual rise in July ahead of an expected Bank of England interest rate rise on Thursday. Overall markets were subdued after reports of an escalation in the trade dispute between the US and China, with President Trump said to be considering raising the existing 10% tariff on $200bn of imports from China to 25%. And following its positive results on Tuesday, Apple shares opened up 4.4%, pushing the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value close to a record $1tn. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. US factory growth dipped slightly in July, according to the latest manufacturing survey, partly due to falling exports and supply problems. The IHS Markit US manufacturing PMI came in at 55.3 last month, down from 55.4 and lower than the initial estimate of 55.5. Markit said: US manufacturing firms signalled a strong improvement in operating conditions in July, despite the headline PMI falling to a five-month low. Weaker rises in output and employment were seen in July, while export sales fell for the second month in a row. Meanwhile, companies reported the greatest deterioration in vendor performance since the series began and a faster rate of input cost inflation. That said, business confidence remained strongly positive, and was supported by hopes of further increases in overall new orders. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: The US manufacturing sector continued to expand in July, but shows increasing signs of struggling against headwinds of supply shortages, rising prices and deteriorating exports. The latest survey showed output rising at a rate roughly equivalent to an annualised 1% pace of expansion, which is the weakest since late last year. While a weakening of new export orders for a second successive month suggested foreign demand has waned compared to earlier in the year, the slowdown can be also in part attributed to increased difficulties in sourcing sufficient quantities of inputs. Suppliers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 delivery delays were more widespread than at any time in the survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history. With producers often scrambling to buy enough raw materials, suppliers enjoyed greater pricing power. Not surprisingly, with tariffs also kicking in, cost pressures spiked higher again. Some relief for manufacturers came from strong domestic demand, which meant firms were increasingly able to pass higher costs on to customers. Average prices charged for goods consequently rose at the steepest rate for seven years, which is likely to feed through to higher consumer prices in coming months. Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise has helped lift technology stocks on Wall Street, pushing the Nasdaq Composite 0.39% higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average - which also includes Apple - is marginally higher, up 0.04% while the S&amp;P 500 has opened 0.17% higher. Following its forecast-beating results and upbeat outlook, Apple shares have jumped 4.4% to $198.4. at the start of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading, helping support a US market rattled by renewed concerns about a damaging trade war between the US and China. The move means Apple is close to becoming the first company to be valued at $1tn. It would need to hit $203.25 to reach that level. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IG index on the expected opening for Wall Street: In pre-trading Apple shares are currently up around 4%, not quite enough so far to push it above a $1tn valuation. US private sector employers took on more workers than expected in July, according to a new report, partly due to this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hefty tax cuts. Ahead of the non-farm payroll numbers on Friday, ADP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment report showed a 219,000 increase in private sector jobs last month, compared to expectations of a 185,000 rise. Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of the ADP Research Institute, said: The labour market is on a roll with no signs of a slowdown in sight. Nearly every industry posted strong gains and small business hiring picked up. But there could be storm clouds ahead given President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariff plans and trade disputes. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Analytics which helped compile the report, said: The job market is booming, impacted by the deficit-financed tax cuts and increases in government spending. Tariffs have yet to materially impact jobs, but the multinational companies shed jobs last month, signalling the threat. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all good news for Apple despite its upbeat results and its approach towards a $1tn valuation. Samuel Gibbs reports: Huawei overtook Apple to become the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest smartphone seller behind Samsung in the second quarter, the first time in seven years that any contender has managed to split the top two. Multiple market analysts said that Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise came as the slowdown in China, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest market for smartphones, eased, with growing market share in Europe. Huawei failed in its recent bid to launch in the US after government action against companies deemed a security threat. Despite Apple being historically weak in the second quarter, analysts described the rise of Huawei as significant. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The importance of Huawei overtaking Apple this quarter cannot be overstated,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Canalys analyst Ben Stanton. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is the first time in seven years that Samsung and Apple have not held the top two positions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Our full report is here: The FTSE 100 has taken a turn for the worse in the course of the morning. Trade tensions are uppermost in investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds following reports that the US plans to raise the tariffs it plans of $200bn worth of imports from China from the original 10% to 25%. So commodity stocks are among the leading fallers on concerns that any slowdown in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy would hit the sector hard. Sharp falls in the likes of Next, Direct Line and Rio Tinto after their latest updates is also hitting the market, leaving the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index 1% or 77 points lower at 7671. So is this the day Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market value hits $1tn? All eyes will be on Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open to see how the better than expected results are received. Will investors push Apple higher or decide to take profits? Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, says: Apple shares leapt 4% in after-hours trade and are set to open at a record high just shy of the $200 level. Although it would be a bit of a stretch, a push up to the $1tn mark today is a possibility - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a matter of time before it achieves a valuation of $1tn. If it does, cue some big profit taking but it would be a moment to savour for Tim Cook. We need the share price to break $203 to hit $1tn in market cap \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a little more than $5 above the after-hours level at $197-$198. Rather like the Dow at 25k, you kind of get the feeling investors will conspire to nudge it over the line. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in FAANGs now I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see why you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rotate some equity out of more exposed companies like Facebook and Netflix and opt for relative safety in Apple, whose multiples remain well short of FAANG peers. What might weigh today is broader market fears about trade wars with China as the White House sets out fresh tariff plans on $200bn of Chinese goods. Tim Cook was pretty circumspect on trade and tariffs on the call. Results were very impressive with a beat on revenues and EPS. iPhone sales were a shade weaker than forecast but on a number of important fronts we saw excellent numbers. The FAANGs - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-owner Alphabet - and the wider technology sector have been under pressure in recent days after poor results from Facebook and Twitter. But Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures could give some badly needed support to the sector. The pound is not getting much help from the prospect of an interest rate rise on Thursday. Against the dollar it is down 0.05% at $1.3117, while against the euro is has edged up 0.05% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1229. The survey is positive about exports but less so about domestic demand, says Helena Sans, head of manufacturing at Barclays: A disappointing result for the manufacturing sector in July with PMI at a three-month low, although still firmly in positive territory. Of more concern is the weakest business confidence score for 21 months, indicating that the industry is desperate for a degree of clarity and progress on the Brexit negotiations and a better understanding of what the final outcome will mean for manufacturers. It looks like a tale of two markets at the moment, with export growth accelerating but domestic demand struggling to keep pace. Aside from the encouraging news for exporters, the only other real bright spot was more job growth, with two full years of consecutive monthly employment increases no mean feat. Following the weaker than expected UK manufacturing report, things are unlikely to improve in the immediate future, says ING Bank economist James Smith. But the downbeat survey is unlikely to discourage the Bank of England from raising interest rates on Thursday, he says: At 54.0, the latest UK manufacturing PMI is the lowest in three months and is a far cry from the levels seen towards the end of 2017. Weaker domestic demand saw new orders fall and the rate of output growth slip to the lowest in 16 months. Interestingly though, demand from abroad hit a six-month high, implying that firms are still reaping the rewards of better global growth, despite the recent moderation in Europe. But over coming months, life for manufacturers is unlikely to get any easier. The recent escalation in trade tensions is clearly a challenge, but increasingly the biggest headache for businesses is likely to be the threat of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit. This scenario would likely see huge congestion at ports and disruption to supply chains. While we suspect the probability of the UK leaving without an agreement in March next year is relatively low, an agreement may not come until late in the day. Until then, confidence could begin to fall as uncertainty increases \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the latest PMI suggests the degree of positive sentiment is already at a 21-month low. Having said all of that, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slip in the PMI is unlikely to faze Bank of England policymakers ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. Representing around 10% of output, manufacturing is a relatively small part of the UK growth mix. Importantly, the recent data flow \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly in the much larger service sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has largely backed up the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view that the economy has regained poise after the weak first quarter. For that reason, we think the Bank of England will increase interest rates this week. But the key thing to watch is what the Bank has to say on its next steps. In an ideal world, we think policymakers would like to hike rates again much sooner than markets are currently pricing (towards the end of 2019). But with Brexit uncertainty considerably ramping up, realistically we think the Bank will struggle to raise rates again before the UK leaves the EU next March. After Thursday, we currently don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anticipate another hike before May 2019. The prospect of a trade war between the US and China is the biggest worry for UK manufacturers, says Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking: The dip in the [PMI] reading comes after an eventful month politically. But if manufacturers are not completely ignoring the Brexit uncertainty, they are nevertheless ploughing on regardless. If anything, the biggest current worry for a sector with so many exporters is the prospect of an all-out trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. The fear is that UK manufacturers become collateral damage in any tit-for-tat tariffs that are imposed at a time when firms are benefiting from their exposure to the still relatively buoyant global economy. The automotive industry is facing a particularly anxious time grappling as it is with weaker consumer sentiment, ambivalence towards diesel engines and uncertainty about those future trade arrangements. This is a real worry given the number of jobs and exports supported by the sector. But by contrast, UK aerospace enjoyed a good July, boosted by the Farnborough Airshow. Bumper orders for the major aircraft manufacturers will help the small- and medium-sized businesses in their supply chains and the launch of the new Tempest fighter jet has the potential to safeguard thousands of highly-skilled jobs. The weaker than expected figures could give the Bank of England second thoughts if it really is planning to raise UK interest rates on Thursday, suggests IHS Markit director Rob Dobson: The financial markets still seem to have an interest rate increase nailed on for August. However, if the combination of weaker growth and a softening of pipeline cost pressures at manufacturers is mirrored in the larger service sector, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision will be far from unanimous and they may even yet find some cause for pause. The figure of 54 for July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK manufacturing PMI is a three month low, albeit that any number over 50 shows the sector is expanding. Markit said: The softer growth patch of the UK manufacturing sector continued at the start of the third quarter. July saw slower rates of expansion in both output and new orders, as weaker growth of new work from domestic sources offset a stronger increase in new export orders. Price pressures also remained elevated as a strong increase in average input costs led to the steepest rise in selling prices since February... July saw the degree of positive sentiment dip to a 21-month low, amid reports of uncertainty regarding both Brexit and the exchange rate. Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply which co-compiles the survey, said: There was a flatline feel to manufacturing this month, as the sector held its ground, but only just. Overall production slowed, whilst new order growth took a leisurely pace, and it was the unbalanced reliance on export orders that kept the sector afloat with domestic clients keeping their distance. This general manufacturing malaise was compounded by a scarcity of essential raw materials and vendor delivery times lengthened at a pace not seen for ten months as supply chains stuttered and stumbled to meet contractual obligations. On the price front, firms raised client prices again in a bid to prevent another sudden increase in their own costs from gnawing away at hard-won profits. But, this strategy may not offer long-term solutions as uncertainty remains enemy no.1. Should operating conditions remain unchanged, this damp squib of a performance may persist and the UK has to look to other sectors to inject some vitality into its economic performance. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories have performed slightly worse than forecast in July. IHS Markit/CIPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 54 last month, less than the 54.2 expected. This was lower than the June figure of 54.3, itself revised down from the initial estimate of 54.4. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s country by country manufacturing PMIs for July: The overall eurozone manufacturing sector was subdued in July, according to IHS Markit, and there could be worse to come. The final purchasing managers index edged up from 54.9 in June to 55.1 as trade tensions and rising prices dented optimism. The final figure was unchanged from the initial estimate, and follows disappointing second quarter eurozone GDP figures released on Tuesday. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: A marginal uptick in the PMI provides little cause for cheer given it is the second weakest number for more than one-and-a-half years. The past two months have seen the most subdued spell of factory output growth since late-2016. Worse may be to come. Even this reduced rate of output growth continued to outpace order book growth, resulting in the smallest rise in order book backlogs for two years. The clear implication is that manufacturers may have to adjust production down in coming months unless demand revives. Clues to the current soft patch lie in the export growth trend, which has deteriorated dramatically since the start of the year across all member states to reach a near-two year low, with France and Austria seeing exports fall into decline in July. The survey responses indicate that the slowdown likely reflects worries about trade wars, tariffs and rising prices, as well as general uncertainty about the economic outlook. Optimism about the future remained at one of the lowest levels seen over the past two years. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector recovered from June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 18 month low last month, albeit more slowly than initial estimates. IHS Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s purchasing managers index rose from 55.9 in June to 56.9, lower than the initial reading of 57.3. IHS Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economist Sian Jones said: The beginning of the second half of the year brought a faster rise in manufacturing growth among German manufacturers. Following a dip in overall performance in June, the upturn in output and new orders strengthened. That said, the increase in production continued to outpace that of new orders as firms expanded their efforts to clear backlogs. Although slightly weaker than June, employment growth continued to grow sharply, with greater production requirements a key factor behind sustained job creation. Panellists also reported stronger optimism towards future output growth, the most robust since April. Concerns were raised however, with some respondents noting uncertainty surrounding tariffs and further marked rises in input costs as risks to future growth. In turn, pressure on supply chains remained significant as firms continued to comment on bottlenecks at suppliers. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories did better in July than analysts had been expecting. IHS/Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing purchasing managers index climbed from 52.5 in June to 53.3, compared to an initial reading of 53.1. Output and new orders increased but exports fell back amid global trade tensions. IHS Markit economist Alex Gill said: July saw renewed growth momentum in the French manufacturing sector, with output and new orders rising at sharper rates, moving off their recent lows seen in June. Stronger client demand encouraged firms to take on additional staff, raise their purchasing activity and boosted hopes of further near-term growth. The only slight blip was a first fall in new export orders since September 2016, as global trade tensions hamper foreign demand. With trade tensions on the rise again, investors are in a cautious mood despite Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than expected results. The FTSE 100 is down 0.44%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has edged up 0.21% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.35%. Among the companies reporting, Lloyds Banking Group is leading the FTSE 100 risers, up 1.8% but Next is down nearly 6% despite a good second quarter as it expressed caution about the prospects for August sales. Among the mid-caps in the FTSE 250, BBA Aviation has slumped 15% after saying it expected \u00e2\u20ac\u0153modest growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd this year. Outsourcing group Capita is down 9.5% as it said its turnaround plan was on track after a collapse in profits but it would be a long road ahead. Commenting on the Nationwide house price index, Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, said: Two steps forward, one step back \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual rate of price growth has barely shifted from where it was a year ago. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tempting to see such a meandering market as the fruit of a cautious consensus. Instead it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a byproduct of the collision of three conflicting forces; pent-up demand, low supply and patchy confidence. With activity levels slowly picking up, the rising tension is creating some big regional anomalies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c making the national average as misleading as it is insipid. The future course of the market is balanced on a knife edge. With the Bank of England set to notch up interest rates tomorrow, the prospect of more expensive mortgages should jolt some previously hesitant buyers into action. Yet any extra impetus is likely to be immediate but ephemeral. By contrast, the forces holding back the market will get steadily stronger if the UK sleepwalks into a no-deal Brexit. If the prospect of Britain crashing out of the EU continues its shift from long shot to likely, the top end of the market could slip into full retreat as investment buyers go into lockdown. For everyone else, softening prices and better affordability will create buying opportunities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly for the bold and strategic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in what will become an increasingly fractured market. Signs of strength in the UK housing market. The Press Association reports: Annual house price growth accelerated in July as the average property value hit a new record high of \u00c2\u00a3217,010, according to an index. Across the UK, house prices were up by 2.5% annually in July, compared with a 2% annual increase in June, Nationwide Building Society said. House prices increased by 0.6% month on month in July - the second month of increases in a row following a 0.7% upturn in June. With speculation that the Bank of England base rate could edge up on Thursday from 0.5% to 0.75%, Nationwide said a 0.25 percentage point rise is likely to have only a modest immediate impact on borrowers, many of whom are locked into fixed-rate deals. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Providing the economy does not weaken further, the impact of a further small rise in interest rates on UK households is likely to be modest. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is partly because only a relatively small proportion of borrowers will be directly impacted by the change. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most lending on personal loans and credit cards is fixed or tends to be unaffected by movements in the bank rate. Similarly, in recent years, the vast majority of new mortgages have been extended on fixed interest rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But, he continued: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the impact for most borrowers is likely to be modest, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to note that household budgets have been under pressure for some time because wages have not been rising as fast as the cost of living. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Indeed, in real terms (after adjusting for inflation) wage rates are still at levels prevailing in 2005.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mr Gardner said that, overall, Nationwide continues to expect house prices to increase by 1% over the course of 2018. Here are IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening calls for European markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Will Apple become the first company in history to be valued at $1tn? The company reported better than expected results after the market closed on Tuesday, helped by strong sales of the higher-cost iPhone X profits jumped 32%, and its shares rose 4% in the after-market, putting it tantalisingly close to the magic $1tn figure. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: Traders breathed a sigh of relief as Apple reported strong earnings after the close, putting a spark back into the Nasdaq... What was there not to like about these numbers? This was the news that the markets had been hoping for; there had been concerns going into this release that the iPhone X numbers just weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to stack up, but that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the case and Apple has managed to pull it out of the bag again, proving why it should be the first trillion-dollar company. The final 7% lift in the share price required to hit that trillion-dollar level shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be so tough achieve after a set of figures like that. Here is our report on the Apple numbers: Elsewhere it is another big day for company results, with Lloyds Banking Group reporting a 23% rise in pre-tax profit and Next defying the current retail blues with a 2.8% increase in second quarter full-price sales, helped by the warm weather boosting demand for summer outfits. We will also get the first snapshot of how the manufacturing sector has performed in July, with PMI figures from the UK, Europe and US. China has already reported, with its manufacturing sector growing at the slowest pace in eight months, with exports declining amid trade tensions. The Caixin/Markit PMI fell from 51 in June to 50.8 last month. The UK numbers are also expected to see a slight dip, from 54.4 to 54.2. But any figure above 50 shows expansion, and the decline is unlikely to deter the Bank of England if it really wants to raise interest rates on Thursday. As for Europe, Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also set to be another important day for economic data especially in light of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing EU Q2 GDP numbers which came in unexpectedly lower than anticipated. For most of this year we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been told that the slowdown that we saw in Q1 was going to be temporary, and likely weather related. The weak Q2 French GDP numbers and yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker than expected EU numbers would appear to give the lie to that perception, and more worryingly inflation appears to be showing signs of picking up. This is likely to be a concern for the European Central Bank especially if we see no evidence that Q3 is gearing to pick up the slack, with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s July manufacturing PMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taking on a much greater importance in terms of looking for a rebound in economic activity after the weaker readings we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen so far this year. Early indications aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t particularly encouraging if last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flash numbers from Germany and France are any guide though Germany did show some improvement, which should be confirmed at 57.3. France slowed to 53.1, while Spain and Italy are also expected to do the same, coming in at 53.1 and 53 respectively, both lower than their June readings. Much later the US Federal Reserve will announce its latest rate decision, although no change is expected this month, with an increase more likely in September. Markets remain edgy, especially with the latest reports suggesting an escalation in the current trade tensions. The US is said to be considering increasing its 10% tariffs on $200bn worth of Chinese imports to 25%.

What did Apple have to offer?</p> <p>With hindsight, the answer is obvious. The iPod looked cool: it had a sleek aluminium shell half the size of its competitors, and a physical scroll wheel that could zoom through the trademark \u00e2\u20ac\u01531,000 songs in your pocket\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>By 2003 Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advertising agency, Chiat/Day, had come up with silhouette adverts to promote the iPod. The ads were almost too successful, turning the iPod\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s white earphones into such a marker of desirability that the Metropolitan police blamed them for a 26% rise in street robberies in 2005.</p> <p>The iPod revolutionised Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fortunes, kicking off a five-fold increase in its share price over the following five years, and providing a gateway drug for winning round Windows users to its Mac ecosystem. But it also changed the company on a fundamental level, turning it from a computer manufacturer into a consumer electronics designer.</p> <p>In January 2007, the company completed this transformation, announcing that it was changing its name from Apple Computer to Apple Inc. That same day, it also announced something else: the iPhone.</p> </blockquote> <p>More here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/macs-ipods-apps-how-apple-revolutionised-technology\">From Macs to iPods and apps: how Apple revolutionised technology</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b633b41e4b0353e13050d46\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-02T17:16:26.101Z\">6.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impressive track record over the years:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gallery/2018/aug/02/apples-six-defining-products-in-pictures\">Apple's six defining products - in pictures</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b633652e4b0353e13050d2d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-02T16:57:37.186Z\">5.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Apple has seen off plenty of critics on its march towards a trillion dollars, particularly in the 1990s when it was losing the Desktop PC battle to cheaper Windows machines. </p> <p>Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shira Ovide has some examples:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ShiraOvide/status/1025056028700889089\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Michael Dell in 1997, on what he&#39;d do if he were Apple&#39;s CEO: &quot;I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders.&quot; <br><br>(Years later, he&#39;d say that remark was misconstrued.)</p>&mdash; Shira Ovide (@ShiraOvide) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShiraOvide/status/1025056028700889089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 2, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ShiraOvide/status/1025057111955439617\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BusinessWeek, 1996: <a href=\"https://t.co/39wvd7M6AP\">pic.twitter.com/39wvd7M6AP</a></p>&mdash; Shira Ovide (@ShiraOvide) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShiraOvide/status/1025057111955439617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 2, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ShiraOvide/status/1025056915376807936\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Steve Ballmer in 2007, on Apple: &quot;There&#39;s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share.

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meteoric rise: Goodnight. GW Apple has beaten several tech rivals for the crown of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first trillion dollar company. At one stage it looked like Amazon could get their first, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently \u00e2\u20ac\u0153only\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd worth around $880bn. Alphabet, Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, is close behind with a market capitalisation of around $850bn. Facebook, though, dropped firmly out of the running after it slashed profitability forecasts last week. One important aspect about Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revival since its 1990s slump is that it started perfecting, rather than creating, new product types. Apple wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t first with a smartphone or a digital music player, but it created compelling devices that trumped what had gone before. Our tech writer Alex Hern explains: MP3 players already existed, such as Malda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nomad Jukebox, and they were technically better, with larger hard drives, replaceable batteries, and compatibility with both Windows and Mac (the iPod would take another year to come to Windows). What did Apple have to offer? With hindsight, the answer is obvious. The iPod looked cool: it had a sleek aluminium shell half the size of its competitors, and a physical scroll wheel that could zoom through the trademark \u00e2\u20ac\u01531,000 songs in your pocket\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. By 2003 Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advertising agency, Chiat/Day, had come up with silhouette adverts to promote the iPod. The ads were almost too successful, turning the iPod\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s white earphones into such a marker of desirability that the Metropolitan police blamed them for a 26% rise in street robberies in 2005. The iPod revolutionised Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fortunes, kicking off a five-fold increase in its share price over the following five years, and providing a gateway drug for winning round Windows users to its Mac ecosystem. But it also changed the company on a fundamental level, turning it from a computer manufacturer into a consumer electronics designer. In January 2007, the company completed this transformation, announcing that it was changing its name from Apple Computer to Apple Inc. That same day, it also announced something else: the iPhone. More here: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impressive track record over the years: Apple has seen off plenty of critics on its march towards a trillion dollars, particularly in the 1990s when it was losing the Desktop PC battle to cheaper Windows machines. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shira Ovide has some examples: Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise to become America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most valuable publicly quoted firm began more than 40 years ago, when Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak began a company that would help kickstart and drive the computer revolution. Today, the firm behind the Macintosh, the iMac, the iPhone and the App Store is now worth more than Exxon Mobil, Procter &amp; Gamble (PG.N) and AT&amp;T put together. Reuters points out how the return of the late Steve Jobs two decades ago was crucial: . One of three founders, Jobs was driven out of Apple in the mid-1980s, only to return a decade later and rescue the computer company from near bankruptcy. He launched the iPhone in 2007, dropping \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Computer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name and super-charging the cellphone industry, catching Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O), Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Nokia off guard. That put Apple on a path to overtake Exxon Mobil in 2011 as the largest U.S. company by market value. The Silicon Valley stalwart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock has surged more than 50,000 percent since its 1980 initial public offering, dwarfing the S&amp;P 500\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approximately 2,000-percent increase during the same almost four decades. During that time, Apple evolved from selling Mac personal computers to becoming an architect of the mobile revolution with a cult-like following. More here. Newsflash: Apple has become the first US listed company to be worth one trillion dollars. The technology giant hit a $1 trillion market cap as its shares rallied following strong earnings results earlier this week. Apple shares jumped 3% to hit a session high of $207.05 , enough to reach the magic $1trn figure. More to follow.... Richard Flax, Chief Investment Officer at Moneyfarm, thinks today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise is hard to justify: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fact the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted in favour of a hike itself is notable. At the last meeting in June, the MPC voted by 6-3 to keep rates where they are. If anything, since then the case for rate hikes has gotten weaker not stronger. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t require too much cynicism to see the unanimous vote as some sort of message. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank and its governor are in an unenviable position - with a combination of low interest rates, low unemployment / low wage growth, sluggish economic growth, declining inflation and massive policy uncertainty around Brexit. They clearly want to normalise interest rate policy if they can - but the data hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t made it easy to justify.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reuters agrees... Higher interest rates will eat into the profits of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s buy-to-let lenders. Paul Haywood-Schiefer of accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise is a blow to the sector: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For many people who were getting no return on their capital due to long term low interest rates and decided to invest in buy to let properties this will be another blow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They wanted to get better returns and for many it was also part of their retirement plans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One solution is to push up rents, of course. And one controversial buy-to-let landlord has swiftly passed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise onto new tenants. Fergus Wilson, who owns hundreds of properties across Ashford and Maidstone in Kent, has announced: Following the interest rate rise I have increased rents in all our properties by \u00c2\u00a350 per month (fifty pounds). It is merely passing onto the tenant the additional mortgage charge. This increase starts immediately. I think this will only apply to new tenants, or when existing tenancies come up for renewal. Wilson was heavily criticised by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equality watchdog last year, as we reported: The buy-to-let mogul Fergus Wilson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ban on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coloured\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tenants because they allegedly left curry smells in his properties has been overturned in a court victory for the Equality and Human Rights Commission. At Maidstone county court, the judge, Richard Polden, granted an injunction against the landlord. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This policy clearly amounts to discrimination,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Polden said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I find the policy is unlawful. Such a policy has no place in our society.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ed Hall, director at law firm Gowling WLG, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise could hurt the economy, if it spooks consumers and businesses: Given that a quarter point rise is perceived to have a limited long-term impact on most business, the move would seem to make sense in terms of longer term strategy. However, in a period of increasing political and economic uncertainty, it can be argued that this move could damage confidence in what could be perceived as an already fragile economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Charles Hepworth, investment director at GAM, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153punchy move\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, given the uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU: Growth in the economy could hardly be described as above trend so members may have realised that this could be the last chance to move ahead before reaching the final Brexit end state. In any case the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response in a few months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time could look very different should the Brexit cliff edge slip nearer despite them saying more hikes will be needed. The currency markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t totally buying the hawkish message otherwise the pound would be rising, which it most certainly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Indeed. As you can see, the pound has dropped to its lowest level since 20th July today - not the move you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect after a rate hike. UK interest rates won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise again until at least March 2019, predicts Dean Turner, UK Economist at UBS Wealth Management. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to see further moves from the Bank ahead of Britain leaving the EU. Monetary policy is unlikely to be the key driver for sterling in the markets in the short term, as the spotlight returns to the Brexit saga. The real surprise is that all nine Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers voted to raise interest rates today. Before noon, many experts were predicting an 8-1 split, or even 7-2, with the most dovish MPC members pushing to keep rates on hold. Our Larry Elliott suggests the data doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t support such unanimity: Threadneedle Street has been overestimating wage inflation for years, and the former MPC member and labour market expert David Blanchflower says it is still doing so [something Carney rejected earlier] Recent official data has shown growth in total pay falling not rising. The economy, despite bouncing back in the second quarter, is far from booming. Retail sales were weak in June, the housing market is dead and inflation is coming back toward its 2% target more quickly than the Bank expected. In such circumstances, it is strange, even a little troubling, that not one MPC member opposed a rate hike. The inflation report makes it sound as if higher interest rates are a no-brainer. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a lot riskier than the Bank appears to think. Jon Ostler, UK CEO at price comparison site Finder.com, says savers need to be proactive to benefit from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s particularly good news for savers, who have suffered ultra-low interest rates for the past decade. They can expect a rise to their savings, albeit a small one. Now is a good time to consider switching your banking products, as banks will be reviewing their rates. Make sure you keep an eye on which banks are offering the best interest rates as not all of their products will increase by the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 25 basis points. Mortgage holders, and other borrowers, face a hit, through, he adds: For example, those paying off the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s average mortgage debt with a variable rate mortgage face paying an extra \u00c2\u00a317-\u00c2\u00a318 per month, which adds up to an extra \u00c2\u00a3200 per year or more than \u00c2\u00a36,000 over the life of a 30-year loan term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Time for a quick recap. The Bank of England has raised UK interest rates for only the second time since the financial crisis, despite concerns that Brexit could hurt the economy. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously to raise borrowing costs to 0.75%, from 0.5%, arguing that a modest increase is needed to keep inflation on target. Governor Mark Carney has defended the move. He told reporters that the economy is in a much healthier place than August 2016, when the BoE cut rates from 0.5% to 0.25%. Carney argued that: UK households were well-prepared for the rise, and that the poorest families would suffer most if the Bank allowed inflation to spike. The Bank was ready for all possibly Brexit outcomes, including Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal Monetary policy needed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153walk, not run\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to keep inflation on target and the economy growing. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a hint that future rate rises will be modest. Banks might not pass the entire increase onto savers The Bank might actually CUT rates, if Brexit negotiations go badly. The move has received a mixed reception, with business leaders criticising it and debt charities fearing that poor families will be dragged into financial difficulties. There is relief in the City that the Bank didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back away from pushing the button, having given plenty of hints that rates would rise today. But... Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious words have hit sterling; the pound is still in the red against the dollar, at $1.3050. Balraj Sroya, Sales Trader at Foenix Partners, explains why: Today the Bank of England defied Brexit uncertainty and brought music to the ears of Sterling bulls as the MPC voted unanimously to increase interest rates to 0.75%. Unfortunately, Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally higher was halted by the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd stating that the monetary policy needs to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153walk, not run, to stand still\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as the interest rates\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 natural level rises gradually. And finally, an important but technical question from the Financial Times. Q: does the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low estimate of the equilibrium level of interest rates (R*) means that quantitative easing is becoming a standard tool of economy policy, rather than just for emergencies? [explainer: if R* is really between zero and 1% today, as the Bank believes, rates might never get high enough to allow the Bank to start selling off the \u00c2\u00a3435bn of bonds it bought through QE during the crisis to stimulate the economy]. Mark Carney says this is a good question, to which he gives a long answer. The upshot is that Bank still expects to start unwinding QE when rates have risen to 1.5%. So if R* rises towards 2-3%, then this plan would still hold. Upshot: the MPC does not expect to keep holding its QE assets on its balance sheet indefinitely. Back on Brexit, and Mark Carney is defending the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach over the last two years. After the referendum, the BoE decided to take the hit in higher inflation (by cutting rates) rather than pushing unemployment up (by raising rates to strengthen the pound), he says. Q: But wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it be better to have waited a few months until we know how Brexit will pan out? No, governor Carney replies. We need a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmodest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 adjustment to policy now because wages are rising faster than inflation. He then explains that rates could rise, stay on hold, or even be cut depending how UK-EU negotiations play out. There are a wide range of Brexit outcomes, but in many of them interest rates will be at least as high as they are today. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to keep our powder dry for that. There are certain circumstances where it would be appropriate to either keep rates the same or lower them. If that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the case, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what the MPC will do. It would be a mistake to wait, wait, wait until you have perfect certainty, because you never know when that point will arise, he concludes. Q: What do you say to business groups who think this rate rise is a mistake? We have a good sense of the challenges faced by British businesses, Carney replies. The Bank knows that this has been the shallowest investment recovery in decades. But...the overwhelming issue for businesses is the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. They should be confident that we will focus on our responsibilities, keeping inflation on target while ensuring the economy is prepared for whatever the outcome is. Christopher Vecchio of DailyFX says Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious guidance on future rate rises is hitting the pound. On trade wars, Carney says the tariffs imposed by the US, China and Europe on each others imports are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of the reasons that global growth is little weaker.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Bank doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see a material impact on the UK economy, yet, but it would be hurt by a slump in global confidence and investment. Mark Carney is now giving a long explanation about the equilibrium interest rate in the UK (known as R*). This is the level at which interest rates should be set to ensure the economy stays at an even keel. The Bank has estimated today that R* is zero to 1 percent, more than 2 percentage points below its pre-financial crisis level. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because UK productivity, fiscal headwinds and economic uncertainty are all pulling R* down. If they improve, R* could move closer to the 2-3% range, Carney explains. Danny Blanchflower has hit back at Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jibe, pointing out that UK wage growth has slowed recently - and is nowhere near 3% per year today. Our economics editor Larry Elliott goes next. Q: The Bank thinks the natural rate of unemployment is 4.25% (slightly above the current rate of 4.2%), which is why you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve raised interest rates. But some experts disagree; former MPC member professor Danny Blanchflower thinks it could be 3%. Why is he wrong, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right? Where do I begin, mutters Mark Carney (somewhat recklessly), before adding that he has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great respect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Prof B, but his time on the MPC has passed. Carney then explains that policymakers need to reorientate to new reality. He points out that labour cost growth is rising, and productivity growth remains disappointing, thus the UK needs higher borrowing costs to keep inflation on target. [historical note: Danny Blanchflower called, in vain, for UK interest rate cuts before the financial crisis struck, when the rest of the MPC was more worried about inflation] Q: Will this rate rise be passed onto savers, and what will the Bank do to help on this? Mark Carney says that savers have suffered over the course of the last decade from the absolutely necessary low interest rates. But he then suggests that banks might not pass today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise on in full. H explains that when rates hit record lows after the crisis, the spread between bank lending and borrowing rates were compressed. (That ate into bank profitability, so they will want to repair that by raising borrowing costs more than saving rates). As rates move up, one should expect more of them to be passed along, Carney adds. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden weighs in, saying: Historically you never get full pass-though of interest rate changes. Q: Surely poorest households are going to suffer from this rate rise? Mark Carney rebuts this, arguing that the Bank has a responsibility to keep inflation under control. The households that are most affected by high or volatile inflation, and most likely to be out of work, unfortunately, are poorer households. The best thing we can do is keep inflation sustainably on target, and keep the economy on track, he adds. Ouch! Sterling has just dropped against the US dollar, and is now down a whole cent at $1.303. The selloff began as Mark Carney explains that monetary policy needs to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153walk not run to stand still\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as the natural level of interest rates slowly rises. That looks like a hint that borrowing costs will not rise sharply in the next couple of years. Onto questions: Q: Are households ready for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise, particularly the poorest? Governor Carney says the Bank of England has been saying for a while that interest rates will go up, at a modest rate. That \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcforward guidance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was meant to give households and businesses clarity. And it worked, Carney says, with three-quarters of households expecting interest rate to go up over the next year. The important thing to recognise is that UK households have worked hard over the last decade to get into a better financial position, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve paid down debt and put themselves in a better position to service their debts. It would take another 100 basis point increase (to 1.75%) to bring the UK debt servicing burden back to the historic average. There is a lot more capacity for UK households to service their debts, Carney concludes. He also cited new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmortgage affordability\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tests that are meant to prevent reckless borrowing. Mark Carney insists that the Bank of England is well prepared for a wide range of Brexit outcomes. The banking system has enough money to keep lending through a cliff-edge Brexit, however unlikely that will be, the governor says. We are working with the Treasury and the European Central Bank to address risks that the banks can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t solve themselves, he adds. Onto Brexit. Mark Carney says that talks between the UK and the EU are at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153critical period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Households have been resilient but not indifferent to Brexit uncertainty, he adds, but there are signs that business confidence is softening again. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts are based on a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrelatively smooth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd transition period, the governor points out (implying it could take action if we end up with a No-Deal Brexit). Carney signals that further interest rate rises will be needed. If interest rates stay at 0.75%, then inflation will be over the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target over the next three years, he explains. Mark Carney says UK exporters are in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a sweet spot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with sterling down 17% compared to its pre-Brexit levels. He adds that the UK labour market is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with signs that earnings growth will accelerate later this year. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is giving a press conference now. Carney begins by referencing a famous quote from Harold Wilson, saying: If a week is a long time in politics, then two years is an eternity in monetary policy. He reminds us that the Bank cut borrowing costs to a record low of 0.25%, after the Brexit vote. Back in 2016, there was substantial spare capacity in the economy, business confidence was its lowest since the financial crisis, and inflation was due to overshoot its target \u00e2\u20ac\u0153entirely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd due to Brexit fears which had driven the pound down. Now, though, the economy is strong enough to justify an interest rate rise to 0.75%. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, says Mark Carney and colleagues have taken a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bold move\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by raising borrowing costs today. By early 2019, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll know if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right, he adds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank has so clearly telegraphed this rate rise that markets would have been shocked had rates been left on hold. The unanimity of the decision probably reflects the view that the UK is, quite simply, running out of spare capacity. But sub-trend growth and a cloudy outlook hardly make a compelling case for a higher UK rates. In six months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time this decision will look either prescient or premature. Either way it is bold move.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Oof! Suren Thiru, Head of Economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), says the Bank of England was wrong to raise interest rates today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decision to raise interest rates, while expected, looks ill-judged against a backdrop of a sluggish economy. While a quarter point rise may have a limited long-term financial impact on most businesses, it risks undermining confidence at a time of significant political and economic uncertainty. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The increase reinforces a concerning aspect of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent approach to monetary policy, which appears to be overly focused on reinforcing an idealised direction for rates, rather than on economic reality \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an approach that unnecessarily risks UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth prospects. The central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assumption that the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speed limit has slowed is unduly pessimistic, as sustained action to fix the fundamentals at home, from closing the skills gap to greater infrastructure investment, would materially help lift the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth potential. Thiru hopes the Bank won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raise borrowing costs again anytime soon: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The MPC must carefully consider what happens next. The most preferential option would be for a sustained period of monetary stability amid the current economic and political uncertainty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Simon Underwood, business recovery partner at accountancy firm, Menzies LLP, fears that this rate rise will hurt businesses - especially those reliant on consumer spending. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The MPC may have been swayed by the summer heatwave and England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success in the World Cup, which have had a positive impact on consumer behaviour, boosting retail sales temporarily. However, it is unlikely this positive sentiment will be maintained and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to increase rates will impact consumer spending ahead of the critical final quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For businesses serving consumers in the retail and hospitality &amp; leisure sectors, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision will be very unwelcome news and we should expect more turmoil on the high street in the short to medium term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd My colleague Richard Partington reports from the Bank of England: The Bank of England has raised interest rates above the emergency level introduced straight after the financial crisis, despite mounting fears over Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal. Signalling the gradual return of higher borrowing costs, Threadneedle Street raised interest rates to 0.75% from 0.5% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the level they were dropped to in March 2009 as the economy lurched through the last recession. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee judged the economy could withstand higher interest rates, which it believes are required to curb persistently high inflation above its 2% target set by the government. An extra 0.25% interest will add \u00c2\u00a312 a month to a \u00c2\u00a3100,000 repayment mortgage and \u00c2\u00a325 on a \u00c2\u00a3200,000 loan. However, nearly 70% of homebuyers now have fixed rate mortgages so will be unaffected. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our Q&amp;A on how higher UK interest rates will affect you: Although today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise is modest, it will hurt families who are already forced to borrow to pay for the essentials. Phil Andrew, chief executive at StepChange Debt Charity, says politicians need to provide more help to theses households: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whilst a rise in interest rates might be right for the wider economy, from a consumer debt perspective many households are walking a precarious budget tightrope, as their incomes don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stretch to cover the basics each month. These are the households that a rate rise will affect most. Policymakers mustn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lose sight of what a rate rise means for real people on a tight budget. The fact that the wider economy can cope doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always mean individual households can. Government and policymakers need to take parallel steps to ensure support is there for those who are negatively affected, especially if more rate rises are coming.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I mentioned earlier this morning that Mark Carney was known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for failing to stick to his promises. Calum Bennie, savings specialist at Scottish Friendly, thinks the governor has turned over a new leaf by raising rates today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise means that Mark Carney has probably shaken off his tag of being the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for good. While the decision indicates the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is picking up steam, it also means higher borrowing costs, so households must be even more prudent to absorb the additional cost. The move is good news for savers but still cash account rates are unlikely to beat inflation, so stocks and shares Isas remain better for those looking to grow their savings long-term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much reaction in the financial markets to the rate hike - which figures, as it was widely expected. The pound has clawed back some of its losses, but is still slightly lower against the US dollar today at $1.31. Shares are still being pummelled by those trade war fears, leaving the FTSE 100 down 93 points or 1.2%. The Bank of England has hinted that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in no rush to raise interest rates again in the coming months. It say that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153any future increases in Bank Rate are likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Bank of England also has also warned that Brexit could damage the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery: The MPC continues to recognise that the economic outlook could be influenced significantly by the response of households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal. The Bank of England says it is raising interest rates because the economy has recovered from its slowdown during last snowy winter. The minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting says: Recent data appear to confirm that the dip in output in the first quarter was temporary, with momentum recovering in the second quarter. The labour market has continued to tighten and unit labour cost growth has firmed. The MPC continues to judge that the UK economy currently has a very limited degree of slack. Unemployment is low and is projected to fall a little further. The BoE also points out that prices are rising faster than its target (2%), so it is raising borrowing costs to squeeze inflation. CPI inflation was 2.4% in June, pushed above the 2% target by external cost pressures resulting from the effects of sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s past depreciation and higher energy prices. The contribution of external pressures is projected to ease over the forecast period while the contribution of domestic cost pressures is expected to rise. Every member of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nine-strong monetary policy committee voted to raise interest rates. NEWSFLASH: The Bank of England has voted to raise UK interest rates to their highest level in almost a decade. The BoE is raising Bank rate to 0.75%, from 0.5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level since March 2009, and only the second rise since the financial crisis struck a decade ago. More to follow! An interest rate rise would obviously be a blow to borrowers, as it would push up the cost of repaying debts. This chart from Resolution Foundation shows how a rise to 0.75% would force a small number of mortgage owners to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctake action\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in some way: Back in June, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MPC was split six-three -- with a trio of policymakers voting to raise interest rates. Danielle Haralambous, UK Analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts that the majority will vote to hike today, but it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a 9:0 win for the hawks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect the MPC to raise the policy rate to 0.75% today, although it is unlikely to be a unanimous vote. Some of the economic data has softened in recent months, notably core inflation and wage growth, which may prevent some MPC members from changing their vote in favour of higher interest rates. Our economics correspondent, Richard Partington, explains why the Bank of England will (probably) raise borrowing costs today: Inflation has remained stubbornly above the 2% target set for the Bank by the government, after having risen sharply straight after the EU referendum result. Some rate setters on the MPC, including the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Andy Haldane, also believe wage growth is just around the corner for workers, amid the lowest levels of unemployment since the mid 1970s, a factor that could help boost workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bargaining power for higher pay. The summer heatwave, royal wedding and England progressing to the semi-final of the World Cup helped boost the economy, triggering stronger retail sales in April and May before they unexpectedly fell back in June. The Office for National Statistics found that the warmer weather helped the economy rebound from a slowdown earlier this year after heavy snowfall from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beast from the east\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More here: Tension is rising in the City, with around 30 minutes to wait until the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision. Traders broadly expect borrowing costs to rise at noon today, to a nine-year high of 0.75%. But this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t giving the pound any love. Sterling is still bobbing at a two-week low against the dollar, with some investors speculating that the Bank could dampen expectations of further interest rate rises any time soon. John Goldie, FX Strategist at Argentex, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank of England are firmly expected to raise rates this lunch time, only the second hike since 2007. However, most commentators are expecting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dovish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hike with perhaps some dissenters within the committee (one or two may vote to keep rates on hold still) and/or the statements to play down further hiking expectations in the near term. Plus, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discount the possibility that the Bank sits on its hands again. But that would badly hurt its credibility, given its recent guidance that a rate rise is close. Sue Kershaw, managing director of major project advisory at KPMG, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders benefitted from the hot summer, but warns that Brexit could derail the recovery seen last month. She writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Seeing housebuilding come back to good health is hugely positive. As the longstanding driver of activity, the weakening demand we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d seen in recent months did cause some concern and raised questions as to whether residential construction had peaked and was heading for a steady decline. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But supply chain and cost pressures still remain a cause for concern. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing input costs continue to creep up and the outcome of Brexit negotiations is still far from clear. Those with infrastructure arms will also be concerned about the sluggish-looking civil engineering market, traditionally quite a reliable source of activity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Phil Harris, Director at BLP Insurance, fears that the collapse of the merger between shopping centre groups Hammerson and Intu could hurt construction. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153July was another strong month for commercial activity but the sector remains vulnerable to volatility. British retailers continue to close shops at a pace and the full impact of shopping centre developer, Hammerson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failed takeover of rival Intu may have yet to be fully felt. With many predicting the closure of more Hammerson sites, growth in July may prove a false dawn.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brendan Sharkey, head of construction and real estate at accountancy firm MHA MacIntyre Hudson, points out that Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock collapse in January has caused less damage than feared. However, a hard Brexit might not be shaken off as easily: Construction has been relatively slow to wake up to the dangers posed by Brexit. Given the industry doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t depend on exports, the potential pitfalls of a no-deal Brexit have perhaps been easier to overlook. Yet construction does depend on the import of raw materials, and crucially on the free movement of labour. Over the next few months we will see more focus on contingency planning and demand for additional information and support from the government. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The consequences of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse were over-hyped but only a very foolhardy captain of industry can assume the same will be true about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: China has hit back at America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threats to impose steep tariffs on its goods (see earlier post). Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commerce ministry has told reporters it is fully prepared to fight back, if America delivers on Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose 25% tariffs. This is driving financial markets deeper into the red. The FTSE 100 is now down 80 points, with mining stocks leading the selloff. Trivia corner: UK interest rate have never been pegged at 0.75%, since the Bank of England was established in 1694. Back in July 2007, the BoE raised interest rates to 5.75% just as the credit crunch began. It was began cutting as the financial crisis kicked in, including a monster Bank Rate cut from 4.5% to 3% in November 2008. In March 2009 it halved borrowing costs to 0.5%, where they remained until the Brexit vote prompted a cut to 0.25%, which was reversed in November 2017. The pick-up in building activity in July will reassure the Bank of England, as it suggest the construction sector could handle higher borrowing costs. However, yesterday we heard that manufacturing growth slowed a little last month, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mixed picture. The opposition Labour party is concerned that consumers will be hurt by higher borrowing costs. John McDonnell MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chancellor, has warned that higher interest rates will push more people into debt: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With wages still below 2010 levels and the gap between people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s income and outgoings at record levels, the concern must be that a pattern of interest rate rises will push more families into higher levels of debt. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government needs to end its counterproductive austerity programme and raise people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incomes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey of purchasing managers at UK construction firms: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders achieved an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153impressive turnaround\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in July, says Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit. He sees several signs that the construction sector has strengthened this summer: New business volumes expanded at the strongest rate since May 2017, while workforce numbers increased to the greatest extent for just over two- and-a-half years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153House building was the bright spot for construction growth in July, alongside a stronger upturn in commercial development projects. Residential activity and commercial work both increased at the sharpest pace since December 2015, which contrasted with another subdued month for civil engineering. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector has recorded its fastest growth in 14 months. Data firm Markit reports that builders picked up pace in July, led by a surge in housebuilding. This pushed Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI, which measures growth in the sector, up to 55.8 from 53.1. Anything over 50 shows growth, and this is the highest reading since May 2017. Housebuilders reported the strongest pick-up in growth since the end of 2015. More to follow.... Stock markets around the globe are sliding today, thanks to the threat of a US-China trade war. Investors have been spooked by the news that the Trump administration is considering a 25% tariff on $200bn of Chinese imports - previously it had been planning a 10% levy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest shot in an increasingly bitter and protracted trade spat between Washington and Beijing. CNN explains: The United States has already slapped 25% tariffs on Chinese goods worth $34 billion to punish Beijing for what it says are its unfair trade practices, such as forcing American companies to hand over valuable technology. China immediately responded with equal measures. In the latest step, President Donald Trump has directed US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to consider increasing the proposed tariff level on fruit and vegetables, handbags, refrigerators, and more. The trade office has extended its previous deadline of Aug. 30 to allow the public more time to comment on the new plan. Those comments are now due on September 5. In London the FTSE 100 has shed 32 points, or 0.4%, to 7620, its lowest level in over two weeks. There are heavier falls across Europe, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX shedding 1.3%. Over in Asia, the Chinese markets have tumbled by around 2%. Other markets also in the red as traders fear an escalating trade dispute will hurt growth and exports across the region. Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale says the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision is the main event of the day: Bloomberg polled 58 forecasts...10 expect no change, and 48 expect a 25 basis point hike (including us). Sterling meanwhile, continues to bump along the bottom of its historic trade-weighted range. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t nearly enough good news in a much-anticipated rate hike to propel it higher, but the downside is limited. An interest rate rise today would be risky, argues our economics editor Larry Elliott. He points out that many UK households are struggling, meaning incomes are lagging spending for the first time in three decades. Households are not borrowing because they are brimful of confidence. In many cases they are borrowing to make ends meet. The MPC knows this and will go out if its way to reassure consumers and businesses that any further policy tightening will be both modest and gradual. Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise is supposed to prevent wage inflation from taking off, underpin sterling and boost the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credibility without harming growth. The next eight months will see Brexit negotiations come to a climax and the inevitable period of uncertainty means this is the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last opportunity to raise rates for some time. Yet the fact remains that this is an ill-timed and risky venture, not least for the millions overburdened with debt. The pound will tumble if the Bank of England leaves interest rates on hold today, says Miles Eakers of global payments, FX and Treasury management firm Centtrip: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A hawkish hike will boost the Pound but only for the short term. That said, Mark Carney may catch market participants off-guard again and not increase rates, which will weaken the Pound substantially and could fall as low as its yearly nadir of $1.2956 or even below. Even if the BoE does hike, the Brexit negotiations are still under way, keeping the Pound under pressure for the foreseeable future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound is dropping this morning, as the City braces for the Bank of England interest rate decision at noon. Sterling has lost half a cent against the US dollar to $1.3068, its lowest in nearly two weeks. Normally you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect a currency to rally when interest rates go up. But there may be some anxiety over whether the Bank will actually do the deed today. Traders may also be anticipating a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdovish hike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - the BoE could raise borrowing costs to 0.75%, but hint that the next rise is a long way away. This chart shows how sterling has struggled, even as an August rate hike looked more likely. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, suspects uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is hurting the pound: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThursday could be a hugely symbolic day if the Bank of England decides to raise interest rates above 0.5% for the first time since the financial crisis. However it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually change too much on the ground. Markets are already expecting a rise, and from here on in, further hikes are going to be few and far between because UK economic growth is so fragile. We could see some reaction from sterling though, which has remained resolutely weak against the dollar, despite rising expectations of a rate rise. That probably reflects the fact that economic data hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been resoundingly positive in the lead up to this interest rate decision, plus of course the prospect of a no-deal Brexit has raised its head in recent weeks. He also points out that rates could yet be cut, if the economy falters. Even though rates are very low and will remain so for the foreseeable future, they can still move down if there is an economic shock to the system. Few people thought rates would ever be cut from 0.5%, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exactly what happened following the EU referendum result. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With Love Island finally off our screens, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favourite unreliable boyfriend to show if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mended his ways, or is as fickle as ever. The Bank of England will announce today whether UK interest rates are going up, for only the second time in a decade. The City widely expects a hike, after governor Mark Carney declared last month that the economy seems to have recovered from its slowdown at the start of 2018. The City is pricing a 91% chance of an interest rate rise today. That would take borrowing costs up to 0.75% today -- their highest level since March 2009 (but still low in historic terms). But traders are edgy. Carney has a long track record of capriciousness \u00e2\u20ac\u201c promising that a rate hike is imminent only to back away when the big day arrives. So there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a possibility that the Bank will shy away from pressing that rate hike button today. The decision is unlikely to be unanimous, as some monetary policy committee members are concerned that the economy may not be strong enough to handle higher borrowing costs. Kathleen Brooks of Capital Index explains: The market is currently expecting an 8-1 split in favour of a hike, with Sir Jon Cunliffe the only member expected to dissent and vote against a hike. However, if we get more MPC members voting against a hike then sterling could come under pressure, as it would suggest a future dovish stance by the BOE. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s four years since Labour MP Pat McFadden gave Carney his \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tag, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a title the governor appreciates. He would argue that businesses and households have understood his message -- that interest rates will rise at a modest pace as the recovery allows. Also coming up Data firm Markit will report how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector performed last month. Economists predict that growth slowed, as the bounceback after the winter freeze fades. Trade war fears are weighing on the markets again. There are reports that Donald Trump is considering slapping a 25% tariff on Chinese imports into the US, which would have a hefty impact on world trade.

                "bodyText":"And finally...here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Richard Partington on the escalating US-China trade war. China has unveiled plans to impose retaliatory tariffs on US imports worth $60bn (\u00c2\u00a346bn), firing the latest volley in the mounting trade dispute between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. Signalling the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s readiness to respond to the higher tariffs threatened by Donald Trump on $200bn of Chinese imports, officials in Beijing said countermeasures were ready and waiting for the next move from Washington. The Chinese finance ministry said 5,207 goods imported from the US could be subjected to the fresh tariffs, with levies ranging from 5% to 25% on products including aircraft, soya bean oil, smoked beef, coffee and flour. The move comes after Trump asked US trade officials to consider imposing a 25% tariff on $200bn of Chinese goods, up from the 10% level originally proposed last month, as the two countries attempt to reach an agreement on trade. China said at the time blackmail would not work and that it would hit back. Speaking just hours after China unveiled the countermeasures on Friday, Larry Kudlow, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economic adviser, said the US president was willing to follow through with his threats, in a stark warning to Beijing. Calling the Chinese economy weak from the lawn of the White House in an interview with Bloomberg TV, Kudlow said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The president has said time and again, that targeted tariffs are going to be part of the gameplan with China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unless, and until, they begin to meet our requests, and so far they have not. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They better not underestimate President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s determination to follow through on our asks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: So, with the US stock market up a bit (the Dow has gained 99 points or 0.3% to 25,425 points), that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Goodnight! GW Bad news for European consumers - the cost of vegetables, bread and even beer is being driven up by the hot summer. With crops struggling in the fields, supermarkets are finding it hard to get produce - so the law of supply and demand is kicking in..... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Ed Helmore on the latest US employment data: The London stock market has closed higher this afternoon, despite the latest trade war tensions. The blue-chip FTSE 100 gained 83 points, or 1.1%, to finish at 7,659 points. The French and German markets also gained around 0.5%, even though their economies could be hit in a trade war. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says traders shrugged off the tariff threat: Despite Beijing preparing its own retaliatory \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimport tax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on $60 billion of US goods if Trump goes ahead with his planned tariffs on $200 billion of products from China, the markets managed to continued their end of week rebound on Friday. UK shares benefitted from the weaker pound, he points out: Sterling spending the day sporadically ducking under $1.30 against the dollar following July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing services PMI and Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat that chances of a no-deal Brexit are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcuncomfortably high\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Larry Kudlow has reportedly cocked a snook at China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation: China can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually retaliate like-for-like, though, as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total imports from America don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t add up to $200bn Just in: Growth across America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector has dropped to its lowest level in almost a year, and trade wars are getting the blame. The Institute of Supply Management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly healthcheck on the sector has dropped to 55.7 in July, from 59.1 in June. Any reading over 50 shows growth, but this is a sharp monthly decline. Some service sector managers said the trade war with China is hurting their businesses One said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business is up overall, but a lot of questions loom over the rest of the year. These include concerns about international markets and the increasing tariffs that impact the landed costs of goods. Larry Kudlow has now told reporters that there have been top-level talks between the US and China on trade. Rreuters has the details: President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said on Friday there has been some communication \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at the highest level\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on trade between the United States and China in recent days. Kudlow, answering questions from reporters on the WhiteHouse driveway, would not say who was involved in the communication or what was discussed. Larry Kudlow, Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic advisor, is speaking to Bloomberg TV now. On today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report, Kudlow argues that there is still significant slack in the US labor market, even though the jobless rate has ticked down to 3.9% There are still a lot of Americans out there who could come back into the labor force. Our potential to grow is very strong, and with the right incentives we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get them working again. And on trade, Kudlow launches a blast at China, claiming that its economy is weakening. He says that the yuan has weakened because China is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lousy investment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, meaning capital is leaving the country. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153heap of trouble\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if that continues, Kudlow adds. Kudlow says: They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a weak economic position... that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a good place to be in vis a vis trade negotiations. Beijing had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better not underestimate president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s determination to follow through on our asks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Kudlow continues. That includes demands that China stops stealing intellectual property, forcing US companies to share technology, and rips up non-reciprocal tariffs and trade barriers. Q: Are you trying to exert maximum pressure on the Chinese economy, to get them to the negotiation table? We are serious, Kudlow replies, and trade negotiations often include the use of tariffs. He reveals that America hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had much discussion with China on trade in recent months, and blames the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intransigence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the Chinese side. Kudlow adds that Trump had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd meeting with European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker last week. He expects lots of announcements in the next 30 days following those talks. Speaking earlier to Fox News, Kudlow also claimed that the US was making progress with the NATFA talks, leaving China \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcincreasingly isolated\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. CNN has more details of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest tariff threat: Products in line for tariffs include meat, coffee, nuts, alcoholic drinks, minerals, chemicals, leather products, wood products, machinery, furniture and auto parts. By announcing new proposed tariffs, China risks throwing fuel on its already smouldering trade war with America. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Duties ranging from 5 percent to 25 percent will be levied on 5,207 kinds of American imports if the U.S. delivers its proposed taxes on another $200 billion of Chinese goods, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement on its website late Friday. The retaliation stands to further inflame tensions between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two biggest economies and echoes China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to the previous round of tariffs which took effect last month. President Donald Trump this week ordered officials to consider imposing a 25 percent tax on $200 billion worth of imported Chinese goods, up from an initial 10 percent rate. The move was intended to bring China back to the negotiating table for talks over U.S. demands for structural changes to the Chinese economy and a cut in the bilateral trade deficit. China has released a list of US products which could be hit with new import duties. The list includes a range of agricultural products; Beijing continues to target American farmers as the trade spat with Washington spices up. Some small aircraft are also on the list. China has also made it clear that these tariffs would only be imposed if America presses on with its tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods. In other words, Beijing is trying to stick to its position that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t intensify the trade dispute, but it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t roll over either. The trade ministry says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China always believes that consultation on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit is an effective way to resolve trade differences. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any unilateral threat or blackmail will only lead to intensification of conflicts and damage to the interests of all parties.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd James Knightley of ING agrees the America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs market remains strong, despite July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown. 2017 averaged 182,000 jobs per month whereas the first 7 months of 2018 have averaged 215,000 job gains. This will help underpin consumer sentiment and spending through the rest of the year. Knightley also believes that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts will cushion the economy from the ongoing trade disputes. There are certainly worries about protectionism and its potential economic impact, but we also have to remember that the stimulus from tax cuts dwarfs the tax hit from higher tariffs. As such we are still expecting the US economy to expand 3% this year. The US jobs report shows that manufacturers took on 37,000 new staff last month. Construction employment rose by 13,000, while service sector firms provided the bulk of the new jobs. Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics explains: We need to be a little careful with the manufacturing number, however, since 13,000 of those jobs were in motor vehicle manufacturing, which is often distorted upwards in July because fewer plants close down for annual retoolings now. Services employment increased by a relatively modest 118,000, although jobs in the better-paid professional &amp; business services increased by 51,000. Despite job creation slowing last month, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labo(u)r market still looks fairly robust. As Kully Samra, Vice President at Charles Schwab, points out: Wage growth is steady month on month and unemployment remains near its 18 year low.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, there are risks on the horizon, including a trade war and the prospect of rising interest rates: Trade isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only cause for concern\u00e2\u20ac\u201dinvestors are also eyeing the rising value of the dollar, slowing global economic growth and the possibility that the Federal Reserve could raise short-term interest rates too much and choke off domestic economic growth. However, US companies have strong balance sheets and tax reform has made it attractive to repatriate even more of their cash from foreign countries. That money can fuel business investment, expansion and stock buybacks. Wall Street isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report: Newsflash: Job creation across America has slowed, while wage growth remains steady Just 157,000 new workers were hired in the US last month, according to the new Non-Farm Payroll. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker than the 190,000 which Wall Street expected. However, June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s NFP has been revised up to 248,000, from 213,000, with May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data also better previously thought. The unemployment rate has fallen back to 3.9%, from 4% last month. On the wages front, pay rose by 0.3% in July alone, or 2.7% over the last year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in line with forecasts. Wages were also up 2.7% per year in June, so the tight labour market isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t still driving up earnings. Reaction to follow.... Newsflash: China has announced plans to impose new retaliatory tariffs on US imports, if America presses on with its trade war. Beijing says it will impose an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153import tax\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on around $60bn of American goods, if the US puts taxes on Chinese products. These taxes would range from 5% to 25%, according to Reuters. The Chinese government says the measures are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rational and restrained\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, will guard its interests, and prevent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trade frictions from escalating\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This appears to be Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s formal response to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods. Currently, both sides have tariffs on around \u00c2\u00a338bn of imports. That is already causing pain in the US farming sector, testing Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claims that trade wars are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good and easy to win\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a audio clip of Mark Carney speaking this morning, explaining how the UK economy has underperformed since the Brexit vote and why a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exit should be avoided if possible: In other financial news, Royal Bank of Scotland took another step towards normality this morning by finally reinstating its dividend. OK, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only 2p per share, but it is some relief for long-suffering shareholders who have been waiting a decade for this to happen. The UK taxpayer is one winner, picking up \u00c2\u00a3149m thanks to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s majority stake in the bank. Mark Carney also suggested this morning that UK interest rates could be cut under some Brexit scenarios (a comment he also made yesterday after, err, raising borrowing costs). This is helping to keep the pound close to an 11-month low, says Lee McDarby of foreign exchange firm Moneycorp. Despite the interest rate hike, confidence shown by the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee is not being reflected by UK businesses. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing the Pound trading lower on Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit scenario, suggesting that economic uncertainty is still front and centre in the minds of decision-makers. A Hard Brexit might not plunge Britain into a deep recession, but it might lock the country into a long period of weakness. So argues Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale, who predicts that it would hurt (but not sink) the pound: Bank of England Governor Mark Carney says that the chance of a no-deal Brexit is uncomfortably high. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty dismal prospect for growth and an awful one for the public finances. It would be bad for the pound but from current low levels, the risk is that we face years of a weak currency rather than another huge move lower.... A \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which we define as ending access to the single market and taking the UK out of the customs union... is our central case. We think it results in real GDP growth being about 0.5% lower per annum than would have been the case otherwise, for up to 10 years. We think this will result in sterling trading about 5% lower than current levels on a trade-weighted basis in the next few years, back to the 2008 lows, but not to or through the 1976 lows in real terms. For EUR/GBP it suggests a return to levels around 0.95, but not a break of parity. Kit also points out that the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all-time nadir was in 1976, when the government called in the International Monetary Fund to help prop up the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances. It also plunged on Black Wednesday in 1992, and during the financial crisis. Having tumbled after the 2016 referendum, how much further could the pound slide in 2019 if Brexit goes badly? Kit writes: The question all of this begs, is whether \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 would be worse than 1992, 2008 and 1976. In 1976 and 1992, the UK was coming out of recession (a mild one in 92, a deep one in 1976). In 2009 the UK was in its deepest post-war recession. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.2% y/y growth rate is respectable by contrast. Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention on Brexit today shows that the Bank of England is getting nervous about the pace and progress of negotiations. As Bloomberg puts it: Mark Carney threw himself back into the thick of the Brexit debate on Friday, saying the chance of the U.K. dropping out of the European Union without a deal is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncomfortably high.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The intervention suggests the Bank of England governor is growing increasingly worried that Prime Minister Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is running out of time to hammer out an agreement that will prevent disruption to business, trade and consumers. The central bank has previously drawn criticism for being too forthright in its comments and predictions surrounding Brexit, which anti-EU lawmakers see as being overly gloomy. In a BBC Radio interview on Friday, Carney said a disorderly Brexit is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly undesirable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound weakened below $1.30 as he spoke and was down 0.3 percent at $1.2982 as of 8:56 a.m. London time. Carney also said that a no-deal Brexit is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a relatively unlikely possibility, but still a possibility.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anxiety about Brexit won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector companies recover from their July stumble, says James Knightley of Dutch bank ING. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services PMI report: The report compiler cited Brexit worries as a key factor holding back investment. The uncertainty it generates means it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probable that businesses will become more wary about putting money to work in the UK. Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning this morning that the risk of a no deal Brexit is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncomfortably high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly going to help stimulate businesses into action either. The drop in UK service sector growth is disappointing, says Howard Archer of the EY Item Club. It may suggest that the Bank of England was too hasty when it raised interest rates yesterday. Chris Sood-Nicholls, managing director and head of global services at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153headwinds on the horizon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are to blame. The prospect of a rise in interest rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c confirmed yesterday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meant that people have been a little more cautious with their spending than they may otherwise have been, while difficulties recruiting staff have also prevented rising demand translating into significant numbers of new jobs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Like consumers, businesses are generally knuckling down and getting on with what they need to do, while the extent of the uncertainty they face weighs heavily on longer-term investment decisions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a result, although the environment facing services businesses might remain generally positive into next year, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unlikely to brush off that cautious approach until they see greater clarity in the mid to long-term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is from Rupert Harrison of BlackRock: Services makes up around three quarters of the UK economy, so the drop in growth in July is significant. Another worrying sign: employment growth across the sector fell to a near two-year low. Some companies blamed the tight labour market; others said they were automating business processes so they could run with fewer staff. Newsflash! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector stumbled last month, with growth hitting a three-month low -- and Brexit is getting some of the blame. Service sector bosses report that new orders grew at a slower rate last month, with business activity growth also weakening. This puled down the Markit Service PMI (which measures activity) to 53.5 in July, from 55.1 in June. Some companies blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153delayed decision-making and greater risk aversion among clients\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd due to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit, says the service sector fell back into the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slow lane\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd last month. While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to quantify the precise impact of the recent heat wave on overall business performance, some survey respondents reported that a combination of hot weather and the World Cup had weighed on consumer footfall. These short-term disruptions and a general slowdown in new business growth appear to have offset the boost to tourism-related activity from the extended dry period in July. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking at demand fundamentals, service providers commented that Brexit uncertainty had held back new project wins, reflecting risk aversion and a wait-and-see approach to investment spending among international clients. Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, also singles out Brexit as a factor: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK services sector experienced a few bumps in the road in July as consumer and client confidence remained persistently half-hearted, and pessimism around the performance of the UK economy along with Brexit concerns lingered. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Levels of new orders and jobs growth were affected along with business optimism which remained below the long-term average even with July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three-month improvement. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector would cope if the UK crashed out of the EU without a transition deal, the Bank of England believes. Mark Carney insists that the banks are much stronger than before the financial crash, and could weather a crisis at home or abroad. So even if Britain and Brussels can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reach a deal, we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a run on the banks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK financial system has tripled the amount of capital they had over the course of the last several years, they have increased the amount of liquidity - the money they have on a day-to-day basis - by 10 times over the course of the last several years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The reason they have done that is to be in a position to be able to withstand a shock, wherever the shock comes from - it could come from China, it could come from abroad, it could come from a no-deal Brexit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have meticulously gone through the types of risk associated with a no-deal Brexit. Mark Carney also warned that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit would disrupt UK trade, hurting growth: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a consequence of that [there would be] a disruption to the level of economic activity, higher prices for a period of time. Newsflash: The pound has slumped close to its lowest level since last September, as the governor of the Bank of England warned that the risks of a hard Brexit are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worryingly high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Mark Carmey told Radio Four\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today Programme that it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly undesirable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Britain to crash out of the EU without a deal...but far from impossible. He warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the possibility of a no deal is uncomfortably high at this point. People will have things to worry about in a no deal Brexit, which is still a relatively unlikely possibility but it is a possibility.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney added that a transition deal is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the interests of both the UK and the EU. He also warned that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd scenario would drive up consumer prices, as companies scrambled to keep supply chains running. Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments raise the stakes as prime minister Theresa May prepared to meet with French president Emmanuel Macron, as part of her push to get EU leaders to back her Chequers plan. Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support could be critical to May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to get Europe to support her compromise proposal. However, EU negotiator Michel Barnier has criticised Chequers - saying the proposal for free movement of goods, but not people, after Brexit would undermine the single market. Carney was also asked about yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise. He said market expectations that rates move to 1.5% over the next few years is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not a bad rule of thumb.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd His comments sent the pound sliding through $1.30 -- it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down half a cent to $1.2980. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s uncomfortably close to the 11-month low scraped last month. Hosting the football World Cup gave Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy a lift. Growth in the Russian service sector jumped in July, according to Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly healthcheck. It says: The IHS Markit Russia Services Business Activity Index \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a single-figure measure designed to track changes in total Russian services activity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c posted 52.8 in July, up from 52.3 in June. The latest expansion in business activity was solid despite remaining below the long-run series average. Where a rise was reported, panellists linked this to greater new order growth and an increase in activity following the recent football World Cup. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector growth has hit a four-month low today, suggesting that the trade dispute with America may be hurting. The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index (PMI) fell to 52.8 in July, down from June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 53.9, and the lowest reading since March. Service sector new orders expanded at their weakest rate for over two-and-a-half years. In another blow, overall business confidence fell to its lowest level since November 2015. Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, fears that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is slowing. The Caixin China Composite Output Index, which covers both manufacturers and service providers, fell to 52.3 in July, pointing to a weaker expansion of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. The sub- index for prices charged fell more than the one for input costs, although both remained in expansionary territory. The situation pointed to rising cost pressures. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The Bank of England took a bit of a gamble yesterday, raising UK interest rates to a near 10-year high even though real wage growth is modest and Brexit uncertainty is worrying businesses. Today we learn if the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominant service sector is strong enough to cope with higher borrowing costs. Data firm Markit is publishing its monthly surveys of purchasing managers from service sector firms (or PMIs). The UK services PMI is expected to fall to 54.7 for July, from 55.1 in June, which would show a small growth slowdown. 2018 has been a torrid year for some services sector firms, such as retailers and restaurants. But some outlets should have enjoyed a World Cup boost last month. Already this week the manufacturing PMI has shown a slowdown, while construction picked up. We also get PMI reports from across the globe. The eurozone figures are expected to confirm that growth slowed last month. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services PMI for July could well go further in showcasing that the rebound seen in the Q2 numbers isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a temporary phenomenon and has momentum. This is expected to show a modest slowdown from June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 55.1 to 54.7, as the boost from the warm weather and England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Cup run came to an end. While we appear to have seen a rebound in the UK economy in Q2, the same can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be said with any certainty with respect to the EU and France in particular which saw its own GDP come in at 0.2% in Q2. You would think that having won the World Cup that the services sector would show evidence of some sort of pickup in July, but even here expectations are modest in that we could see a slowdown to 55.3. This could be even weaker if the effects of air traffic control and rail strikes caused a bigger loss of output than has originally been estimated. The other major event of the day is the US jobs report, or Non-Farm Payroll. This will show whether America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-running labour market boom continued in July. Economists predict that 192,000 new US jobs were created last month, down from 213,000 in June. That could pull the unemployment rate down to just 3.9%, from 4%. The earnings figures are more important. Pay is expected to have risen by 0.3% during the month, up from 0.2% in June. That would leave annual wage increases pegged at 2.7%, not spectacular, given US growth hit its highest level since 2014. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be watching to see whether Donald Trump breaks with protocol (again) and tweets about the jobs number. It would make a nice change from flaming the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fake, disgusting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd news.

Morgan Stanley recently estimated that more than 70% of US households will own a smart speaker with voice commerce capabilities by 2022 and half of all web searches will be voice activated. The category will become so important to the data tech giants, the report recommended, that Google should give away a free Home Mini smart speaker to every US household. The $3.3bn this would cost Google parent Alphabet to execute would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153small price to pay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the opportunity, it added, since the potential to make money off the trend will likely go to Amazon and Google because of their dominance in their voice recognition technologies and smart speaker technology. For Sonos, then, perhaps the best policy would be to remain on good terms. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales have been increasing, albeit modestly from a loyal customer base that drove sales to nearly $1bn last year. The company, still based in Santa Barbara, Californi, where it was founded, has posted annual losses in its three most recent fiscal years.",

Their shares have been soaring since the start of the year, despite being buffeted by trade war fears as President Trump talked of limiting Chinese investments in the US and restricting American technology imports to China.</p> <p>But now there are signs that cracks may be starting to appear in some of the biggest firms in the sector. Facebook suffered the biggest ever one-day drop in a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c losing more than \u00c2\u00a390bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after its growth slowed in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p> <p>Twitter lost 20%, or $5bn, as it reported a surprise fall in active monthly users, while streaming service Netflix missed its targets for subscriber numbers.</p> <p>On the other hand, electric car specialist Tesla managed to head in the right direction despite making a $717m second-quarter loss, as its controversial chief executive, Elon Musk, regained investor confidence after apologising for previous outbursts. That was in marked contrast to a conference call for the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous set of figures, when he accused a Wall Street analyst of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boring bonehead questions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and ignored queries from investors.</p> <p>But the pick of the bunch remains Apple, which beat Amazon and Google to reach the landmark $1 trillion valuation on Thursday.</p> <p>Despite the recent rollercoaster ride, the five key tech stocks, known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Faangs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet-owned Google \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have reached breathtaking heights. The total value of the five companies amounts to a staggering 19% of total US GDP. But their surge in value has prompted fears of a re-run of the dotcom boom of the late 1990s, when technology businesses dominated the stock market before coming crashing to earth.</p> <p>Russ Mould at investment group AJ Bell says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That [19%] compares to the 15.5% of US GDP reached by the five biggest companies by value at the US stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peak in the fourth quarter of 1999, just before the technology, media and telecoms bubble burst and that particular mania came to grief.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Here we look at where the big names stand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and where they could go from here.</p> <h2>Facebook</h2> <p>The social network\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market value <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/29/facebook-results-running-out-new-users-goodwill\">plunged by more than \u00c2\u00a390bn</a> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the largest one-day drop in corporate history \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it felt the effect of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\">Cambridge Analytica data scandal</a>. The group made more than $5bn (\u00c2\u00a33.8bn) profit in the last three months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slightly ahead of expectations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but some 3 million Europeans quit the website amid concerns about what Facebook does with personal data. Finance chief David Wehner warned revenue growth was likely to slow, while costs soared by 50% to $7.4bn as the company spent vast sums on improving data security.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-3902HEHbgs63337q/\" data-alt=\"Facebook shares\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-3902HEHbgs63337q/\">Facebook shares</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Verdict </strong>For all the bluster around the largest one-day fall in history, the reasons behind it make the case for a founder-leader with absolute control better than anything else Mark Zuckerberg has done in the past decade. Facebook, shaken by Cambridge Analytica and the election interference scandal, decided to slash its profits in half in order to fund a response: 50,000 new moderators, a substantial investment into its trust and safety engineering, and a commitment to carry on doing the same for at least another year. Wall Street, predictably, hated it, but it was the right thing to do. A weaker leader could have been toppled for doing it, or might never have tried in the first place. Yes, Zuckerberg led the company into this swamp, but maybe he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the only one who can get it back out.</p> <p>However, there are storm clouds on the horizon as well. In the future, look out for the shift from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feeds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to self-deleting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stories\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which could be as momentous as its shift from desktop to mobile. Facebook believes it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be that long before the majority of content across its four platforms is shared as stories, the format it cloned from Snapchat two years ago, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling to achieve advertiser buy-in.</p> <h2>Alphabet</h2> <p>Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company smashed Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit expectations, sending its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/23/google-alphabet-profits-5bn-fine-shares-surge\">shares soaring to a record high</a>. Net profit was actually lower than last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down from $4.9bn to $3.5bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but that included a $2.7bn fine levied on Google by the European commission for anti-competitive behaviour. The company is set to appeal, so could still get its money back. The business raked in more than $26bn of revenue in the three-month period \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well up on the $21bn recorded in the same period last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-39023vu72D1VPfPJ/\" data-alt=\"Alphabet shares\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-39023vu72D1VPfPJ/\">Alphabet shares</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Verdict </strong>Even though the general tech sell-off hit Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, and profits fell year-on-year, the future looks fairly bright for Alphabet. Yes, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine over Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Android monopoly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good for the company, and it was large enough to hit profits directly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for the $2.7bn penalty, Alphabet would have actually seen profits grow this quarter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the most significant wrongs that Google was accused of are largely in the past, and it is unlikely to feel too constrained going forward.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the search business prints money. Almost every open-ended query on the web starts at Google, and that makes its advertising revenues enormous and secure. YouTube could be a shining gem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and certainly seems to be if you speak to anyone under 20, for whom it, not Netflix, is the new TV \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it will have problems down the line over the same dodgy content now causing such pain for Facebook.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"931af6ffd10fe477756d17cf40862818ea649179\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/931af6ffd10fe477756d17cf40862818ea649179/0_141_4644_2787/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon Web Services inflatable display at a trade fair\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cloud computing division has seen extraordinary growth in profits.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mauritz Antin/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Amazon</h2> <p>The globe-spanning online retailer announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/26/amazon-profit-second-quarter-2018-advertising-cloud\">record quarterly profits of $2.5bn</a> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c double the level Wall Street experts had expected \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sending the share price to an all-time high.

Well, Amazon is the AWS (Amazon Web Services) company now. The record profits of the cloud-computing division led to an astonishing 1,286% year-on-year growth in overall profits, thanks to the extremely high margins that Amazon makes on selling computing time. It now stretches from its own consumer retail business to the Marketplace platform \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building a shopping mall of internet stores \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to AWS, which provides the backbone to the internet. And don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget its bets on the future, particularly with Echo and Alexa. Voice control may yet prove to be a dead-end in the annals of computing, but if not, Amazon could well own the iPhone of the 2020s.</p> <h2>Apple</h2> <p>Apple made history on Thursday, becoming the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">first public company to be valued at $1 trillion</a>, reaching the landmark 42 years after the company was founded and two decades after it almost went bust. Financial results for the most recent three months, filed earlier in the week, showed revenues topped $53bn. The company shipped more than 41m phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slightly less than anticipated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but because the expensive iPhone X has proved popular, the average price consumers paid for them went up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-3902KmLt1o6pmxWJ/\" data-alt=\"Apple shares\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-3902KmLt1o6pmxWJ/\">Apple shares</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Verdict</strong> Making nice things and selling them for a lot of money to tens of millions of people is a very good business to be in. The engine of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business, the iPhone, generated 60% of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits, and it shows no sign of letting up.</p> <p>The iPhone X has been a resounding success, proving the hypothesis that millions of people will pay whatever Apple asks for the best phone on the planet. The average selling price of an iPhone is now more than $700. More promisingly still, that has held up in the second quarter, usually the time when sales fall off as savvy customers hold on for the inevitable upgrade in September.</p> <p>But while the iPhone provides the reliable profit, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the growth opportunity. That lies in the two lines at the bottom of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153services\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153other products\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Services \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which include the App Store, Apple Pay and income from Apple Music \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have been growing rapidly since the company stopped viewing them just as a tool for boosting phone sales and started seeing them as a business. Apple invented the idea of the App Store and is taking a 30% cut on everything in it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32d8f9963390ea58bbfb94ee79ad4680315df206\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32d8f9963390ea58bbfb94ee79ad4680315df206/0_46_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elon Musk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elon Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent outbursts have worried investors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gene Blevins/ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Tesla</h2> <p>Tesla has had a difficult few months, with increasing concerns about the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sustainability and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/18/elon-musk-apologises-for-calling-thai-cave-rescue-diver-a-pedo\">outbursts from its billionaire founder Elon Musk</a> that have seen him labelled the Trump of Tech.

But whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a responsible boss or an unpredictable tech genius, Musk still has an uphill struggle on his hands, turning Tesla from a niche maker of expensive cars for the Silicon Valley set into a mass-market manufacturer of electric cars that can compete on equal terms with the likes of BMW and Nissan.</p> <p>Tesla is finally producing its self-imposed quota of 5,000 of its mass-market Model 3s a week, but to do so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had to shift production to an external \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and take a record $700m loss for the quarter. And simply matching its legacy competitors on one mass-market vehicle isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to justify its sky-high valuation (Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock-market value is roughly the same as BMW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to deliver on at least one of its moonshots: self-driving cars, a radically redesigned charging infrastructure, or the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first commercially feasible electric truck.</p> <h2>Twitter</h2> <p>Twitter lost more than a fifth of its value in two days, despite reporting a record profit, because investors were worried about hugely disappointing forecasts for user numbers. It <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/27/twitter-share-price-tumbles-after-it-loses-1m-users-in-three-months\">lost 1 million users in the last three months</a> and predicted a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mid-single-digit millions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd decline in the next three-month period. The social media service reported net income of $100m during the second quarter, but tech companies need to show they can deliver uninterrupted growth to impress Wall Street.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-39024qv2eKcTU0Ob/\" data-alt=\"Twitter shares\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-39024qv2eKcTU0Ob/\">Twitter shares</a> </figure>  <p><strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>Verdict </strong>In 2016, Twitter moved its app from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153social networking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd section of the App Store to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd section. At the time, it was seen as a capitulation to Facebook, but now it looks like a piece of genuine insight into what the company could offer to users and how the service differs from its competition. Like all news services, when there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of news, the company booms, and there is certainly a lot of news right now. That has fed into a good performance over the last year.</p> <p>The last quarter is a different story, of course. Twitter still has to tackle the same trust and safety issues as Facebook and Google, with a fraction of the money and engineering talent.

So Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock price is essentially a representation of one simple question: will it win, or will Apple Music? In Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favour is its large and growing free service, which brings in substantial ad revenue and is a crucial pipeline for new users \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the Android market, where it lacks a strong competitor. Working against it: a competitor with much deeper pockets.</p>",
                "bodyText":"It has been a tumultuous couple of weeks for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high-flying technology stocks, even by their own unique standards. Their shares have been soaring since the start of the year, despite being buffeted by trade war fears as President Trump talked of limiting Chinese investments in the US and restricting American technology imports to China. But now there are signs that cracks may be starting to appear in some of the biggest firms in the sector. Facebook suffered the biggest ever one-day drop in a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c losing more than \u00c2\u00a390bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after its growth slowed in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Twitter lost 20%, or $5bn, as it reported a surprise fall in active monthly users, while streaming service Netflix missed its targets for subscriber numbers. On the other hand, electric car specialist Tesla managed to head in the right direction despite making a $717m second-quarter loss, as its controversial chief executive, Elon Musk, regained investor confidence after apologising for previous outbursts. That was in marked contrast to a conference call for the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous set of figures, when he accused a Wall Street analyst of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boring bonehead questions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and ignored queries from investors. But the pick of the bunch remains Apple, which beat Amazon and Google to reach the landmark $1 trillion valuation on Thursday. Despite the recent rollercoaster ride, the five key tech stocks, known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Faangs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet-owned Google \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have reached breathtaking heights. The total value of the five companies amounts to a staggering 19% of total US GDP. But their surge in value has prompted fears of a re-run of the dotcom boom of the late 1990s, when technology businesses dominated the stock market before coming crashing to earth. Russ Mould at investment group AJ Bell says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That [19%] compares to the 15.5% of US GDP reached by the five biggest companies by value at the US stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peak in the fourth quarter of 1999, just before the technology, media and telecoms bubble burst and that particular mania came to grief.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here we look at where the big names stand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and where they could go from here. Facebook The social network\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market value plunged by more than \u00c2\u00a390bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the largest one-day drop in corporate history \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it felt the effect of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. The group made more than $5bn (\u00c2\u00a33.8bn) profit in the last three months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slightly ahead of expectations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but some 3 million Europeans quit the website amid concerns about what Facebook does with personal data. Finance chief David Wehner warned revenue growth was likely to slow, while costs soared by 50% to $7.4bn as the company spent vast sums on improving data security. Verdict For all the bluster around the largest one-day fall in history, the reasons behind it make the case for a founder-leader with absolute control better than anything else Mark Zuckerberg has done in the past decade. Facebook, shaken by Cambridge Analytica and the election interference scandal, decided to slash its profits in half in order to fund a response: 50,000 new moderators, a substantial investment into its trust and safety engineering, and a commitment to carry on doing the same for at least another year. Wall Street, predictably, hated it, but it was the right thing to do. A weaker leader could have been toppled for doing it, or might never have tried in the first place. Yes, Zuckerberg led the company into this swamp, but maybe he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the only one who can get it back out. However, there are storm clouds on the horizon as well. In the future, look out for the shift from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feeds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to self-deleting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stories\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which could be as momentous as its shift from desktop to mobile. Facebook believes it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be that long before the majority of content across its four platforms is shared as stories, the format it cloned from Snapchat two years ago, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling to achieve advertiser buy-in. Alphabet Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company smashed Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit expectations, sending its shares soaring to a record high. Net profit was actually lower than last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down from $4.9bn to $3.5bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but that included a $2.7bn fine levied on Google by the European commission for anti-competitive behaviour. The company is set to appeal, so could still get its money back. The business raked in more than $26bn of revenue in the three-month period \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well up on the $21bn recorded in the same period last year. Verdict Even though the general tech sell-off hit Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, and profits fell year-on-year, the future looks fairly bright for Alphabet. Yes, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine over Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Android monopoly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good for the company, and it was large enough to hit profits directly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for the $2.7bn penalty, Alphabet would have actually seen profits grow this quarter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the most significant wrongs that Google was accused of are largely in the past, and it is unlikely to feel too constrained going forward. Meanwhile, the search business prints money. Almost every open-ended query on the web starts at Google, and that makes its advertising revenues enormous and secure. YouTube could be a shining gem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and certainly seems to be if you speak to anyone under 20, for whom it, not Netflix, is the new TV \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it will have problems down the line over the same dodgy content now causing such pain for Facebook. Amazon The globe-spanning online retailer announced record quarterly profits of $2.5bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c double the level Wall Street experts had expected \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sending the share price to an all-time high. Advertising and cloud computing were the big growth areas. Verdict Remember when it just sold books? Well, Amazon is the AWS (Amazon Web Services) company now. The record profits of the cloud-computing division led to an astonishing 1,286% year-on-year growth in overall profits, thanks to the extremely high margins that Amazon makes on selling computing time. It now stretches from its own consumer retail business to the Marketplace platform \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building a shopping mall of internet stores \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to AWS, which provides the backbone to the internet. And don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget its bets on the future, particularly with Echo and Alexa. Voice control may yet prove to be a dead-end in the annals of computing, but if not, Amazon could well own the iPhone of the 2020s. Apple Apple made history on Thursday, becoming the first public company to be valued at $1 trillion, reaching the landmark 42 years after the company was founded and two decades after it almost went bust. Financial results for the most recent three months, filed earlier in the week, showed revenues topped $53bn. The company shipped more than 41m phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slightly less than anticipated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but because the expensive iPhone X has proved popular, the average price consumers paid for them went up. Verdict Making nice things and selling them for a lot of money to tens of millions of people is a very good business to be in. The engine of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business, the iPhone, generated 60% of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits, and it shows no sign of letting up. The iPhone X has been a resounding success, proving the hypothesis that millions of people will pay whatever Apple asks for the best phone on the planet. The average selling price of an iPhone is now more than $700. More promisingly still, that has held up in the second quarter, usually the time when sales fall off as savvy customers hold on for the inevitable upgrade in September. But while the iPhone provides the reliable profit, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the growth opportunity. That lies in the two lines at the bottom of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153services\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153other products\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Services \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which include the App Store, Apple Pay and income from Apple Music \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have been growing rapidly since the company stopped viewing them just as a tool for boosting phone sales and started seeing them as a business. Apple invented the idea of the App Store and is taking a 30% cut on everything in it. Tesla Tesla has had a difficult few months, with increasing concerns about the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sustainability and outbursts from its billionaire founder Elon Musk that have seen him labelled the Trump of Tech. On Wednesday the electric-car maker reported a record $717m loss for the last three months, but the shares climbed because revenue hit $4bn and Musk promised profitability later this year. He said there had been a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mind-blowing leap forward\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the number of cars rolling off the lines. Verdict Elon Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s responsible-boss routine on Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings call appeared to restore investor confidence following his disastrous performance three months ago, when he rejected \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boring bonehead questions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from Wall Street analysts concerned about Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fundamentals. But whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a responsible boss or an unpredictable tech genius, Musk still has an uphill struggle on his hands, turning Tesla from a niche maker of expensive cars for the Silicon Valley set into a mass-market manufacturer of electric cars that can compete on equal terms with the likes of BMW and Nissan. Tesla is finally producing its self-imposed quota of 5,000 of its mass-market Model 3s a week, but to do so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had to shift production to an external \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and take a record $700m loss for the quarter. And simply matching its legacy competitors on one mass-market vehicle isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to justify its sky-high valuation (Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock-market value is roughly the same as BMW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to deliver on at least one of its moonshots: self-driving cars, a radically redesigned charging infrastructure, or the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first commercially feasible electric truck. Twitter Twitter lost more than a fifth of its value in two days, despite reporting a record profit, because investors were worried about hugely disappointing forecasts for user numbers. It lost 1 million users in the last three months and predicted a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mid-single-digit millions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd decline in the next three-month period. The social media service reported net income of $100m during the second quarter, but tech companies need to show they can deliver uninterrupted growth to impress Wall Street. Verdict In 2016, Twitter moved its app from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153social networking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd section of the App Store to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd section. At the time, it was seen as a capitulation to Facebook, but now it looks like a piece of genuine insight into what the company could offer to users and how the service differs from its competition. Like all news services, when there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of news, the company booms, and there is certainly a lot of news right now. That has fed into a good performance over the last year. The last quarter is a different story, of course. Twitter still has to tackle the same trust and safety issues as Facebook and Google, with a fraction of the money and engineering talent. And, as with Facebook, Wall Street just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to play ball: Twitter deletes millions of fake accounts, and investors punish it with a 20% plunge in stock price. Would they really prefer to invest in a site riddled with bots? Netflix The video streaming service was first of the tech firms out of the gate, posting figures in mid-July. Its latest three-month results sent its shares tumbling after it missed subscriber-number expectations for the first time in five years: it signed up more than 5 million new users, which was about a million fewer than the company and the market had expected. Verdict Netflix\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy has changed a lot over the years, from posting DVDs, to streaming licensed movies, to streaming licensed TV shows. These days, its focus is on original serialised programming, which changes the way to think about its content costs: they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re no longer a recurring expense eating into the margin, but a long-term investment. And, as analyst Ben Thompson notes, the spending in effect works towards customer acquisition: the more content on Netflix, the more reason there is to join the site. Which is why, when subscriber growth slows, the whole thing looks unstable. The smallest of the Faangs hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t achieved the escape velocity of its peers, and a dip could always turn into a death dive. Spotify In only its second financial report since flotation, the music streaming service reported an 8 million rise in the number of paid subscribers, to 83 million during the second quarter. Spotify has yet to record a profit, but the increase suggests it is still staving off competition from deep-pocketed rivals such as Amazon and Apple for music streaming customers. Its operating loss widened from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac79m to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac90m (\u00c2\u00a380m). Verdict The music streaming market still has room to grow, as the stubborn markets for digital downloads and CDs demonstrate.

                "body":"<p>There may be times when Mark Carney regrets extending his stint at the Bank of England by an extra year. Had things gone as originally planned, Carney would have handed over the keys to Threadneedle Street a month ago and someone else would have had the task of steering the economy through what is certain to be a fiendishly tricky period.</p> <p>That would be the case even without Brexit. The UK economy has recovered more slowly and more unevenly than Carney envisaged when he took over at the Bank from Mervyn King in 2013. It was only last week that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee felt confident enough to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/02/bank-of-england-raises-interest-rates\" title=\"\">raise interest rates</a> above the 0.5% emergency level that they reached in March 2009.</p> <p>But Brexit is taking up half the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time and it is clear that he is starting to get concerned. Certainly, his remarks when questioned on the BBC <em>Today</em> programme on Friday were blunt. With just eight months to go before Britain leaves the European Union, the risk of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/03/mark-carney-says-risk-of-a-no-deal-brexit-is-uncomfortably-high\" title=\"\">no-deal Brexit is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncomfortably high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</a>.</p> <p>There was a time when such plain speaking from the governor of the Bank of England would have raised a few eyebrows in Downing Street.

                "bodyText":"There may be times when Mark Carney regrets extending his stint at the Bank of England by an extra year. Had things gone as originally planned, Carney would have handed over the keys to Threadneedle Street a month ago and someone else would have had the task of steering the economy through what is certain to be a fiendishly tricky period. That would be the case even without Brexit. The UK economy has recovered more slowly and more unevenly than Carney envisaged when he took over at the Bank from Mervyn King in 2013. It was only last week that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee felt confident enough to raise interest rates above the 0.5% emergency level that they reached in March 2009. But Brexit is taking up half the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time and it is clear that he is starting to get concerned. Certainly, his remarks when questioned on the BBC Today programme on Friday were blunt. With just eight months to go before Britain leaves the European Union, the risk of a no-deal Brexit is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncomfortably high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There was a time when such plain speaking from the governor of the Bank of England would have raised a few eyebrows in Downing Street. Not now. The line since the cabinet signed up to Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s soft Brexit plan is that the government has made all the concessions it can, and that means unless Brussels gives something in return there is a danger of chaos next March. So the prime minister would not have been troubled when Carney said that a no-deal Brexit would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly undesirable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and something all parties should seek to avoid, because that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official Whitehall line.

Sterling slid by three quarters of a cent today to hit $1.2920, its lowest point since September 2017, as City traders fretted about the slow pace of Brexit talks. The selloff was blamed on international trade secretary Sir Liam Fox, and his warning that a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno-deal Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was a 60:40 chance. Fox also attacked the European Commission for being intransigent, declaring. If the theological obsession of the unelected takes priority over the economic wellbeing of the people then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bureaucrats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit. This latest sign that UK-Brussels negotiations are floundering also sent the pound down against the euro, losing half a eurocent to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.119. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman, though, insists that Britain is confident of getting a good deal (which sticking to its fallback position that no deal is better than a bad one). The EC have denied hampering Brexit talks, telling reporters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are working constructively, day and night, to reach a deal with the United Kingdom and I think this is also reflected in the fact that the next negotiation round is scheduled for 16 and 17 of August.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd City analysts are bracing for more volatility in the months ahead, as Britain heads towards Exit Day, 29th March 2019. Analysts at Capital Economics predict that the pound could fall to $1.20, if London can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree a deal with Brussels (or rise to $1.40 if the no-deal threat is avoided). Financial markets have also been jolted by a worrying drop in German factory orders. New manufacturing orders shrank by 4% in June, the biggest drop in almost 18 months. Orders from within Germany, across the eurozone, and beyond all fell -- a bad sign for economic prospects. The decline may show that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imposition of tariffs on China and the EU are damaging the global economy, denting confidence and cutting demand for German goods. Economists warned that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153horrendous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd data suggests Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s powerhouse economy is weakening. And with trade war fears escalating, the situation could worsen this autumn. This has pulled several European stock markets into the red today, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX index down 0.3%. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 ended the day flat, though, as the falling pound helped exporters and firms with overseas earnings. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Boom! Capital Economics have predicted that the pound could slide back to $1.20 if Britain can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree a deal with the EU. Even though sterling has already fallen a long way against the dollar, it would probably drop a lot more if fears of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd materialised, says analyst John Higgins. Higgins warns: After all, investors still seem to be assigning a fairly low probability to this outcome. Unlike in the run-up to the vote for Brexit in June 2016, there has been no surge in the demand for options to protect against a slump in sterling. And in the past few months, it has only fallen a few cents more against the dollar than might have been expected given the shift in UK/US rate expectations. ... The upshot is that we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised if, in the event of no deal, the exchange rate plunged towards, or even below, the level of circa $1.20/\u00c2\u00a3 that it reached in early 2017. Having said that.... Capital Economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153baseline assumption\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is that a deal is reached, pushing the pound back to $1.40 by the end of 2018 (from $1.29 today). Over in the eurozone, Greece has received the final tranche of its bailout - as it prepares to exit the programme in a fortnight. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no celebrating in Athens, following the forest fires left a trail of death and destruction east of the capital. Our correspondent HelenaSmith report from the Greek capital As the death toll rose to 94 - prime minister Alexis Tsipras, whiplashed by public discontent over its handling of the fires, accepted the resignation of the head of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s civil protection agency this morning. The resignation, which follows the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacement of the heads of the fire and police services last night, has spurred speculation Tsipras will move ahead with a far-reaching reshuffle to boost his two-party coalition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flagging popularity imminently. Government sources told the Guardian the makeover will take place well in advance of the leftist leader making his annual economic address in Thessaloniki on September 9th. Tsipras says August 21st will mark the beginning of the end of debt-stricken Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arduous nine-year odyssey on the frontline of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At long last we will reclaim our sovereignty,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told Greeks claiming \u00e2\u20ac\u0153political responsibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the fires. But as the countdown intensifies and the trauma of the fires intensifies, it feels anything but festive among those in office in Athens amid reports this morning that even the finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos may not be around for too much longer.... Steven Barrow, strategist at South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Standard Bank, thinks the pound is falling because time is running out to agree a Brexit deal. He warns (via the FT) that the selloff could intensify this autumn. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think the timescale is unrealistic and, as this starts to dawn on the market, it could just prove another factor tipping risk assets over the edge in the autumn. Sterling caught a dose of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit blues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd today, says Connor Campbell of financial spread-betting group SpreadEx. He blames Dr Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that a no-deal Brexit was a 60:40 shout, on top of Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns. Campbell says: Though the Western markets were almost uniformly in the red, the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real loser was the pound. Plunging half a percent against the dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cable is at a fresh 11 month low \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and 0.3% against the euro, sterling was spooked by the apparent increase in likelihood of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno-deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit, with international trade secretary Liam Fox echoing Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claims last week that the chances of the UK leaving the EU without an agreement in place is becoming more and more of a reality. Brexit worries have also pulled the pound down against the euro today. Sterling has dropped below \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.12 today, a decline of 0.35%. Back in April it was worth almost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.16, meaning UK holidaymakers got a little bit more for their money overseas. Polling company ORB has bad news for the government: public support for Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s handling of the Brexit negotiations has hit a record low. Just 24% of the public approve of the way things are going, they say, things are going well, down from 40% back in April. European stock markets have slipped into the red today. Investors are worrying about the decline in German factory orders in June and the lack of Brexit progress, meaning the FTSE 100 didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get its typical boost from the weakening pound. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153European stock markets opened mixed today as the trade dispute between the US and China continues to hang over investors and stocks... There has been an marked escalation in the trade war, with President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claiming the US was winning the trade dispute.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The drop in the pound has been the main event on a quiet session, says Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX Strategy BK Asset Management. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The biggest story of the day was the continued slide in cable which hit fresh 11 month highs as it dipped below towards $1.2950 support on renewed fears of a hard Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Schlossberg also warned that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153waves of uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd buffeting sterling will become choppier as the Brexit deadline approaches. Marketwatch has more details. The latest attacks on Europe from eurosceptic voices such as Liam Fox are pushing the pound down, argues Commerzbank currency strategist Ulrich Leuchtmann. Leuchtmann says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The voices forecasting a hard Brexit are becoming increasingly shrill. The FX [foreign exchange] market is slowly beginning to work out that these people might successfully torpedo a constructive solution.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound is continuing to drop, and is now down three-quarters of a cent at $1.293. Over in Downing Street, the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman has denied that Britain is likely to leave the EU without a deal. He told reporters at the regular lobby briefing that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We continue to believe that a deal is the most likely outcome because reaching a good deal is not only in the interests of the UK, it is in the interests of the EU and its 27 members.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But, he also argued that Liam Fox was right to warn that a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno-deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit is an option (spooking the pound to an 11-month low) Why a no-deal Brexit worries the City: The pound is hitting new 11-month lows, due to Brexit worries and a general move into the US dollar this morning. UBS Wealth Management has cut its recommendation for clients to go \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoverweight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on shares, due to the threat of a trade war. It fears that the dispute will get worse in the months ahead, with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153several painful rounds of talks and new tariff measures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the horizon. Caroline Simmons, deputy head of UBS Wealth Management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK Investment Office, warns that trade war spats could rumble along for Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entire presidency: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While we expect the trade disputes to ultimately be resolved before the world is tipped into another recession, our base case now assumes things will get worse before they get better. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The benign macroeconomic environment, and strong fundamentals, have emboldened a recent sense of market optimism. But there is a very real danger of overlooking the possibility of the trade situation getting worse, which could have significant impacts, such as supply-chain disruptions, reduced hiring, and lower investment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To reflect this risk and take advantage of the recent move higher in equities, we are reducing our overweight in global equities versus high grade bonds.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The drop in German factory orders may indicate that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate is slowing fast, warns Mikael Sarwe of Nordea Markets: Newsflash: The pound has hit its lowest level since last September, amid heightened worries over Brexit. Sterling fell half a cent this morning to $1.2954. That takes it below its mid-July low to the weakest point in 11 months. The selloff came after Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international trade secretary, Dr Liam Fox, warned that a no-deal Brexit was now more likely than not. Fox told the Sunday Times that there was a 60:40 chance that the UK would leave the European Union without an agreement. He accused the Commission of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intransigence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd putting EU rules above economic well-being. Last Friday, Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned that a no-deal Brexit was an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncomfortably high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd risk. He was then criticised as being a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high priest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of Project Fear; presumably Dr Fox will get the same treatment?.... Back in the UK, car sales have crept up in July, despite a drop in demand for diesel cars again. Some 163,898 new cars were registered last month, up 1.2% year-on-year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reports. Diesel registrations slumped by nearly 25% compared with July 2017, as the knock-on effect of the emissions scandal lingers. Petrol car sales jumped by 20%, while electric car sales jumped 21% - giving them 6.5% of the market. Ian Plummer, director at Auto Trader, reckons car buyers got some good deals last month: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Manufacturers have been racing to clear stock before new regulations on fuel economy and emissions take effect in September, resulting in some great opportunities for consumers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reuters reports that the Chinese media turned up the heat on Donald Trump over his trade policies: The overseas edition of the ruling Communist Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daily newspaper singled out U.S. President Donald Trump in an editorial on Monday, saying he was starring in his own \u00e2\u20ac\u0153street fighter-style deceitful drama of extortion and intimidation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Fears of a trade war with America hit China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market today. The Shanghai composite index fell by 1.25%, as traders fretted about the threat of tariffs hurting global trade. Last Friday, Beijing announced plans for new taxes on $60bn of America goods, if Washington carries out its threatened 25% tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods. Such a move, though, might trigger fresh retaliation from Washington. Yesterday, president Donald Trump claimed that his tariffs were working, indicating that he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning to change his trade policies: Factcheck: the US budget deficit is actually rising sharply, thanks to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts, while farmers are getting a $12bn bailout to protect them from the trade dispute with China. The drop in German factory orders was much steeper than expected, says Bloomberg: Orders fell 4 percent from the previous month -- eight times as much as forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists -- and the 0.8 percent drop from a year ago was the first annual decline since July 2016. The size and scale of the drop in German factory orders in June is almost too bad to be true, suggests Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services. He writes: The fact that every single category fell - be that domestic, Eurozone &amp; Non-Eurozone or Capital Goods, Consumer Durables or Intermediate Goods - looks to be highly anomalous, in so far as there is rarely ever a month where there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153parallel shift\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd down, barring events such as the global financial crisis of 2008. As such, he expects a sharp bounceback in July. Alternatively, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data might be revised up. Economist Fred Ducrozet of Pictet Bank points out that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 German factory orders also fell in June: The broader picture is that German factory orders have fallen in five of the first six months of 2018, as this chart from the Financial Times show: The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Camilla Hodgson writes that trade tensions are a factor: The data covers a month when the transatlantic trade relations between the US and the European Union were worsening, ahead of a meeting between US President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in July. Carsten Brzeski of Dutch bank ING also believes Germany is being buffeted by rising trade tensions. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data: German industrial orders took a severe hit in June, dropping by 4% month-on-month, from [up] 2.6% month-on-month in May. On the year, new orders were down by 0.8%. Even though new orders data are highly volatile, the June report could be a tentative sign of how trade tensions are hitting the German economy. Foreign orders from outside the eurozone dropped by almost 6% MoM. At the same time, domestic orders decreased by 2.8% MoM. With the sharpest drop since January 2017, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new orders data do not bode well for German industry going into the second half of the year. Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s German factory data is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153horrendous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and a sign that economic uncertainty is dampening demand. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade wars appear to be biting. New data show that German factory orders slumped by 4% in June, the biggest fall in almost 18 months. The decline was driven by weaker overseas demand, with orders from outside the eurozone slumping by 5.9%. Domestic orders dropped by 2.8%, while orders from other euro countries declined by 2.7%. Orders for capital goods and consumer goods were particularly weak, falling 4.7% and 4.5% respectively. This monthly data can be volatile, but such a big decline suggests that the tariffs imposed by America in recent months are hurting global trade. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Economy Ministry said that industrial orders fell by 1.6% in April to June, and singled out president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politics, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Regarding the latest development, uncertainty caused by trade policy probably played a role.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Given the size of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing base, this data may highlight wider problems building in the world economy... I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull together some reaction now. Also coming up. HSBC, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest bank, has posted strong-looking results this morning. Pte-tax profits rose $10.71bn for the first half of the year, beating analyst expectations. More on that shortly... In UK retail, House of Fraser is pressing on with plans to shut more than half its stores after settling a legal row with a group of landlords last night. That breakthrough means the remaining outlets cold still be saved We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also expecting the latest UK sales, plus a new survey of investor morale in the euro area.

The S&amp;P report ssays:</p> <blockquote> <p>This is because China is running out of room to retaliate on goods.. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent threat to impose tariffs of 5% to 25% on a further $60 billion worth of U.S. goods (5,207 product lines) means that, together with the $50 billion of goods already announced, about 85% of its American imports (totaling $130 billion in 2017) could be taxed.</p> <p>The threat is in response to the Trump administration last week announcing that it may increase its proposed tariff rate on Chinese imports valued at about $200 billion to 25% from 10%. Together with the previously-announced tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports, the total amount of $250 billion represents about 50% of the value of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual exports to the U.S. in 2017.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153With China running out of room to retaliate on goods (i.e., 85% versus 50% coverage), China could opt to pursue non-tariff actions affecting services and investments from the U.S.,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said S&amp;P Global Ratings analyst David Tesher.</p> <p>The U.S. has a net services surplus with China. A retaliation that spilled over into services could hurt U.S. sectors that rely on China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expanding import market for growth. This step-up in tensions could also exacerbate investor worries about China, damaging business and consumer confidence and growth prospects.

David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US has reimposed sanctions against this morning, with an executive order signed by President Trump that targets financial transactions involving the US dollar, the purchase of commercial plans and metals including gold and the Iranian automotive sector coming into effect. From a financial markets point of view, the price of crude oil could be where these decisions are most keenly felt, with the increased animosity threatening to disrupt Tehran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significant output. This is unlikely to be reflected immediately, with Iranian production expected to remain at present levels for the time being, but should further more stringent sanctions come into play then we could well be set for a supply shock in the oil market which would trigger a sharp move higher.</p> <p>The complex nature of this situation means that it is not just the US and Iran that could be impacted, with the bulk of Iranian crude actually being sold to other countries. The issue lies in whether the US look to force allies to also shun oil from Iran, and if this occurs then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real chance that OPEC will struggle to make up the lost supply and this would drive the price of oil up. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b6969fee4b05f576d12d0b3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-07T09:45:10.676Z\">10.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Anyone trading with Iran won't be trading with US - Trump</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the Iran sanctions, and President Trump has just tweeted:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1026762818773757955\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Iran sanctions have officially been cast.

Barclays said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[This] is the strongest consistent growth in our data history. UK domestic sectors have held up year to date and resilient spending should continue to support their near-term performance.</p> </blockquote> <p>It said the strength came from in-store spending, which grew by 2.9%, the strongest growth since April 2014. Online spending grew by 10.4%, which is weaker compared to the historical data. And Barclays warned:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are reasons to be cautious, as consumers remain negative about the general economy and appetite for large purchases remains muted. </p> <p>Outside influences, such as oil price inflation and FX, combine to push up spending on Petrol. Consumer confidence moved slightly lower in July, as negativity about the general economy persists. The appetite for major purchases remained muted, with consumers cautious about making significant spending commitments, evident in subdued spending on electronics, furniture, household appliances and vehicle sales.</p> </blockquote> <p>Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at AJ Bell, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heat wave and World Cup fever boosted consumer spending in July, with people spending on picnics, BBQs and pubs.</p> <p>People are making the most of the sunshine as spending on food increased 6.7% in the month, while more families are also going on day trips and doing outdoor activities. </p> <p>The World Cup effect also continued to boost spending in the month, with money spent in pubs rising 73% on the day of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s semi-final, as people cheered on their team. Overall the amount shelled out in pubs increased by 17% in July \u00e2\u20ac\u201c marking the biggest rise since April last year.</p> <p>However, the hangover is looming as people admit they are worried about the effect of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise on their finances. The 0.25 percentage point hike last week will hit those who are in debt, including many who are already struggling to make ends meet. </p> <p>A third of those questioned said they were worried that the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move would mean they have less money each month, while confidence in finances among those questioned dropped by 6 percentage points to 59%.</p> <p>This cautiousness is also shown in the fact that households are still putting off buying big ticket items.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f479d26b2a1040c8ae0ca48695867d64c1b91b09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f479d26b2a1040c8ae0ca48695867d64c1b91b09/0_248_4173_2504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England supporters celebrate at the Lord Raglan Pub in London as England play Tunisia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England supporters celebrate at the Lord Raglan Pub in London as England play Tunisia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel French/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-08-07T09:41:02.372Z\">at 10.41am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b69616be4b05f576d12d077\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-07T09:23:35.267Z\">10.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A reasonably strong performance from US markets on Monday is one of the reasons for a more positive mood in Asia (the Nikkei 225 was up 0.69%) and Europe.

Reasons to be cautious still abound however, with the Reserve Bank of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overnight view that China is seeing a modest slowdown in growth reminding us that all is not entirely rosy out there, and this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline in German industrial production added to this impression, coming as it does after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grim factory orders data.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b695e24e4b03096a5adfc1b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-07T09:00:36.037Z\">10.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The positive mood in stock markets is holding up as the morning progresses.</p> <p>With copper prices edging higher, mining shares are leading the FTSE 100 higher, with the leading UK index now up 0.69%.

There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still plenty of evidence that shifting consumer habits are supportive and while the hot weather took the shine off the second quarter numbers a little, the World Cup offered some compensation. However, investment in its international expansion weighed on profit growth.</p> <p>Underlying profits rose 2.5% but on a statutory basis profits were down 10% due to a load of exceptional costs that seem to have mounted: \u00c2\u00a31.9m from its Warrington supply chain centre, a \u00c2\u00a32.1m hit from Norway as it transforms Dolly Dimples into Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, \u00c2\u00a31.4m from joint venture store conversion in Germany and a further \u00c2\u00a34.2m from tax, amortisation and German Market Access Fee increase charges recognised on the income statement as non-underlying items.

However, it could become a bumpy ride over the summer months. July, August and sometimes September months are notorious for even more volatility, given the start and end of the vacation period. The usual suspect is the car sector. In the last five years, auto production embarked on a wild rollercoaster four times. Auto companies ramp up their production before the summer holidays with a technical setback following suit one month later. This effect then plays havoc with the headline figures in the corresponding two months.</p> <p>...Next week on 14 August, German GDP growth for the second quarter will be released.

On the year, industrial production was still up by 2.5%. The drop in industrial activity was broadly-based. After three strong months, activity in the construction sector also weakened, declining by 3.2% MoM. At the same time, exports held up relatively well, despite the delayed impact from last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro strengthening and trade tensions, remaining flat in June after a 1.8% MoM increase in May. As imports increased by 1.2% MoM, the seasonally-adjusted trade surplus narrowed to 19.3bn euro, from 20.4bn euro in May.</p> <p>After yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing new orders data, speculations about an imminent downswing of the German economy have gained new momentum. Intuitively, weak June data can be associated with trade tensions. However, in our view, this intuition is not so straight-forward. The analysis of the German economy requires more nuances. Here is our take on the state of the economy.</p> <p>1. Despite this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointments, comparing economic activity data with first quarter data still points to solid growth in Q2. Construction, industrial output and consumption should all be growth drivers, not drags, in Q2. Therefore, next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP data could easily outperform the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.3% growth rate</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eac6622ce5b06b20d60d6445bdf071e8f9aff690\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eac6622ce5b06b20d60d6445bdf071e8f9aff690/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volkswagen cars wait to be shipped at the harbour in Bremerhaven, nothern Germany.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volkswagen cars wait to be shipped at the harbour in Bremerhaven, nothern Germany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrik Stollarz/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>2. Looking at bilateral trade data, German exports have gone through a slight structural shift since the start of the year. While the share of German exports to the US is currently lower than in 2017, the share of other Eurozone countries like the Netherlands, Italy or Spain has actually increased.</p> <p>3. At least in the short run, weakening demand for German products as illustrated by yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing new orders data could actually bring some relief. Particularly the manufacturing sector has been suffering from severe supply-side constraints, with capacity utilisation at its highest level since early 2008, a high lack of qualified workers and equipment as a limiting factor. Orders books are still richly filled and it would take a while before a protracted decline in demand would show in activity data.</p> <p>4. Trade tensions are weighing on sentiment, not on activity. Obviously, trade tensions are the biggest threat to the German economy at the current juncture. Not so much due to tariffs or the possibility of tariffs but simply due to the fact that a potential trade war brings uncertainty and uncertainty brings a delay in investment decisions.</p> <p>All of this means that reading and understanding the German economy has become more complex. The long series of one-offs explaining the monthly, often highly volatile, ups and downs of German macro data since the start of the year has further complicated things. Just think of the harsh winter weather, strikes, timing of Easter and long weekends. For now, the only thing that is for sure is that the economy has lost its stellar performance but this does not mean at all that it has become an underperformer. Complexity does not mean failure.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b693a7ee4b03096a5adfb6d\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-07T06:45:41.020Z\">7.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Agenda: Pound in focus, German industrial output disappoints</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong></p> <p>With growing concerns about a no-deal Brexit in the past couple of days - as warned by such diverse personalities as Bank of England governor Mark Carney and Sir Liam Fox - the pound hit an 11 month low on Monday.</p> <p>However there has been a bit of relief for sterling - and UK holidaymakers heading overseas - in early trading today.

It has gained a little ground against the dollar - up 0.03% - but is still in negative territory against the euro - down 0.37%. Oil prices are on the rise after the US introduced a new series of sanctions against Iran, prompting concerns about crude supplies. Brent crude is currently 0.9% higher at $74.42 a barrel. Meanwhile analysts at S&amp;P have warned that the US-Chinese trade row could move from goods to services. On the economic front, UK house prices grew by 1.4% month on month in July, a better result than had been expected, while consumer spending remains strong, according to Barclays. But in Germany there were disappointing industrial output figures, a day after a fall in factory orders. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The rise in the oil price has lifted US energy stocks and pushed Wall Street higher at the open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 0.4% or 101 points while the S&amp;P 500 has opened up 0.23% and the Nasdaq Composite is 0.28% better. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full story on the Halifax house price survey: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest story on the US sanctions on Iran: Donald Trump has warned America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading partners that anyone who does business with Iran will not be doing business with the US, after his administration reimposed blanket sanctions. The US president described the new sanctions, which hit Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s access to dollars, gold and precious metals, as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the most biting ever imposed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In November they ratchet up to yet another level,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he tweeted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States. I am asking for WORLD PEACE, nothing less!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Within hours of the sanctions taking effect, the German carmaker Daimler, which announced a joint venture in Iran last year, said it was halting its business activities in the country. The punitive measures came into force in the early hours of Tuesday, and follow Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision in May to renege on the landmark 2015 deal to curtail Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear ambitions. The sanctions also target a range of industries, including Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carmaking sector, and will be followed by a set of additional and even more stringent measures by 4 November, including an embargo on the import of Iranian oil and sanctions on its banking sector. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest comments appear aimed at the EU, which is attempting to protect European businesses from the sanctions and has vowed to safeguard firms. Companies have been instructed that they should not comply with demands from the White House for them to drop all business with Iran. Those who decide to pull out because of US sanctions will need to be granted authorisation from the European commission, without which they face the risk of being sued by EU member states. The full report is here: US markets are expected to open higher: The VIX index - a measure of the stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectation of volatility - is heading lower. It is currently down 2% at 11.03 having earlier fallen to 10.9, the lowest level since January. The US-China trade battle could spill over from goods into services, according to S&amp;P Global Ratings. The S&amp;P report ssays: This is because China is running out of room to retaliate on goods.. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent threat to impose tariffs of 5% to 25% on a further $60 billion worth of U.S. goods (5,207 product lines) means that, together with the $50 billion of goods already announced, about 85% of its American imports (totaling $130 billion in 2017) could be taxed. The threat is in response to the Trump administration last week announcing that it may increase its proposed tariff rate on Chinese imports valued at about $200 billion to 25% from 10%. Together with the previously-announced tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports, the total amount of $250 billion represents about 50% of the value of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual exports to the U.S. in 2017. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With China running out of room to retaliate on goods (i.e., 85% versus 50% coverage), China could opt to pursue non-tariff actions affecting services and investments from the U.S.,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said S&amp;P Global Ratings analyst David Tesher. The U.S. has a net services surplus with China. A retaliation that spilled over into services could hurt U.S. sectors that rely on China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expanding import market for growth. This step-up in tensions could also exacerbate investor worries about China, damaging business and consumer confidence and growth prospects. We note that the trade tension is already weighing on the Chinese currency and stock market sentiment. Oil prices are continuing to rise in the wake of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Iranian sanctions. Brent crude is now up 1.27% at $74.69 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has climbed 0.94% to $69.66. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB, says: The US has reimposed sanctions against this morning, with an executive order signed by President Trump that targets financial transactions involving the US dollar, the purchase of commercial plans and metals including gold and the Iranian automotive sector coming into effect. From a financial markets point of view, the price of crude oil could be where these decisions are most keenly felt, with the increased animosity threatening to disrupt Tehran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significant output. This is unlikely to be reflected immediately, with Iranian production expected to remain at present levels for the time being, but should further more stringent sanctions come into play then we could well be set for a supply shock in the oil market which would trigger a sharp move higher. The complex nature of this situation means that it is not just the US and Iran that could be impacted, with the bulk of Iranian crude actually being sold to other countries. The issue lies in whether the US look to force allies to also shun oil from Iran, and if this occurs then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real chance that OPEC will struggle to make up the lost supply and this would drive the price of oil up. Back with the Iran sanctions, and President Trump has just tweeted: UK consumers are continuing to spend, boosted by the World Cup and the heatwave, according to the latest Barclays trend survey, although there are reasons to be cautious about the outlook. Spending grew by 5% year on year in July, the third consecutive month with spending growth around this level. Barclays said: [This] is the strongest consistent growth in our data history. UK domestic sectors have held up year to date and resilient spending should continue to support their near-term performance. It said the strength came from in-store spending, which grew by 2.9%, the strongest growth since April 2014. Online spending grew by 10.4%, which is weaker compared to the historical data. And Barclays warned: There are reasons to be cautious, as consumers remain negative about the general economy and appetite for large purchases remains muted. Outside influences, such as oil price inflation and FX, combine to push up spending on Petrol. Consumer confidence moved slightly lower in July, as negativity about the general economy persists. The appetite for major purchases remained muted, with consumers cautious about making significant spending commitments, evident in subdued spending on electronics, furniture, household appliances and vehicle sales. Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at AJ Bell, said: This summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heat wave and World Cup fever boosted consumer spending in July, with people spending on picnics, BBQs and pubs. People are making the most of the sunshine as spending on food increased 6.7% in the month, while more families are also going on day trips and doing outdoor activities. The World Cup effect also continued to boost spending in the month, with money spent in pubs rising 73% on the day of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s semi-final, as people cheered on their team. Overall the amount shelled out in pubs increased by 17% in July \u00e2\u20ac\u201c marking the biggest rise since April last year. However, the hangover is looming as people admit they are worried about the effect of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise on their finances. The 0.25 percentage point hike last week will hit those who are in debt, including many who are already struggling to make ends meet. A third of those questioned said they were worried that the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move would mean they have less money each month, while confidence in finances among those questioned dropped by 6 percentage points to 59%. This cautiousness is also shown in the fact that households are still putting off buying big ticket items. A reasonably strong performance from US markets on Monday is one of the reasons for a more positive mood in Asia (the Nikkei 225 was up 0.69%) and Europe. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: UK and European markets have rallied this morning, carrying the baton over from last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better showing for US markets. Confidence has returned as the S&amp;P 500 moseys its way to towards the January record high, and it remains encouraging to see stock markets hold their ground despite a drumbeat of trade war headlines of late. Earnings season is shaping up very well indeed, which accounts for why US equities remain comfortably ahead of the likes of Europe, but a rising tide lifts all boats and will reinforce the impression that this economic recovery and its associated bull market has further to run. Reasons to be cautious still abound however, with the Reserve Bank of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overnight view that China is seeing a modest slowdown in growth reminding us that all is not entirely rosy out there, and this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline in German industrial production added to this impression, coming as it does after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grim factory orders data. The positive mood in stock markets is holding up as the morning progresses. With copper prices edging higher, mining shares are leading the FTSE 100 higher, with the leading UK index now up 0.69%. Oil is also giving support, with crude moving ahead on the prospect of curtailed supplies from Iran following the imposition of US sanctions on the country. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up 0.95% while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.84%. There are a few notes of caution over UK house prices despite the stronger than expected Halifax data. Jonathan Samuels, chief executive of property lender, Octane Capital, said: It would be premature to pop the champagne corks on the back of this seemingly robust data. The annual rate of growth may have shot up between June and July but weak supply rather than robust demand is the primary driver. The market might look punchy on the outside but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pallid on the inside. Transaction levels overall are low and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see them picking up materially in the months ahead as Brexit uncertainty heightens. The impact of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise remains to be seen. While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a massive hit in real terms, how it impacts sentiment is key. The jobs market is holding up but the direction of inflation and wage growth will be key as we enter the latter part of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, is also wary: Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, said: The market has seen far too many false dawns to allow itself to get carried away by these surprisingly strong numbers. Yet with the rate of annual price growth rising to its highest level so far this year, the progress is no flash in the pan. Rather it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the result of the tussle between pent-up demand and chronically low supply. That tussle continues, even if the last two months have seen increases in both the number of mortgage approvals and the number of homes coming onto the market. The modest momentum could also be given a short-term boost by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increase in interest rates, which, rather than cooling the market, may spur previously hesitant buyers into action during the typically busy \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcback to school\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 season next month. Yet the future course of the market is delicately balanced. With even Cabinet ministers now warning that a no-deal Brexit is more likely than an orderly exit from the EU, investment buyers are dialling up their caution. For everyone else, softening prices and better affordability are creating some attractive buying opportunities, but the market remains deeply polarised, with pockets of value and activity pulling different regions in opposing directions. Markets are holding on to their opening gains, limited though they may be. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex said: After yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war-fearing, Brexit-bitten session, the markets got off to a brighter start on Tuesday, without really any reason to do so. Though it still couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t break out of its recent trading bracket, the FTSE at least pushed to the upper end of it after the bell, climbing 25 points to hit 7685. The index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main boost came from the commodity sector. With copper up 0.7% the likes of Rio Tinto and Anglo American rose anywhere between 1.3% and 2%, while BP and Shell jumped 0.8% and 0.5% respectively as Brent Crude crossed $74 per barrel following the resumption of the US sanctions on Iran. Meanwhile sterling is currently up 0.13% against the dollar at $1.2958 but has dipped 0.1% against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1192. Across the Atlantic, the futures market is pointing to a positive start on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average expected to open around 70 points higher. Signs of life in the UK housing market with a better than expected report from mortgage lender Halifax. House prices rose 1.4% month on month in July, compared to expectations of a 0.2% increase, according to the Halifax. The 3.3% year on year increase was higher than the forecast 2.7% gain. But managing director Russell Galley said: Whilst the quarterly and annual rates of house price growth have improved, housing activity remains soft. Sterling is set for continued volatility in the run up to Brexit day next March, according to Thanos Vamvakidis, head of G-10 foreign exchange strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He told CNBC: If we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a deal, sterling can be weaker by about 10 percent, (or) even lower. If you get a deal, any deal, \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. (sterling) can be up by 10 percent. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think any other currency can have this kind of moves in the next few months. The comments echo those of Capital Economics on Monday, who said the pound could fall to $1.20 if no deal is agreed between the UK and EU. As expected, markets have got off to a slow start in Europe, but a mainly positive one. The FTSE 100 is up 0.28%, helped by a rise in commodity stocks following the stronger oil price, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.32% and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up 0.48%. One of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bigger UK fallers is Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pizza, with analysts pointing to the cost of international expansion and some caution about the outlook. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pizza reported another firm set of half-year numbers this morning as the investment in digital, especially mobile, pays off in terms of driving top line sales. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still plenty of evidence that shifting consumer habits are supportive and while the hot weather took the shine off the second quarter numbers a little, the World Cup offered some compensation. However, investment in its international expansion weighed on profit growth. Underlying profits rose 2.5% but on a statutory basis profits were down 10% due to a load of exceptional costs that seem to have mounted: \u00c2\u00a31.9m from its Warrington supply chain centre, a \u00c2\u00a32.1m hit from Norway as it transforms Dolly Dimples into Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, \u00c2\u00a31.4m from joint venture store conversion in Germany and a further \u00c2\u00a34.2m from tax, amortisation and German Market Access Fee increase charges recognised on the income statement as non-underlying items. Nevertheless the underlying picture remains positive. We note the company expects fewer stores to open this year, with management suggesting 60 new outlets in 2018 versus the 65-75 anticipated in April. This seems to reflect a more focused and disciplined approach to openings in what is undoubtedly a trickier market, but it might also signal some deeper worries about the UK market. Indeed, management struck a very cautious tone over the UK, saying that the trading environment \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccontinues to be uncertain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The June data for Germany so far has been uniformly weak, says Dr Andreas Rees, economist at UniCredit Bank: Industrial production declined 0.9% mom, while exports treaded water (yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new orders: -4.0%). However, in all three cases, the decreases (or stagnation) came after strong rises in the previous month. Going forward, we expect a moderate acceleration in the industrial sector on average, driven by global trade and solid domestic demand. However, it could become a bumpy ride over the summer months. July, August and sometimes September months are notorious for even more volatility, given the start and end of the vacation period. The usual suspect is the car sector. In the last five years, auto production embarked on a wild rollercoaster four times. Auto companies ramp up their production before the summer holidays with a technical setback following suit one month later. This effect then plays havoc with the headline figures in the corresponding two months. ...Next week on 14 August, German GDP growth for the second quarter will be released. We expect a plus of 0.4% qoq (or about 1\u00c2\u00bd% annualised) with the forecast risks skewed to the downside (for 2018 as a whole: +2.0%). The disappointing industrial figures from Germany do not necessarily mean the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is heading for trouble, suggests ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski: German industrial production took a hit in June, dropping by 0.9% MoM, from 2.4% MoM in May. On the year, industrial production was still up by 2.5%. The drop in industrial activity was broadly-based. After three strong months, activity in the construction sector also weakened, declining by 3.2% MoM. At the same time, exports held up relatively well, despite the delayed impact from last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro strengthening and trade tensions, remaining flat in June after a 1.8% MoM increase in May. As imports increased by 1.2% MoM, the seasonally-adjusted trade surplus narrowed to 19.3bn euro, from 20.4bn euro in May. After yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing new orders data, speculations about an imminent downswing of the German economy have gained new momentum. Intuitively, weak June data can be associated with trade tensions. However, in our view, this intuition is not so straight-forward. The analysis of the German economy requires more nuances. Here is our take on the state of the economy. 1. Despite this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointments, comparing economic activity data with first quarter data still points to solid growth in Q2. Construction, industrial output and consumption should all be growth drivers, not drags, in Q2. Therefore, next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP data could easily outperform the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.3% growth rate 2. Looking at bilateral trade data, German exports have gone through a slight structural shift since the start of the year. While the share of German exports to the US is currently lower than in 2017, the share of other Eurozone countries like the Netherlands, Italy or Spain has actually increased. 3. At least in the short run, weakening demand for German products as illustrated by yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing new orders data could actually bring some relief. Particularly the manufacturing sector has been suffering from severe supply-side constraints, with capacity utilisation at its highest level since early 2008, a high lack of qualified workers and equipment as a limiting factor. Orders books are still richly filled and it would take a while before a protracted decline in demand would show in activity data. 4. Trade tensions are weighing on sentiment, not on activity. Obviously, trade tensions are the biggest threat to the German economy at the current juncture. Not so much due to tariffs or the possibility of tariffs but simply due to the fact that a potential trade war brings uncertainty and uncertainty brings a delay in investment decisions. All of this means that reading and understanding the German economy has become more complex. The long series of one-offs explaining the monthly, often highly volatile, ups and downs of German macro data since the start of the year has further complicated things. Just think of the harsh winter weather, strikes, timing of Easter and long weekends. For now, the only thing that is for sure is that the economy has lost its stellar performance but this does not mean at all that it has become an underperformer. Complexity does not mean failure. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With growing concerns about a no-deal Brexit in the past couple of days - as warned by such diverse personalities as Bank of England governor Mark Carney and Sir Liam Fox - the pound hit an 11 month low on Monday. However there has been a bit of relief for sterling - and UK holidaymakers heading overseas - in early trading today. Against the dollar the pound has edged up 0.12% to $1.2956, while against the euro it is virtually flat at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1199. Markets have other things to worry about too, with the continuing trade tensions between the US and China, and now the resumption of US sanctions on Iran. The latest move by the Trump administration has helped push the oil price higher on concerns about curtailed supplies from Iran. Brent crude is currently 0.37% better at $74.02 a barrel. A rising oil price is expected to lift commodity companies, and along with the weaker pound, should help the FTSE 100 to edge higher. Other European markets are also expected to move ahead, albeit only slightly: There is not much on the agenda in terms of economic news, but the key figures from Germany are already out. German industrial output fell 0.9% in June compared to forecasts of a 0.5% decline, while the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus has come in at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac19.3bn, lower than the expected \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20.3bn. In terms of company news US billionaire Stan Kroenke, the majority owner of Arsenal football club, has made an offer to buy the rest of the club he does not already own. He has secured the backing of minority stakeholder Alisher Usmanov for a deal which values the premier league club at \u00c2\u00a31.8bn. Elsewhere car dealer Pendragon has reported a 41% drop in profits to \u00c2\u00a328.4m, with car sales hit by the scandal over diesel vehicles and the consumer uncertainty caused by Brexit. But Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pizza has boosted half year sales by 12.8%, boosted by consumers ordering takeaways during the world cup and a continuing rise in online orders.",

His conclusion was almost alarmist: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This puts at risk the post-war economic and security order.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>For its part, RIT is keeping a very low exposure to stock markets of just 47%. Warren Buffett, the most successful investor alive today, is similarly in risk-off mode as he sits on large sums of cash and grumbles about how everything is too expensive to buy. Take note of these octogenarians. They have seen a few market cycles.</p> <h2>Merger looks a defensive move</h2> <p>The integration of <a href=\"https://www.standardlifeaberdeen.com/\">Standard Life Aberdeen</a> (SLA) is proceeding splendidly, shareholders are told, and the rationale for combining two of Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big fund managers is more compelling than it was 18 months ago. So the share price must be flying, right? Not exactly. It rose on Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s half-year figures but has fallen 20% since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/06/job-losses-likely-standard-life-aberdeen-asset-management-merger\">the deal was unveiled</a> in March last year.</p> <p>Martin Gilbert and Keith Skeoch, co-chief executives, offered excuses aplenty. Conditions for asset managers, at least those not called BlackRock or Vanguard, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continue to be challenging\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Money is still leaking towards passive funds and away from active managers like SLA. Stock market rewards, especially in the US, have been concentrated among 20-odd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd technology companies, which again is bad news if your specialism is picking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153value\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd stocks. And the pressure on fees remains downwards.</p> <p>Those points are all true but they also suggest that a successful rewiring of SLA could be a long haul. At the half-year stage, pre-tax profits fell from \u00c2\u00a3355m to \u00c2\u00a3311m, ignoring the contribution from the insurance operations that are being sold. The benefit of the merger cost savings are still awaited and SLA is only about a third of the way through the process.</p> <p>More alarming, however, was another net outflow of funds, this time of \u00c2\u00a316.6bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a shade over 2% of the \u00c2\u00a3610bn of the funds under management, whistled Gilbert cheerfully. Well, yes, but most of the money seems to be fleeing from products that the two firms were independently famous for \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the GARs multi-strategy fund on the Standard Life side, and emerging markets and global equities funds at the Aberdeen end.</p> <p>The better news is that the new money is arriving into investment products, which will help the attempt to reduce reliance on blockbuster funds. Meanwhile, the joint venture in India, HDFC, got off to a flyer on its local stock market debut this week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c SLA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stake for all its Indian assets could be as much as \u00c2\u00a34.5bn. Therein lies the case for patience: a strong balance sheet and the chance to reverse the outflows over time.</p> <p>But let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not pretend this was a merger from strength. It looks more defensive as the months pass and the share price refuses to re-rate.</p> <h2>Directing the right retirement package</h2> <p>When <a href=\"https://www.hsbc.co.uk/\">HSBC</a> announced in June that Iain Mackay would soon be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153retiring\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, we assumed the finance director would be retiring from bean-counting for good. Who could blame him? Eight years tackling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/hsbcholdings\">HSBC</a>\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complexities is probably enough for anyone. But now, even before Mackay has escaped HSBC, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/glaxosmithkline\">GlaxoSmithKline</a> (GSK) has hired him as its new finance director from January.</p> <p>The personal package is roughly the same \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a33.5m-ish for an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on target\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd year. But the cute part, from GSK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s point of view, is that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to buy Mackay out of his long-term incentives at HSBC. Since his retirement had been announced, and GSK only approached him afterwards, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up to the bank to honour its contractual obligations. Good move.</p>",

Merger looks a defensive move The integration of Standard Life Aberdeen (SLA) is proceeding splendidly, shareholders are told, and the rationale for combining two of Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big fund managers is more compelling than it was 18 months ago. So the share price must be flying, right? Not exactly. It rose on Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s half-year figures but has fallen 20% since the deal was unveiled in March last year. Martin Gilbert and Keith Skeoch, co-chief executives, offered excuses aplenty. Conditions for asset managers, at least those not called BlackRock or Vanguard, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continue to be challenging\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Money is still leaking towards passive funds and away from active managers like SLA. Stock market rewards, especially in the US, have been concentrated among 20-odd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd technology companies, which again is bad news if your specialism is picking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153value\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd stocks. And the pressure on fees remains downwards. Those points are all true but they also suggest that a successful rewiring of SLA could be a long haul. At the half-year stage, pre-tax profits fell from \u00c2\u00a3355m to \u00c2\u00a3311m, ignoring the contribution from the insurance operations that are being sold. The benefit of the merger cost savings are still awaited and SLA is only about a third of the way through the process. More alarming, however, was another net outflow of funds, this time of \u00c2\u00a316.6bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a shade over 2% of the \u00c2\u00a3610bn of the funds under management, whistled Gilbert cheerfully. Well, yes, but most of the money seems to be fleeing from products that the two firms were independently famous for \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the GARs multi-strategy fund on the Standard Life side, and emerging markets and global equities funds at the Aberdeen end. The better news is that the new money is arriving into investment products, which will help the attempt to reduce reliance on blockbuster funds. Meanwhile, the joint venture in India, HDFC, got off to a flyer on its local stock market debut this week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c SLA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stake for all its Indian assets could be as much as \u00c2\u00a34.5bn. Therein lies the case for patience: a strong balance sheet and the chance to reverse the outflows over time. But let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not pretend this was a merger from strength. It looks more defensive as the months pass and the share price refuses to re-rate. Directing the right retirement package When HSBC announced in June that Iain Mackay would soon be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153retiring\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, we assumed the finance director would be retiring from bean-counting for good. Who could blame him? Eight years tackling HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complexities is probably enough for anyone. But now, even before Mackay has escaped HSBC, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has hired him as its new finance director from January. The personal package is roughly the same \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a33.5m-ish for an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on target\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd year. But the cute part, from GSK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s point of view, is that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to buy Mackay out of his long-term incentives at HSBC. Since his retirement had been announced, and GSK only approached him afterwards, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up to the bank to honour its contractual obligations. Good move.",

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap. The trade dispute between the US and China has escalated further, as neither side shows any appetite for backing down. The Chinese government unveiled tariffs on $16bn of American goods today. Medical equipment, fuels, fish meal, wood waste, paper and paper waste, metal scraps, cars and bicycles are all on list of products targeted. Beijing was retaliating against Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to slap tariffs on an extra $16bn of Chinese goods overnight. These latest tit-for-tat moves mean there are levies on $50bn of goods moving each way between the two countries. So far, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy seems to be holding up under the strain. Trade figures released overnight showed that exports rose by 12.2% year-on-year in July, while exports jumped by over 27%. The decision to allow the yuan to fall against the US dollar may be supporting manufacturers, analysts say. But if the situation escalates, the global economy could be badly hurt. With the two sides deadlocked, a ship full of soybeans has been anchored off China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coast for a month - as its owners ponder whether to swallow the tariffs. Fears of a hard Brexit have hurt the pound again. Sterling fell to an 11-month low against the US dollar, at $1.2854. Against the euro, it dropped to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1091, a nine-month low. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, explains why traders are worried: he possibility of a no-deal Brexit has been looming over the pound for a while now but it seems to have asserted itself in traders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds even more this week since Bank of England governor Mark Carney said that the likelihood was now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncomfortably high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a sentiment later echoed by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade secretary Liam Fox. Elsewhere in the markets, Tesla board members have confirmed they are evaluating whether to take the electric car market private. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still some cynicism, though, as to whether Elon Musk will actually pull the idea off. And the oil price has slipped, due to trade war worries and a smaller-than-expected drop in US crude inventories. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. GW It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a month since the US and China imposed their first wave of tariffs, in early July. And ever since, a cargo ship full of soybeans has been waiting at anchor off the port of Dalian. Having failed to reach China before the deadline, the vessel is in limbo while its owners decide what to do. If they unload the beans now, they (or the buyer) would incur hefty tariffs. My colleague Rob Davies has been looking into the issue, and explains: A shipment of soybeans worth more than $20m (\u00c2\u00a315.5m) has been bobbing aimlessly in the Pacific Ocean for a month, a casualty of the escalating trade war between China and the US. Lingering uncertainty over the cargo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fate offered a timely reminder of the fallout from a dispute that intensified on Wednesday, as the US president, Donald Trump, unveiled a second round of tariffs on $16bn of Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to respond in kind. The Peak Pegasus, a 229 metre bulk carrier weighing 43,000 tonnes, has become the reluctant symbol of the potential consequences of this tit-for-tat trade spat. The ship, owned by JP Morgan Asset Management, was scheduled to unload about 70,000 tonnes of American soybeans in the Chinese port of Dalian on 6 July, shortly after Trump imposed a first round of tariffs on $34bn-worth of goods. As it rushed to shore in the hope of clearing customs before Beijing imposed retaliatory tariffs, the ship \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and its protein-rich cargo \u00e2\u20ac\u201c became an unlikely internet sensation on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. However, the vessel arrived just too late and has been sailing around in circles ever since while the cargo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owners, understood to be the agricultural commodity trading house Louis Dreyfus, decide what to do.... More here: The US-China trade row is also being blamed for falling oil prices today. Brent crude has tumbled by 3.5% today to $71.99 per barrel, while US crude is down 3.8% at $66.60. Economists are citing the risks to global growth posed by tariffs Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy in London, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US-China trade war is set to worsen, and its impact on oil prices will be gradual as the situation develops. Crude oil and refined products affected by additional duties will reduce their competitiveness in the Chinese market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The latest oil inventory figures from America have also hit the oil price. Crude inventories fell by 1.4 million barrels in the latest week, less than half the 3.3 million barrel draw analysts had expected. Trade wars can have many casualties. And the dispute between America and China is threatening the future of a paper mill in the state of Arkansas. Associated Press has the details: A Chinese company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement two years ago that it would spend more than $1 billion and hire hundreds of workers for a paper mill on the outskirts of this rural college town was seen as a much-needed shot in the arm for the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. A web video promoting Arkadelphia \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great place to call home!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd continues to tout the Sun Paper project and its potential to generate jobs and boost development. But optimism has been giving way to concern in recent months amid President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s escalating trade dispute with China. The threat of a full-blown trade war has delayed the project further and prompted the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governor to send his top economic development official to China to make sure it stays on track. It also has caused other Chinese companies considering investing in Arkansas to put their plans on hold. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like a dark cloud hanging over the future of the project,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stephen Bell, the president and chief executive officer of the Arkadelphia Area Chamber of Commerce. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Right now, the clouds are off on the horizon. But I think no one knows where the trade situation is going right now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... More here. By announcing new tariffs today, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is sticking firmly to its tit-for-tat policy on trade, says Art Hogan, chief market strategist at investment bank B. Riley. That means that the trade war is likely to escalate, Hogan warns (via CNN): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our $16 billion comes at a scheduled time, which comes up on the 23rd. China said we see your $16 billion and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll match your $16 billion.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pretty much match what we do until they have no more levers to pull. The bad news is the trade war fears in China are escalating. The major concern right now in trade is China. In case you missed this earlier, we learned overnight that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imports and exports both rose in July. Exports jumped by over 12% year on year, indicating that the trade war hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t caused serious damage yet. These photos from Lianyungang Port, in the Jiangsu Province of China, show that plenty of vehicle were lined up for shipment today: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest wave of tariffs haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spooked the US stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 24 points, or just 0.1%, while the broader S&amp;P 500 index is flat. David Madden of CMC Markets explains why traders aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panicking: Markets had a muted reaction to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement that it plans to impose tariffs on $16 billion worth of US goods, starting on 23 August. The token retaliation from Beijing keeps the trade spat alive, and it seems like China were doing it to send a message, rather than to inflict financial pain on the US. So far, China has managed a tit-for-tat response to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade tariffs -- including today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation to US plans for tariffs on $16bn of Chinese goods. But Beijing can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t respond in kind if Donald Trump implements his threat for 25% tariffs on an extra $200bn of goods, simply because China doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buy enough from America. Oliver Jones of Capital Economics thinks Beijing might change course, and target individual US companies. He writes: While China has so far responded to US tariffs primarily with duties of its own, it is reaching the limit of its ability to respond in this way. There are already signs that China is starting to target US multinationals operating there directly instead. We think that its response will increasingly take this form if the US imposes tariffs beyond those already in the pipeline. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 take on the US-China tariffs row: China is slapping additional import tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion worth of U.S. goods ranging from oil and steel products to autos and medical equipment, the commerce ministry said, as the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies escalate their trade dispute. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a very unreasonable practice,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the commerce ministry said on its website http://www.mofcom.gov.cn, responding to the United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision to slap 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion of Chinese goods on Aug 23. The slump in sterling today has given the London stock exchange a boost. The FTSE 100 has gained 43 points, or 0.5%, to 7761 points. With the pound lower, multinational\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overseas earnings are worth more in sterling terms (updated). Basically the Footsie is acting as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcup\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 side of the see-saw, as the pound drops - currently down 0.5% against the US dollar to around $1.287. Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have dipped in early trading, down $2.5 at around $377. Wall Street may not be convinced that the company is definitely being taken private, following that announcement from the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board. After all, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taking the appropriate next steps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is rater more guarded than Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bold claim that he has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153funding secured\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to take Tesla off the stock market at $420 per share. Newsflash: Electric car maker Tesla has issued a statement, in response to founder Elon Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments yesterday about taking the company off the stock market. Tesla says that Musk \u00e2\u20ac\u0153opened discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd last week with the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board about taking it private, to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better serve\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd its long-term interests. The board have met several times since, and are now evaluating the idea. Yesterday, Musk insisted that he had secured the funding to take Tesla private - even though it would be the biggest buyout ever. Leaving the stock market would take some pressure off Tesla, as it battles to hit its production targets... However, some financial analysts are sceptical that the plan would really work: American scrap metal and waste paper will also incur 25% tariffs at the Chinese border in two weeks. So, apparently, will US \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fish meal for feed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (which I think is used to nourish farmed fish, poultry and pork). China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new retaliatory tariffs will apply to 333 US products. Coal, diesel, cars and bicycles, medical equipment and steel products are all on the list, the Chinese commerce department says. Newsflash: China has announced it will impose retaliatory 25% tariffs on $16bn of US goods. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commerce ministry says it has been forced to retaliate to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very unreasonable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd levies on $16bn of Chinese exports (announced last night). China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measures will kick-in on August 23, the same day as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest levies, as it sticks to its policy of respond in kind to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade moves. So in two weeks, the two countries will be imposing tariffs on $50bn of each others goods. American officials are already working on plans for tariffs on another $200bn of Chinese products in September. Reuters reports that City traders are taking steps to protect themselves against sterling falling further: Nine-month and one-year sterling/dollar risk-reversals fell on Wednesday to the lowest since early-March 2017, as investors rushed to protect themselves from further weakness in the British currency. Risk reversals are a gauge of investor expectations for a currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s direction and are used to hedge against expected moves. The fall in sterling risk reversals indicates greater demand for put options, derivatives that give investors the right to sell an asset. This is from Miles Eakers of foreign exchange firm Centtrip: Sterling is being hit by fears of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno-deal Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, says Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM. Sterling was pounded by the Dollar and most of its major counterparts on Wednesday as fears heightened over the UK exiting the European Union without a trade deal in place. Concerns of a potential hard Brexit scenario have haunted investor attraction towards the Pound and have left the currency vulnerable to downside shocks. The selloff is gathering pace. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest damage: Pound vs US dollar: $1.286, an 11-month low Pound vs euro: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.109, a nine-month low Economics lecturer Daniel McLaughlin says the slide in the pound is bad news for UK consumers: [It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that a weaker currency makes exports more competitive, but it also makes imported raw materials pricier - so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not an undiluted win] Newsflash: The euro has risen over 90p against the pound for the first time since last autumn. Jordan Rochester of Japanese bank Nomura predicts the pound will keep falling ahead of the next crunch EU summit in October - when Theresa May will try to persuade leaders to back her \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcChequers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 deal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We remain bearish on the pound in the short term until the Brexit mess is out the way and look for the currency to enter a $1.27-1.28 range before the leaders summit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ouch! The pound just fell through $1.29 for the first time since August 2017. UK holidaymakers heading to Europe this summer just suffered a blow. The pound has weakened against the euro to its lowest level since last November, meaning trips across the channel have become a little more expensive. Sterling fell as low as \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1129, down 0.25% today. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all! Sterling has dropped to a new 11-month low against the US dollar, at $1.2909, and is also weaker against the yen and the Swiss franc. The pound has been under pressure this week, after trade secretary Liam Fox claimed that Britain was likely to leave the EU without a deal. Such a hard-Brexit could lead to chaos at the borders, and leave companies struggling to keep their supply chains running Christophe Barraud, an economist at Market Securities brokerage in Paris, has told Reuters that firms are trying to protect themselves from a sterling crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of companies can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait for the negotiations outcome in October so a lot of course are trying to hedge against a drop in the pound.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ANZ senior China economist Betty Wang agrees that Chinese factories have benefitted from the weaker yuan - even if Beijing hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been fighting a currency war. She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Currency devaluation, which may have helped exports to some extent, has been largely market-driven in our view and is not a preferred policy tool by Chinese policy makers as part of the retaliation measures.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Figures released earlier this week showed that Beijing hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been burning through its foreign exchange reserves, suggesting it has been allowing the yuan to drop rather than fighting it: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market suffered losses today, after America finalised its plans for tariffs on another $16bn of exports. The Shanghai composite index fell by 1.2%, as traders worried that the trade war keeps ratcheting up. Washington might be disappointed to see that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imports and exports actually rose in July, says Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: If the US was hoping that its $34bn opening salvo of tariffs would have an effect on Chinese exports this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s China trade numbers would have been a disappointment to them. Chinese exports for July saw a rise of 12.2% up from 11.2% in June, supporting the premise that for the moment we seem to be in a bit of a phoney war. We also saw a big rise in imports of 27.3% showing that domestic demand remains quite strong. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus with America remained close to a record high in July, despite the trade dispute. Reuters explains: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closely watched surplus with the United States dipped only slightly to $28.09 billion last month from a record $28.97 billion in June. Washington has long criticised China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus with the United States and has demanded Beijing cut it. Still, disagreements between the two major economic powers run deeper than just the trade balance and tensions remain over market access, intellectual property, technology transfer and investment. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. America has fired another shot in the deepening trade dispute with China. Overnight, Washington said it would impose a 25% tariff on $16bn of Chinese imports, taking the total amount being targeted to $50bn. The new levy will come into force on August 23rd, and will apply to 279 product types. It mostly affects industrial products, such as machinery, chemicals and semiconductors. Motorcycles and railway cars also feature. Announcing the move, the US trade representative declared that America was penalising China for stealing its intellectual property, saying: China directs and unfairly facilitates the systematic investment in, and acquisition of, U.S. companies and assets to generate large-scale technology transfer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. China is likely to retaliate soon, escalating the dispute that has been rumbling for weeks. But... China may not be suffering from the trade war yet. Data released this morning shows that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exports jumped 12.2% year-on-year in July, beating expectations. Imports surged by a sparkling 27.3% - meaning China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus shrank during the month to $28bn (from over $41bn in June). This is significant, as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first wave of tariffs (on $34bn of Chinese goods) began in early July. Those tariffs have been blamed for a drop in German factory orders, but today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures suggest China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is holding firm. Of course, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still early days. Global trade, like the massive container ships it relies on, changes course slowly. Plus, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers may be benefitting from the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker currency, given the yuan has fallen pretty steadily recently to a 13-month low. Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist for Capital Economics, explains: Adjusting for seasonality and price effects, we estimate that export volumes were essentially flat in July. Shipments to the US did weaken slightly, which suggests the tariffs had some impact. But this was offset by stronger exports to the rest of the world, most likely buoyed by the weaker renminbi. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets agrees that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade data is encouraging, especially in the current climate. China trade data showed stronger growth in both exports and imports, notably the latter, suggesting strong consumption both domestically and internationally. But Also coming up today... Wall Street will be watching for Elon Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next move, after the inventor/entrepreneur surprisingly announced he plans to take Tesla private. Shares in the electric carmaker surged last night, burning sceptical investors who had bet against the company. Going private would take some pressure off Tesla to meet financial targets (and prevent Musk having another row with the analyst community) However, shares aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t at the $420 level which Musk pitched his somewhat vague offer at (which has sparked grumbling about market manipulation), so Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future remains uncertain. Oil is calm this morning, having risen yesterday after the US issued new sanctions on Iran. Later today we get the latest American oil inventory figures, which may show a drop in stocks.

The decision is aimed at domestic American audiences who see Trump as soft on Putin. And he is. After all, the sanctions only cover technology or goods that might be sensitive to national security, a restriction most would have assumed was already in place, and the sanction can be suspended in some instances such as space flight cooperation.</p> <p>Frankly, the tariffs against China will have a greater impact than this latest round of sanctions on Russia. Moreover, the decision comes as Kentucky Senator Rand Paul visits Moscow. Paul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Putin will allow Trump to communicate this uncomfortable decision with some diplomatic cordiality. Needless to say, Trump has not afforded the UK the same exchange. His Twitter account is noticeably quiet; there is no mention of standing with America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allies in Europe against blatant terrorism. Such a message might not go down well in Moscow.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-08-09T16:51:00.512Z\">at 5.51pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b6c4225e4b04b9fff008aad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-09T13:32:43.880Z\">2.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Observer did a guide to holiday money which is worth looking at, especially as travellers will want to maximise their spending power as the pound continues to wobble.

While it is too early to suggest that a low has been hit, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound is certainly a welcome relief for the pound bulls. The GBP/USD has ended a run of five consecutive losses, the GBP/JPY is up after falling six days in a row, while the EUR/GBP is back below 0.90 after a sharp 4-day rally. Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound is therefore mainly because of profit-taking on the short trades that had been accumulated over the past week or so.</p> <p>Clearly some market participants have one eye on upcoming UK data while assessing the damage of a potential no-deal Brexit outcome on the UK economy. The latter is going to be a longer term worry which means any short-term rallies in the pound could be short-lived, as it proved to be the case after the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike last week. </p> </blockquote> <p>Speaking of the data, we have the latest UK growth figures to contend with on Friday. Razaqzada says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>GDP is expected to have grown in the second quarter by 0.4% following a disappointing expansion of just 0.2% in Q1. The ONS will also publish the monthly GDP estimate at the same time, as well as UK trade figures, manufacturing production, industrial production and construction output. The UK data dump tomorrow morning at 9:30 BST should cause a spike in pound volatility. If the figures are overall weaker than expected then the pound could resume its slide. If the data turn out to be stronger then it will be interesting to see whether the pound bulls will be more determined this time around after the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quick reversal post the Bank of England last week. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b6c1994e4b0a97da7c9dc3b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-09T13:09:52.610Z\">2.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over at the London stock market, shares in holiday firm TUI have slumped by 5% to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, although they are off their worst levels.</p> <p>Obviously a weak pound won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be good for their sales.

                "bodyText":"Investors were in a cautious mood, with Brexit concerns hitting the pound and markets unsettled by the latest target for Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sanctions, Russia. The pound held steady for much of the day but has slipped back against the dollar in late afternoon trading, down 0.17% to $1.2857. Against the euro sterling is up 0.22% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1117. Meanwhile the Russian rouble remains near a two year low at 66.3 to the US dollar. With some disappointing results from travel group TUI and a host of companies going ex-dividend, the FTSE 100 fell back but the German and French markets managed to edge higher. In the US, markets have lost some of their early shine, with the S&amp;P 500 struggling to reach a new peak. The closing scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 34.88 points or 0.45% at 7741.77 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 0.34% to 12,676.11 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.01% higher at 5502.25 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.72% to 21,634.25 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.08% at 9754.6 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 0.04% or 11 points. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Talk of a new EU offer on goods has been giving some support to the pound, but that alone may not be good enough, says Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG: The pound hit an 11-month low against the dollar, as fears over the future relationship between the UK and the EU persist. There are reports of a potential EU offer that would allow the UK to remain within the single market for goods, while also ending the free-movement of labour. However, with the EU seeking to ensure the UK closely follows the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s environmental, customs, and social rules, we are once again likely to find ourselves at a roadblock. The truth is that both the EU and the Tory Brexiteers have such differing red lines, any deal which appeased both sides would be unlikely to receive approval from both sides. There is a real chance that we will look back at the snap election as an overriding factor which means that no deal is possible. Given the substantial differences of opinion within parliament, it seems near impossible for Theresa May to garner enough support to pass an agreement that would be satisfactory to the EU. US markets are in positive territory, with the S&amp;P 500 heading close to a new record. The index is up 0.12% at 2861, around 12 points below the record 2872.87 it hit towards the end of January. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.03% while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.31%. A rise in technology stocks is helped to prop up the overall market. As for the pound, which remains fairly stable at the moment, hedge fund manager Crispin Odey believes it has further to fall in the run-up to Brexit. He told Reuters he was continuing to bet against sterling and said he believed it could fall to as low as $1.21 against the dollar. It is currently at $1.2878. Back with the UK, and IHS Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief business economist believes that Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures will make the recent Bank of England rate rise look even more puzzling: The US sanctions on Russia will have little effect, reckons Michael Patrick Cullinane, Professor of US History at the University of Roehampton: Trump is the master of media manipulation, and the decision to sanction Russia over the Skripal assassination attempt comes, not coincidentally, as pressure mounts on the president to react to the widespread condemnation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. The decision is aimed at domestic American audiences who see Trump as soft on Putin. And he is. After all, the sanctions only cover technology or goods that might be sensitive to national security, a restriction most would have assumed was already in place, and the sanction can be suspended in some instances such as space flight cooperation. Frankly, the tariffs against China will have a greater impact than this latest round of sanctions on Russia. Moreover, the decision comes as Kentucky Senator Rand Paul visits Moscow. Paul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Putin will allow Trump to communicate this uncomfortable decision with some diplomatic cordiality. Needless to say, Trump has not afforded the UK the same exchange. His Twitter account is noticeably quiet; there is no mention of standing with America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allies in Europe against blatant terrorism. Such a message might not go down well in Moscow. The Observer did a guide to holiday money which is worth looking at, especially as travellers will want to maximise their spending power as the pound continues to wobble. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the guide: The mini-revival in the pound - up 0.04% against the dollar to $1.2883 and 0.21% higher against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1116 - could be short lived, says Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com: After a sharp slide, the pound has finally caught a bid today. While it is too early to suggest that a low has been hit, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound is certainly a welcome relief for the pound bulls. The GBP/USD has ended a run of five consecutive losses, the GBP/JPY is up after falling six days in a row, while the EUR/GBP is back below 0.90 after a sharp 4-day rally. Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound is therefore mainly because of profit-taking on the short trades that had been accumulated over the past week or so. Clearly some market participants have one eye on upcoming UK data while assessing the damage of a potential no-deal Brexit outcome on the UK economy. The latter is going to be a longer term worry which means any short-term rallies in the pound could be short-lived, as it proved to be the case after the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike last week. Speaking of the data, we have the latest UK growth figures to contend with on Friday. Razaqzada says: GDP is expected to have grown in the second quarter by 0.4% following a disappointing expansion of just 0.2% in Q1. The ONS will also publish the monthly GDP estimate at the same time, as well as UK trade figures, manufacturing production, industrial production and construction output. The UK data dump tomorrow morning at 9:30 BST should cause a spike in pound volatility. If the figures are overall weaker than expected then the pound could resume its slide. If the data turn out to be stronger then it will be interesting to see whether the pound bulls will be more determined this time around after the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quick reversal post the Bank of England last week. Over at the London stock market, shares in holiday firm TUI have slumped by 5% to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, although they are off their worst levels. Obviously a weak pound won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be good for their sales. But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff is mainly due to the European heatwave encouraging holidaymakers to stay at home. After all, why spend hard earned cash seeking sun elsewhere when you can frazzle for free in your own back garden. Our full report on the TUI results is here: Just in: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs market remained solid last week, with just 213,000 people signing on for unemployment benefit. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 219,000 in the previous seven days, and not far from the 48-year low recorded in July. The US labo(u)r market continues to look remarkable solid.... Like a holidaymaker struggling up from the sun lounger after a well-earned snooze, the pound is rising, rather slowly and cautiously. Sterling has recovered this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early losses, and trading back around $1.289 against the US dollar. That matches yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 11-month low, and is still 10% lower than mid-April (when the City was more confident that the UK and Eu would agree a Brexit deal) Against the euro, the pound has clawed back 0.2% this morning, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.112 -- meaning one euro is worth 89.9p. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nine-month low, and around 4% weaker than in April. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: It initially looked like sterling was going to suffer another awful session, hitting fresh 11 month and 9 month lows against the dollar and the euro not long after the bell. However, while it is lightyears away from posting anything resembling an actual recovery, the pound has managed to edge into the green on Thursday. The Bank of England should share some of the blame for the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent weakness. Last week, the BoE raised interest rates (which ought to strengthen sterling), but also hinted that it might cut them again if Britain fails to reach a Brexit deal. City economists have concluded that borrowing costs are unlikely to rise again for some time - making the pound a less attractive asset. Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ed Conway has tweeted about this: BoE governor Mark Carney didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help the mood either, when he said there was an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncomfortably high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd risk of a no-deal Brexit (a point subsequently echoed by international trade secretary Liam Fox). Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, has compiled some helpful advice for British holidaymakers heading abroad this summer: Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buy cash at the airport as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll always be able to beat it with a bit of forward planning. The same applies with buying cash from your travel company. Compare travel money companies online but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just focus on exchange rates. Factor in delivery costs and choose the option that gives you the most cash to spend on holiday. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve left it until the last minute order online for airport collection so you get the best of both worlds. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay for travel money with a credit card as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be charged a cash withdrawal fee which adds to the cost. Top up a prepaid card to lock in your rate now. Choose your card and read the T&amp;Cs carefully as some apply hefty fees. Prepaid cards can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always be used for hotel reservations or pay at pump fuel so make sure you have a backup option. Your regular credit card may sting you with fees abroad and your debit card is likely to be far worse. Get a credit card that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t charge transaction fees abroad and pay off your statement when you get home for super cheap spending. As a bonus, if you buy something that costs over \u00c2\u00a3100 while you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on holiday you could get Section 75 credit card protection too. Taking cash out on your credit card can leave a footprint on your credit score \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not held in anywhere near the same weight as if you defaulted on a payment but keeping withdrawals to a minimum is something to bear in mind if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re planning to apply for other borrowing (like a mortgage) soon. Double check whether American Express is accepted where you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re heading so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find yourself caught short. Always choose to pay in the local currency rather than sterling if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re given the choice as this will help you avoid sneaky exchange fees. Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, says the pound is being dragged down by the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccircus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at Westminster, and weak data on the economic front. There are not many reasons for investors to hold on to sterling at present \u00e2\u20ac\u201c economic data is weak, the political picture is a circus and overall, sentiment is poor. GDP data due tomorrow is likely to show the UK economy grew by 0.4% in the last quarter - not even half as fast as America. Thomson-Cook predicts that the pound could fall further this autumn as the negotiations reach fever pitch: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On top of this, we are still concerned that the worst is yet to come with no-deal Brexit noises likely to reach a crescendo as we get closer to the European Council meeting in October, unless an Article 50 extension can be agreed upon. Remember what happened to sterling as it became clear that we had voted to leave the EU despite most market participants still believing that Brexit would enable the UK to remain a member of the single market with broad equivalence of regulations in place? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, none of that exists under this potential cliff edge scenario. While some Brexiteers may hear the explosions and think that they are celebratory fireworks, the reality would likely be one of economic devastation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Russian assets are being pummelled this morning, after America announced fresh sanctions over the novichok poisoning case in Salisbury. The US said it would impose sanctions later this month, after concluding that Russia used the Novichok nerve agent to poison Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. This could include a curb on export licenses for Russia to purchase items with national security implications, Associated Press says. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency has weakened this morning, hitting 66.2 roubles to the US dollar for the first time since August 2016, following heavy losses yesterday. Shares in state airline Aeroflot have fallen to a two-year low, following reports that America could downgrade diplomatic relations with Russia and suspend Aeroflot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to fly to the US. Russia has criticised the move, accusing America of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153far-fetched accusations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, fears the rouble could fall further, causing pain for Moscow. The period of sideways trading which lasted for four months seems to be over for the Ruble. The Russian currency fell more than 3.3% on Wednesday as Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration proposed fresh sanctions following the poisoning of a former Russian agent in the U.K. The decline in oil prices also helped to intensify the fall in the Ruble and with such uncertainty, investors will need to price in further risk premium on Russian assets. Investors will likely ignore the Russian economic fundamentals in the weeks ahead and focus on political developments. The Ruble may find some support around the 67 level, but a break above will lead to further selling pressure. The currency exchange booths aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only places causing holidaymakers grief this summer. Budget airline Ryanair warned yesterday that hundreds of flights will be cancelled on Friday. Pilots in Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Belgium and Ireland are striking as they push for better working conditions. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fights are already being disrupted - 35 have been delayed due to a lack of air traffic controllers in parts of Europe, the airline says. At $1.2850, sterling is 20 cents below its levels before the EU referendum in 2016. Some City economists have predicted the pound would tumble back to $1.20 in a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scenario. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that the pound has lost ground against most major currencies in recent weeks, as Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lewis Goodall shows here: Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide means that holidaymakers are actually getting less than one euro to the pound, if they change their money at the airport. The Independent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alex Watson explains: Exchanging currency at the airport has always been expensive, but holidaymakers are now facing exceptionally poor exchange rates if they wait until just before they fly to buy. Foreign exchange company Moneycorp (who have locations in Bristol, Central London, Gatwick, Stansted, Southampton and Southend airports) were offering 0.94 euros to the pound at Gatwick airport, according to The Sun. This rate means holidaymakers would get 94 euros back when exchanging \u00c2\u00a3100. So if you can possibly help it, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t swap your money at the airport! The Post Office, for example, are offering around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.08471 per pound. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Brexit fears are hitting holidaymakers in the pocket. Sterling has slid to its lowest level agains the US dollar in almost a year, nudging $1.2850 in the foreign exchange markets this morning. The pound is also suffering against the euro, dropping to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.107 for the first time since last October. Traders are rushing to sell the pound because they fear Britain is about to crash out of the European Union without a deal next March. These fears are weighing on the currency, making overseas holidays more expensive and also pushing up the cost of imported goods into the UK. David Madden of CMC Markets says there is a lot of anxiety in the City: Sterling suffered greatly yesterday as Brexit-related fears were doing the rounds. GBP/USD fell to a level not seen since late August last year, and EUR/GBP hit a level last seen in November 2017. The pound is still coming under pressure from Liam Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the possibility of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno-deal Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is 60-40. Dealers are extremely fearful about the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without an agreement in place, and until some clarity is provided, the pound would remain weak. This weakness is threatening UK living standards; costlier imports means higher inflation, which will eat into pay packets. Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: Although the government has insisted that it still expects negotiations with the EU over the next few months to prove successful, currency traders have been prepared for a deal not to emerge and are now hedging against the possibility of the hardest possible Brexit. With less than eight months to go before the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned departure date, financial markets have now started to take seriously the chances of chaos at the borders and damage to supply chains Also coming up today Russian assets are under pressure after the US announced sanctions on Moscow over the Salisbury Novichok attack. The ruble is dropping in early trading, adding to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble (more on that shortly)... In the City, estate agent Savills have posted a 18% drop in profits, and warned that: Ongoing political and economic uncertainty created by the negotiations to leave the EU make it difficult to predict market volumes for the rest of the year. Holiday firm TUI is sticking to its profit forecasts, even though the heatwave has encouraged some people to stay at home. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a big day for House of Fraser; the retail chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling creditors are expected to asses competing rescue bids from turnaround firm Alteri Investors and retail tycoons Philip Day and Mike Ashley today.

The fallout saw European markets fall sharply, with investors worried about contagion effects, particularly on banks exposed to the Turkish currency. The escalation of yet another trade dispute hit not only European and emerging markets but Wall Street as well. The final scores in Europe showed:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The FTSE 100 fell 74.76 points or 0.97% to 7667.01</strong></li> \n   <li><strong>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.99% to 12,424.35</strong></li> \n   <li><strong>France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 1.59% lower at 5414.68</strong></li> \n   <li><strong>Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished down 2.51% at 21,090.78</strong></li> \n   <li><strong>Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.56% lower at 9602.1</strong></li> \n   <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.45% to 743.73</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 191 points or 0.75%.</p> \n  <p>On the currency markets the Turkish lira, down 20% at one point, is 15.6% lower. </p> \n  <p>The pound is also under pressure, as continuing Brexit concerns outweighed improving growth figures (although manufacturing moved into recession). Against the dollar sterling is down 0.6% at $1.2742 but it improved 0.5% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1183 against a euro which has been weakened by worries about European banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exposure to Turkey.</p> \n  <p><em>On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day.

This includes in other emerging markets [EMs], which tend to have limited trade and financial ties with, as well as smaller current account deficits than, Turkey. Meanwhile, the fragilities in Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector that are now grabbing attention are more acute than in most other EMs. </p> \n   <p>Having said all of this, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes are another headwind facing EMs that has arisen in the past few months: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is now slowing, EMs are now tightening monetary policy and the trade war is escalating. So the situation in Turkey could worsen sentiment towards EMs and also strengthens our view that EM growth will weaken.</p> \n   <p>Of course, investors are also worried about the implications of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems for the euro-zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking system and economy. But while these concerns add to the long list of recent headwinds for the euro, neither the overall exposure of banks in the euro-zone to Turkey nor the direct links between the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and the country is large.</p> \n   <p>This is also the case for the wider world. The exposure of US and UK banks to Turkey is negligible. And Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy accounts for just one percent of the global economy at market exchange rates. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5b6daeb1e4b048f8247cc449\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-10T15:28:34.389Z\">4.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Heading into the market close in Europe, and investors have taken fright at the Turkish problems, with worries about contagion uppermost in their minds.

The European Central Bank (ECB) warned that a number of eurozone banks might be exposed to the sharp decline in the Turkish lira.</p> \n   <p>A number of Spanish, French and Italian banks are connected to Turkey in the form of foreign denominated loans, and if the Turkish borrowers haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hedged their exposure it might spark defaults. Should European banks incur write-downs on account of the Turkish currency crisis, investment sentiment is likely to be weak. Many financial institutions in Europe have their own non-performing loans to contend with, and they could be facing a similar situation in Turkey. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5b6da968e4b0bc551397db17\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-10T15:04:37.618Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jamie McGeever has put today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall in the Turkish lira into context:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/1027933196384694272\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Turkish lira having one of the biggest one-day falls of any free-floating currency in over 20 years.

The chickens have now come home to roost.</p> \n   <p>US President Donald Trump has, in typical fashion, wasted no time in exploiting a minor diplomatic spat over an American pastor jailed in Turkey to add insult to Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largely self-inflicted injuries by slapping tariffs on Turkey \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which will further exacerbate today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide.</p> \n   <p>The outlook for Turkey from here remains bleak. Ten years of macroeconomic mismanagement will take a long time to fix even if Turkey begins to follow sensible economic policies from here on out. A recession, and possibly a banking crisis, now look extremely likely. Does Erdogan understand how serious the situation has become? Does he suffer from the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdictator problem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, in which his advisers are scared to give him bad news and prudent advice? One thing seems clear now: if Erdogan continues to blame \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe economic war\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinterest rate lobby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 then the outlook is even more complicated and any macroeconomic improvement less plausible.</p> \n   <p>We remain underweight Turkey as we have done for some time, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to remember that this is almost entirely a self-inflicted Turkish issue. No other emerging market country has a president who believes higher rates cause inflation. Investor sentiment towards EM more widely can temporary weaken, which is normal in periods of risk aversion, but such price action is not justified. If asset prices decline in other EMs just because Turkey does not have its house in order this should be viewed as a buying opportunity and exploited ruthlessly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5b6da2e7e4b048f8247cc392\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-10T14:37:36.966Z\">3.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Earlier Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister - and Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son-in-law had also tried to ease fears about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, including concerns about the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence.

                "bodyText":"The Turkish lira was already under pressure this week on concerns about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, but Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweet threatening to double tariffs on steel and aluminium sent the currency tumbling to new lows. The fallout saw European markets fall sharply, with investors worried about contagion effects, particularly on banks exposed to the Turkish currency. The escalation of yet another trade dispute hit not only European and emerging markets but Wall Street as well. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 74.76 points or 0.97% to 7667.01 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.99% to 12,424.35 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 1.59% lower at 5414.68 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished down 2.51% at 21,090.78 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.56% lower at 9602.1 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.45% to 743.73 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 191 points or 0.75%. On the currency markets the Turkish lira, down 20% at one point, is 15.6% lower. The pound is also under pressure, as continuing Brexit concerns outweighed improving growth figures (although manufacturing moved into recession). Against the dollar sterling is down 0.6% at $1.2742 but it improved 0.5% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1183 against a euro which has been weakened by worries about European banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exposure to Turkey. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems: Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unfolding economic crisis has deepened further after Donald Trump announced he is doubling US import tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium, stoking the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency freefall and rattling financial markets. The Turkish lira plunged by more than 20% against the dollar after the president announced the move, amid a widening dispute between Washington and Ankara over the imprisonment of the US pastor Andrew Brunson. Pressure has been applied on the country in recent days to stage an emergency interest rate rise to avert further economic damage. Revealing an increase in US taxes on Turkish steel imports to 50% and on aluminium to 20%, the president tweeted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The full report is here: The fallout from Turkey is unlikely to be felt too strongly elsewhere despite fears of contagion, says John Higgins at Capital Economics: Our view is that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems will continue to mount in the face of excessively loose monetary and fiscal policy...Despite a vague acknowledgement by the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister of the need for somewhat tighter policy, Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan was devoid of detail and followed an anti-market diatribe from President Erdogan. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing difficulties will cause a lot of trouble elsewhere, though. This includes in other emerging markets [EMs], which tend to have limited trade and financial ties with, as well as smaller current account deficits than, Turkey. Meanwhile, the fragilities in Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector that are now grabbing attention are more acute than in most other EMs. Having said all of this, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes are another headwind facing EMs that has arisen in the past few months: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is now slowing, EMs are now tightening monetary policy and the trade war is escalating. So the situation in Turkey could worsen sentiment towards EMs and also strengthens our view that EM growth will weaken. Of course, investors are also worried about the implications of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems for the euro-zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking system and economy. But while these concerns add to the long list of recent headwinds for the euro, neither the overall exposure of banks in the euro-zone to Turkey nor the direct links between the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and the country is large. This is also the case for the wider world. The exposure of US and UK banks to Turkey is negligible. And Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy accounts for just one percent of the global economy at market exchange rates. Heading into the market close in Europe, and investors have taken fright at the Turkish problems, with worries about contagion uppermost in their minds. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: European stock markets have been rocked by the plunge in the Turkish lira. The European Central Bank (ECB) warned that a number of eurozone banks might be exposed to the sharp decline in the Turkish lira. A number of Spanish, French and Italian banks are connected to Turkey in the form of foreign denominated loans, and if the Turkish borrowers haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hedged their exposure it might spark defaults. Should European banks incur write-downs on account of the Turkish currency crisis, investment sentiment is likely to be weak. Many financial institutions in Europe have their own non-performing loans to contend with, and they could be facing a similar situation in Turkey. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jamie McGeever has put today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall in the Turkish lira into context: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy editor on Turkish steel exports, which will now be hit by the new Trump tariffs: Erdogan is now repeating his previous pleas to buy lira: The situation for Turkey looks bleak and it is entirely of its own making, says Jan Dehn, head of research at investment manager Ashmore Group: The situation unfolding in Turkey is fluid, but essentially unsurprising. Any emerging market investor who has done even a modicum of due diligence will be aware of the monetary policy problems Turkey has been running for years. President Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consistent pressure on the central bank to keep interest rates low \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a product of his erroneous belief that high interest rates lead to inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has brought Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s macroeconomic situation into serious imbalance, hence placing the country in a vulnerable position. The chickens have now come home to roost. US President Donald Trump has, in typical fashion, wasted no time in exploiting a minor diplomatic spat over an American pastor jailed in Turkey to add insult to Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largely self-inflicted injuries by slapping tariffs on Turkey \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which will further exacerbate today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide. The outlook for Turkey from here remains bleak. Ten years of macroeconomic mismanagement will take a long time to fix even if Turkey begins to follow sensible economic policies from here on out. A recession, and possibly a banking crisis, now look extremely likely. Does Erdogan understand how serious the situation has become? Does he suffer from the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdictator problem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, in which his advisers are scared to give him bad news and prudent advice? One thing seems clear now: if Erdogan continues to blame \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe economic war\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinterest rate lobby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 then the outlook is even more complicated and any macroeconomic improvement less plausible. We remain underweight Turkey as we have done for some time, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to remember that this is almost entirely a self-inflicted Turkish issue. No other emerging market country has a president who believes higher rates cause inflation. Investor sentiment towards EM more widely can temporary weaken, which is normal in periods of risk aversion, but such price action is not justified. If asset prices decline in other EMs just because Turkey does not have its house in order this should be viewed as a buying opportunity and exploited ruthlessly. Earlier Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister - and Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son-in-law had also tried to ease fears about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, including concerns about the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence. Associated Press reports: In a bid to ease investor concerns about Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policy, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister says the government will safeguard the independence of the central bank. Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak on Friday also vowed sustainable and healthy economic growth as well as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong struggle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd against inflation, which currently stands at close to 16 percent. Albayrak was speaking at a conference where he outlined his ministry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new economic policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as the currency plunged, raising questions about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of our principles will be ensuring the full independence of monetary policy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Investors are worried about the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unorthodox economic policies, pressure exerted on the central bank, and a dispute with the United States that has led to sanctions. Before his second speech and after Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech, Erdogan was reportedly in contact with Russia: Turkish president Erdogan is making a second speech at the moment. He is currently talking about infrastructure spending, including better roads and tunnels. He says forget the lira, forget currencies and talks about being in love with the Turkish people. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, also sees echoes of the Greek troubles: If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a black swan event, this could be it, although we must stress that so the panic is very much confined to Turkey. Nevertheless, ghosts of Greece are still vivid in the memory for European investors and today is the first sign that the problem with Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s larger dollar debts is no longer confined to its borders. Three summers ago, Greece was forced to impose capital controls to prevent a run on its banks, as its future in the eurozone hung in the balance. Gavin Friend, senior market strategist at National Australia Bank, believes Turkey could soon be forced into similar measures: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Though hiking rates would be the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred option for Turkey to stem this crisis and help deal with inflation this seems unlikely given what we heard from President Erdogan today. If we assume IMF assistance is out of the question from both sides, that leaves capital controls. That is problematic given Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s need for foreign inflows - but of course they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be coming for now and stemming the flow the other way is the issue. This won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help in building trust between Turkey and international investors. Paul McNamara, investment director at asset management firm GAM, has written a fine explanation of the causes of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic woes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think that Turkey has a toxic combination of a weak external position (current account deficit), excessive private sector debt and a high level of foreign funding in the banking system. This is coming to a head as a much-needed demand slowdown is causing asset quality problems in the banks. The role of construction in the economy for example is comparable with that in Spain or Ireland ahead of the European bust. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think the Turks have exhausted the possibilities of rate hikes, and are backed into a corner by their inadequate level of currency reserves (the IMF thinks that Turkey has the least adequate level of reserves of the major EM economies. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politics are also a problem with the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son-in-law as Finance Minister and perception of political interference with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153independent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Central Bank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s developments have been very negative: President Erdogan made a belligerent speech with no reference to the need of a change of course. Finance Minister Albayrak made a content-free speech full of consultant platitudes. Finally, US President Trump doubled tariffs on Turkish metal exports \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is likely symbolic, but symbolising a lack of US support for the Ankara regime. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our strongly-held negative view on Turkey remains intact and we have not covered any risk.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deepening currency crisis is sending fear sweeping through the financial markets. All the main European stock markets are in the red, led by financial shares. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark stock index has sunk by 3% today. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has shed 2%, while Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is down 60 points, or 0.8%. Several European banks have significant operations in Turkey, such as Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BBVA, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UniCredit and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BNP Paribas. Unicredit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have fallen by 5.6%, closely followed by BBVA (-5.4%) Deutsche Bank (-5.3%), ING (-5%) and BNP Paribas (-4.2%) According to the Financial Times, the European Central Bank is worried that Turkish borrowers might not be hedged against the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness and begin to default on foreign currency loans. Those loans make up about 40% of the Turkish banking sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets, and are now a lot more expensive to repay following the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency crisis could force president Erdogan to impose capital controls, or seek help from the International Monetary Fund, says Brad Bechtel of investment bank Jefferies: Turkey has a handful of options including seeking an IMF program, capital controls, rate hikes, yield to American demands or do nothing and so far the only option he seems to be leaning towards is do nothing. His stubborn stance against the US and twisted view of the IMF combined with a fear of higher interest rates make the situation untenable. The complete loss of credibility in the central bank was the final shoe to drop and spark for the latest rout we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in the currency. Until decisive action is taken, they will continue to spiral out of control. Turkey is now suffering one of the most painful and intense currency crises in many years: The Turkish lira is plunging to new record lows following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweet. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now down 18% (!!) today, at over 6.5 lira to the dollar, compared with 5.5 lira last night. That means the currency has lost nearly a third of its value this week. A truly shocking plunge, suggesting Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is getting into serious trouble. NEWSFLASH: Donald Trump has announced he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doubling the tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium imports, as the diplomatic row between Turkey and the US deepens. Trump announced the move in a tweet, claiming it was in response to the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent slump. This further intensifies the battle between the two countries over US pastor Andrew Brunson, who is currently imprisoned over terrorism charges. The moves comes shortly after Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president claimed there was a campaign to harm Turkey by weakening the lira. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move has sent the lira sliding deeper into trouble. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now down almost 14% today at 6.3 lira to the dollar (a month ago it traded at 4.8). Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency crisis has deepened today, as president Erdogan attempting to calm the situation with a defiant address to the nation. After watching the lira fall to record lows in recent days, Erdogan declared that Turkey is facing an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic war\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which he vowed not to lose. Erdogan also urged Turkish citizens to help, by swapping any foreign currency for lira to help stem its losses. If there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anyone who has dollars, gold or euros under their pillow, I am asking them to take them to the bank and exchange them for Turkish lira. Turkish assets have been slumping in recent days, for several reasons 1) A standoff with the U.S. over a detained American pastor that Turkey, a NATO ally, has put on trial for espionage and terror-related charges linked to a failed coup attempt in the country two years ago. Washington has imposed financial sanctions on two Turkish ministers and warned of additional measures unless the pastor is released 2) Investors are worried about the Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policies since his election win in June. He has long pushed the Turkish central banks to cut interest rates, claiming this would lower inflation (most economists take the opposite view). The lira has slumped by around 10% today, extending yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deep losses. Paul Greer, portfolio manager at Fidelity International, argues that Turkey actually needs a massive interest rate hike of perhaps 10 percentage points, to restore market confidence. However, such a move would also probably drag Turkey into recession. Greer says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s macro challenges are numerous and well known - an overheating economy, a sizable external financing requirement, an outsized structural current account deficit, persistent double digit inflation, low net FX reserves and a large private sector debt burden. As a result of this, investor confidence in President Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regime has been waning for much of the past year but key cabinet changes made after the June 24th elections have been particularly damaging for sentiment..... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fundamental challenges are numerous, there are plenty of straightforward textbook solutions which, if implemented, can halt the downward spiral of investor confidence and asset prices. An aggressive interest rate hike from the Central Bank would be a good start, something of the order of +1,000bp that Argentina delivered back in May would be appropriate at this juncture. This would help slow the economy, probably into a recession, which would help crunch the relentless demand for imports and thereby alleviate some of the current account deficit problem. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics correspondent Richard Partington on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures: Warmer weather helped the British economy grow at a faster pace in the three months to the end of June, despite official figures revealing the manufacturing sector slumped into recession for the first time since the Brexit vote. The Office for National Statistics said GDP increased by 0.4% in the second quarter from a rate of 0.2% in the previous three months, helped by stronger retail sales and good weather enabling the construction industry to make-up lost ground from the heavy snow earlier this year. The better news for the economy comes after the Bank of England lifted interest rates to 0.75% last week, their highest level since the financial crisis a decade ago. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are working hard to build a stronger, fairer economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c dealing with the deficit, helping people into work, and cutting taxes for individuals and businesses.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Service industries experienced robust growth of 0.5% in the second quarter, with the retail and wholesale sectors providing the strongest contribution, helped by the warm weather tempting shoppers back to the high street. However, the latest snapshot from the ONS painted an increasingly lopsided picture for economic growth, with Britain reliant on the services sector amid a downturn for factory output. There were also indications of slowing growth in June, with the ONS revealing May was the strongest month of the second quarter. More here: Philip Hammond also dropped a loud hint that the UK government could push for new taxes on online retailers: Asked about House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lurch into administration today, and the wider problems in the high street, he told Sky News that: We want to ensure that the high street remains resilient, and that we also make sure that taxation is fair between businesses doing business the traditional way, and those doing business online. That requires us to renegotiate international tax treaties because many of the big online businesses are international companies. The EU has been talking about a tax on online platform businesses, based on the value generated. Chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond, has blamed Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slow growth in recent quarters on Brexit uncertainty. Speaking in Coventry today, Hammond told reporters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Clearly that uncertainty is having a depressing effect on economic growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hammond has been pushing for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, under which Britain maintained close links with the European Union. Back in January, he called for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continued cross-border flow of ideas, goods, services, people and capital\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, annoying cabinet colleagues who favour a hard break with the EU. The TUC make a very important point -- if you adjust for population increases, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth has been extremely poor since the financial crisis. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady blames weak investment over the last decade, which has meant earnings growth has been poor too: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest figures cap a dismal decade for the economy. But we should not accept weak growth as the new normal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the result of bad management of the economy. There has been too little investment and a failure to focus on getting wages rising. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we want a stronger decade ahead, the UK must catch up with the levels investment we see in other OECD nations. And the government must put action to get wages rising at the heart of its plans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However...Rebecca Long Bailey MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Business Secretary, is concerned that Sports Direct now has control of House of Fraser. She argues that the UK must reform its business rates system, to help high street chains compete with online retailers. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIt is unforgivable that the Conservatives have stood by and done nothing while tens of thousands of jobs have been put at risk. Their inaction has prepared the ground for the likes of Mike Ashley, notorious for his company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor treatment of workers, to hoover up businesses. Staff will undoubtedly be concerned about what the sale means for their wages and conditions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How many more of our most recognisable high street brands have to go under before the Prime Minister steps up and addresses the broken business rates system which is turning our high streets into ghost towns? Financial experts are pleased that House of Fraser has been saved from the abyss by Sports Direct - even though we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term plans for the retailer. Simon Underwood, business recovery partner at accountancy firm, Menzies LLP, says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153welcome outcome\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is possibly the best news from the High Street this year and a positive indicator for other ailing retailers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153House of Fraser is a strong brand and this \u00c2\u00a390m bid from Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley means many of its stores will be saved and its operations streamlined. The fate of the remaining stores is uncertain - some may be sold off separately and others will be closed. The new owners will bring a timely injection of cash, ensuring a future for the various concessions and providing a more stable platform for the business to restructure its operations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In a very fast-moving set of circumstances, this is a welcome outcome for both House of Fraser and UK consumers. It shows that there is light at the end of the tunnel and at least for the moment, a mainstay of the British High Street has been saved from the brink.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Michael Mulligan, insolvency specialist at Shakespeare Martineau, thinks it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for suppliers and staff: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now that Sports Direct has acquired the House of Fraser brand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including all of the stock in the business - it will allow continued operation with a likely focus on the flagship stores. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will be welcome news not only for suppliers who rely on House of Fraser for their livelihoods, but also for all employees involved. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is yet another significant High Street rescue mission and the crisis shows no sign of abating. With interest rates rising and less money in the pocket of the UK consumer, more household names may be at risk.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is still \u00e2\u20ac\u0153struggling to gain momentum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd despite growing faster in April-June, says Mike Jakeman, senior economist at PwC, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The improvement was partly driven by one-off events, such as higher consumer spending on food and drink around the World Cup, the heatwave and the Royal Wedding. However, there was also some evidence that hot weather and wall-to-wall football deterred shoppers from buying goods other than food or drink. The net effect was that household consumption grew at the same pace as in Q1. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Instead, the acceleration was driven by investment, which rebounded after a very poor first quarter, but only to the level seen at the end of 2017. Brexit-related uncertainty is still deterring large, export-focused firms from committing to investment plans. Net trade also subtracted from growth for the first time since late 2016, as a result of weaker exports of cars and planes. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK GDP report is rather mixed: Although the 0.4 quarter on quarter per cent growth for 2018Q2 is in line with expectations, the annual growth reading of 1.3 per cent is slightly lower than that the 1.41 per cent estimate (based on market interest rate expectations) by BoE policymakers and even lower than the 1.5 per cent \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctrend growth\u00c2\u00b4 considered by the Bank as our new economic \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnorm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. So does that mean that the Bank of England was wrong to raise interest rates to 0.75% last week? Not at all, he explains: What BoE policymakers have decided to do is store up interest rate \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcammunition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 should Brexit-related developments over the next few months require deep interest rate cuts to revive the economy. It is vital that financial markets and traders see all this so that selling pressure on the sterling currency recedes. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics makes an important point -- the slump in sterling since the Brexit vote has not healed the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade woes: Anthony Gillham, head of investment at City firm Quilter Investors, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very impressed with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth report. He warns that the UK is still \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcplaying catch-up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 after slowing last winter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While growth has improved slightly, it does so from a low starting point. Over the medium term, UK growth has been thoroughly unspectacular, with the domestic economy expanding at a slower pace than most developed countries. So with the pound at a 13-month low this morning, Gillham warns that imports will become more expensive.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a real risk of stagflation on the horizon, with the recent interest rate hike failing to address the fall in the pound, and the sentiment of Mark Carney and Liam Fox even talking the value of Sterling to its lowest point against the dollar in a year. The UK finds itself in a difficult situation where the Bank of England is hiking rates to try and keep a lid on import costs that drive up inflation, but it is doing so against the backdrop of weak economic growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The general climate of uncertainty that pervades is discouraging households form making big ticket purchases, while business investment is also stifled as a result of CEOs feeling cautious about starting big projects before they have more certainty about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future relationship with European trading partners. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate remains lacklustre. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s particularly concerned by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade figures, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The higher growth in the second quarter was largely due to stronger service sector output, which helped offset a contraction in industrial output and a widening trade deficit. While there was pick-up in construction output, the improvement was from a low base, and the sector continues to add little to overall UK growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The widening of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit in the quarter is disappointing, and reflects both a decline in goods exports and a rise in imported goods. The deterioration in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net trade position is further confirmation that we are still some way from achieving a rebalancing of our economy. These charts show how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit widened last quarter, and how it became MORE reliant on trade with the EU over the last year: UK economic growth is still \u00e2\u20ac\u0153way below the gains we were used to before the financial crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Rob Hodgson, Head of Wealth Management at GWM Investment Management. Economics journalist Dharshini David agrees that 0.4% growth isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t something to shout about John McDonnell MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chancellor, says the economy is suffering from Brexit uncertainty, and years of government cutbacks: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153More than eight years of unnecessary ideologically-driven austerity has created an economy unable to cope with the instability brought about by the Tories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mismanagement of the Brexit negotiations. The result is low growth and stagnant pay. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grow this anaemic, councils are going bankrupt and the NHS is now in permanent crisis while holidaymakers are being hit by the Tories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 falling pound. Labour will bring stability to the economy and rising living standards with long term stable planning and investment and by securing a Brexit deal that puts jobs and the economy first.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chancellor Philip Hammond has tweeted: Back on GDP, and this chart shows how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers had a tough few months: Newsflash: Sports Direct has bought House of Fraser for \u00c2\u00a390m, just a couple of hours after it fell into administration. The retailer, run by Mike Ashley, is acquiring all of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 51 stores, and its stock. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear what this means for the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 17,000 staff, though. In a statement, it says: Sports Direct International plc (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Company\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Group\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) announces the acquisition of the business and assets of House of Fraser from the administrators of House of Fraser Limited, House of Fraser (Stores) Limited and James Beattie Limited, the House of Fraser group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main operating companies (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Operating Companies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), for a cash consideration of \u00c2\u00a390 million (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Transaction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). Pursuant to the Transaction, the Group has acquired all of the UK stores of House of Fraser, the House of Fraser brand and all of the stock in the business. For the year ended 28 January 2017 (the last date to which statutory accounts are available for the parent company of the Operating Companies and prior to the appointment of the administrators), the House of Fraser group had gross assets of \u00c2\u00a3946.3m and made \u00c2\u00a314.7m net profit. Although Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate picked up in the last quarter, it has been modest for the last 18 months: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the breakdown sector-by-sector, confirming that Britain relied on its service sector for growth in the last three months, with construction also making a positive contribution. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rob-Kent Smith, head of national accounts at the ONS, on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The economy picked up a little in the second quarter with both retail sales and construction helped by the good weather and rebounding from the effects of the snow earlier in the year. However, manufacturing continued to fall back from its high point at the end of last year and underlying growth remained modest by historical standards. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit noticeably worsened as exports of cars and planes declined sharply while imports rose.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade gap has worsened, as the country continues to import much more than it exports to the rest of the world. The total UK trade deficit widened by \u00c2\u00a34.7bn to \u00c2\u00a38.6bn in the three months to June 2018, due mainly to falling goods exports and rising goods imports. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector drove growth in the last quarter, growing by 0.5%. The construction sector also had a good quarter, expanding by 0.9%. But the industrial sector shrank by 0.8% in April-June. That includes a 0.9% contraction across the UK manufacturing base. That means UK manufacturing is now in recession.... Breaking! The UK economy grew by 0.4% in the second quarter of 2018. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 0.2% in the first three months of the year, as the economy got back up to speed after the bad wintery weather. More to follow! The pound has fallen to a fresh 13-month low against the US dollar this morning. Sterling shed three quarters of a cent in nervy trading to hit $1.2740, its lowest level since June 2017. This means that the pound has shed 10% of its value since April, as worries over a hard Brexit have intensified. But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls are also due to the US dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength. Nervous traders are piling into the dollar, in the face of a mounting financial crisis in Turkey. The Turkish lira has gone through the floor this morning, tumbling a staggering 12%. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister (who happens to be the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son in law) is due to unveil \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a new economic model\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on Friday, which will include plans to cut the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit. Investors, though, are losing faith - and increasingly alarmed about the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence. As Charlie Robertson of Renaissance Capital puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The markets have lost confidence in the triumvirate of President Erdogan, his son-in-law as finance minister and the [central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] ability to act as it needs to.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Overnight, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned that Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy expanded by 0.5%, thanks to a pick- up in consumer spending. Can the UK match it? Michael Hewson of CMC Markets predicts that the UK economy rebounded strongly in the last quarter: A decent recovery across construction, manufacturing and services is expected to show 0.4% growth, with the timing of Easter, a Royal Wedding and warm weather set to paint a decent picture of economic activity. In an hour we discover if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right.... Retail expert Nick Bubb thinks some parts of House of Fraser can still be saved, saying: Hopes of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pre-pack\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd deal to salvage parts of the business (with Sports Direct?) still seem high\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The House of Fraser story is moving fast. Sky News are reporting that Mike Ashley, founder of Sports Direct, is close to agreeing a deal to take control of the company. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear, though, how many of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stores he would take on. Frank Slevin, chairman of House of Fraser, says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hopeful that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future will be sorted out soon. He told investors this morning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This has been an extraordinarily challenging six months in which the business has delivered so many critical elements of the turnaround plan. Despite the very recent termination of the transaction between Cenbest and C.Banner, I am confident House of Fraser is close to securing its future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd High street chain House of Fraser has confirmed it is appointing administrators after negotiations between investors and creditors failed to reach a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153solvent solution.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The retail chain, which employs over 17,000 people, has been forced to turn to Ernst &amp; Young as administrators after days of negotiations with billionaire tycoons Mike Ashley and Philip Day, and the retail turnaround fund Alteri Investors. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 59 stores are all set to open as usual on Friday, while EY attempts to arrange a sale. Some 31 stores were previously earmarked for closure under an earlier restructuring plan, so HoF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff now face fresh uncertainty. In a statement to investors, the company says: Court hearings are expected to take place at 7:30 am today, at which orders will be sought appointing individuals from Ernst &amp; Young LLP as administrators of each of the Operating Companies with immediate effect. Significant progress has been made towards completing a sale of the Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business and assets. The proposed administrators are expected to continue to progress those discussions with a view to concluding a transaction shortly after their appointment. My colleague Sean Farrell explains how HoF could now be broken up: The group needs about \u00c2\u00a350m after C.banner, the Hong Kong-listed owner of Hamleys, pulled out of plans to raise \u00c2\u00a370m to invest in House of Fraser. Most industry experts expected any rescue to involve putting House of Fraser into administration to allow a new investor to buy its most attractive stores without taking on loss-making sites. Plum locations include shops in Glasgow as well as Bluewater in Kent, Manchester, Belfast and Meadowhall in Sheffield. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we discover how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is faring, when growth figures for the second quarter of 2018 are released. Economists expect that GDP increased by 0.4% in April-June, as businesses got back up to speed after the Beast from the East hit growth. If they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right, this would mean the economy grew twice as fast as in the first quarter of the year. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still lacklustre growth in historic terms, extending the generally weak growth since the Brexit referendum in 2016 Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says growth should have picked up in the last few months - even though consumer confidence is subdued. The second quarter was altogether brighter, with good weather, a Royal Wedding and the World Cup all driving consumer behaviour. The latest ONS retail sales data suggests that food and drink sales have been positively impacted by the sunshine and the football, while spending in pubs also increased by 9.5% year on year in June according to Barclaycard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer analysis. Not all parts of the UK economy have been making hay in the sunshine however, with big ticket items particularly under pressure. Household appliance sales fell 14.8% in the year to June according to Barclaycard, and the football combined with the warm weather led to a June drop in sales for non-food retailers according to the ONS. Also coming up today... Department chain House of Fraser is fighting for survival, after days of increasingly frantic rescue talks to secure new funding for the company. The company is going into administration, following all-night talks with potential bidders such as Mike Ashley, the owner of Sports Direct, Philip Day, the owner of Edinburgh Woollen Mill, and restructuring expert Alteri. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK growth figures for the second quarter of 2018 9.30am BST: UK trade and industrial production data for June 1.30pm BST: US inflation figures for July",

Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank raised its key interest rate by five percentage points to 45% after a fall in the peso and the South African rand was also hit in a day of turbulence that saw the lira fall 8% against the dollar.

But the Turkish president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insistence that his country would survive an economic siege failed to reassure financial markets alarmed at the possible collapse of the strategically vital emerging market country. Concerns that the 45% drop in the value of the lira this year would prove ruinous for companies that had borrowed heavily in foreign currencies prompted the renewed sell off of the lira and pushed up the cost of servicing Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit.

Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour:</p> <h2>What are the implications for the global economy?</h2> <p>The direct impact of what looks like an inevitable recession in Turkey would be relatively small because, despite a population of 80 million and strong growth in recent years, the country accounts for only 1% of global GDP. Eurozone countries run a trade surplus with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a> but it is small. In the two previous Turkish financial crises since the turn of the millennium, European exporters have been able to divert their business to other markets. The European Central Bank has expressed concern about potential contagion through the eurozone banking system, with Spain, followed by Italy, the most heavily exposed countries.<br></p> <p>A bigger danger is that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crisis will spill over into other emerging market economies and there were signs on Monday that other countries seen as vulnerable were coming under speculative attack. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems are particularly acute because it has more than $300bn of dollar-denominated corporate debt, which is getting more expensive to finance by the day. However, other countries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as Mexico and South Africa - also took advantage of low US interest rates in the years after the financial crisis to borrow heavily in dollars and saw their currencies coming under pressure. The fear is of a full-blown emerging market crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/13/how-serious-is-turkeys-lira-crisis-and-what-are-the-implications\">How serious is Turkey's lira crisis and what are the implications?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b71adabe4b0cc3a88371818\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-13T16:16:06.993Z\">5.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The lira is weakening in late trading, and is threatening to plunge back the 7 lira-to-the-US dollar mark to a new all-time low.</strong></p> <p>Andy Birch, principal economist at IHS Markit, fears the lira will keep tumbling until Turkey raises interest rates:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The changes to reserve requirements in recent days and the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unspecified action plan has done little to stabilize the lira.

                "bodyText":"This liveblog is now closed, but you can catch-up with all the latest developments here: And finally, the Turkish crisis makes the front page of Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Guardian: The Times is reporting that UK holidaymakers are taking advantage of the fact they can now get eight lira to the pound: President Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defiant speech makes the front page of the Independent, and the Financial Times: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll back on Tuesday morning, UK time, with the latest market action. Stay tuned to the Guardian website in the meantime, for any breaking developments. Goodnight! GW Over in Asia, the markets are cranking back into action for Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session. And so far, the lira looks quite orderly - trading just below 7 lira to the US dollar, as in Europe earlier. The US stock market has close down lower tonight, as the Turkey crisis weighted on sentiment. The Dow shed 125 points, or 0.5%, to finish at 25,187. The wider S&amp;P 500 lost 0.4%. Energy companies led the sell off, dropping by 1.2%. Banks and miners lost 1%, reflecting worries that the lira crisis could create financial turmoil and dent economic demand. After a busy day, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the Turkish crisis: A fresh plunge in the Turkish lira sent tremors through global currency markets on Monday, amid fears that the failure of Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government to tackle its worsening financial crisis would have a domino effect on other vulnerable countries. The Argentine peso and the South African rand were the biggest knock-on casualties of a day of turbulence that saw the lira fall 8% against the dollar and Erdogan lash out at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic terrorists on social media\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as he accused Donald Trump of stabbing Turkey in the back. But the Turkish president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insistence that his country would survive an economic siege failed to reassure financial markets alarmed at the possible collapse of the strategically-vital emerging market country. Concerns that the 45% drop in the value of the lira this year would prove ruinous for companies that had borrowed heavily in foreign currencies prompted the renewed sell off of the lira and pushed up the cost of servicing Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit. Erdogan insisted that the Turkish economy was fundamentally sound and attacked the US president for imposing sanctions and doubling tariffs on Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel and aluminium imports last week over the house arrest of an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, on disputed terrorism charges. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are together in NATO and then you stab your strategic partner in the back,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Erdogan said as he came under pressure from the markets to respond to the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall and an inflation rate of more than 15%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: My colleague Martin Chulov has discovered that the lira crisis has been fuelled by a misunderstanding between the leaders of the US and Turkey. He writes: The currency plunge imperilling Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has been fuelled by a standoff between Donald Trump and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an over the fate of a Turkish woman detained in Israel whose freedom the US president brokered, and an American pastor held in Turkey whose release he demands in return, officials in Ankara claim. Those officials say that Trump may have \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmisinterpreted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 a discussion with Erdo\u00c4\u0178an over the pair - Turkish woman Ebru \u00c3\u2013zkan, jailed for alleged links to Hamas (but released last month), and Andrew Brunson, a preacher from North Carolina. It appears that Trump thought he had reached a deal for Brunson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s release, while Erdo\u00c4\u0178an believed he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d agreed to transfer the pastor to house arrest (as happened in July). Martin explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It took place on the margins of the Nato summit,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the source told the Guardian. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Erdo\u00c4\u0178an asked Trump for help with the lady in prison in Israel. There was only the two of them and a translator. Trump said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI need some traction on the pastor first\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. When Erdo\u00c4\u0178an said OK he meant that we are working on it. Then [US vice-president Mike] Pence, due to midterm election considerations, messed things up. Trump confused a process for an agreement.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That might explains why the White House has taken such a tough line on Turkey this week, imposing new sanction and starting the process to double tariffs on steel and aluminium. One late newsflash: Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has raised its benchmark interest rate to a blistering 45% (!), from 40%. As explained earlier, the peso hit a record low as the Turkish crisis rocked emerging market currencies (and as a political scandal continued to shake confidence). This rate hike is aimed at preventing the peso plunging even further, and suggest Buenos Aires is concerned that the markets could become more volatile in the days ahead. Time for a recap The currency crisis gripping Turkey has deepened today, sending ripples through the financial world and hurting emerging market countries across the globe. Fears over Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial position sent its currency spiralling to a fresh record low, hitting 7.2 lira to the US dollar. The lira has now lost a third of its value in the last week, as the crisis has escalated alarmingly. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market also had a rough day, with bank shares tumbling by over 10%. Economists fear that Turkish companies will struggle to repay loans priced in dollars, given the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plunge in value. Contagion caused jitters elsewhere too, with India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rupee and Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peso dropping to record lows. The Russian rouble and the South African rand hit levels not seen since 2016. A cocktail of problems are to blame, from Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surging inflation rate and current account deficit to the diplomatic row with America that means the Turkish economy faces punishing sanctions. Investors believe that Turkey needs to take decisive action, such as hiking interest rates from their current level of 17.75% to an even more painful rate - perhaps over 27%. President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is refusing to bow to pressure from the markets, though. He told an audience of ambassadors in Ankara that Turkey was under attack from overseas interests: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The developments over recent weeks have shown that Turkey is under siege. It is clear that these attacks will continue for a while.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Erdo\u00c4\u0178an also blasted US sanctions against its NATO ally, calling them a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stab in the back against Turkey.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has taken some steps to prop up the lira. It has pledged to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153provide all the liquidity the banks need\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which should help them to keep providing loans to people and businesses. Delphine Arrighi, fund manager at Old Mutual Global Investors, argues that borrowing costs must rise to prevent the lira plunging to fresh depths. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Other options could include capital controls, which seem more likely than an appeal to the IMF, but that would certainly not be the least painful and would most likely precipitate a recession while postponing the return of portfolio inflows. Hence a sizable rate hike followed by drastic measures of fiscal consolidation still appear as the most viable option to re-anchor the lira and pull the Turkish economy from the brink. Turkish authorities have also launched a crackdown against social media accounts, which it blames for spreading \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and undermining confidence in the economy. Even German chancellor Angela Merkel has weighed in, saying she hoped Turkey could be economically prosperous. She also called for Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank to be properly independent -- a touchy subject, as Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has been pushing it not to raise interest rates. There are fears that currency speculators could drive Turkey deeper into the crisis in the days ahead: And on the streets of Turkey, people have spoken of their concerns as import prices jump and the value of their savings shrinks. One told the Guardian: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really understand any of it. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an argues with Trump, and we end up trapped in a corner.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can just pray to God,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. The US stock market is heading lower, as worries over Turkey ripple weigh on Wall Street. Banks are bearing the brunt, with Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan both down around 1%. Traders remain worried that the Turkish crisis will escalate, unless Ankara takes more decisive steps - such as an interest rate hike. A bit more from Ed Conway: After a day of heavy losses, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchange has closed deep in the red with the benchmark BIST 100 index losing 2.4%. Financial stocks felt the full blast of the currency crisis, with some bank stocks falling by over 10%. The slump is even worse if you adjust for the depreciation of the lira, points out Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ed Conway in this thread about the situation in Turkey: Our economics editor Larry Elliott has written a new Q&amp;A on the Turkish crisis. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: What are the implications for the global economy? The direct impact of what looks like an inevitable recession in Turkey would be relatively small because, despite a population of 80 million and strong growth in recent years, the country accounts for only 1% of global GDP. Eurozone countries run a trade surplus with Turkey but it is small. In the two previous Turkish financial crises since the turn of the millennium, European exporters have been able to divert their business to other markets. The European Central Bank has expressed concern about potential contagion through the eurozone banking system, with Spain, followed by Italy, the most heavily exposed countries. A bigger danger is that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crisis will spill over into other emerging market economies and there were signs on Monday that other countries seen as vulnerable were coming under speculative attack. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems are particularly acute because it has more than $300bn of dollar-denominated corporate debt, which is getting more expensive to finance by the day. However, other countries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as Mexico and South Africa - also took advantage of low US interest rates in the years after the financial crisis to borrow heavily in dollars and saw their currencies coming under pressure. The fear is of a full-blown emerging market crisis. The lira is weakening in late trading, and is threatening to plunge back the 7 lira-to-the-US dollar mark to a new all-time low. Andy Birch, principal economist at IHS Markit, fears the lira will keep tumbling until Turkey raises interest rates: The changes to reserve requirements in recent days and the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unspecified action plan has done little to stabilize the lira. Significantly more than just official promises of action are needed to exit the current crisis. IHS Markit continues to believe that the most immediate step to be taken to rescue the lira is a sharp central bank rate rise. If this step is taken in conjunction with a shifting of government rhetoric, the plunge of the lira could pause and portfolio investment outflows may slow. Turkish citizens are struggling to cope with the impact of the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s astonishing losses in recent days, report Kareem Shaheen and Gokce Saracoglu in Istanbul. Some fear their businesses could shut down, while others who support the president say they will buy domestic products and shun goods from abroad. Those who cater to tourists, however, hope that the decline in the value of the currency will bring more foreign holidaymakers to the country. All declined to give their full names. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Go your way, nothing will happen to this country, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen the lira much lower than this in the 1990s,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one foreign exchange office worker. Money-changing offices in Istanbul were selling dollars at a much higher rate than the banks on Monday, however, saying the fluctuation in the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value was so unstable as to render the price they set meaningless. One vegetable and fruit seller said he had been forced to raise the price of imported products. A kilogram of bananas that cost 10 lira last week was now 15 lira. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to send Erdo\u00c4\u0178an away,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. While ordinary Turks struggle to absorb the effects of high inflation and a declining currency, some foreigners who earn salaries in dollars and tourists are buying up luxury items. Pictures on social media over the weekend showed queues of foreigners outside stores such as Luis Vuitton and Chanel. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of tourists, especially Arabs, buy from our store,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the manager of a high-end design store in Galata. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But every 15 days we have to buy new supplies from Europe. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their full report: European stock markets have closed in the red, as Turkish worries weigh on shares. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 shed 24 points, or 0.3%, to end the day at 7642. Holiday firm TUI was the worst-performing stock on the Footsie, losing 2.5%. Last week, it revealed it was taking a financial hit on euro-denominated loans taken out to fund hotel building in Turkey. The lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses push up the cost of repaying that debt. European banks with exposure to the Turkish economy also had a bad day. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BBVA lost 3.2% while Unicredit shed 2.5%. Argentina has been hit by the anxiety rippling through the financial markets today. The peso has fallen to a record low, at around 30 pesos to the US dollar. Back in April it was trading around the 20 mark, before a slump in market confidence forced Buenos Aires to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. The peso is also being driven down by an unfolding scandal involving alleged bribes made to former officials of the Kirchner government (which was in power until 2015). More than a dozen business people have been arrested, after it emerged that the chauffeur of a former government official had kept diaries which allege to show payments totalling millions of dollars. The ongoing investigation has also hit share and bond prices, as traders wonder whether more executives, or politicians, will be dragged in. Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama, currency exchange offices have been operating as normal in Turkey today. Here are some photos from Istanbul: While the slump in the lira is bad news for Turkish citizens, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something of a boon for tourists. For example, one pound is now worth 8.8 lira -- compared to just 4.5 lira a year ago. That makes Turkey an attractive destination for Brits, driving down the cost of accommodation and food. Economics columnist Matt O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Brien has written a pithy explanation of the Turkish financial crisis, which new readers might find particularly helpful: In another worrying sign, the cost of insuring Turkish government bonds has jumped today. The cost of a five-year credit default swap (which would pay out if Ankara can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t repay its bonds) jumped to 573 basis points, up from 452bp on Friday. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to data firm Markit, and suggests Turkish debt is now seen as riskier. Technically, it means it would cost $573,000 per year to insure $10m of Turkish debt. After several hours of volatile trading, the Turkish lira has settled around 6.87 lira to the US dollar. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a loss of around 7% today (a whopping move by usual standards), but also a small recovery on the record low of 7.2 struck overnight. It also means the lira has still lost a third of its value in the last week. The news that the Turkish central bank is offering more liquidity to commercial banks (see earlier post) seems to have stemmed the panic. However, investors still want to see more comprehensive action to tackle its inflation and current account deficit, such as a massive hike in interest rates. Reto Foellmi, economist from the University of St Gallen, fears that further lira losses could be disastrous: The vibrant growth of Turkey relied heavily on financing in foreign-currency debt. While Turkish exports get cheaper, Turkish companies face higher repayment obligations of the loans which hurts banks as well. As the Lira has a reputation as a weak currency, Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rhetoric puts oil into the fire. With a further weakening of the Lira, Turkey faces a downward spiral, where default could be the end. The Turkish crisis dragged world stock markets to a one-month low today. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell 0.6% this morning, as the Turkish lira hit fresh record lows against the US dollar. That was driven by losses in Asia overnight, in Europe this morning, and at emerging markets across the world. Dean Popplewell of City firm OANDA says anxiety over Turkey has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153severely bullied emerging markets into near submission.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In Japan, the Nikkei tumbled -2% to a five-week low overnight as a sell-off in emerging market currencies frightened investors, with the safe-haven yen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (\u00c2\u00a5110.20) appreciation also hurting sentiment. The broader Topix dropped -2.1%. Down-under, Aussie shares ended lower overnight, weighed down by materials and banks after the crisis in Turkey hit Asian assets, while global trade turmoil pushed commodity prices lower. The S&amp;P/ASX 200 index fell -0.4%. In S. Korea, the Kospi ended down -1.5%, in line with other Asian countries. However, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is holding its nerve. Wall Street is calm in early trading, with the Dow Jones industrial average up 60 points (or 0.23%). The EIU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Agathe Demarais adds that Turkey has a lot of work to do to regain market confidence -- but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear that such measures will be taken..... With an overheated and indebted economy, Turkey will require credibly orthodox economic policies, fiscal discipline and central bank independence to reverse the current situation. A normalisation of relations with the US could also reduce the amount of legwork that the central bank will have to do to control the economic situation, but this is unlikely to happen at the moment. In view of the domestic political and economic conditions, it is therefore unclear whether the necessary steps will be taken to contain the market fallout. Agathe Demarais, Turkey analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, has predicted that Western banks will suffer losses from the Turkish lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump soon. She told the AFP newswire that the impact of the currency crisis will ripple through the financial world, as Turkish companies find they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t service loans taken out in dollars. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So far the impact of the lira crash has been limited in Europe and the rest of the world. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, within a few months western banks that have strong ties with Turkey will feel the impact of the crisis as Turkish corporates will struggle to repay debt in foreign currency. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sharp depreciation of the lira has almost doubled the local currency value of external debt repayments since the start of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd German chancellor Angela Merkel has now waded into the crisis, urging Turkey to ensure the independence of its central bank. Merkel told a news conference in Berlin that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No one has an interest in an economic destabilisation inTurkey. But everything must be done to ensure an independent central bank,. Germany would like to see an economically prosperous Turkey. This is in our interest.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Turkish central bank has been restricted by Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opposition to higher borrowing costs (he believes they cause inflation, while most economists believe they restrict it). Turkish interest rates are currently 17.75% -- very high by current standards. Some City experts, though, argue they should be hiked by over 1000 basis points (to around 27%) to prop up the lira. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Associated Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on the Turkish leader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech earlier today. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says his country is under an economic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153siege\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that has nothing to do with its economic indicators. During an address to Turkish ambassadors in the capital, Ankara, Erdogan said Monday that Turkey would overcome the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153attack\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on its economy. He insisted that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy remains strong and said the currency would soon settle \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at the most reasonable level.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In an apparent reference to the United States, Erdogan said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the bullies of the global system cannot roughly, shamelessly encroach on our gains that were paid for by blood.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Turkish leader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments came after authorities launched investigations into hundreds of social media accounts for alleged reports they claimed were helping the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plunge. Erdogan said there is an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic terror\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd being waged on social media, adding that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153traitors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd would be punished. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters first take on the Erdo\u00c4\u0178an speech: President Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an said on Monday he expected attacks on Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy to continue but predicted the lira would return to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rational levels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd soon, after the Turkish currency hit a record low of more than 7 to the U.S. dollar. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an, who has described the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall as the consequence of a plot rather than economic fundamentals, also said that spreading false news about the economy was treason and recent U.S. actions were a stab in the back against Ankara. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clip of president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an addressing the Ambassadors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 conference a moment ago: The lira is weakening, following Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that America is trying to stab Turkey in the back. It has dropped back to 6.9 lira to the US dollar, close to this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record low of 7.2. President Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has also declared that spreading false news about false news about Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153treason\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That follows this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crackdown on social media accounts blamed for sharing misleading information about the crisis. Heads-up: Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is giving a speech now, 10th annual Ambassadors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Conference in Ankara. Bloomberg say Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has told the conference that Turkey must prepare for further attacks on its economy. He has accused America of breaking World Trade Organisation principles (presumably by doubling tariffs on Turkish metal exports last week). Erdo\u00c4\u0178an adds that America is trying to stab Turkey in the back. On the market turmoil, Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has told his audience that the lira would settle at a rational level soon. There is no \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceconomic basis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for recent exchange rate moves, he adds. There will also be no retreat from free market economic policies, he insists. More details to follow soon Some UK stocks are taking a direct hit from the Turkey crisis. Travel firm TUI is leading the FTSE 100 fallers, down 3.3% this morning. In theory, the slump in the lira makes Turkey a more attractive holiday destination. In practice, reports of financial instability are likely to deter tourists. Ashmore, a fund manager focused on emerging markets, is down 5%. Stockbroker AJ Bell explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fund management group Ashmore is widely seen as the London-listed bellwether for emerging markets and its shares are unsurprisingly being sold off in the wake of the crisis in Turkey. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The recent collapse in the Turkish lira has served to trouble investors around the world and triggered a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrisk-off\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mentality. Put simply, investors are less willing to hold assets in higher risk areas such as emerging markets, and are switching instead to assets deemed to be safer havens. Fiona Cinoctta, senior market analyst at City Index, reckons the Turkish government only has a few days to stem the crisis. She warns that the slump in the lira could prompt some companies to default on their US dollar loans, triggering a domino effect: The lira had already declined 20% against the dollar on Friday on a mixture of domestic financial problems and increasing friction with the US and the decline continued this morning with the Turkish currency plumbing new lows. For the time being Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial crisis looks localised but the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has perhaps only days to stop the decline of the currency before the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s freefall results in loan defaults, starts seriously affecting the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system and potentially starts spilling over onto European banks. Into this domestically induced financial slide comes the deteriorating relationship between Turkey and the US. The US is holding it against Turkey that it is refusing to support US sanctions against Iran and that is not releasing an American pastor who is being held on terrorism charges. The US response was fairly clear cut \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on Friday when the lira was in freefall the US announced it would raise the tariffs on imports of Turkish steel to 50% and the tariffs take effect Monday morning. The selloff at the Istanbul stock market is gathering pace. The BIST 100 index has fallen 4%, with some bank stocks suffering double-digit losses. You can get up to speed on the Turkey crisis with this Q&amp;A: Plus, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics editor Larry Elliott on why Turkey needs to raise interest rates sharply, or turn to the IMF for help.... Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s answer to the financial crisis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that his followers should do their patriotic duty and exchange rapidly appreciating US dollars for ever-more worthless Turkish lira \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is laughable. Indeed, it will merely add to the belief in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets that Turkey is being led by a man who has lost touch with reality. It is clear what needs to happen. Turkey has to tackle the three causes of its current predicament: an overheating economy; Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts since his re-election in June to prevent the central bank from taking the necessary action to deal with rising prices; and the stand-off with the US. For Erdo\u00c4\u0178an, that means eating a huge plateful of humble pie. He is going to have to surrender to Trump over [jailed pastor Andrew] Brunson, because he is damaging the economy by continuing with a fight he cannot win. And he will need to accept that tough and unpopular measures are now inevitable to prevent a total collapse in the currency leading to hyper-inflation. The slump in the Turkish lira in recent weeks is quite extraordinary. It has lost a third of its value against the US dollar in a week (!) as investors have grown more anxious about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial health, its diplomatic row with the US, and its central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reluctance (or inability) to raise borrowing costs to stem the crisis. This chart shows how the crisis could spread to Europe, if Turkish banks find themselves struggling to repay dollar-denominated debts: Turkish authorities have launched a crackdown on news and social media posts which are threatening confidence in the economy, according to local reports. Turkish financial regulators are threatening legal action against those who make or publish \u00e2\u20ac\u0153erroneous and fabricated news and statements\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Almost 350 social media accounts are under investigation, for undermining the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate against the US dollar. The move comes as president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office warns that there is a co-ordinated attempt to undermine the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. H\u00c3\u00bcrriyet Daily News has the details: The Chief Prosecutor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office in Istanbul has opened an investigation into actions threatening \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic security,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial watchdog launched a separate probe into what it described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fake news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd aiming to manipulate economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An investigation has been launched according to Turkish Penal Law, Banking Law, Capital Markets Board regulations and related laws into people who displayed actions that threaten economic security through manipulative stories on media and operational social media accounts as part of the economic attacks that target the Republic of Turkey, its social peace, unity and economic security by the powers behind the [2016] coup attempt,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the prosecutor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office said in a statement on August 13, according to the state-run Anadolu Agency. In a separate statement, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Interior Ministry said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a judicial investigation has been launched into 346 social media accounts who shared posts to provoke the rise in the dollar exchange rate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meanwhile, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Crime Investigation Board (MASAK) also launched a probe into what it described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fake news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd aiming to manipulate economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153MASAK started an investigation into people and institutions that spread fake news, such as those claiming that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe state will intervene to convert foreign exchange in accounts into Turkish lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcit will fix dollar exchange rate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by ditching floating rate policy, which is a main pillar of the free market,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Treasure and Finance Ministry Press Undersecretary Ali Berber said in a tweet on Aug. 13. More here: Turkey launches probe into \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 over lira rumors Overnight, the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s communications chief, Fahrettin Altun, has claimed there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disinformation campaign\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd underway to undermine confidence in Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sector. He is unhappy about reports that President Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is threatening to seize foreign currency deposits. Over the weekend, Erdo\u00c4\u0178an warned he would take new measures if businesses rushed to withdraw their bank funds. He told an audience in Trabzon that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is industrialists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 duty too to keep this nation on its feet. Otherwise we will set into motion our plan B and C.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Altun insist on Twitter, though, that this has been misinterpreted (although he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reveal what Plans B or C might be): Emerging currencies across the globe are suffering from the Turkish crisis. The South African rand has dropped to a two-year low, while Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rouble is at its lowest against the US dollar since early 2016. India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rupee hit a record low, with traders reporting that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank had intervened to prevent an even steeper loss. The Turkish lira is still sharply lower today, down 6% at 6.8 lira to the US dollar (having plunged through 7 lira in early trading). With the US dollar strengthening, traders fear that developing economies are going to suffer capital outflows - potentially creating fresh currency crises. Neil Wilson of Markets.com fears further pain for emerging markets [EM in City jargon]. The dollar is the big winner in all this as investors turn away from EM. This may very well make things worse, particularly as long-dollar increasingly becomes something of a one-way trade. This dollar rally has a lot further to go and this will heap more misery on EM. European bank shares are leading the selloff, driven by fears that they could be dragged into the Turkish crisis. Several European financial institution, including Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BBVA, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UniCredit and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BNP Paribas, have significant operations in Turkey. They have borrowed in US dollars and may struggle to repay those debts unless the lira recovers. BBVA shares have fallen by 2.2%, Unicredit have lost 2% and BNP Paribas are down 1%. On Friday, the Financial Times reported that the European Central Bank is concerned about their exposure to the Turkish crisis. Anxiety about spillover effects from Turkey is also pinning the euro at a one-year low against the US dollar (down half a cent at $1.137 right now). Yesterday, Turkish finance minister Berat Albayrak pledged that a new economic action plan would be implemented today. He announced: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153From Monday morning onwards our institutions will take the necessary steps and will share the announcements with the market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But that promise, and the Turkish central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new measures, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to be stemming the crisis. Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at financial services group ADSS, says Turkish policymakers need to do more: Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speeches over the weekend did little to calm down investors as he remains defiant and this morning news that the Turkish central bank implemented measures to improve liquidity is not addressing the main issue which is the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline. Ergodan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unwillingness to raise interest rates suggests that the situation might not be defused soon extending the risk-off sentiment seen across all markets. Anxiety over Turkey is hitting share prices across Europe too, following those losses in Asia earlier today. The main European indices have all fallen into the red in early trading. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has lost 0.8%, and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is down 0.45% or 35 points at 7631. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says contagion fears are engulfing the markets. The panic that engulfed the markets at the end of last week is showing no signs of going anywhere at the start of the new week. Traders were met with a sea of red as indices dived across the Asian session; investors shunned riskier assets overnight while safer havens such as the Japanese yen and Swiss Franc firmed; jitters surrounding the Turkish currency crisis were showing few signs of moving on. The Turkish Lira dropped a further 6.3% in trading overnight, breaking through TL7 and hitting an all time low of TL7.2 after comments from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan over the weekend failed to calm investors. The lack of any new significant policy and a defiant stance from Erdogan means that traders are bracing themselves for another day of hectic trading on Monday. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is suffering heavy losses this morning. The BIST 30 index of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top countries has slumped by 2.5% in early trading, with virtually every share down. Financial stocks, utilities and consumer-focused companies are all leading the selloff, as investors fear that the financial crisis is escalating. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at foreign exchange firm FXTM, argues that Turkish policymakers need take much more decisive action, immediately. With inflation expected to run above 20%, a current account deficit that continues to widen, bond yields trading at record highs and growing political tensions with the U.S., the Turkish administration have limited choices to stop the Lira from bleeding. Investors need to see serious economic measures and not political ones to prevent things getting completely out of control. This includes an emergency interest rate hike by the central bank, imposing capital controls, fiscal reforms, securing a rescue package by the IMF or other lenders and ending the current diplomatic fight with Donald Trump. Until such steps are taken, investors will continue to selloff Turkish assets. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has taken action to stem the crisis, after seeing the lira slump to a record low today. The central bank of Turkey has announced several measures to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153support financial stability and sustain the effective functioning of markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This includes providing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all the liquidity the banks need\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and taking a more active role in the foreign exchange markets. In a statement (online here), the bank says: The Central Bank will closely monitor the market depth and price formations, and take all necessary measures to maintain financial stability, if deemed necessary. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an attempt to stabilize the tumbling lira and improve liquidity in the banking system. The move is having some success - the lira has recovered to around 6.7 against the dollar, from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record low of 7.2. But, that still means it has suffered a huge depreciation in the last week: Crucially, the bank has NOT raised interest rates, despite some economists arguing they need to increase by perhaps 10 percentage points. Robert Bergqvist, chief economist at Swedish bank SEB, thinks more needs to be done: Asian stock markets and emerging currencies have been hit by the Turkish crisis today, and the euro has been dragged down to its lowest level in a year. My colleague Martin Farrer explains: The Turkish lira fell almost 9% in early trading on Monday and the euro hit a one-year low as investors feared that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial crisis could spread to European markets. Despite defiant words by the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an over the weekend pledging as yet unspecified action to reverse the slide, the currency slipped alarmingly against the US dollar on Monday. Asian stock markets were also down on Monday. The Nikkei in Japan lost 1.7%, Hong Kong was off 1.8%, Shanghai -1.7%, Sydney -0.5% and the Taiwanese bourse fell 3%. The euro dropped 0.3% to a one-year low against the US dollar on Monday as the falling lira fuelled demand for safe havens, including the greenback, Swiss franc and yen. The Vix volatility index measuring turbulence in financial markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c also known as the fear index \u00e2\u20ac\u201c jumped 16% on Monday. More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fear is sweeping through the financial markets this morning as Turkey falls deeper into a currency crisis. The Turkish lira has slumped to new record lows overnight, hitting more than 7 lira to the US dollar. That followed Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s precipitous declines, as investors fear that the country could be heading towards full-blown financial chaos. The crisis has been building for months as Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has surged higher, its current account deficit has risen, and its economy has been hurt by the strengthening US dollar. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasing autocratic governing stance - including putting his son-in-law into a key post running the economy - has spooked the markets. So has his dislike of higher interest rates, which would typically be used to prop up a weakening currency like the lira. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to double Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel and aluminium tariffs on Friday has added to the sense of panic. President Erdo\u00c4\u0178an did nothing to reassure investors over the weekend. Instead, in a series of public addresses, he blasted the United States over the dispute over a jailed US pastor, and appeared to hint that Turkey \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a Nato member \u00e2\u20ac\u201c might look elsewhere for help (Russia, perhaps?) He declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will say bye bye to those, who sacrifice their strategic partnership and alliance with a country of 81 million people on the altar of their relations with terror organisations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are working day and night for alternative markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Erdo\u00c4\u0178an also urged the Turkish people to do their bit, by converting any spare dollar and euros into lira. He told supporters in the north-eastern Turkish town of \u00c3\u0153nye that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there are dollars under your pillow, take these out. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there are euros, take these out \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 immediately give these to the banks and convert to Turkish lira and, by doing this, we fight this war of independence and the future. Because this is the language they understand.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Unless Turkish policymakers can get a grip, the situation could easily cause serious problems in other markets. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: The Turkish lira has taken a battering, and the banks in Turkey who have borrowed in euros might struggle to repay their loans if they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hedged their position. Some eurozone banks have substantial shareholdings in Turkish bank, and should the default rate rise in Turkey, it could have a knock on effect around Europe. It looks like the eurozone banking system is set for another period of turmoil as the exposure that some Spanish and French banks have to Turkey could hurt confidence in the region. European banks have enough to worry about with their own non-performing loans, and let alone Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakened loan books. When it comes to the health of banks, traders usually steer clear of stocks and seek out safe-haven assets such as government bonds or the Japanese yen. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

Turkey will be represented at the EU foreign ministers meeting at the end of the month; a potential Turkey, Russia, France and Germany summit, though still not confirmed, is scheduled for 7 September; and Erdogan is slated to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the end of September.</p> <p>Erdogan is also likely to want to avoid triggering another crisis with the EU. Indeed, earlier yesterday, Albayrak tweeted a very positive response to German Economics Minister Peter Altmaier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of new US tariffs.

Back in May, <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-currency/turkeys-erdogan-calls-interest-rates-mother-of-all-evil-lira-slides-idUKKBN1IC1NV\">he called interest rates the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mother and father of all evil\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</a>.

This all happened under the supervision of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which offered more than $20 billion in financial assistance between 1999 and 2003, in return for a package of interest rate hikes and fiscal austerity.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This economic disaster paved the way for the 2002 general election victory of the newly-created Justice and Development (AKP) Party under Recep Tayyip Erdogan, so no investor should be surprised by how Mr Erdogan is now responding.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153His rise to power was at least partly fuelled by public discontent with the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s version of economic orthodoxy, so it is no wonder he is determined not to follow the path of higher interest rates and lower government spending now.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given that he also called interest rates \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe mother of all evil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in a speech last May, raising the question of whether he wanted to pay interest and repay overseas loans, let alone could do so, all it needed was some unexpected development to puncture confidence in Turkish assets and prompt capital flight.

Increasing signs that President Erdogan has been expanding his powers into the central bank, preventing rate hikes and articulating an outright demonisation of high interest rates, has led to the panic selling of the currency.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b72af9ae4b0cc3a88371d6e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-14T10:39:47.645Z\">11.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Reuters have published more quotes from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/aug/14/turkey-crisis-lira-rupee-germany-growth-uk-unemployment-business-live?page=with:block-5b72995ae4b0a246f44005a6#block-5b72995ae4b0a246f44005a6\">president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech in Ankara today</a>.</strong></p> <p>On the currency crisis, he called for Turkey to stay united:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Together with our people, we will stand decisively against the dollar, forex prices, inflation and interest rates.

                "bodyText":"A late update: Donald Trump is increasingly unhappy that Turkey still hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t released Andrew Brunson from house arrest, two years after the pastor was arrested on espionage charges. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told a press briefing that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The president has a great deal of frustration on the fact that Pastor Brunson has not been released as well as the fact that other U.S. citizens and employees of diplomatic facilities have not been released. Time for a recap. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government has come out fighting today against the market turmoil that sent its currency tumbling in recent days. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an raised the stakes, declaring that Turkey will boycott electronic products from the US. The Turkish president told an audience in Ankara that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will boycott US electronic products. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If they have iPhone, the other side has Samsung. In our country there is Venus, Vestel.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Finance minister Berat Albayrak also tried to restore confidence, pledging: We will make all kinds of preparations, from A to Z.... You will see that our lira will become stronger.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Albayrak also took a swing at America, saying that the US dollar had lost credibility after being used as a tool for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153political punishment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s environment minister also jumped on the boycott bandwagon, saying US products wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be used for Turkish construction projects. After days of losses, the lira has finally caught a break. It has rallied by over 8% against the US dollar today, back to 6.3 lira to the $, from almost 6.9 on Monday night. But the diplomatic rift between Turkey and the US hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been fixed. The White House is still demanding the release of American evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson, who has been held since the 2016 coup. Analysts argue that Turkey needs to take decisive steps to prevent the market mayhem continuing; eg, an interest rate hike, improved relations with America, and a strategy to lower Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit. Ripples from the Turkish crisis pushed India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rupee to a record low this morning, apparently forcing the Indian central bank to intervene in the FX markets. Over developing market currencies, such as the Mexican peso and the South African rand, strengthened though. In other news.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate has fallen to a new 43-year low, but wage growth remains disappointingly slow. Germany has posted 0.5% growth in the last quarter, helping the wider eurozone to expand by 0.4% - the same the the UK. After a calmer day than Monday, European stock markets have closed for the night. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 fell by 30 points, or 0.4%, even though worries about Turkey have faded. Mining stocks dragged the index down, as investors switched their attention to worrying about China instead. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Mining stocks are in the red after China revealed disappointing economic indicators overnight. Beijing confirmed that fixed asset investment grew by 5.5% - a record low. Industrial output held steady at 6% in July, but economists were expecting an increase of 6.3%. Retail sales rose by 8.8%, which was below the 9.1% forecast, and it was a slower rate compared with the 9% growth in June. The updates suggest that the Chinese economy is continuing to soften, and this prompted traders to dump mining stocks like Glencore, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. The German DAX ended the day flat while the French CAC index dipped by 0.17%. And in Istanbul, the Turkish stock market closed 0.75% higher - recovering some of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. At some stage, the Turkish leadership must move on from simply promising to protect the lira, and actually take action. Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group says president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an must take three steps. allows the Central Bank to significantly hike interest rates; de-escalate tensions with the US by releasing Pastor Andrew Brunson (or signalling a commitment to doing so) restore medium-term investor confidence via a credible program of fiscal consolidation and economic reform. The Turkish crisis could be a good opportunity for the EU to strengthen its relationship with Ankara. After all, both sides have experienced Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confrontational approach to diplomatic relations and trade. Rahman says: Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unpopularity in Europe makes it highly unlikely EU leaders are going to rally behind his approach. If anything, senior EU officials point to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153commonalities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that the EU and Turkey now both face vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis the US\u00e2\u20ac\u201don tariffs, threats and much besides\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand suggest these might be used as a jumping off point for any discussion that follows: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will tell the Turks we have sympathy for the situation they are in, but not how they are handling it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says one. Multiple meetings between EU and Turkish counterparts over the coming months will present an opportunity for the EU to better assess the situation; convey its concerns about Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deep-seated economic problems and reforms needed to fix them; and to potentially strengthen co-operation with Ankara. Turkey will be represented at the EU foreign ministers meeting at the end of the month; a potential Turkey, Russia, France and Germany summit, though still not confirmed, is scheduled for 7 September; and Erdogan is slated to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the end of September. Erdogan is also likely to want to avoid triggering another crisis with the EU. Indeed, earlier yesterday, Albayrak tweeted a very positive response to German Economics Minister Peter Altmaier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of new US tariffs. The Turkish mainstream (i.e. pro-AKP) media have also been quoting dovish remarks by Merkel. This suggests EU-Turkey relations are likely to continue to thaw, as we saw on 17 May at the EU-Western Balkans summit in Sofia. The blizzard of comments from top Turkish politicians is helping to underpin the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency. As this chart shows, the lira has recovered to around 6.5 lira-to-the-US dollar today - down from 6.88 lira/$ at the close of play on Monday. Traders are cheered by finance minister Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to make the lira stronger, and his pledge to stick to free market principles. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being taken as a pledge not to impose capital controls to shore up the exchange rate. Finance minister Berat Albayrak also pledged: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will protect the lira, we will march with the lira and the lira will strengthen greatly in the coming period.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And on the US dollar, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The dollar has lost its credibility. In times when the dollar has been turned into a tool for political punishment, we will continue to strongly take steps to protect the lira in international trade.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance chief has pledged to protect Turkish companies through the currency crisis, and predicted that the lira will recover its losses. Berat Albayrak, Treasury and finance minister (and president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son-in-law), said the government would protect the economy while sticking to free market rules and maintaining fiscal discipline. Details were scarce, though - but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough to keep the lira around 6.5 to the US dollar, a 5% gain today. Albayrak told members of the ruling AK Party, that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will make all kinds of preparations, from A to Z.... You will see that our lira will become stronger.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (thanks to Associated Press for the quote). Albayrak also followed Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead, by declaring that the US dollar is being used a means to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153politically\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd punish nations, and has lost credibility. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bold claim, given the US dollar has strengthened to a one-year high, while Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency slumped to an all-time low of 7 lira to the dollar yesterday.... Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boycott of American goods is gathering pace! The Turkish environment minister, Murat Kurum, has announced that Turkey will not use US goods in construction projects, Reuters reports. Kurum added that Turkey was going through an economic siege, due to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspeculative moves\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the value of the US dollar. The idea that Turkey will stop buying iPhones has received a mixed reception on the streets of Istanbul. Some Turkish citizens support president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boycott of US electronics, but others think the idea won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. Reuters reports: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We supported him with our lives on July 15,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd shopkeeper Arif Simsek said, referring to a failed 2016 military coup. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And now we will support him with our goods. We will support him until the end.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But shopkeeper Umit Yilmaz scoffed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have a 16-year-old daughter. See if you can take her iPhone away ... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All these people are supposed to not buy iPhones now? This can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd America has renewed its efforts to get pastor Andrew Brunson released from house arrest, two years after he was accused of espionage related to the 2016 Turkish attempted coup. Reuters has the details: The U.S. Charge d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Affaires in Turkey visited Andrew Brunson, the evangelical pastor whose detention and trial on terrorism charges has sparked a crisis between the two countries, and repeated a call on Tuesday for his case to be resolved. Jeffrey Hovenier, speaking outside Brunson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home in the coastal province of Izmir where he is under house arrest, said Washington wanted the pastor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as well as the case of the other unjustly detained Americans, and the Turkish national employees of the U.S. diplomatic mission\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd resolved fairly, swiftly and transparently. I mentioned earlier that White House National Security Adviser John Bolton told Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US ambassador yesterday that relations between the two countries won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t thaw until Brunson is released. The Turkish lira is holding onto its earlier gains, and is still up 5% at 6.5 lira to the US dollar. Edward Park of investment management firm Brooks MacDonald fears the rally won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last, though, unless Ankara take decisive action. How bad could the situation in Turkey get? Nick Brooks of asset management firm Intermediate Capital Group believes things will get worse before they get better, given its weak economic position. Brooks argues for a sharp hike in interest rates (from 17.75% today): The fundamental problem in Turkey has been the build-up of unsustainable economic imbalances (current account deficit if 6.3% of GDP, Corporate foreign exchange debt is 35% of GDP, inflation rate of 16%), while the economy is now in a vicious downward spiral with the fall in the lira leading to concerns about corporate and financial sector solvency, further pushing down the currency and increasing capital outflows. Only a sharp hike in interest rates to halt capital outflows and incentivise inflows will halt the downward spiral. Capital controls, if implemented, will not be effective as Turkey needs foreign capital inflows to fund its current account deficit and to re-finance large foreign currency borrowing coming due this year. Investors will not bring new funds into the country if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe they will be able to get it back out. Miranda Xafa, a former official at the International Monetary Fund, reckons Turkey could be forced to seek a bailout. Otherwise, it will struggle to repay debts issued in foreign currencies such as the US dollar, she explains: Amid fears that the Turkish currency crisis could pull down the eurozone, the German tabloid Bild has analysed the immediate effects it might have on German consumers. In a rather flippant article, it suggests the price of the popular chocolate spread Nutella should go down (as the hazelnuts in it come from Turkey). Jeans, and other items of clothing which Germany buys en masse from Turkey, should also get cheaper, it adds. But there are risks too. German banks have a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac17bn stake in Turkey, the paper points out (paywall). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less than other eurozone nations, such as Spain, whose BBVA bank is one of the most exposed to Turkey. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems have been building for a while, points out Witold Bahrke, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management. Bahrke explains how the strengthening US dollar has made Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit (the gap between what it imports and exports) a bigger problem. Turkey is in a genuine currency crisis, with the lira falling 30% over three days. Fundamentally speaking, the reason for the Turkish meltdown is primarily a large current account deficit, which is 6% of GDP, and reliance on outside capital. Markets do not care if liquidity stays abundant but can turn toxic when global liquidity dries up due to higher interest rates, the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance sheet shrinks, and the US dollar strengthens. Making things worse, there are serious doubts about the ability of policymakers to correctly assess what kind of storm is currently brewing and how to deal with it. Adding to the pain, a dispute between Washington and Ankara around the arrest of a US pastor in Turkey has prompted Trump to impose additional tariffs on Turkey this week. Altogether, we have a perfect storm. Why is Erdo\u00c4\u0178an so implacably opposed to raising Turkish interest rates, even though inflation has bubbled to dangerous levels? In a nutshell, the Turkish leader has an unorthodox view of economics, arguing that higher rates actually create inflation. Back in May, he called interest rates the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mother and father of all evil\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A month earlier, he criticised the Bank of Turkey for defying him and raising borrowing costs, making the markets concerned about central bank independence. The conventional view, though, is that higher borrowing costs squeeze prices down, as they make credit less affordable. Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell, thinks Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views are based on experience of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous financial problems \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The current Turkish situation bears all of the hallmarks of the Asian and Russian economic crises of 1997-98, which finally spilled over into the West and led to a short, sharp bear market in developed market share prices, while Turkey last got into serious trouble in 2000-01 when the lira collapsed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That crisis followed a period of rip-roaring growth funded by a rising budget deficit and rampant overseas borrowing that left the economy overheating \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which all sounds very familiar today, given Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $200 billion-plus of overseas debt, inflation in the high-teens and a current account deficit that represents nearly 6% of GDP. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When the smash came in 2000, the Turkish lira halved in value and GDP plunged while unemployment and inflation soared. This all happened under the supervision of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which offered more than $20 billion in financial assistance between 1999 and 2003, in return for a package of interest rate hikes and fiscal austerity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This economic disaster paved the way for the 2002 general election victory of the newly-created Justice and Development (AKP) Party under Recep Tayyip Erdogan, so no investor should be surprised by how Mr Erdogan is now responding. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153His rise to power was at least partly fuelled by public discontent with the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s version of economic orthodoxy, so it is no wonder he is determined not to follow the path of higher interest rates and lower government spending now. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given that he also called interest rates \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe mother of all evil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in a speech last May, raising the question of whether he wanted to pay interest and repay overseas loans, let alone could do so, all it needed was some unexpected development to puncture confidence in Turkish assets and prompt capital flight. After all, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccapital will always go where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s welcome and stay where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well treated\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as one-time Citigroup chairman Walter Wriston once said, and it may well be that Turkey now no longer fits that bill. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency crisis won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t abate until the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank is allowed to raise interest rates, argues David Kohl, chief currency strategist at Swiss bank Julius Baer. He writes: The Turkish lira has depreciated dramatically over the last few days. However, it is not the overall macro backdrop of Turkey that is so disastrous as to justify the sharp drop of the currency. Economic activity, including export dynamics and domestic demand, is actually growing at a solid pace. The sharp depreciation of the currency is driven by the fact that the Turkish economy is in constant overheating mode, with inflation above 15%. The reluctance of the central bank to step in has been weighing on the lira. Increasing signs that President Erdogan has been expanding his powers into the central bank, preventing rate hikes and articulating an outright demonisation of high interest rates, has led to the panic selling of the currency. Reuters have published more quotes from president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech in Ankara today. On the currency crisis, he called for Turkey to stay united: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Together with our people, we will stand decisively against the dollar, forex prices, inflation and interest rates. We will protect our economic independence by being tight-knit together.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He threatened retaliatory action against America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sanctions and tariffs: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will impose a boycott on U.S. electronic products. If they have iPhones, there is Samsung on the other side, and we have our own Vestel here.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also urged businesses to keep investing, and not be put off by the market turmoil: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we postpone our investments, if we convert our currency to foreign exchange because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s danger, then we will have given into the enemy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares in Turkish electronics firm Vestel have soared by almost 8%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benefitting from president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for Turks to buy its Venus smartphone instead of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s iPhone. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always been so dismissive of iPhones. Back in the attempted coup in 2016, the Turkish leader famously used Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FaceTime service to mobilise his supporters. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an made a video call to a Turkish television network, urging the people to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153convene at public squares and airports\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to oppose the Turkish military forces who were trying to overthrow him. The appeal worked, and Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has been tightening his grip on the Turkish levers of power ever since. By threatening to boycott American electronics, president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is signalling that he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be cowed by the market turmoil. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an interesting threat. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population is almost 80 million strong, meaning plenty of potential consumers. But...given the slump in the lira, US goods such as iPhones are now much more expensive for Turkish consumers - so sales of pricy imports were already likely to fall. Investors may be concerned that Ankara isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trying to calm the crisis - instead, relations with the Trump administration could be getting worse. As Neil Wilson of Markets.com puts it: Erdogan fired a shot back at the US with a statement saying he would ban US electronic goods. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine Apple is too worried about this, but it nevertheless points to a worrying deterioration in relations between Ankara and Washington. Erdogan doubling down like this won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help market sentiment. However, the lira is still holding onto its early gains as the currency stages a cautious recovery, after days of heavy losses. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Associated Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says his country will boycott U.S.-made electronic goods amid a diplomatic spat that has helped trigger a Turkish currency crisis. Showing no signs of backing down in a standoff with the U.S., Erdogan suggested that Turkey would stop procuring U.S.-made iPhones and buy Korean Samsung or Turkish-made Vestel instead. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If they have the iPhone, there is Samsung elsewhere. We have Vestel.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It was unclear how Erdogan intended to enforce the boycott. Erdogan also renewed a call for Turks to convert their dollars into the Turkish lira, to help strengthen the currency. The Turkish lira has nosedived in value in the past week over concerns about Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policies and after the United States slapped sanctions on Turkey angered by the continued detention of an American pastor. NEWSFLASH: Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president is giving another defiant speech, threatening to boycott American electrical goods in response to US sanctions. President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has told an audience in Ankara that the US was targeting Turkey. He warns: We will boycott US electronic products. If they have iPhone, the other side has Samsung. In our country there is Venus, Vestel [the Turkish smartphone brand]. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an also makes a direct threat towards the White House, warning that those who are waging \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic warfare\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd against Turkey will pay a price. According to Bloomberg, he says: There is a price we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying for the period we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in. But there will be a price [which] those who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re waging an economic warfare against Turkey will also pay. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is vowing to maintain a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153firm political stance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as his government takes the necessary measure to protect its economy. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an also argued that flip-flopping was not in the Turkish nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s character, and that switching to foreign currencies would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153giving in to the enemy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speaking at an event organised by Turkish think tank Seta (the Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research). These charts show the divide in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market, with unemployment at a 43-year low, but wage growth decidedly underwhelming: Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate has hit a new 43-year low. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate dropped to just 4.0% in April-June 2018, down from 4.2% previously. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest level since the winter of 1975, when Harold Wilson was prime minister. The Office for National Statistics reports that the number of people in work rose, while those out of work fell. However, the number of people dropping out of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour force also rose, and more people became self-employed. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: The number of people in employment increased by 42,000 on the quarter to 32.39 million in the second quarter of 2018. Unemployment declined by 65,000 on the quarter to 1.36 million. The level of inactivity increased by 77,000 on the quarter, resulting in the inactivity rate increasing to 21.2%. The number of self-employed people increased by 22,000 on the quarter to 4.77 million in the second quarter of 2018. However, people aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feeling the benefits in their pay packets. Total earnings (including bonuses) only rose by 2.4% per year during the quarter, down from 2.5%. Germany has beaten expectations by growing by 0.5% in the second quarter of 2018. The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy benefitted from stronger domestic demand from households and companies. Statistics body Destatis also reports that German exports rose during the quarter, while imports increased at an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153even stronger\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pace. Germany has outpaced the UK over the the last quarter (UK GDP rose by 0.4%), and was rather faster than France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.2% expansion. German growth in the first quarter of 2018 was also revised higher, from 0.3% to 0.4%. Teis Knuthsen of Denmark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kirk Kapital points out that Germany has now been growing for four years in a row: However, economist Ulrik Bie thinks Germany could still falter in the months ahead, as Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crisis and the US-China trade wars bite. Despite the rupee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide, the picture is brighter in other emerging markets this morning. South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rand has gained 2%, as it bounces back after hitting a two-year low during Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff . Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rouble is up 1.5%, reaching 66.76 to the US dollar having struck 68 (also a two-year low) on Monday. The Mexican peso is also catching a break, up 1% too. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is also rallying this morning, up over 2% in early trading. That mean shares have clawed back most of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. After days of very heavy losses, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency is recovering some ground. The lira has risen by around 5%, taking it back to 6.5 lira to the US dollar from over 6.88 late last night. That could be a sign that investors are recovering their nerve - however, this still leaves the lira in a precarious place (it was worth 3.7 lira to the dollar at the start of 2018). India shares another problem with Turkey, and indeed with all emerging markets -- the strengthening US dollar. As America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates, capital is being sucked out of developing markets and back to the US (because dollars offer a higher rate of return). That weakens EM currencies, putting pressure on their central banks to raise interest rates too -- which undermines growth. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says: Economies with large current account deficits such as India, Argentina and South Africa will come under increased economic pressure as the Fed continues to tighten monetary policy. The rupee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes are a sign that emerging market contagion is worsening, says Neil Wilson of Markets.com: India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rupee slipped to a record low against the dollar, with one USD buying 70 rupees at one point this morning. This follows the chaos in the Argentine peso market on Monday as the currency plumbed fresh depths even as the central bank raised interest rates by 5 percentage points to 45%. The rand is coming off its lows but the pressure across the board is there to see. The Financial Times says the rupee is suffering from investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 concerns about India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lack of progress in fiscal consolidation and the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s widening current account deficit. That sounds rather similar to Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems (without the diplomatic row with America, of course) Overnight, America has warned Turkey that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t end the diplomatic row between the two countries until US pastor Andrew Brunson is released from house arrest. White House National Security Adviser John Bolton met Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambassador to the US, Serdar Kilic, yesterday and insisted that Brunson -- who was arrested in 2016 and charged with espionage -- must be freed. Bloomberg explains: President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top national security aide warned Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambassador on Monday that the U.S. has nothing further to negotiate until a detained American pastor is freed, according to two people familiar with the matter, signaling a standoff between the countries will continue as Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial meltdown spreads to emerging markets. More here. Last night, my colleague Martin Chulov reported that a misunderstanding between Donald Trump and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an over Brunson, and a Turkish woman detained in Israel, may have helped caused the crisis. The Indian government is urging people not to panic about the rupee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide to a record low this morning. Subhash Chander Garg, economic affairs secretary at the ministry of finance, has blame the move on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexternal factors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (a reference to the Turkish crisis, and the wider US dollar rally, I think), adding that there is no need to worry. Newsflash: India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rupee has fallen to a record low, as Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency woes sends ripples through emerging markets. The rupee fell to 70.09 to the US dollar on Tuesday morning, as investors fretted that the lira crisis will spread to other developing nations. The slide means the rupee has lost a tenth of its value so far this year. Traders in Mumbai report that the Indian central bank may have stepped in to stabilise the currency after it fell through the 70-point mark for the first time over. N. S. Venkatesh, chief executive of the Association of Mutual Funds in India, told the AFP newswire that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors are concerned that the rupee has crossed the 70 benchmark today.... The Reserve Bank of India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy has shown concern for the rupee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fluctuations so investors should not be worried by knee-jerk reactions in the forex market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Turkey is in the eye of the storm today thanks to the currency crisis that has wiped a third off the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value in the last week. As we covered yesterday, the Turkish crisis gave other emerging markets a jolt yesterday - forcing Argentina to hike its interest rates to 45% after the peso hit an all-time low. President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an refused to bow to pressure from the markets yesterday. Instead, he hit out at the US for imposing sanctions in an attempt to force Turkey to release an American pastor named Andrew Brunson, who is currently under house arrest. He declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are together in NATO and then you stab your strategic partner in the back.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Currently the lira is bobbing around 6.8 to the US dollar, close to Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all-time low of 7.2. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank seems to have calmed the crisis a little, by pledging yesterday to provide liquidity to its banking sector. But worries over Turkey are mounting; its inflation rate is pushes higher, its current account deficit is worryingly high, and its companies may struggle to repay loans taken out in US dollars. The markets remain unconvinced that Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government can cope with the currency crisis, triggered by the diplomatic spat with Washington that has resulted in higher U.S. tariffs. Many economists argue that Turkey urgently needs a big rate hike, something Erdogan has opposed in the past. European stock markets are expected to open higher, having been dragged down by Turkish worries on Monday. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says investors will be watching emerging markets today. The selloff in the Turkish Lira and the knock-on effects to other currencies and asset classes will continue to attract attention through today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session. Also coming up today New UK unemployment data is expected to show that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate stuck at 4.2%, the lowest in over 40 years. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the good news. The bad news is that wage growth probably remains weak, with basic pay expected to only rise by 2.7% year-on-year. We also get a new estimate of eurozone growth in the last quarter; it will probably confirm that the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy expanded by just 0.3% in April-June.

Most of these liabilities fall on the private sector, mainly banks and corporations; the sovereign owes only $11 billion. What makes the problem worse is that the external financing requirement is trending up over the medium term, indicative of a long-standing over-reliance on foreign-funded leverage. </p> <p>As the lira collapses, this lending boom now is undoubtedly grinding to a sudden halt. Foreign financiers, whether they exist as banks or bond investors, are re-assessing the outlook and related repayment prospects.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap: Qatar has come to Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aid today, pledging to invest $15bn in the country to help it ride out its currency crisis. The offer came as Turkish president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an hosted Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, emir of the Gulf state (photos). Analysts believe the move will help Turkey ride out the crisis - with the money committed to helping the financial sector. In the long run, though, many investors are looking for conventional measures such as an interest rate hike. Turkey has escalated the diplomatic row with the US today, by slapping hefty tariffs on American imports. Cars, spirits and beauty products will all become much more expensive, as Ankara retaliates against America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s metals tariffs. Turkey has also taken steps to prevent traders betting against its currency. Financial regulators tightens the rules around foreign exchange derivatives, making it harder to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the lira. After days of heavy losses, the lira has staged a recovery. The currency has gained over 5% today to trade around 6 lira to the US dollar, compared with a record low of 7 earlier this week. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says: The limits on shorting the Lira taken by Ankara have halted the slide in the currency, which has firmed over 4% after its 20% decline, easing contagion fears and cooling the threat on financials. Whilst this is a short-term measure, its doing the trick for now. However, it was the more confrontational move by Ankara to raise tariffs on American cars, alcohol, cigarettes, escalating tensions with the US that has caught the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention and increased flows into safe havens such as the Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc. Financial markets have indeed had a bad day. Shares fell across Europe, and commodity prices were hit by worries over emerging markets - including Turkey and China. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story on the situation in Turkey: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today (unless any major news breaks tonight....) Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Political scientist Soner Cagaptay of the Washington Institute believes Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s help could be crucial for Turkey. He also points out that Ankara stood with Doha during last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blockade drama; Erdo\u00c4\u0178an loyalty then could be paying off now (as explained earlier). With a dull clunk, the copper price has sunk into a bear market. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lost 20% of its value since June! Three factors are driving the markets down, says Charlie Robertson of Renaissance Capital -- the buoyant US dollar, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade disputes, and the prospect of US interest rates going up. He says (via Reuters) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is dollar strength, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade wars and Fed tightening. They are an ugly combination for emerging markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Robertson is also cautious about Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to invest $15bn in Turkey. When will we actually see the money, and will it be invested sensibly? After a rough day, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has sunk to its lowest closing level since 26 April. The blue-chip index shed 113 points to 7497, a loss of 1.5%. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX closed 1.6% lower, while France lost 1.8%. Many developing markets also suffered losses today, which dragged emerging market shares into a bear market. The MSCI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main EM equities index is down 2% today, and 20% lower than its recent peak in January. Oliver Jones of Capital Economics blames worries about China, rather than Turkey: While there has been comparatively little news on the Sino-US trade war in the past few days, the Chinese activity and credit data released earlier this week were weak. They confirmed that domestic headwinds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially the ongoing slowdown in credit growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are at least as big a threat to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy as US protectionism. In our view, these headwinds mean that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy will continue to slow over the rest of this year. And this is a key reason why we think that EM [emerging market] assets will generally continue to struggle, regardless of what happens in Turkey. Countries that rely heavily on trade with China, most of whom are located in Emerging Asia, are probably particularly exposed. Alongside China itself, these countries dominate the main EM equity benchmarks, including the MSCI EM Index. Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move is a start, but not enough to rescue Turkey, says Mohamed A. El-Erian of financial services giant Allianz. BREAKING: Qatar has agreed to invest $15bn in Turkey, according to Turkish officials. This pledge follows the meeting between Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani and President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an in Ankara today. The money will apparently be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchanneled into Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets and banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The lira is strengthening following this announcement, now up 6% at 5.95 lira to the US dollar, from around 6.35 last night. Wall Street is also on the back foot, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping by over 1%. The big picture today is that shares are down, commodity price are taking a hammering, and many currencies are losing ground against the US dollar. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC index is having a particularly rough time, down 2%, with Germany and Portugal both down 1.8%. Zinc is down over 6%, and oil has lost 2.5%, as traders fret that an emerging markets crisis will hurt growth. David Madden of CMC Markets says dealers are worried about the currency crisis in Turkey, and the cooling of Chinese growth. European banks have lost ground today as investors are concerned the financial problems in Turkey could spread to the eurozone. Natural resource stocks like BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Randgold Resources and Glencore are all lower on the session as metals are under severe pressure. Copper, Platinum and Palladium are weaker as traders are concerned the Chinese economy is cooling, and yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing fixed asset investment and industrial production reports from Beijing confirmed their fears. The renminbi has been steadily losing ground versus the US dollar since March and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near its all-time-low, and that sums up the cautious sentiment surrounding China. Bank shares are also having a bad day, as Turkish contagion fears ripple. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning into a rough day in the City of London. The FTSE 100 index of top share is now down 121 points, or 1.6%, at 7490. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest level since late April. Mining stocks are still being hit hard , with some natural resource giants down over 5%. The strong dollar is pushing commodity prices down, and there is also concern that global growth could be hit by the Turkish crisis. If emerging market countries are forced to raise interest rates to support their currencies, it could dampen demand. Sterling is also being hurt by the dollar rally. The pound is down half a cent at $1.267, its lowest level in 14 months. Newsflash: Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president has held talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel. The two leaders agreed to strengthen their bilateral ties, according to Turkish officials. Associated Press has more details: Officials from Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office said during their conversation on Wednesday the two leaders confirmed their commitment to maintaining high-level visits and contacts to strengthen cooperation. They said that Turkish Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak would meet with his German counterpart, but did not provide a date. The two also discussed their planned meeting in Berlin at the end of next month, the officials said. Relations between Berlin and Ankara have been strained over the last couple of years. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an was angered when Germany blocked several rallies in the run-up to last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum, while Berlin protested when Die Welt reporter Deniz Y\u00c3\u00bccel was imprisoned - for a year - on propaganda charges. Just in: Photos of the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, conducting his \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworking visit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an today: A court in Istanbul has decided to release the Honorary Chair of Amnesty International Turkey, Taner Kilic, after more than fourteen months behind bars. Kilic had been detained in June 2017 and charged with membership of a terrorist organisation, which he denies. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interesting that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being released now -- at a time when Turkey is looking for help and support from other nations. Yesterday, two Greek soldiers who were arrested in March for entering Turkey illegally were released. However, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no legal progress on the case of American pastor Andrew Brunson, despite US pressure.... Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Secretary General, says the organisation is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153overjoyed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the news, and will keep pushing for more detainees to be released. Naidoo explains: Beneath the smiles of joy and relief there will be sorrow, anger and a steely determination. Sorrow for all the things Taner has missed during his cruel incarceration. Anger that the baseless charges against him and the Istanbul 10 have not been dropped. And determination to continue our fight for human rights in Turkey and for the release of all those human rights defenders, journalists and others who have been unjustly jailed in the vicious crackdown. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are overjoyed at this news. It has taken us more than a year of campaigning and struggle to get here, but it appears that Taner will finally be freed. Whilst we rejoice at this decision, our celebrations will only truly begin when he is safely back at home in the arms of his wife and daughters. Artjom Hatsaturjants, research analyst at Accendo Markets, says investors are nervous over the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153geopolitical back-and-forth between US and Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Neither side appears ready to back down over recent confrontation that sent the Turkish lira to new lows and raised a spectre of FX contagion across Europe. The turmoil in Turkey is testing stock market morale and sending the US dollar to its highest level since mid-2017, say Dean Popplewell of foreign exchange firm OANDA. U.S Treasuries prices have climbed a tad, while the greenback trades atop its 15-month highs against G20 currency pairs, again putting commodity prices under pressure. In Turkey, President Erdogan implemented an additional tax on a range of U.S imports (autos, tobacco and alcohol), signalling its squabble with the U.S. will continue. Crumbs. Foreign exchange firm International Currency Exchange (ICE) says it ran out of Turkish lira on Tuesday, after a surge in demand. ICE says that orders for Turkish Lira to its UK website www.iceplc.com jumped by 24,000% compared to the average last month. Most of its UK stores have sold out of lira, but you can still get your hands on them at London Luton Airport and Doncaster Airport. This surge in demand indicates that many British tourists have decided to take a last-minute holiday to Turkey, which are much cheaper thanks to the currency crisis. One pound is currently worth 7.7 lira on the international currency exchanges, up from 6 lira at the start of July. Louis Bridger, general manager at ICE, says there has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unprecented demand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the lira. We are working closely with our suppliers and the Turkish Central Bank to increase our stock however the demand is so high that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely we will be able to sell Turkish Lira online until tomorrow morning. We apologise if any customers are experiencing delays when purchasing their currency. For people travelling to Turkey who are unable to get their hands on Lira, they can take alternative major currencies such as US dollars and Euros which are easily exchangeable when they are out there.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European stock markets have all fallen into the red, as nervous traders pile into the US dollar. In London, the FTSE 100 has slid by 75 points, or 1%, with hefty losses on other markets too Mining shares are leading the selloff in London, with Anglo American shedding 4.5%. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re suffering from falling commodity prices, with copper and zinc on the slide. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly because the US dollar is rallying, hitting a 14-month high this morning. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, blames anxiety over the Turkish financial crisis: Turkey is nowhere near fixed, so risk appetite is struggling to make a comeback. European stock markets have steadily slipped into the red since the open, also leading a retreat by Wall Street futures. Prospects of a smooth and sustained recovery for emerging market currencies had looked too dicey to Asia-Pacific investors, so markets there mostly fell as well. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lira lost all Wednesday gains at one point, following Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bounce of more than 8%. It is now firmer again, though clearly volatile. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s uncertain whether the rebound will be sustained. Comebacks by other currencies that fell sharply in recent days, like the rand, Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rouble and Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peso, also falter. Turkish trade minister Ruhsar Pekcan says the new tariffs will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153protect the rights of Turkish companies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as well as retaliating against America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on steel and aluminium Pekcan also insisted Turkey isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dependent on the US, saying: The United States is an important trading partner, but it is not our only partner. We have other partners and alternative markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (via Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Anadolu news agency) Hiking tariffs won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help Turkey tackle its key financial challenge -- to keep servicing its foreign loans. Turkish companies owe almost $300bn in foreign denominated debt. That includes a surge in borrowing by Turkish banks, who have tapped foreign wholesale markets to help fund its credit boom. The slide in the lira in recent weeks has pushed up the cost of refinancing those loans (finding a new lender when an existing debt matures). Jurgen Odenius, Economic Counsellor at PGIM Fixed Income, explains: The root cause of the crisis lies in a leverage-financed domestic demand boom that increased the external financing requirement of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporations, banks, and government to an estimated $229 billion this year. Most of these liabilities fall on the private sector, mainly banks and corporations; the sovereign owes only $11 billion. What makes the problem worse is that the external financing requirement is trending up over the medium term, indicative of a long-standing over-reliance on foreign-funded leverage. As the lira collapses, this lending boom now is undoubtedly grinding to a sudden halt. Foreign financiers, whether they exist as banks or bond investors, are re-assessing the outlook and related repayment prospects. Western European banks from Spain and France are particularly exposed, with over half of the debt owed to them. The trouble is that the Turkish financial system and the corporate sector are short dollars. GAM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul McNamara says the issue is crucial: Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new swathe of tariffs are going to have a major impact on the cost of US goods. The list, published on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Official Gazette, shows that the levies on some products will more than double. For example: Rice: Tariff more than doubled to 50%, up from 20% Spirits: Tariff more than tripled to 140%, up from 40% Coal: Tariff raised to 14%,from 10% Beauty and make-up products: Tariff doubled to 60%, from 30% Certain types of paper: Tariff doubled to 50%, from 25% Motor cars: Tariff more than tripled to 120%, from 35% Back in Turkey, the government is preparing for show of support from Qatar. The emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, left Doha to travel to Ankara for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153working visit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an. The Gulf Times says they will discuss bilateral relations between Qatar and Turkey. They will also examine: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153means of strengthening the existing strategic cooperation between the two countries in various fields, in addition to a number of issues of mutual interest. Turkey and Qatar are close allies. There is a Turkish military base in the Gulf state, and Turkey was quick to send food aid to Qatar when Saudi Arabia imposed a blockade last year. However, the wealthy Gulf state might be reluctant to anger America by providing Ankara with financial aid at this time. Just in: New inflation figures show that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living squeeze continues. The consumer prices index rose by 2.5% in July, up from 2.4% in June - the first year-on-year increase in 2018. The wider retail prices index rose by 3.2%, down from 3.4%, and faster than basic pay (which increased by 2.7% in the last year). Total pay, including bonuses, only rose by 2.4% in the last year. This RPI figure is used to set UK rail fares, so commuters should brace for prices to increase in 2019. Turkish media are reporting that a court has rejected an appeal for the release of American pastor Andrew Brunson. Hurriyet newspaper said the court in Izmir rejected the appeal from Brunson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyer, but that a higher court would review the appeal. If Brunson remains under house arrest, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see US-Turkey relations improving.... Economist Jens Bastian fears for Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial prospects: Robert Ward of the Economist Intelligence Unit says Turkey needs a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdecisive orthodox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 response to the currency crisis (ie, a chunky interest rate hike), rather than tariffs on US goods. Bloomberg has calculated that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs cover around $1bn of US imports. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s similar to the amount of Turkish steel and aluminium exports that were subjected to higher tariffs by President Donald Trump last week, suggesting this genuinely is a tit-for-tat response. The lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery comes as Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial regulators impose new restrictions on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks. These rules make it harder for banks to buy and sell foreign exchange derivatives with overseas banks. That will prevent some investors from betting against the lira. Reuters has the details: Turkish banking watchdog BDDK on Wednesday said it is cutting the limit for Turkish banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forex swap, spot and forward transactions with foreign banks to 25 percent of a bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equity. The BDDK had said on Sunday that the limit would be 50 percent of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equity. n a statement, the BDDK said the rate will be calculated daily and new transactions will not be performed or renewed until the current excess of the amount is realised at a quarter of a bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital. Paul McNamara, investment director at asset manager GAM, says this squeeze will have helped the lira recover: Investor Martin Enlund points out that it will also make it harder for Turkish investors to protect themselves from the crisis: Boom! Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency just dipped back below the psychologically important 6-lira-to-the-dollar mark, as this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally continues. The Turkish lira has risen by 2.5% in early trading, after Ankara hit the US with fresh tariffs. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently changing hands at below 6.2 lira to the dollar, up from around 6.35 lira last night, extending Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still an extremely weak position compared to four months ago, though, when one dollar was only worth 4 lira. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Turkey has raised the stakes in its diplomatic battle with America by hiking the tariffs on some US goods. Fuat Oktay, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vice-president, says the measures are a retaliation for the US government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deliberate attacks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the Turkish economy in recent weeks. Under the plan, the tax on US alcohol will be hiked to 140%, the car tariff is going up to 120%, while tariffs on coal, cosmetics and rice are also being raised. Oktay declared on Twitter that Turkey was responding to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to double the tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium. He tweeted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The import duties were increased on some products, under the principle of reciprocity, in response to the U.S.administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deliberate attacks on our economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The move comes a day after president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an announced a boycott on US electrical goods, encouraging Turks to shun iPhones and support local manufacturer Vestel instead. Last night, the White House renewed its calls for Turkey to release the evangelical pastor who has been detained by Turkish authorities on espionage charges since 2016. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The president has a great deal of frustration on the fact that Pastor Brunson has not been released as well as the fact that other U.S. citizens and employees of diplomatic facilities have not been released.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So with the crisis still swirling, investors around the globe will remain nervous.

The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) has been forced to hike interest rates sharply [earlier this year], which will have a dampening effect on credit growth. It will also increase default rates and the need for debt restructuring, hurting banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 asset quality.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153A credible commitment to grant the Turkish central bank monetary policy independence is critical. Unless the government introduces an austerity programme within the next weeks, an event such as sharply higher inflation (likely) or a large fine on Halkbank for violating US sanctions on Iran (possible) could trigger a full-blown balance of payments crisis, followed by a banking crisis. So far, the government has shown few signs of being willing to change course, either on economic policy or in its relations with the US. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The TRY is in for a bumpy ride on the road to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The CBRT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions this week and agreements with China and Qatar may take USD/TRY down to 5.50 or even lower, but without structural reform, the pair could reach 8.00 this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Gulay</strong> <strong>Girgin</strong> of Turkish bank <strong>Sekerbank</strong> argues that Albayrak performed well, telling Reuters that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first investor call.

It also includes tightening government spending, and giving the Turkish central bank the freedom to raise interest rates (something Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is opposed to).</p> <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Schmieding\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to-do list for Turkey:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Independent central bank</strong>: Making the CBT truly independent again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and thus able to pursue a policy that could inflict short-term pain for long-term gain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would make a policy change more credible.<br></li> <li><strong>Fiscal prudence:</strong> In emerging markets, monetary excesses often reflect prior fiscal choices. A monetary policy U-turn thus needs to be complemented by a sustainable fiscal policy. Otherwise, markets would suspect that the rising debt \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including the debt of institutions de jure or de facto directed by the government \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would eventually be accommodated by the central bank again. In such a case, the turn in monetary policy would not be sufficiently credible for long.<br></li> <li><strong>Change in key personnel:</strong> Appointing central bankers and a finance minister who command trust \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and who are perceived as being able to withstand political pressure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c could signal that Turkey is serious about a policy change. A finance minister who is the son in law of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autocratic president does not suit that description easily.<br></li> <li><strong>Mending relations with the US and the EU:</strong> US sanctions are not the cause of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s completely home-made economic problems. They merely triggered Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent sell-off. However, mending relations with the US and the EU would help in two ways. First, exactly because Erdogan may find it so difficult to ditch the policies that got him into trouble with the US and the EU, a shift in his approach to the US and EU could signal that he is serious about a change in economic policies as well. Second, US and EU concerns about Turkey partly focus on arbitrary detentions in Turkey. Anything that could be seen as strengthening the battered rule of law in Turkey may make Turkey a little more attractive for foreign direct investment again.<br></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b753973e4b030c7c692fb52\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-16T08:48:30.399Z\">9.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>Financial Times </strong>agrees that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister Albayrak faces a huge test when he speaks to investors on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/aug/16/turkish-financial-crisis-lira-finance-minister-berat-albayrak-investor-call-business-live?page=with:block-5b7513f9e4b030c7c692fa8e#block-5b7513f9e4b030c7c692fa8e\">this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conference call</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Some worry that Mr Albayrak and his team are simply out of their depth, having been caught off-guard by an economic and political crisis just weeks into the job.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have concerns that they fully comprehend the root of this problem,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a person who has dealt with members of Mr Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153They think their economy is in good shape and this is a pure economic war against them. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They keep saying there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a positive side [to what is happening] and that, if the lira is at TL6.8 to the dollar, it will improve exports and stabilise the current account deficit.</p> <p>Yes, that is true.

                "bodyText":"Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the Turkish currency crisis. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Goodnight! GW Wall Street is on a tear today, with the Dow Jones up more than 400 points (or 1.6%) in afternoon trading. Traders seem to be much more relaxed about Turkey and US-China trade wars than yesterday. Perhaps too relaxed, given we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve only seen modest progress on both issues today.... Ouch! President Trump also told his cabinet meeting that Turkey hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been a good friend, according to reports. Reuters says: The United States and Turkey have exchanged tit-for-tat tariffs in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to persuade Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to give up Brunson, who denies charges that he was involved in a coup attempt against Erdogan two years ago. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They have not proven to be a good friend,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump said of Turkey during the Cabinet meeting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They have a great Christian pastor there. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an innocent man.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd .... Trump said the United States had helped Turkey in a related incident, but that the NATO ally had not repaid the favor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They want to hold our wonderful pastor. Not fair, not right,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conference call with investors failed to really address one key issue -- whether interest rates will be raised sharply to support the lira (as some economists believe must happen). Robert Ward of the Economist Intelligence Unit say this is a big concern: The lira has pared some of its earlier gains, following Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to roll out more sanctions on Turkey. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now trading at nearly 5.9 lira to the US dollar, compared with 5.7 earlier. NEWSFLASH: America has signalled it will impose more sanctions on Turkey, unless US pastor Andrew Brunson is released from house arrest. The threat comes hot from the White House, where Donald Trump has been holding a cabinet meeting. During the meeting, the president criticised Turkey for holding the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wonderful pastor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd since 2016 on espionage charges. He then asked treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin about the state of play regarding Turkey. Mnuchin replied that America has put sanctions on Turkey, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we are prepared to do more\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to CNBC. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a timely reminder that the diplomatic row between Ankara and Washington could easily escalate, if Brunson continues to be detained. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a remarkable week for the lira. After plunging in early trading on Monday, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fought its way back as Ankara has clamped down on currency speculation, urged the public to help resist the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceconomic war\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and tried to reassure investors. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still much weaker than in April, when one dollar only bought 4 lira. A sense of relief has swirled through most of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets today. All the main indices have closer higher tonight, bar one -- Italian construction stocks declined in the aftermath of the Genoa bridge collapse tragedy. Otherwise, the FTSE 100 gained 58 points - or 0.75% - clawing back most of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Traders are a little less anxious about contagion risks Turkey today, following the Albayrak call. Worth noting, though, that the main Turkish stock index slid by 3.5% today, even though the lira recovered. Trade war worries have also ebbed, with China now planning to send a delegation to the US for fresh talks. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says: After heavy falls for the miners in the previous session, today the miners were the top sectorial gainer as metal process rebounded. News that China is sending a trade delegation to Washington for the first attempts at trade talks since the US levied tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports has boosted optimism that a deal between the two powers is still a possibility, even if a distant opportunity. Notably senior Chinese officials won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be in attendance, showing a level of caution from China over the ability of the two sides to reach a deal. However, for the markets it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a step in the right direction. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to strengthen its fiscal position (see earlier post) is likely to mean tough spending cuts. The Financial Times says: Turkey has set out plans to cut spending to bolster the lira as it seeks to navigate a way out of the crisis that has hit the currency and shaken emerging markets. In a much-anticipated conference call with 6,000 investors, Berat Albayrak, finance minister, indicated the country would largely use fiscal measures to slow down the economy and reduce a hefty current account deficit and inflation running at 16 per cent. Mr Albayrak said the government would be asking ministries for expenditure cuts of 10-30 per cent and that it would be aiming at a primary surplus of six billion Turkish lira for the rest of this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which analysts suggested could be Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest fiscal tightening this century. This chart shows how Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s external borrowing has risen sharply in the last few years, as a credit boom has driven growth: And this one shows how Ankara has run up larger budget deficits recently: Cristiana De Alessi of BNP Paribas has given Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new finance minister some credit for his comments today, but warned that Turkey faces a struggle. She cites Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reliance on external funding (its corporate sector owes around $220bn in foreign debt, according to CNBC): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The finance minister provided some comfort by acknowledging that rebalancing the economy is a priority through both fiscal and monetary policy and that capital controls aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an option.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The MTP (medium term programme) released in September will be key to see what concrete steps will be taken to turn this into sustained action. It will also provide a benchmark to measure the new government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s progress. My main concern is a lack of contingency plan if debt cannot be rolled over or if a slower growth rate exacerbates corporate NPLs. Turkey may require a stronger adjustment than is currently in their plans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Per Hammarlund, chief EM Strategist at Nordic bank SEB, fears that Turkey could be forced to seek help from the IMF -- despite Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledges today. He writes: Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak continues to reassure investors that Turkey will address its structural problems, but at this stage crisis measures, including sharply higher policy rates, a tightening of fiscal policy and support to troubled sectors such as construction, retail and banking will be key. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In sum, the economy is set to slow down sharply. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) has been forced to hike interest rates sharply [earlier this year], which will have a dampening effect on credit growth. It will also increase default rates and the need for debt restructuring, hurting banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 asset quality. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A credible commitment to grant the Turkish central bank monetary policy independence is critical. Unless the government introduces an austerity programme within the next weeks, an event such as sharply higher inflation (likely) or a large fine on Halkbank for violating US sanctions on Iran (possible) could trigger a full-blown balance of payments crisis, followed by a banking crisis. So far, the government has shown few signs of being willing to change course, either on economic policy or in its relations with the US. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The TRY is in for a bumpy ride on the road to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The CBRT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions this week and agreements with China and Qatar may take USD/TRY down to 5.50 or even lower, but without structural reform, the pair could reach 8.00 this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gulay Girgin of Turkish bank Sekerbank argues that Albayrak performed well, telling Reuters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first investor call. In general, I found it successful as the rhetoric suggests that they are aware of the problems in Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and reasonable solutions are being prepared. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very valuable that they underlined the negative effects of inflation on the economy and the target of single digit inflation was emphasized.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I also find the sustainable growth goal important. The importance of fiscal discipline was stressed. In a nutshell, it shows that problems of the economy can be discussed with investors and confidence can be restored. Paul McNamara of asset manager GAM is less effusive though: Ryan Connelly of Frontier Strategy Group was encouraged to hear Albayrak rule out capital controls: The lira is continuing to strengthen, following Berat Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conference call. It has now gained around 4.5% today, meaning one dollar is worth 5.7 lira, down from almost 6 lira to the dollar last night. Heres are the key points from Berat Alkayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first major performance before international investors: [FDI = foreign direct investment, such as the $15bn pledged by Qatar yesterday] Thousands of investors had piled onto the conference call. That shows the level of interest in Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predicament around the globe. Albayrak ends the call by saying he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like to meet investors soon. [Background: Some institutional investors have grumbled that Albayrak hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been willing to meet them and has been taking a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbunker mentality\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 since becoming treasury and finance minister in July] Earlier in the call, Berat Albayrak said he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect state-owned Turkish bank Halkbank to be fined by America for allegedly helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions. Halkbank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have jumped by 3.6% on this news. In May, a Halkbank executive was sentenced for two years and eight months in prison. He was convicted of charges of bank fraud and conspiracy to evade US sanctions for his role in a multibillion-dollar gold-for-oil scheme designed to avoid Obama-era sanctions on Iran. Some analysts have suggested that Halkbank could be targeted by Washington, if the diplomatic row with Ankara isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resolved. On US sanctions, Berat Albayrak says Turkey will turn to other parties - such as China and Germany - help it navigate the current situation. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 first take on Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conference call (which is still going on): Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said on Thursday Turkey won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hesitate to provide support to the banking sector, which was capable of managing current volatility, and there has not been major deposit flow from banks lately. In a conference call with investors, Albayrak said Turkey had already taken measures to curb forex funding and corporate sare in a comfortable position to meet short-term liabilities. Albayrak is now talking about the need to co-ordinate fiscal and monetary policy. In other words, the government and the central bank need to work together to fight the crisis. Investors, though, will want to know whether Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bankers will actually be given free rein on monetary policy, to raise interest rates. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take-home message for investors: Newsflash: Berat Albayrak says Turkey doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any plans to bring in capital controls [ie, restricting bank withdrawals and the movement of money in and out of the country]. It also isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning to turn to the International Monetary Fund, he tells investors. Albayrak is insisting that Turkey remains committed to the free market. On the fiscal side of things, Albayrak says Turkey wants to boost its primary budget surplus. All ministries have been asked to contribute to an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ambitious savings programme\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It sounds like he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promising to keep spending tight, saying that fiscal discipline is one of the anchors of the economy. Albayrak says that reducing inflation is Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top priority; it wants inflation to be in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsingle-digits\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as soon as possible. [Currently Turkish inflation is running at 15%] More snaps from Bloomberg: The crucial conference call between Turkey and thousands of investors is underway! Finance minister Berat Albayrak began by telling the call that Turkey will emerge from the current period of volatility stronger. He says that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector is healthy and strong, and capable of managing the situation. There hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been any major deposit flow from the banks either. We \u00e2\u20ac\u0153won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hesitate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to provide support to the banks if needed, Albayrak continues: More to follow.... Just in: Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic advisor has hailed the strength of the US dollar - even though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s causing serious pain in emerging markets. Speaking on CNBC, Larry Kudlow said the the strong dollar is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sign of confidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the United States, and good news for Americans \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of unrest around the world. Money is flowing into the U.S.A. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s terrific. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By the way, a strong dollar holds down commodity prices, gasoline prices are slipping, oil prices are slipping\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Kudlow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boss has also just tweeted about the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccherished\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dollar: However, a strong dollar INEVITABLY means other currencies are weaker, something Trump has labelled currency manipulation. The White House can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have it both ways. Newsflash: President Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has spoken by phone to French president Emmanuel Macron. The two leaders \u00e2\u20ac\u0153emphasised the importance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of improving bilateral investment, and economic and trade relations, according to the Turkish side. Macron also (apparently) told Erdo\u00c4\u0178an that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic stability was important to France. [He may have been thinking of the French banking sector; BNP Paribas is one of the European lenders with particular exposure to Turkey] This is why Turkey needs to persuade foreign banks to keep lending to its corporate sector: If Turkey can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t restore market confidence, it could become swept into a full-blown financial crisis that forces it to impose capital controls. This would prevent citizens and businesses emptying their bank accounts, stopping a run on the banking sector. But it could also create a wider crisis, undermining confidence in other emerging markets. Kamakshya Trivedi, co-head of emerging markets and foreign exchange research at Goldman Sachs, says capital controls wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t address Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big challenge - rolling over hundreds of billions of US-dollars worth of loans from foreign banks. He told CNBC this morning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Full-blown capital controls that everybody is worried about I think have a pretty limited chance of success, partly because they have a big external funding requirement. Back in the UK, social media personalities who gush about their favourite products -- but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reveal they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been paid -- have questions to answer. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) fears that some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153influencers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are breaching consumer protection law, which requires that any reward received for an endorsement is disclosed. It has asked a range of celebrities and social media influencers to explain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the nature of the business agreements they have in place with brands\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery today (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still up 3% at 5.8 to the dollar) There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a calmer feel in the markets today, with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 up 43 points or 0.6% at 7541. Yesterday it shed 1.5%, as investors fretted about a possible emerging market slowdown. Reports out of Beijing that the US and China will hold a new round of discussions at the end of this month has cheered the City, explains Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: This has prompted a rebound in the Chinese Renminbi from its recent lows while the continued recovery in the Turkish lira has alleviated short term concerns of a collapse in the currency. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the talks: Meanwhile in the UK, retail sales have bounced back thanks to the heatwave (which seems to have bunked off today, alas) and the football World Cup. The Office for National Statistics reports that retail spending rose by 0.7% in July, reversing a 0.5% drop in June. Food sales were strong, as Brits hit the barbecue and sustained themselves through England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s charge to the 3rd-4th place playoff. Online sales hit a new record high too, at 18.2% of total spending -- a reminder that the traditional high street is still under pressure. Turkey needs to make four changes to persuade the markets that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s serious about tackling its credit binge, argues Holger Schmieding of German bank Berenberg. And, awkwardly for Berat Albayrak, that includes appointing a finance minister who isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t married to president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daughter. It also includes tightening government spending, and giving the Turkish central bank the freedom to raise interest rates (something Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is opposed to). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Schmieding\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to-do list for Turkey: Independent central bank: Making the CBT truly independent again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and thus able to pursue a policy that could inflict short-term pain for long-term gain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would make a policy change more credible. Fiscal prudence: In emerging markets, monetary excesses often reflect prior fiscal choices. A monetary policy U-turn thus needs to be complemented by a sustainable fiscal policy. Otherwise, markets would suspect that the rising debt \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including the debt of institutions de jure or de facto directed by the government \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would eventually be accommodated by the central bank again. In such a case, the turn in monetary policy would not be sufficiently credible for long. Change in key personnel: Appointing central bankers and a finance minister who command trust \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and who are perceived as being able to withstand political pressure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c could signal that Turkey is serious about a policy change. A finance minister who is the son in law of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autocratic president does not suit that description easily. Mending relations with the US and the EU: US sanctions are not the cause of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s completely home-made economic problems. They merely triggered Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent sell-off. However, mending relations with the US and the EU would help in two ways. First, exactly because Erdogan may find it so difficult to ditch the policies that got him into trouble with the US and the EU, a shift in his approach to the US and EU could signal that he is serious about a change in economic policies as well. Second, US and EU concerns about Turkey partly focus on arbitrary detentions in Turkey. Anything that could be seen as strengthening the battered rule of law in Turkey may make Turkey a little more attractive for foreign direct investment again. The Financial Times agrees that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister Albayrak faces a huge test when he speaks to investors on this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conference call. Some worry that Mr Albayrak and his team are simply out of their depth, having been caught off-guard by an economic and political crisis just weeks into the job. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have concerns that they fully comprehend the root of this problem,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a person who has dealt with members of Mr Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They think their economy is in good shape and this is a pure economic war against them. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They keep saying there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a positive side [to what is happening] and that, if the lira is at TL6.8 to the dollar, it will improve exports and stabilise the current account deficit. Yes, that is true. But can you imagine how many people will declare bankruptcy one after another?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fledgling finance minister put to the test Berat Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family connections make it harder for him to establish confidence with investors. After all, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that the best possible candidate to become finance minister is also the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son-in-law. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a great look. Reuters has a good take: Albayrak must convince jittery markets that Turkish monetary policy will be determined by economic reality - and an independent central bank - rather than the powerful family chief behind his meteoric rise. Economists attributed the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s modest recovery on Wednesday to central bank measures which squeezed lira liquidity, raising borrowing costs without hiking the benchmark interest rate. Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public statements have so far had less success. Last Friday, from a hall in the ornate Ottoman-era Dolmabahce palace on the shores of the Bosphorus, he outlined the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new economic plan in a powerpoint presentation to bankers and business leaders. He promised central bank independence, tighter budget discipline, structural reform and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sustainable and healthy growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But the lack of detail or clear action worried markets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The issue here is that he lacks credibility,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Piotr Matys, an emerging markets strategist at Rabobank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to give him the benefit of the doubt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Berat Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise to power has attracted comparisons to another well-connected son-in-law, Jared Kushner. My colleague Martin Chulov explains how Albayrak has shimmied up the greasy pole: Albayrak completed a master\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of finance at New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pace University, before completing a PhD in Turkey. In 2006, two years after his marriage, he was appointed the chief executive of the energy and media conglomerate \u00c3\u2021al\u00c4\u00b1k, a role that opened connections across the region. In 2015, Albayrak was named energy minister \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the same year he became an MP. By later that year he had begun to consolidate political power, moving from one of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most influential businessmen to a figure at the heart of the power base \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and unmistakably tied to his father-in-law. He displayed a ruthless streak, eliminating perceived rivals within the ruling AKP party, such as Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s then prime minister, Ahmet Davuto\u00c4\u0178lu, and anyone perceived to be disloyal to Erdo\u00c4\u0178an. In the following years, Albayrak became both feared and formidable, acting as Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enforcer, while at the same time gathering powers that made him almost untouchable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as long as Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current leader remains in power. The pair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship has grown so close that Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trust has been described by those who know the pair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dynamic as almost unconditional.... More here: The lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally suggests Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to repel speculators is paying off. Yesterday, Turkish financial regulators imposed new restrictions on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks, which effectively made it harder and more expensive to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, or bet against, the lira. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s helping the lira to struggle back, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly room for further improvement: There are encouraging signs for Turkey in the financial markets today: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Living up to family expectations can be tough. But few sons-in-law will have faced such a daunting challenge as Berat Albayrak, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister. Albayrak, who just happens to be married to president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daughter Esra, has been facing a growing currency crisis since becoming Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treasury and finance minister last month. The surprise, and frankly questionable, promotion of the 40-year old Albayrak to such a crucial job arguably contributed to Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency crisis, as it indicated Erdo\u00c4\u0178an would be taking a more authoritative approach to economic issues. Today, Albayrak gets the chance to prove he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up to the task when he holds a conference call with international investors. Up to 3,000 investors and economists will dial in, Reuters believes. Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s task is to calm the jitters that drove the lira to record lows this week. That means proving that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank is actually independent, and that Ankara is committed to tackling inflation, and reining in its current account deficit. With talk swirling that Turkey could be forced into capital controls, or an IMF bailout, Albayrak needs a solid performance -- something that shows that Erdo\u00c4\u0178an didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t goof when he kept such a vital role in the family. The call takes place at 4pm local time, or 2pm BST. There is some optimism in the markets this morning. The Lira has risen to 5.7 lira to the US dollar, up 3% today. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an improvement on Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record low of 7.2, but still 20% less than a month ago. Some traders are encouraged that Qatar offered Turkey $15bn of investment yesterday. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no progress in the diplomatic row with America over the US pastor, Andrew Brunson, who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still under house arrest. Yesterday was a ropey day in the City, and beyond. Shares fell across Europe, while emerging markets fell into a bear market, having lost 20% of their value since January. Commodity prices also got thumped, amid fears over Turkey, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, and trade war fears. Today may be a bit brighter, though; China has said it will send a delegation to Washington to discuss trade issues later this month.

Asked whether the budget\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast of 2.75% wage growth next year could be achieved, Lowe said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153possible, even probable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that aggregate earnings would reach that level, but only when extra pay including bonuses was considered. Lowe said the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pullback\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in house prices in Sydney and Melbourne was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153welcome development\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, putting the market on a better footing after a period of unsustainable rising prices, debt and lower affordability. While banks were tightening lending standards in response to the banking royal commission, Lowe said reduced demand from investors had caused the price falls. Lowe said the banking royal commission had exposed how financial institutions had difficulty managing conflicts of interest, and remuneration structures had driven a sales culture that was not always in customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 best interests. But he warned against an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153overreaction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, warning that despite \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrible shortcomings\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd regulation still needed to strike a balance between protecting customers and allowing financial innovation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the solution is more and more regulation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Lowe noted trade tensions between the United States and China, and that the IMF had slightly downgraded its growth projections in response. He said an increase in tariffs of between 10% to 25% would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153manageable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Australia, slowing global growth but not halting economic expansion. But he warned of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worst-case scenario\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if tariffs were combined with lower business investment, which would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very damaging cocktail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Lowe said he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153less relaxed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than global financial markets about US policies of enacting fiscal stimulus through increased spending and reduced taxes. He said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly unusual\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to do so at a time when the deficit was 4%-5% of GDP, while the US was growing at above its trend rate and had high public debt due to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inability to reform entitlements\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.",

He says:</p> <p><strong>Exports:</strong> The eurozone earns 0.57% of its GDP by selling goods to Turkey. Even a 20% fall in exports to Turkey would not subtract more than 0.1ppt from annual Eurozone GDP growth. As global demand remains healthy, eurozone firms could likely contain the damage further by switching to other markets for some of these affected goods with only modest reductions in their selling prices.</p> <p><strong>Financial linkages:</strong> Spain, France and Italy are the most exposed eurozone countries to Turkey. According to BIS data, the exposure to Turkey of banks domiciled in these countries stands at $81bn for Spain, $35bn for France and $18bn for Italy. A major part of this consists of equity stakes in Turkish banks rather than in more dangerous intra-company loans or direct credit exposure. Turkish losses may well affect individual institutions in the Eurozone visibly. </p> <p>Still, eurozone banks are in much better shape than they were during the 2011-2012 euro crisis which had come right in the wake of the 2008/2009 mega-recession. The risk that the exposure of some banks to Turkey could turn into a systemic problem for the eurozone and/or cause a tightening of credit conditions in Spain, Italy or France remains remote.</p> <p><strong>Confidence effect:</strong> The real risk stems from the level of noise. Confidence and hence the readiness to spend and invest often drives the business cycle. As confidence is currently fickle with no established trend, even small but highly visible problems can nourish the feeling that the world is a dangerous place rather than full of exciting opportunities. We therefore see a clear risk that any noisy crisis - such as the Turkish turmoil - could take some toll on the Eurozone and retard the upturn in markets and business sentiment for a while.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b76c184e4b016cd4306bc62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-17T12:39:19.379Z\">1.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Holger Schmieding, economist at Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Berenberg, says the bank has lowered its year-end forecasts for the euro to $1.17 from $1.21, due to the Turkey crisis.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Turkey is no small fry.

Adding to concerns about Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget and Brexit uncertainty, the noise from Turkey could delay the rebound in eurozone business confidence and growth for a few more months despite the easing of US-EU trade tensions.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b76be6ce4b030c7c69306c7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-17T12:24:55.795Z\">1.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over in the US, Donald Trump has revealed that he has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to look into whether American companies should report earnings on a half-year, rather than a quarterly basis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1030416679069777921\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In speaking with some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top business leaders I asked what it is that would make business (jobs) even better in the U.S. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stop quarterly reporting &amp; go to a six month system,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one.

                "bodyText":"The Turkish lira has taken another battering today, falling 5% to 6.1 to the dollar (it lost nearly 7% at one stage) and the Turkish stock market is down 1%. It has been a tumultuous week that saw the lira go into meltdown on Monday when it hit a record low of 7.2 against the dollar and the panic spread to other emerging markets. A pledge by Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank to provide liquidity to banks and other measures, a pledge from Qatar to provide $15bn in loans to Turkey, and reassuring words from the finance minister yesterday helped calm nerves. But this afternoon, a Turkish court rejected a US pastor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeal for release, a day after the United States warned of further sanctions unless Ankara hands over Andrew Brunson, who is under house arrest. Reuters reported that a court in the western province of Izmir rejected an appeal to release the paster, saying evidence was still being collected and he posed a potential flight risk, according to a copy of the court ruling seen by the news agency. The lira has lost nearly 40% of its value against the dollar this year. The currency crisis has deepened concerns about the Turkish economy, in particular its dependence on energy imports and its foreign-currency debt burden. Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is expected to downgrade Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign credit rating after the markets close today. Turkish markets will be closed from midday on Monday for the rest of the week for the Muslim Eid al-Adha festival. European stock markets are down \u00e2\u20ac\u201c UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index down 0.4% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax down 0.7% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC down 0.5% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB down 0.9% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex down 0.3% On Wall Street, the Dow Jones and Nasdaq are flat. We are closing the blog for today. Have a great weekend. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. Even so, Schmieding reckons that the impact on the eurozone will be very limited. He says: Exports: The eurozone earns 0.57% of its GDP by selling goods to Turkey. Even a 20% fall in exports to Turkey would not subtract more than 0.1ppt from annual Eurozone GDP growth. As global demand remains healthy, eurozone firms could likely contain the damage further by switching to other markets for some of these affected goods with only modest reductions in their selling prices. Financial linkages: Spain, France and Italy are the most exposed eurozone countries to Turkey. According to BIS data, the exposure to Turkey of banks domiciled in these countries stands at $81bn for Spain, $35bn for France and $18bn for Italy. A major part of this consists of equity stakes in Turkish banks rather than in more dangerous intra-company loans or direct credit exposure. Turkish losses may well affect individual institutions in the Eurozone visibly. Still, eurozone banks are in much better shape than they were during the 2011-2012 euro crisis which had come right in the wake of the 2008/2009 mega-recession. The risk that the exposure of some banks to Turkey could turn into a systemic problem for the eurozone and/or cause a tightening of credit conditions in Spain, Italy or France remains remote. Confidence effect: The real risk stems from the level of noise. Confidence and hence the readiness to spend and invest often drives the business cycle. As confidence is currently fickle with no established trend, even small but highly visible problems can nourish the feeling that the world is a dangerous place rather than full of exciting opportunities. We therefore see a clear risk that any noisy crisis - such as the Turkish turmoil - could take some toll on the Eurozone and retard the upturn in markets and business sentiment for a while. Holger Schmieding, economist at Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Berenberg, says the bank has lowered its year-end forecasts for the euro to $1.17 from $1.21, due to the Turkey crisis. Turkey is no small fry. It contributes 1% to global GDP. Beyond the obvious geopolitical concerns, a major Turkish recession would pose a significant challenge for financial markets and for other economies. Remembering the tremors which Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s smaller neighbour Greece once sent through European and global markets, investors are understandably nervous. Adding to concerns about Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget and Brexit uncertainty, the noise from Turkey could delay the rebound in eurozone business confidence and growth for a few more months despite the easing of US-EU trade tensions. Over in the US, Donald Trump has revealed that he has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to look into whether American companies should report earnings on a half-year, rather than a quarterly basis. The Turkish lira is still down 5.4% on the day, with one dollar buying 6.14 lira. The Turkish stock market has turned positive, however, gaining 0.6%. Other emerging markets currencies are also under pressure, with the Mexian peso down 0.7% and the South African rand losing 0.9%. European stock markets have turned negative, after a Turkish court rejected the US pastor Andrew Brunson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeal for release. UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index down 0.46% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax down 0.58% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC down 0.28% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB down 1.2% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex down 0.4% Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, has tweeted: He wrote earlier this morning: A $15bn rescue package from Qatar, and a limited package of exchange controls in limiting banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to take out short positions has bought the Turkish lira some brief respite in the last few days, but let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not kid ourselves here, unless president Erdogan takes steps to restore confidence in his stewardship of the Turkish economy then we could well see the lira come under further pressure. The US doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear in any mood to relieve the pressure on the Turkish government in securing the release of their pastor, if recent comments from vice President Mike Pence, and Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin are any guide. President Erdogan may be able to defray some of the risks to the Turkish economy by trying to improving his ties with Germany and Russia, but if the US really wanted to turn the screws it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely that these countries would be able to do much about it. One currency trader told Reuters that the weakness of the lira was driven by the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new US sanctions threat and the S&amp;P decision, with position-closing in markets ahead of the public holiday\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is expected to downgrade Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign credit rating after markets close today. Next week, the Turkish markets will be closed for Eid al-Adha, the Festival of Sacrifice, from Tuesday until Friday. The Turkish stock market has slid 1.3% today. William Jackson of Capital Economics said: There has been no sign that the central bank will be allowed to raise interest rates significantly and return rates to positive territory. Similarly, there has been no improvement in relations with the US, and additional sanctions may be on the horizon. The Turkish lira is under pressure again, falling nearly 7% against the dollar at one stage to 6.24. It is now trading at 6.04, down 4% on the day. The currency has lost almost 40% against the dollar this year, hit by a diplomatic row with the US and and investor concerns about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial policies and its foreign-currency debts. The independence of the Turkish central bank and its finance minister have been called into question. The central bank is refusing to raise interest rates to curb inflation, with Turkish president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an opposed to rate hikes. The appointment of his son-in-law Berat Albayrak as finance and treasury minister last month also alarmed investors, although Albayrak managed to calm nerves yesterday when he addressed thousands of investors and analysts on a conference call. After nearly nine years of financial crises and austerity, Greece is about to come out of its third bailout programme \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on Monday, at midnight. Greece borrowed more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac288bn from international creditors in the biggest bailout in history. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, said earlier this week that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes would not affect Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the bailout. He said: A clean exit is based on the following: the Eurogroup agreement on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt management, and the cash buffer the government has created which guarantees that the public sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s funding needs will be met in the next two or three years. Therefore, the Greek government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans are not affected by short-term turmoil in the markets. On 21 August, Greece is turning the page, and this is final. You can read more here. According to the Deutsche Bank economist Oliver Harvey, the UK, Germany and the US have lent the most to Turkey, says Ed Conway, economics editor at the Times. We are trying to get hold of the note... Turkish president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration has been adamant that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. Qatar pledged about $15bn in loans on Wednesday but provided few details. Turkey and its companies face repayments of nearly $3.8bn on foreign currency bonds in October, according to Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency woes has sparked worries about Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s external debts and the ability of its firms and banks to repay them. For companies, the cost of servicing their foreign borrowings has risen by a quarter in the past two months, due to the sharp fall in the lira. Jason Daw at Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale said: Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s external financing requirements are large (IMF estimates around $250bn per year). It has the highest foreign-exchange-denominated debt in emerging markets and short-term external debt of $180bn and total external debt of $460bn. According to his calculations, Turkish firms have $1.8bn of foreign-currency denominated bonds maturing by the end of the year while $1.25bn of government bonds also come due. There is $2.3bn in interest payments. The worst month for repayments is October, when $3bn in principal and $762m in interest are due. Daw said: Principal and interest payments should be close watched to year-end \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is 25% more costly for the corporate sector to repay their obligations compared to June given FX depreciation. How will Turkey roll over existing debt? Refinancing via the bond market could be challenging. An IMF support would be the logical place to seek financing. It is unlikely that Turkey would request, or be granted a package given current diplomatic tensions, Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rhetoric, and the restrictive fiscal and monetary policy conditions policymakers would need to abide by. Chinese banks have been lending to infrastructure projects and local banks in the last six months and this could increase. Inflation in the eurozone has been confirmed at 2.1% in July \u00e2\u20ac\u201c above the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of 2%. The annual rate rose from 2% in June, pushed up by higher energy costs, according to the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics office Eurostat. This means the ECB can push ahead with plans to end its bond purchasing programme by the end of the year, and possibly raise interest rates next year. Inflation was highest in Estonia (3.3%), Latvia and Belgium (both 2.7%), while Greece and Ireland posted the slowest inflation rates, of 0.8% and 1% respectively. Once all 28 EU countries are included, Romania had the highest inflation rate, of 4.3%. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, the parent of Pimco where he served as chief executive, and the former chairman of Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Global Development Council, writes: Can Turkey rewrite the rulebook for crises in emerging markets? By rejecting the conventional approach, Erdo\u00c4\u0178an risks greater trouble \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and not just for Turkey. Whether by accident or design, Turkey is trying to rewrite the chapter on crisis management in the emerging-market playbook. Rather than opting for interest-rate hikes and an external funding anchor to support domestic policy adjustments, the government has adopted a mix of less direct and more partial measures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this at a time when Turkey is in the midst of an escalating tariff tit-for-tat with the US, as well as operating in a more fluid global economy. How all this plays out is important not only for Turkey, but also for other emerging economies that already have had to cope with waves of financial contagion. The initial phases of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crisis were a replay of past emerging-market currency crises. A mix of domestic and external events \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an over-stretched credit-led growth strategy; concerns about the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy autonomy and effectiveness; and a less hospitable global liquidity environment, owing in part to rising US interest rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c destabilised the foreign-exchange market. You can read the full article here. The euro is rising for a second day, heading towards $1.14, after coming under pressure on concerns over the exposure of major European banks to Turkey, after the lira went into meltdown. There is a sense of relief in financial markets today, following the news that Beijing will resume trade talks with Washington next week, although at a lower level than previously. It is the first round of trade talks since June and offers some hope to those worried about the impact of the tit-for-tat trade war on the world economy. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, said: Although the chances of a breakthrough deal from lower-level talks are seen as unlikely, the meeting could be a positive step towards easing trade tensions between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. The Turkish lira has staged a remarkable recovery since Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meltdown when it hit a record low below 7.23 to the dollar. The currency is currently trading at 5.79, up 0.4% on the day. While the Turkish authorities have been criticised for adopting half-measures, the lira was thrown a lifeline on Wednesday when Qatar pledged to shore up Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shaky finances with loans worth $15bn. Yesterday, finance minister Albayrak managed to calm nerves during a conference call with thousands of investors, although this was later marred by news from Washington that Turkey faces more sanctions if the US paster Andrew Brunson is not freed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty quiet on the corporate front as well. Royal Bank of Scotland has announced that its deputy chief financial officer Katie Murray will stand in as interim finance chief after Ewen Stevenson leaves on 30 September to go to HSBC on a \u00c2\u00a310.6m deal. A search for a successor for Stevenson is under way, RBS said. The FTSE 100 index in London has opened flat, trading down 2.5 points at 7553.84. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is also flat, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC is up 0.1%, Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex has gained 0.2% and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB has slipped 0.1%. Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING, expects the lira to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tread water\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with US-Turkey relations on a knife-edge as the White House said it may increase sanctions. Next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market holiday should offer some respite \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Istanbul stock exchange will be closed from Tuesday until Friday for Eid al-Adha. Patel adds: All the noise from Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister Albayrak appeared to be on the right lines in terms of reassuring global investors that Ankara remains credibly committed to addressing the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation problem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and in the status quo free-market spirit. In effect, Turkish policymakers have bought themselves a bit of time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least until early September, when markets will be expecting to see some sort of joint fiscal and monetary tightening in the Medium-Term Economic Plan. While we did see Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign CDS rally following the finance minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investor call, the lira failed to push on much further beyond 5.75 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as markets had largely priced in a conciliatory outcome. S&amp;P are due to downgrade Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign credit rating today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but again this is in the price of the currency. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The Turkish lira has become volatile again at the end of a tumultuous week, after the United States warned of more sanctions against Turkey. The embattled currency weakened in early London trading, with one dollar buying 5.86 lira, but has just recovered to 5.8, up 0.26%. On Monday the lira hit a record low of 7.2, dragging down other emerging markets currencies. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister sparked a recovery in the lira yesterday after he addressed thousands of international investors on a conference call. Berat Albayrak, the son-in-law of president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an, pledged to protect beleaguered local banks and cut public spending to prevent the country defaulting on its loans. But a few hours later US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin assured president Donald Trump at a cabinet meeting that sanctions were ready to be put in place if US pastor Andrew Brunson, who is on house arrest in Turkey over terrorism charges, is not released. Trump later tweeted that the US \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will pay nothing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the release \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but we are cutting back on Turkey!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is expected to downgrade Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign credit rating later today. Asian stock markets rose overnight, heartened by news that Beijing and Washington agreed to hold their first trade talks since June next week. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei advanced 0.35% while Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng the Australian stock market both rose 0.2%, although the Shanghai stock exchange lost 1.3%. The MSCI index of world stocks rose 0.6% yesterday, its biggest gain in a month. European shares are expected to be pretty flat when they open at 8am BST.

A report by investment bank Morgan Stanley last year argued that the \u00c2\u00a310bn supplied by the government for the scheme simply went into higher house prices.</p> <p>Last year the chancellor announced an extension of help to buy until 2021.

That has been driven by the low-interest-rate environment and, very significantly, help to buy. The numbers suggest there has been a moderation in that trend and it looks like things are going to be more difficult for the sector.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Persimmon has also benefited from its nationwide spread and lack of projects in central London, where prices are falling and the market is moribund. Markets such as Scotland, the north-west of England and the Midlands are still quite lively. Persimmon is a well-run company that has accelerated its construction programme and builds lots of homes for housing associations. It achieved its profit growth after 2012 without the easy option of building in London, which was at the centre of the boom. But the company has been supported by help to buy: almost half the 16,043 homes Persimmon sold last year had a help-to-buy mortgage. A report by investment bank Morgan Stanley last year argued that the \u00c2\u00a310bn supplied by the government for the scheme simply went into higher house prices. Last year the chancellor announced an extension of help to buy until 2021. As that date draws nearer, investors may start to fret about how housebuilders will fare without it. That is unless \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like low interest rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c help to buy becomes a fixture of the post-crisis economy. There was uproar about high pay last week, including calls for the government to take action. But, like the withdrawal of help to buy, if it ever happens Fairburn will already have the money in the bank.",

Unemployment is still about 20%, and youth unemployment is more than double that. Despite undertaking the biggest post-crisis fiscal adjustment of any euro zone country, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public debt is equal to about 180% of GDP. ESM fiscal and structural reform policies, to which Greece will remain subject after the third economic adjustment programme expires, are unlikely to generate sufficient economic growth to mitigate the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt burden or reduce popular disaffection. Grexit is not a short-term risk, but Greece will struggle to improve competitiveness inside the euro area or grow its way out of its huge debt burden (179.1% of GDP in 2017), so it will remain a significant risk over the medium and long term.</p> <p>The past eight years of bailouts have exacted a high cost in per capita GDP, employment, wages, pensions, living standards, life satisfaction and social and political cohesion. Greece has lowest life satisfaction rating of any OECD country. Divisions of income, equality, class and politics have sharpened. Greek sovereignty and democracy undermined as the country became subject to external tutelage. There is no popular enthusiasm for any party: popular cynicism and disaffection reign.</p> <p>Greece has been benefiting from cyclical upswing in the euro zone in 2017-18; and tourism and merchandise exports have also performing well. These factors will remain important, and point to stronger real GDP growth of around 2% this year, after 1.3% growth in 2017. However, Greece faces formidable medium- and long-term challenges, including a very poor demographic outlook; a dysfunctional labour market and a huge emigration of Greeks during the past decade; still weak public finances; poor banking asset quality; closed professions; bad regulation; and an unsustainable public debt load. These structural weakness, together with a commitment to deliver annual primary budget surplus targets of 3.5% of GDP in 2018-22 and of 2% of GDP in 2023- 2060 will shackle growth.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b7a9472e4b0f6601fba18c3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-20T10:27:15.829Z\">11.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek reforms laid groundwork for sustainable recovery - Moscovici</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The austerity measures undertaken by Greece will lead to a sustainable recovery, says European economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici.</p> <p>Speaking as the country exits its bailout programme, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The extensive reforms Greece has carried out have laid the ground for a sustainable recovery: this must be nurtured and maintained to enable the Greek people to reap the benefits of their efforts and sacrifices.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said the Greek economy is expected to grow by around 2% after 1.4% growth last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LiveSquawk/status/1031481875032944640\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">EU&#39;s Moscovici Says Greece Must Ensure Continued Implementation Of Reforms<br>EU&#39;s Moscovici Says Greek Economic Growth Expected To Remain Around 2Pct In 2018, 2019</p>&mdash; LiveSquawk (@LiveSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LiveSquawk/status/1031481875032944640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 20, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b7a9576e4b00f6a2ff7f86b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-20T10:19:23.314Z\">11.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with Greece, and here is a link to the European summary of the main statistics:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/A_Breidthardt/status/1031483068421431296\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The conclusion of Greece&#39;s stability support programme opens the door to a new chapter for Greece.

                "bodyText":"Greece has turned the page to become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd member of the single currency, European Union authorities in Brussels declared as the country finally exited its eight-year bailout programm, writes Jennifer Rankin. Its three bailouts during the eurozone crisis totalled \u00e2\u201a\u00ac288.7bn (\u00c2\u00a3258bn) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest-ever financial rescue. During that time, as the crisis that threatened to lead to the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ejection from the single currency \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Greece has had four governments and endured one of the worst recessions in economic history. Marking the official end of the third bailout programme on Monday, Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, said Greece was beginning a new chapter after eight \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very difficult\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have had eight very difficult years, often very painful years, where we have had three successive programmes. But now Greece can finally turn the page in a crisis that has lasted too long,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told journalists. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The worst is over.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Our full report is here: On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The Turkish lira continues to come under pressure, now down 1.66%. Kathleen Brooks, research director at Capital Index, says: Germany may say no now, but it is becoming increasingly likely that Turkey will need significant amounts of financial aid in the months to come. Qatar has come in with a credit line to backstop the economy, and has promised $15bn of investment in Turkey. However, this has not been able to stabilise the lira at the start of the week, which has suffered another rout today. The problem for investors is two-fold: firstly, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and S&amp;P, the credit rating agencies, cut Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt to junk status at the end of last week, which limits the amount of sovereign debt larger investors like pension funds can purchase, it could also make a bailout by the likes of Germany less likely. Secondly, the spat between the US and Turkey continues to gain pace. As the US threatens more tariffs, shots were fired this morning at the US embassy in Ankora. Until Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government frees pastor Andrew Bunson, it is hard to see the Trump administration cutting Turkey some slack. Regardless of your view on the rights or wrongs of what the US is doing to Turkey financially, with Trump as President, it certainly doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay to mess with the US, especially when you upset the evangelical wing of the US this close to the mid-terms. Meanwhile in Athens it has not gone unnoticed that Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has chosen to remain silent about Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much-awaited bailout exit, writes Helena Smith from Athens. His only public utterance today has been to tweet his congratulations to the county\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s youth water polo team on its world championship victory. Has this got something to do, perhaps, with the fact that his leftist-led government has signed up to a staggering array of ambitious targets? Post\u00e2\u20ac\u201cbailout Greece has committed to produce primary surpluses of 3.5 % of GDP until 2022 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a feat achieved by only a handful of countries since the seventies - and 2.2 % until 2060. For professor Kevin Featherstone who has followed the twists and turns of the crisis as head of the Hellenic Observatory at the London School of Economics, such obligations amount to perpetual purgatory. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No other government in Europe would choose to follow this path. It is Ordoliberalism gone wild,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told the Guardian. With the fiscal straightjacket remaining so tight, there will be little scope for future administrations to improve economic competitiveness through investment, or accelerate social support for those pauperised by austerity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rehabilitation falls well short,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Professor Featherstone said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The prospect of a recurrence of the debt crisis has been eliminated but nothing has been done to help Greek society overcome the trauma of excessively high unemployment and bankruptcies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tsipras had hoped to mark the exit with a visit to Kastelorizo, the remote Aegean isle where the drama began. Celebrating Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcliberation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the place where former Prime Minister George Papandreou had in April 2010 first announced that Athens would seek help from the EU and IMF \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after surging Greek bond yields made borrowing on capital markets prohibitive - seemed appropriate to coming full-circle. But the outcry over his government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s handling of last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wildfires \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a calamity that has left 94 dead and brought devastation and ruination to hundreds more \u00e2\u20ac\u201c put paid to the idea. Fanfare, aides say, will be kept to a minimum. The chief economist of the ESM rescue fund has admitted there were mistakes made with Greece. In an interview with CNBC Rolf Strauch said: This was a severe crisis situation and obviously it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to claim that everything went well in the sense that everything was completely right at the time. I think the overall direction of the programme was right and what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing now, are particularly the consequences of those many reforms that were taken, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that also the Greek people deserve a lot of respect for what they did over the years. Reforms have the feature that it takes a bit until you see the impact and so the benefits of the reforms weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t occurring right at the start or right from the moment when they were taken, but they are coming in now and I think this process will continue. You should see the projected growth rates, they are about 2%. This is good news, the task is now to stay on course and reap the benefits of what was done in the past. He also says that the efforts Greece has to make are not yet over: Obviously, it takes a lot to restructure an economy, and therefore [Greece has agreed] the steps to be taken by the Greek authorities in the coming years and they have made some commitments on that. The head of the European Stability Mechanism, the euro zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout fund, has wasted no time stressing the point that the debt-Stricken country will be subject to a strict regime of enhanced surveillance post-bailout, reports Helena Smith from Athens: Speaking to the Greek daily Ethnos this morning Klaus Regling, the rescue fund chief, emphasized that Athens will be strictly monitored in the coming years so there is no let up in reform implementation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece is exceptional. It has received much more loans from us than any other country,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told the paper, saying that Athens unlike any other member state had also benefited from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 huge amounts of debt relief.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No other programme country has received anything comparable. Therefore, the monitoring will be tighter than in the other cases and this will take the form of the so-called enhanced surveillance.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meanwhile the Greek government spokesman was hailing the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new phase\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the country was about to enter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Citizens will soon feel the difference,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dimitris TzAnnakopoulos told a radio station earlier today. He said prime minister Alexis Tsipras would soon be announcing handouts when he gave his annual economic address at the Thessaloniki trade fair next month and elaborated how the budget surplus would be handled. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an earlier piece looking at the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future following the bailout exit: And Greece will also continue to be monitored: On the other hand, Greece still faces serious challenges, according to Joan Hoey, director for Europe at The Economist Intelligence Unit: There has been lots of pain, but to what gain, and to what purpose has the Greek government signed up to multi-decade, large primary budget surplus targets which are likely to hobble growth? The economy has been in almost permanent recession since 2010, and real GDP has shrunk by more than a quarter from its pre-crisis peak in 2007-08. Unemployment is still about 20%, and youth unemployment is more than double that. Despite undertaking the biggest post-crisis fiscal adjustment of any euro zone country, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public debt is equal to about 180% of GDP. ESM fiscal and structural reform policies, to which Greece will remain subject after the third economic adjustment programme expires, are unlikely to generate sufficient economic growth to mitigate the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt burden or reduce popular disaffection. Grexit is not a short-term risk, but Greece will struggle to improve competitiveness inside the euro area or grow its way out of its huge debt burden (179.1% of GDP in 2017), so it will remain a significant risk over the medium and long term. The past eight years of bailouts have exacted a high cost in per capita GDP, employment, wages, pensions, living standards, life satisfaction and social and political cohesion. Greece has lowest life satisfaction rating of any OECD country. Divisions of income, equality, class and politics have sharpened. Greek sovereignty and democracy undermined as the country became subject to external tutelage. There is no popular enthusiasm for any party: popular cynicism and disaffection reign. Greece has been benefiting from cyclical upswing in the euro zone in 2017-18; and tourism and merchandise exports have also performing well. These factors will remain important, and point to stronger real GDP growth of around 2% this year, after 1.3% growth in 2017. However, Greece faces formidable medium- and long-term challenges, including a very poor demographic outlook; a dysfunctional labour market and a huge emigration of Greeks during the past decade; still weak public finances; poor banking asset quality; closed professions; bad regulation; and an unsustainable public debt load. These structural weakness, together with a commitment to deliver annual primary budget surplus targets of 3.5% of GDP in 2018-22 and of 2% of GDP in 2023- 2060 will shackle growth. The austerity measures undertaken by Greece will lead to a sustainable recovery, says European economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici. Speaking as the country exits its bailout programme, he said: The extensive reforms Greece has carried out have laid the ground for a sustainable recovery: this must be nurtured and maintained to enable the Greek people to reap the benefits of their efforts and sacrifices. He said the Greek economy is expected to grow by around 2% after 1.4% growth last year. Back with Greece, and here is a link to the European summary of the main statistics: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the tensions between Turkey and the US: President Tayyip Erdogan has been speaking again about the crisis which has laid low Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency and prompted a market sell-off. Reuters reports: [Erdogan] said on Monday an attack on Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy was no different from a strike against its flag or the Islamic call to prayer, responding to a recent currency sell-off in stark religious and nationalist terms ahead of a major Muslim holiday. In a pre-recorded address to mark the four-day Eid al-Adha festival, which starts on Tuesday, a defiant Erdogan said the aim of the currency crisis was to bring \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Turkey and its people to their knees\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The lira has tumbled some 40 percent this year, hit by worries about Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s influence over monetary policy and a worsening diplomatic rift with the United States. The sell-off has spread to other emerging market currencies and global stocks in recent weeks. Amid the tension, several gunshots were fired on Monday from a vehicle at the U.S. Embassy in the Turkish capital. Nobody was hurt. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The attack on our economy has absolutely no difference from attacks on our call to prayer and our flag. The goal is the same. The goal is to bring Turkey and the Turkish people to their knees - to take it prisoner,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Erdogan said in the televised address. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those who think they can make Turkey give in with the exchange rate will soon see that they are mistaken.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Erdogan stopped short of directly naming any countries or institutions, but he has, in the past, blamed a shadowy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153interest rate lobby\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Western ratings agencies and financiers. The lira is currently down around 1.5% against the dollar. Meanwhile a German government spokesman has said that it is up to Turkey to decide whether it wants to ask the International Monetary Fund for help. Markets are continuing to head higher, as investors shrug off the continuing concerns about Turkey and concentrate on the prospects for US-China trade talks. The FTSE 100 is up 0.55%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has added 0.93% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.63%. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: The fears of last week seem to have been washed away with a renewed optimism over the direction of US-China trade. Markets often find it difficult to focus on one topic, and thus with the focus now shifting away from Turkey and towards China, it comes as no surprise that the pessimism of last week is fading into obscurity. Wednesday will see a trade delegation from China kick off a two-day meeting with their US counterparts, and as long as there is hope for some form of breakthrough, markets are likely to be in a more optimistic mood. However, this optimism is likely to be ill-founded, for all the previous meetings have shown precious few signs of anything that looks like a breakthrough. As Greece exits its bailout, new government figures show a drop in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account surplus compared to a year ago, but a rise in tourist revenues. Reuters reports: Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account balance showed a smaller surplus in June compared to the same month a year earlier on the back of a wider trade deficit, the Bank of Greece said on Monday. Central bank data showed the surplus fell to 210 million euros ($240.18 million) from a surplus of 737 million euros in June 2017. Tourism revenues increased to 2.33 billion euros from 2.007 billion in the same month a year earlier. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In June the current account ... (was) down by 527 million euros year-on-year, as a result of a deterioration principally in the balance of goods and to a lesser extent in the primary income account,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Bank of Greece said. It said the trade gap rose by 535 million euros as imports outstripped exports, mainly the result of a worsening in the oil balance. In January to June, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account showed a deficit of 3.8 billion euros, up by 555 million euros year-on-year as the trade deficit widened and the primary income account surplus shrank. In 2017 as a whole, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit reached 1.5 billion euros, down by 418 million year-on-year. And another reality check: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more on the forthcoming press conference on Greece: Back in the UK, and luxury handbag marker Mulberry has seen its shares slump 26% after it warned it would take a \u00c2\u00a33m hit from House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration. Our full report is here: And G4S is down 1% after the UK ministry of justice took over HMP Birmingham from the company after drink, drugs and violence among prisoners: Over in Turkey and the lira has edged lower again, down 1.4% at 6.09 against the dollar. But this is a far cry from its all time worst level against the US currency of 7.24 which it hit at the start of last week as economic crisis unfolded. But the strain between Turkey and the US over the detention of a US pastor can be seen by the firing of gun shots at the American embassy in Ankara earlier this morning. Jamie McGeever at Reuters has a few sobering facts as Greece \u00e2\u20ac\u0153returns to normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: Markets in Europe are marginally better as traders return to their desks after the weekend break. The FTSE 100 is up 0.33%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.32% and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 0.34% better. Earlier Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s produce price index rose by 3% year on year in July, the same level as the previous month and in line with expectations. Today Greece returns to normal, according to Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister and head of the eurogroup: Giorgos Papakonstantinou, who was finance minister when Greece signed up to the bailout, said he would do the same again if the country was in the same position. He told the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wake up to Money programme: The choice we had at that point was either to allow the country to go bankrupt by not paying our debts... at which point we would not have been able to pay salaries and pensions and provide basic public services. Or to sign a bailout which would give us time to reduce those deficits. But he admitted there had been tremendous pain and suffering along the way as austerity measures hit hard. And Zsolt Darvas of the Bruegel think tank said Greece could still face further problems. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme, he said: Unfortunately I give a high probability that Greece will enter a new crisis three to five years from now, partly because Greece still has a very high level of debt and it has to repay a lot in the near term. If Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth slows down long-term, then markets might become very nervous and Greece will enter a new crisis. European markets are expected to make a mixed start to the week: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a momentous day for Greece and its government led by prime minister Alexis Tsipras. After eight years and innumerable late night eurozone crisis meetings, the country is exiting its bailout programme. The so-called troika of creditors - the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund loaned Greece a total of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac289bn in three tranches in 2010, 2012 and 2015. The country is now free to borrow money on the capital markets, something it has not been able to do while the bailout programme was underway. But it has suffered under tough austerity measures demanded by its creditors, and everyone involved understands there is still a long way to go. Here is our report on the news: Later this morning Pierre Moscovici, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic affairs commissioner, is expected to hail Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the bailout. But our economics editor Larry Elliott says the programme has been a failure: It is a tale of incompetence, of dogma, of needless delay and of the interests of banks being put before the needs of people. And there will be long-term consequences. When Greece first received help in 2010, the plan was for it to have access to the financial markets within two years. It has taken two further rescue packages and six years for that to happen. His full analysis is here: Elsewhere Turkey is likely to remain in focus after the recent collapse of the lira and concerns that its economic problems will spread elsewhere.

However, Rebecca Long Bailey MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow business secretary, argued that small suppliers could thrive if the energy landscape was fundamentally reformed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The case for market reform as well as revolutionising energy generation and transmission as Labour has pledged is stronger than ever,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said.

One of the arguments in favour of publicly owned energy firms is, in the longer term, they could offer a new source of revenue for cash-strapped local authorities. However austerity could put such money-raising efforts at risk. Some fear the advent of big local authorities such as Northamptonshire paring back services to a legal minimum to meet budgets could spook consumers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It might well be in back of people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minds, about signing up to a local authority [energy company] in a time of cuts. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIf they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re cutting back on X, Y and Z, how sustainable is that authority?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 We are trying to be sustainable,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Battlemuch, who is also a Labour councillor at Nottingham city council.

The strength and length of this bull market has its origins in the severity of the downturn a decade ago. The related decline in US corporate profits in 2008/09 was the largest proportionate fall on record, larger even than that seen in the Great Depression. However, the cause of this dramatic fall in earnings was also the seed of their dramatic bounce. Write downs of financial assets at banks, insurers and some large manufacturers with substantial financing departments trounced corporate earnings as they travelled from balance sheet through the profit and loss statement. However, such write downs were only ever going to have a transitory effect, once the write downs stopped, the weight was lifted and earnings flew.</p> <p>Essentially the record-breaking nature of the recession experienced by the US and world economy between 2008 and 2009 perhaps always suggested that the recovery from those depths would be similarly record breaking in nature. The fact that private sector scar tissue and a suitably chastened banking sector are only just starting to more visibly recover is among the factors suggesting that there is scope for this recovery to go further yet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the wild cyclical hubris that tends to precede the worst recessions is so far substantially absent.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b7d562ce4b05a8f21bb3c5f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-22T12:25:28.311Z\">1.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here are the opening calls for Wall Street:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/1032237253416894464\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">US Opening Calls:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DOW?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DOW</a>  25787  -0.14%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SPX</a>  2856  -0.21%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NASDAQ?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NASDAQ</a>  7384  -0.17%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IGOpeningCall?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#IGOpeningCall</a></p>&mdash; IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/1032237253416894464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 22, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b7d5500e4b0d3dac03497ae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-22T12:22:44.016Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The record on the S&amp;P 500 on Tuesday was not mimicked by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is still below its high point:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/alaidi/status/1032240363350765568\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SPX</a> high is an intraday high not a closing high, while DOW still 1000 pts below its record.

                "bodyText":"Here is our story on the record breaking bull market run in the US: On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. With dollar weakness continuing, even the pound is benefiting. Sterling is now up 0.2% at $1.2925 after its earlier dip. The depth of the financial crisis is one reason why the recovery has been record breaking for markets, suggests Will Hobbs, Head of Investment Strategy at Barclays Smart Investor: Liquidity and sentiment are overestimated factors in this Bull Run. The strength and length of this bull market has its origins in the severity of the downturn a decade ago. The related decline in US corporate profits in 2008/09 was the largest proportionate fall on record, larger even than that seen in the Great Depression. However, the cause of this dramatic fall in earnings was also the seed of their dramatic bounce. Write downs of financial assets at banks, insurers and some large manufacturers with substantial financing departments trounced corporate earnings as they travelled from balance sheet through the profit and loss statement. However, such write downs were only ever going to have a transitory effect, once the write downs stopped, the weight was lifted and earnings flew. Essentially the record-breaking nature of the recession experienced by the US and world economy between 2008 and 2009 perhaps always suggested that the recovery from those depths would be similarly record breaking in nature. The fact that private sector scar tissue and a suitably chastened banking sector are only just starting to more visibly recover is among the factors suggesting that there is scope for this recovery to go further yet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the wild cyclical hubris that tends to precede the worst recessions is so far substantially absent. And here are the opening calls for Wall Street: The record on the S&amp;P 500 on Tuesday was not mimicked by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is still below its high point: Meanwhile the dollar is slipping back, with the dollar index down 0.3% to its lowest since the start of the month. Wall Street is expected to open slightly lower, with the Dow Jones futures suggesting a 25 point dip and the S&amp;P 500 down 4 points. Even so, European markets are managing to hold onto their - slight - gains, with the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index up 0.38%. Artjom Hatsaturjants, Research Analyst at Accendo Markets, said: The FTSE100 is refreshingly bullish, building on the positive example set by Wall St [overnight], with considerable support from FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heavyweight energy sector after last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpectedly large build in API Oil Inventories. Lower sterling, weakened by disappointment over lack of Brexit progress, is helping many international stocks, but note that defensive shares are at the forefront of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive run, hinting at a still tentative market attitude. News of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential troubles with the law over the Michael Cohen affair are so far having a rather limited impact on London shares. European markets have managed to struggle into positive territory, but the moves are not exactly convincing. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says: With the pound reversing some of its recent growth the FTSE was able to crawl out of the red on Wednesday. The return of Brexit concerns to the forefront of investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c inspired by Michel Barnier warning that the UK and EU were unlikely to reach the October deadline set by the European Council \u00e2\u20ac\u201c undermined sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent gains. Against the dollar, which still isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back to its best, the pound slipped 0.2%, sending cable to $1.288, while against the euro sterling fell as much as 0.4%, leaving it at its worst price in almost a fortnight. This, alongside a return to growth from the majority of its oil and mining stocks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Antofagasta was the only real notable exception \u00e2\u20ac\u201c allowed the FTSE to join its Eurozone peers on the green side of the board. The UK index rose 0.3%, and is once again teasing 7600, while the DAX nudged 0.1% higher and the CAC jumped 0.2%. Oil is heading higher after a drop in US inventories, as well as on the prospect of the renewed US sanctions on Iran curtailing supplies from the third largest producer in Opec. Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall in US stocks of 5.2m barrels announced by the American Petroleum Institute after the market closed on Tuesday was more than three times the decline expected by analysts. The weakness of the dollar is also helping support the oil price, with Brent crude up 1.5% at $73.74 a barrel. The latest problems for Donald Trump will be cheered or jeered depending on your point of view, but markets seem unsettled by a threat to the US president. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, explains: Michael Cohen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s implication of Donald Trump in criminal activity may not put the president behind bars, but it has certainly riled markets, with traders shifting out of the dollar and stocks....While Trump is one of the most divisive presidents in history, markets have certainly taken to his economic expansionary policies and any threat to his second term will likely hit markets. With US mid-terms coming up in November, the continued scandal surrounding Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency will dent confidence even though a Republican win is near-enough nailed on due to gerrymandering. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a particularly busy day for company news, but two businesses at least will be wishing they were not in the headlines. There is yet another problem for Ryanair, which has been sending out compensation cheques with no signatures. Unsurprisingly, these have bounced. And Superdrug is the latest business to be targeted by hackers: European markets are drifting rather aimlessly at the moment, lost in a summer lull despite Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new records, the US-China trade talks and the political developments in the US. The FTSE 100 is virtually flat, down just 0.07%, while both Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac have edged into positive territory. Meanwhile the dollar, which was hit on Tuesday by Donald Trump slamming the Federal Reserve for its policy of raising interest rates, seems to be steadying. So the pound is down 0.18% at $1.2875 while the euro has dipped 0.1% to $1.1563 after earlier hitting two week highs. The expected dip in US markets looks like the right reaction to the latest Trump travails, says Paul Donovan at UBS: US President Trump faces either double trouble (Cohen and Manafort) or a witch hunt, depending on your perspective. Does this matter for markets? It might matter if the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political capital with Congress was undermined, affecting policy. However, the president does not have that much political capital with Congress, and is not asking Congress to pass laws they do not want to pass. It might matter if markets think the politics will change the midterm election results (or the risks around those results), and thus policy. However, Republicans may successfully try to separate themselves from Trump. Trump supporters may be motivated to turn out and vote. This impact on midterms is not certain. It might matter if trade policy is used to distract attention from the domestic politics. The US president has considerable authority over trade, and taxing US consumers via trade tariffs can be made to serve the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Make America Great Again\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd slogan. Overall, the muted market reaction seems appropriate. US markets are set to open lower but this will not prevent the record bull market run. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: The divergence in US markets continued overnight with a marginal new record high for the S&amp;P 500, as well as new records for the Russell 2000 and the Dow Jones transportation index, before slipping back into the close, but still on course for the longest bull market run in history. This failure to push on higher, as buying momentum stalled, along with the news that President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance laws by arranging hush payments to two women Trump was alleged to have had affairs with, could well see investors look to take some profits today after a fairly mixed session in Asia and a lower open in Europe. Cohen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plea, which puts the President under the spotlight even more, and opens him up to charges of criminal conduct, has raised concerns that he might be vulnerable to impeachment in the coming months. While this is unlikely in the short term, any shift in the balance of power after the mid-terms in November, could increase that prospect if the Republicans lose their majorities. Meanwhile Trump may have played down the prospects of early progress in the US-China trade talks, but a spokesman from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign ministry said it hoped there would be a good outcome. Despite the record breaking run on Wall Street, European markets have opened lower as investors take note of the latest political developments in the US which could cause problems for president Trump. The FTSE 100 is currently down 0.24%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 0.23%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is off 0.08%, while Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is 0.33% lower. The previous record bull market for the US ran from October 1990 to March 2000 and encompassed the dotcom boom - and ended with that bubble bursting. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: The US market has now been on a rampant charge since March 2009 with only a few blips along the way. Many question whether this exceptional period for the US stock market is going to end in tears, though the very fact this issue is so widely raised suggests we are not in the throes of the irrational exuberance of the late 1990s.

Preliminary purchasing manager surveys for August show French business activity hitting a four month high, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector did well but manufacturing slipped back and the overall eurozone figure was disappointing. And the minutes from the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s July meeting showed it was concerned about protectionism and the escalation of trade disputes. The dollar edged higher for the first time in six trading sessions, helped by the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minutes suggesting more interest rate rises were on the way despite Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s displeasure at such a policy. Elsewhere UK retail sales grew more strongly than expected, thanks mainly to the heatwave boosting sales of food and drink for barbecues and outdoor parties. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The minutes suggest a rate rise in just over a year from now, in September 2019, says one ECB watcher: The threat of a global trade war and increased protectionism are the main risks for the eurozone economy, according to the minutes of July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of the European Central Bank. Otherwise, the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth was on track, the ECB believed which is why there was little disagreement on leaving its policy unchanged. It had already announced in June it would end its bond buying programme by the end of the year and keep interest rates steady at least until next summer. On trade tensions, the minutes said: Uncertainties related to global factors remained prominent, in particular with regard to the threat of protectionism and the risk of an escalation of trade tensions...These tensions could generate a more general decline in confidence throughout the global economy, beyond any direct effects from the imposition of tariffs. The dollar has rallied for the first time in six trading sessions, following the US Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minutes which suggested further rate rises this year despite Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s displeasure. News of the new round of trade tariffs from the US and China also helped the greenback, given its status as a haven in uncertainty. So the dollar added 0.07% against a basket of currencies, while the pound dipped 0.15% to $1.2890. Sterling is also being affected by continued Brexit uncertainties, as the UK government spells out some of the consequences of leaving the EU without a deal. The proposed merger between supermarket chains Sainsbury and Asda will be investigated by the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition and markets authority. The CMA said it will begin a detailed assessment into how any deal would affect competition for UK shoppers, and whether it would lead to less choice or higher prices. It will also investigate whether the deal would allow the merged company to squeeze suppliers. The companies have asked for a fast track inquiry, and the CMA will accept this unless there are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153valid objections.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With markets continuing to drift, Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Thursday continued to be more notable for what didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen than what did, with the FTSE avoiding the red despite a rocky set of mining stocks. The UK index spent the morning flat at 7580, the gains from the likes of BP and Shell \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Brent Crude shot up to $75 per barrel on Wednesday, though has pulled back below $74.50 this Thursday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c countering the losses seen from Rio Tinto, Anglo American et al. Helping the FTSE was a disappointing session for the pound. Having built up a head of steam against the dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c admittedly one that is pretty paltry in comparison to its recent losses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sterling saw its rebound nipped in the bud by a hawkish set of Fed meeting minutes on Wednesday night, with cable slipping 0.3% to fall beneath $1.287. And even though the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing and services PMIs weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great, the euro also managed to have the edge over the pound, the single currency climbing 0.2%. Turning to this afternoon, and with the US-China trade war heating up with the latest bout of tit-for-tat tariffing just as talks get back underway, the Dow Jones isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t looking like it fancies doing much when the bell rings on Wall Street. The futures have the Dow dipping 25 or so points when the US session gets underway, a move that keeps it below the 25750 mark it has struggled to really push beyond with any longevity in the last few days. The CBI says the hot weather in August kept people spending, but the outlook is not so positive. Anna Leach, CBI Head of Economic Intelligence, said: The summer heatwave has kept shoppers out on the high street, with consumers splurging on food and drink for barbecues and garden parties. That said, the outlook for retail remains challenging, with orders falling, prices rising, employment sliding, and investment drifting down. The long-term challenges facing the retail sector are significant and won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be resolved overnight. Subdued real wage growth and digital disruption continue to pile pressure on firms, while high street retailers continue to suffer under an out-dated business rates system. Signs of strength in the UK high street. The latest distributive trades survey from the CBI shows a positive balance of 29 in August, compared to an expected fall to +13 from +20 in July. But the expected employment index - a quarterly index - fell to -35 in August, the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2009 and down from a flat level in May. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliatory measures following the latest US tariff move are more aggressive than expected, says ING Bank economist Iris Pang: The $16bn revised tariff list from China includes medical equipment and automobiles when the US administration would like to help American automobiles fare better in the international market. We see this list as more punchy than the previous one even the amount involved stays the same at $16bn... The uncertainty now lies in how China would retaliate qualitatively and this the main concern for markets rather than today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs implementation. If the trade talks between China and the US do not yield positive results this week, the US is set to impose another 25% tariffs on $200bn of imported goods from China. The amount would be around half of the goods US imports from China, but China will only retaliate with tariffs on $60bn because the US doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t export as much. But China has repeatedly stated that it can retaliate qualitatively. Qualitative retaliations could include placing administrative measures on US companies operating in China or following the US lead and leveraging \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnational security\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to prevent some American companies operating in the country. Given that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnational security\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 examination has recently been added as a clause in foreigners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 investment policies in China, this seems like a possibility. US markets are expected to open fairly flat, as investors remain cautious in the wake of the trade tensions and President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubles. Most European markets are also virtually unmoved at the moment, but analysts are nervous about how long the hiatus will last. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Early hesitancy for European markets reflects the ongoing political instability in the US, alongside uncertainty as the US-China trade talks come to a head ... The ongoing fears over the snowballing political picture in the US ... remain a driver of risk aversion in the US, with European markets largely outperforming in recent days. Comments from Trump that he did not break election campaign rules are far from allaying market fears, and there is a growing fear that this crisis could drive substantial losses at the mid-term elections in November .... Today sees the US-China trade talks come to a head, with low market expectations likely to drive the response to any final announcement. There seems to be little headway being make over the months, and the inability of the Chinese to appease Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demands mean that this is likely to rumble on for some time yet. However, with the bar set so low, there is also the potential for some sort of half-hearted announcement which sets out an agreement to work towards specific targets, in a similar ilk to that seen with the EU. The trade tensions between the US and China are more likely to deteriorate this year and dampen global growth in 2019, according to Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. In its latest global outlook report, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s says there are early signs that global growth has peaked. It expects the G20 countries to grow by 3.3% in 2018 and 3.1% in 2019. The advanced economies will grow 2.3% in 2018 and 2.0% in 2019, while G20 emerging markets will remain the growth drivers, at 5.1% in both 2018 and 2019. But it added that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153further tariffs, similar in magnitude to the newly proposed 25% US tariffs on $200bn of imports from China and 25% US tariffs on all auto and auto part imports, represent a disruptive downside risk to our baseline forecasts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Madhavi Bokil, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vice-president and lead author of the report, said: Most of the impact of the trade restrictions on economic growth will be felt in 2019. The magnitude of the macro impacts will depend on market sentiment. Tightening of financial conditions through asset price and currency adjustment and a broader hit to business and consumer confidence are now more likely than a few months ago and have the potential to derail the global economy. Back with the trade wars, and here is our latest report on the new tariffs: The US and China have escalated their ongoing trade war by implementing 25% tariffs on $16bn worth of imports on both sides, bringing the amount levied to a combined $100bn (\u00c2\u00a378bn) since July. Beijing began implementing the new tariffs on Thursday, when the US said it would begin collecting extra duties in retaliation for what it claimed were unfair Chinese trade practices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China firmly opposes [the US tariffs] and has to continue to make necessary counterattacks,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ministry of commerce said in a statement. The latest round of tariffs comes as Chinese and US officials are due to meet in Washington for talks that few expect will bring an end to months of tit-for-tat threats and tariffs. On Monday, Donald Trump told Reuters he did not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anticipate much\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the negotiations in Washington. The US president said any resolution would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153take time because China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done too well for too long, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve become spoiled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The White House claims China steals foreign companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 intellectual property or forces them to give it up, and that industrial subsidy programmes unfairly benefit Chinese businesses. The latest round of US tariffs target electronics, plastics, chemicals, semiconductors and other goods from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Made in China\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd industrial plan to upgrade Chinese manufacturing capabilities. The full story is here: The eurozone data will not make easy reading for the European Central Bank or its president, Mario Draghi, suggests Balraj Sroya, sales trader at foreign exchange specialist Foenix Partners: The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy plans could be derailed as trade war fears have impacted PMI figures from the bloc state. While both the services and manufacturing PMI prints from the eurozone showed expansion in each respective sector, the manufacturing figure fell to 20-month lows of 54.6. Recently Inflation and economic growth have exceeded the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s targets. However, the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Quantitative Easing tapering strategy could be derailed if feeble data such as today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI prints continue while adding fuel to an already cautious Draghi. Eurozone business growth picked up but at a slower pace than expected, with the prospects of a trade war hitting the outlook for manufacturers. The IHS Markit preliminary composite PMI - which includes both the manufacturing and service sectors - came in at 54.4 in August, up from 54.3 the previous month but marginally below the forecast 54.5. The rate of expansion was one of the weakest seen over the past year and a half, said Markit. Companies expectations of growth slipped to the lowest for nearly two years. The services PMI rose from 54.2 to 54.4, in line with expectations. But the manufacturing index fell from 55.1 to 54.6, the lowest since November 2016 and below the expected 55. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit warned of warning lights flashing. He said: The survey data indicate that the eurozone economy looks to have continued to grow at a steady rate in August, raising hopes that the third quarter could see GDP growth match the 0.4% expansion seen in the second quarter. In fact, the survey evidence suggests that the official data so far this year could yet be revised slightly higher. Jobs growth also remains encouragingly robust, which should help further stimulate consumer spending and help offset signs of continuing weakness in exports. With the indicators of current activity, employment and price gauges remaining elevated, the August survey sends a hawkish signal to policymakers. But the forward-looking indicators suggest the business mood could cool as summer passes. Warning lights are flashing. Analysis of past data indicates that demand needs to pick up to sustain current output and employment growth in coming months. Yet the risks seem tilted to the downside. Escalating political worries, rising prices and a recent slowdown in order book growth have all contributed to the gloomiest outlook for almost two years, according to companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of their future output. In manufacturing, optimism is down to its lowest for almost three years, as a near- stalling of exports corroborated escalating trade war worries. With manufacturing looking the most susceptible to a trade-led slowdown in coming months, hopes are pinned on a robust service sector helping to drive economic growth as we move into the autumn, yet even here optimism is down to its lowest for nearly two years. Back with the German PMIs: Investors remain cautious, with markets continuing to drift. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor, said: Markets traded either side of breakeven in early trade as tariffs threatened by both the US and China came into effect overnight. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real risk to global economic growth if the US slaps duties on another $200bn of Chinese goods, and especially if other countries get sucked into this dispute. At a time when other economies are beginning to struggle, a sharp slowdown in US expansion could have a significant impact worldwide. These developments come at a particularly sensitive time for a UK stock market rangebound for the past three months. September is statistically the worst month of the year for UK shares, but there have been wild swings either way in recent years, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect this stale period to last. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business activity hit a six month high, with a strong service sector making up for weakness manufacturing as global trade tensions rise. The IHS Markit preliminary composite PMI rose from 55 in July to 55.7, better than the expected 55.2. But the manufacturing index fell from 56.9 to a lower than forecast 56.1. The service sector rose from 54.1 to 55.2. Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit said: German business continued to display remarkable resilience during August, with the latest PMI data going some way to dispel any fears about a global trade slowdown and its impact on the health of the economy. Buoyed by strong fundamentals in the domestic market, including rising employment and wages, the service sector enjoyed an upturn in growth in August and drove the steepest rise in private sector business activity for six months. While the manufacturing PMI retreated slightly, it remained well inside growth territory at the mid- point in the third quarter. The top-line number is perhaps flattered by the output component, with trends in new orders and exports \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the latter the weakest in over two years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c pointing to a softer pace of growth. Elsewhere, the survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measure of prices charged for goods and services edged closer to January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey-record peak, to suggest the potential for some renewed upward pressure on the headline inflation rate in coming months. France has reported better than expected growth in August, according to a preliminary survey of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing and service sectors. IHS Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s composite purchasing managers index - which combines the two sectors - rose from 54.4 in July to 55.1 this month. Analysts had been expecting a figure of around 54.6. The index has been above the 50 level which separates growth from contraction for the 26th month in a row. The manufacturing PMI rose from 53.3 to 53.7 while the service sector index increased from 54.9 to 55.7. Sam Teague, economist at IHS Markit said: Output growth across the French private sector ticked up to a four-month high in August, with both the service and manufacturing sectors seeing stronger expansions. Robust domestic client demand, alongside a renewed upturn in exports provided stimulus for the latest acceleration in growth. A key theme in the latest survey were the sharp inflationary pressures reported in the manufacturing sector, with many respondents blaming higher oil- related input cost burdens. This in turn placed downward pressure on confidence towards expected output growth over the next year. That said, despite optimism slipping in August, French businesses continued to hire additional staff at an elevated pace, partly reflecting rising output requirements. The new round of tit-for-tat trade tariffs between the US and China, the prospect of a US rate rise next month and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing problems have cast a shadow over European markets at the open. The FTSE 100 is virtually flat, up just 0.05%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 0.07% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.11%. Here are the opening calls for the European markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The bull run in the US market may have broken a new record on Wednesday, but investors have plenty to be nervous about at the moment. US and Chinese negotiators are meeting to try and resolve the trade dispute between the two sides, but this has not stopped new tariffs coming into effect a few hours ago. The US imposed a new round of tariffs on $16bn worth of imports from China, including motorcycles, locomotives and agricultural equipment. The 25% tax came into effect at 5.00 BST (noon in Beijing). China immediately responded by saying it planned to file a fresh complaint to the World Trade Organisations, and imposing retaliatory taxes on $16bn worth of US goods. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The US-China trade spat continues as representatives from both countries engage in low level talks in the US. The tit-for-tat tariffs conflict continues as both sides will impose tariffs on $16bn worth of each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goods today. The monetary size is small but the gesture is big, and traders will be eyeing developments. The trade dispute is of course not the only thing to worry US markets. President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubles continued after the criminal conviction of two associates, which is causing the one thing markets hate above all - uncertainty. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: There has been a lot of negative news on Trump over the past 36 hours; the job of markets will now be to decide whether Trump can ride the storm, or whether the double blow is likely to damage the Republican Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election prospects at the mid terms in November and result in the extension of a criminal investigation, which is already overshadowing Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency. The reality is that the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction so far has been limited and contained, suggesting that traders believe, at least for now, that Trump can move past this. The latest minutes from the Federal Reserve suggested the central bank is still keen on hiking rates, with another rise expected in September despite Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent attack on the policy. But the Fed did express some concerns about the Chinese trade spat, meaning it was marginally less hawkish than some had expected. Later today come the minutes from the recent meeting of the European Central Bank, with investors looking for further clues about the ending of its bond buying programme and the prospect of any rate rises. Also today there are the preliminary snapshots of the eurozone economy in August, with updates from France, Germany and the bloc as a whole.CMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Madden said: The flash manufacturing and services PMI reports from major eurozone countries will be in focus today. At 08.15 (UK time) France will release their numbers, and economists are expecting the manufacturing report to come in at 53.4, a slight improvement on July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 53.3. The consensus estimate for the services report is 55.1, up from 54.9 last month. Germany will announce their figures at 08.30 (UK time) and traders are expecting a slight cooling in the manufacturing sector from 56.9 in July to 56.5. Economists are expecting the services report to be 54.3, and the July reading was 54.1. As for the overall eurozone performance, economists at UniCredit said: The composite PMI is likely to edge up slightly in August, to 54.5 from 54.3 in the previous month (10:00 CET). We expect both the manufacturing and the services components to contribute to the headline reading. While a pickup in global trade activity during the second half of 2018, as indicated by our own global leading indicator, is likely to bolster sentiment of eurozone export-dependent manufacturers going forward, solid domestic fundamentals stemming from robust consumer spending and record-low unemployment should keep economic activity in the services sector well supported.

                "bodyText":"Markets continue to drift as the concerns about the US-China trade rift continue, along with uncertainty about how the problems facing Donald Trump will play out. The FTSE 100 is currently up just 0.17%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up a similar amount while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.37%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. A positive sign for the US economy with better than expected capital goods orders. The Commerce Department said new orders for non-defence capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a key indicator for business investment - climbed by 1.4% in July. This is sharply higher than June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure of 0.6% - itself revised upwards from 0.2% - and better than the forecasts of a 0.4% increase. But overall orders for durable goods decreased by 1.7% as demand for civilian aircraft - a volatile measure - fell. Back with Trump and Italy: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the latest housing data: Mortgage lending in Britain dropped last month before the Bank of England raised interest rates above the level set since the financial crisis, new banking industry figures show. The industry body UK Finance said the number of mortgages approved for new house purchases dropped by 4.3% in July to 39,584 compared with the same month a year ago. City economists had forecast around 40,700, suggesting a renewed slowdown in the housing market. Threadneedle Street raised the cost of borrowing earlier this month, making it more expensive for prospective homeowners to secure a mortgage, while concerns about a no-deal Brexit are also discouraging buyers. Analysts said the rise in rates to 0.75% from 0.5% could further weigh on demand for mortgages. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the figures demonstrate the housing market is fundamentally slowing, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The hike [from the Bank of England] will unnerve many buyers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The full report is here: President Donald Trump offered to buy Italian sovereign bonds when he met prime minister Giuseppe Conte at the White House last month, according to the Corriere della Sera newspaper. Rome is scheduled to issue about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac400bn worth of debt in 2019, and recent political uncertainty has seen a jump in Italian borrowing costs as investors move out of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bonds. The paper said that while Italy is keen to find new investors, it was unclear how the US could step in to guarantee the debt. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the view from an ING strategist: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the market reaction: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is currently up 0.75%, outpacing other European markets. Three senior executives at TSB, which suffered a disastrous IT meltdown beginning in April, are leaving the bank, according to the Financial Times. Ian Firth, Rachel Lock and Nigel Gilbert - TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treasurer, head of human resources and chief marketing officer - are all set to depart, says the report (\u00c2\u00a3). The fiasco is the subject of independent investigations, and helped push the bank into a loss for the year: ScottishPower has become the fourth of the big six energy suppliers to announce a second price rise this year, in response to rising wholesale prices. Around 900,000 customers on the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s default tariff will be hit with a \u00c2\u00a346 price hike from 8 October, pushing up their annual dual fuel bill 3.7%, to \u00c2\u00a31,257. The bad news for consumers comes on top of a 5.5% hike by ScottishPower in June. The company, which is owned by Spanish energy giant Iberdrola, blamed wholesale electricity and gas costs, which it had said had increased more than a fifth since April. Analysts have warned householders to expect further price rises, and one challenger firm, Bulb, has told customers a third rise this year is likely. Oil is being lifted again amid signs that US sanctions on Iran are beginning to have an impact on supplies. Brent crude is up 0.8% at $75.33 a barrel while US crude has climbed 0.9% to $68.45. The US government re-imposed sanctions on Iran this month after it withdrew from a 2015 international nuclear agreement. Jason Gammel, equity analyst at investment bank Jefferies, said: Multiple third-party reports indicate that Iranian tanker loadings are already down by around 700 kbd in the first half of August relative to July, which if it holds will exceed most expectations. We expect that by the fourth quarter the market will be dealing with either undersupply, dwindling spare capacity - or both. The UK mortgage figures are weighing on housebuilders, with Berkeley Group, Persimmon, Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey all down around 1%. A downgrade on Persimmon from analysts at Canaccord is not helping the sector. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: In thin August trading housebuilders have taken a knock as a double whammy of lower new approved mortgages and a five-month low in net mortgage lending weighed on the sector. Fortunately, the lower weighting for the likes of Taylor Wimpey in the FTSE means that these losses have been easily countered by gains for mining stocks off the back of a weaker US dollar. So overall the FTSE 100 remains virtually unchanged, edging up 0.12%. The number of mortgage approvals by the main high street banks slipped last month compared to a year ago. Approvals in July fell by 0.8%, but within this there was a 2.8% rise in existing households remortgaging ahead of the well-flagged interest rate rise earlier this month, according to data from industry body UK Finance. Credit card spending was 8.1% higher that a year earlier, but annual consumer credit growth slowed to 3.7%. Peter Tyler, director at UK Finance, said: July saw steady growth in gross mortgage lending, driven largely by remortgaging as homeowners locked into attractive deals in anticipation of the recent base rate rise. Card spending has also strengthened, reflecting increased expenditure during the holiday period and an uplift in retail sales due to the World Cup and warm weather. However the broader economic outlook remains mixed, with households continuing to see their incomes being squeezed by rising inflation. This may explain the shift towards deposits held in instant access accounts, as consumers opt to keep their money close to hand. With the European Central Bank being the latest to warn of the dangers of growing protectionism (in Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minutes), here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an interesting chart from HSBC (hat-tip Ransquawk): So would the markets crash if Donald Trump was impeached, as the president suggested? Paul Donovan, global chief economist at UBS Wealth Management, thinks not: Impeachment (by the House) may be more likely than conviction (by the Senate), but neither seems highly probable. A conviction would lead to President Pence. Pence\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic track record gives no grounds for assuming a negative equity reaction. The markets may be fairly subdued at the moment, but it could be a lot worse, says Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell: There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a lot to Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open, the lack of progress between the US and China following the latest round of trade talks leading to a muted start to the session. Given the amount of bad news out there at the moment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade talk-undermining tariff tit-for-tatting between the US and China, the ominous clouds of a no deal Brexit, and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential legal problems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the markets have done well to not lose their heads this week. The FTSE was unchanged after the bell, lurking just above 7560. The index failed to capitalise on a rebound from its mining stocks, that sector having been something of a burden in the last few sessions. The pound, meanwhile, needs to try and claw back the losses it incurred followed Dominic Raab\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poorly received no deal Brexit advice on Thursday. It hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been particularly successful so far: against the dollar it rose 0.1%, pushing cable above $1.283, while against the euro it actually slipped another 0.1%, keeping it the wrong side of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.11 for the first time in over a fortnight. As for the Eurozone indices, a solid second quarter German GDP reading \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was confirmed at 0.5% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c allowed the DAX to nudge 20 points higher. The CAC, meanwhile, could only add a handful of points, pushing above 5425 in the process. News of the latest prime ministerial appointment in Australia has seen a recovery in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency. Neil Wilson at Markets.com said: Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dollar rose after Scott Morrison was voted the next prime minister. The Australian dollar/US dollar had sold off as Malcolm Turnbull was forced to resign, briefly touching on 0.720, its lowest since the start of 2017, before paring losses to trade around 0.7280. But the longer-term downtrend remains in play with trend resistance seen at 0.73750. Politics won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a factor for long for the Australian dollar, which tends to ride this kind of shenanigans \u00e2\u20ac\u201cforex traders should be pretty used to a changing Australian prime ministers and will shrug it off quickly. With the continuing trade row between the US and China, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s travails and the spotlight on US interest rates, markets are making a cautious end to the week. The FTSE 100 is virtually flat, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up 0.25%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed just 0.12% while Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is up 0.1%. On the trade dispute, Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com said: With the US mulling $200bn in additional 25% tariffs, this is not going away. The real worry is what does China do then. While Beijing cannot match the US in terms of raw firepower as it imports far less from the US, it can respond with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcqualitative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 measures, which could seriously impede US firms doing business in China. The German GDP figures show that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has not yet been hit too badly by the current trade tensions, says ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski, although this could of course change: German growth data suggest that at least in the second quarter, the ongoing trade tensions were a threat but did not leave any significant marks on the economy. Obviously, this could change in the coming months. Even though the EU seems to be off US radar screens at least for the time being, the series of German export partners being hurt by sanctions, tariffs or economic crises is getting longer. Just think of China, Russia, Turkey, Iran or potentially the UK. The strength of the German export sector has always been its diversity and the fact that it is not dependent on a single export partner. And while the weak euro should cushion any adverse effects stemming from tariffs or sanctions, the list of troubled countries should obviously not get too long. While risks from the external side are increasing, the domestic side of the German economy offers both challenges but also opportunities. Just think of an increasingly complicated political landscape, too few new investments and structural reforms and supply-side constraints in the manufacturing sector. Many potential risks ahead but at least for now, there is only one good reaction to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth data: enjoy and savour. Here are IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening calls for European markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There was little expectation that this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talks between the US and China to resolve their trade tensions would make much of a breakthrough. And so it proved, as they ended on Thursday with no real progress. President Trump had already set the tone, suggesting there was unlikely to be any quick resolution, and discussions can hardly have been helped by the two sides slapping a new range of tariffs on each others\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 goods as the talks were underway. White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the officials \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exchanged views on how to achieve fairness, balance, and reciprocity in the economic relationship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the discussions including \u00e2\u20ac\u0153addressing structural issues in China\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd including its intellectual property and technology transfer policies. Later China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister Liu Kun told Reuters the country would keep hitting back at the US. He said: China doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wish to engage in a trade war, but we will resolutely respond to the unreasonable measures taken by the United States. Economists at UniCredit said a new round of tariffs was likely to come into force in September, with the US targeting $200bn of imports from China: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beijing is said to be willing to start new talks only after the US mid-term elections.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So markets continue to be edgy as the row rumbles on, with Wall Street finishing in the red and Asian markets vacillated between negative and positive. European markets are expected to make a mixed start. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: A spokesperson for the Beijing administration described the meeting as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconstructive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, but it sends a message to traders that this situation won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be resolved quickly. The negative press surrounding President Trump isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t boosting investor confidence either. Indeed Trump declared that impeaching him would lead to a stock market crash, although the thing markets hate most is uncertainty, which is what we have here. Elsewhere US Federal Reserve members speaking at the two day meeting of central bankers at Jackson Hole in Wyoming tried to make it clear that despite Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of their rate raising policy, they would not be swayed by his comments. CMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Madden said: Esther George, the Kansas City Fed President issued an upbeat view of the US economy, as she believes the Federal Reserve can hike interest rates several more times before it can get to a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcneutral\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 position. Ms George made it clear that President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views regarding the hiking cycle, will not influence the central bank. Robert Kaplan, Dallas Fed President, reiterated the independence of the Federal Reserve, making it clear that Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t influence decisions in relation to interest rates. The stimulus effect is boosting the economy, but it will start to fade in 2019, according to Mr Kaplan. There is little economic news expected, with US durable goods due at 1.30 UK time. We have already had the latest German GDP figures, which showed a 0.5% rise in the second quarter, the same as the previous three months and in line with expectations. Year on year the figure was 2.3%, again as forecast.",

Presidents usually go out of their way to avoid saying anything that might give Wall Street cause for concern. Not this one. The market would crash, Trump said. Everyone would be very poor.</p> <p>The warning shows just how crucial Trump thinks a rising stock market is to his political appeal. You might not like me much, he is suggesting, but look what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happened to your share portfolio since my election in November 2016.</p> <p>What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, Trump is partly right. There is no doubt that a bitter impeachment battle \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially since it inevitably would be long drawn out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would rattle Wall Street. Financial markets hate uncertainty.</p> <p>It is also the case that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda has helped to push up share prices. He has cut taxes on American corporations, which has boosted profits. He has also slashed regulation. Both are positive for markets. Trump campaigned as a man who would deliver for the little guy: he has governed in the interests of big business.</p> <p>But all bull markets come to an end sooner or later, and there are already signs that the second 18 months of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency will be a choppier time for Wall Street than the first, impeachment or no impeachment. And if, as some believe, 2019 is a dire year for the stock market, Trump himself will have only himself to blame.</p> <p>First, his tax cuts were ill-timed. They have pumped up demand late in the business cycle, raising concerns at the Federal Reserve, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, that the economy is in danger of overheating. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crude attempts to pressurise the Fed into slowing the pace of interest rate increases will not work. The next increase in borrowing costs will happen next month, and eventually tighter borrowing costs will slow the economy, affecting corporate earnings.</p> <p>The fact that the Fed has moved further and faster to normalise monetary policy has also led to a stronger dollar, and that affects the earnings that US companies make on their sales overseas. Trump seems to be setting up Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Fed, to be the fall guy if there is a market correction.</p> <p>Secondly, there is Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/23/us-china-escalate-trade-war-total-sum-levied-reaches-100bn\">aggressive trade agenda,</a> which is starting to affect the US economy in a number of ways. At the most basic level, tariffs push up the cost of imports, which add to business costs and so eat into corporate profit margins.</p> <p>Tariffs also hurt other countries, and the reduction in global growth has a knock-on effect on US exports. The companies in the S&amp;P 500 make 40% of their earnings outside America.</p> <p>Then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the impact on business confidence. The psychological effects of protectionism were limited while US companies believed Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s belligerence was all an act. But as the rhetoric has hardened and sabre-rattling has threatened to turn into a full-scale trade war, businesses have become more and more alarmed. The risk is that Trump may use trade as a diversionary tactic in order to deflect attention from the investigations into his dealings.</p> <p>Wall Street could continue to rise for a while. But by the start of next year the boost from tax cuts will be fading, interest rate increases will be starting to bite, the global economy will be slowing as a result of protectionism, and the midterm elections could result in a Congress much more hostile to Trump. The message to investors is clear: a big market correction is lurking out there. And it is not all that far away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9ed021437b74459e9fa716c0999f49d88392fcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9ed021437b74459e9fa716c0999f49d88392fcb/0_0_4108_2464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oil Rigs in the Cromarty Firth awaiting decommissioning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oil Rigs in the Cromarty Firth awaiting decommissioning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Oil and gas can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fuel Scottish independence</h2> <p>Higher oil prices have helped Scotland cut its deficit, giving Nicola Sturgeon, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/22/scotland-cuts-its-deficit-but-is-still-outspending-the-uk\">something to cheer last week</a>.</p> <p>The question of how much oil and gas revenues could power an independent Scotland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/21/questions-value-scotland-north-sea-oil-highlighted\">was debated during the referendum campaign four years ago</a>.

                "bodyText":"Keen angler Darren Bailey left school at 16 in the hope of making money doing something he loved. Thirty years on from taking a job in a fishing tackle shop in Norwich, he is chief executive of Angling Direct, a rapidly growing retail business that made its stock market debut a year ago. At a time of great uncertainty on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high streets, with some of the best known names in retail struggling or going bust, Angling Direct is opening more shops. Its 23rd shop will open its doors to customers in Guildford on 1 September, soon to be followed by a 24th store in Peterborough. The company has identified another 20 other popular fishing locations for future stores. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tactile product,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bailey explains. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People like to see it, touch it, feel it. They might wait until a later date to buy it online but they still want to see the products in the shops.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Combined online and store sales jumped 56% to \u00c2\u00a321.9m in the six months to 31 July, despite extreme weather conditions with the Beast from the East and the prolonged heatwave, which might deter even the most dedicated anglers. The number of shoppers visiting stores did dip over the period, by about 2%, but like-for-like sales \u00e2\u20ac\u201c stripping out sales at shops open for less than a year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rose 4.2% as the average customer spend increased. Angling Direct sells a vast assortment of more than 21,500 fishing tackle products, ranging from a \u00c2\u00a31 bag of hooks to poles that will set you back nearly \u00c2\u00a34,000. The company does not sell through Amazon and, as yet, has not suffered at the hands of the online retailer. Bailey says that while it is always wise to keep an eye on what Amazon is doing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it does sell some fishing tackle \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not too concerned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Customers want specialist service and advice, and you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get that from Amazon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd For a business that began with fishing tackle shops in Norfolk, Bailey now has ambitions beyond UK shores. Angling Direct already exports to more than 40 countries and launched a German website in June, with other European websites to follow later in the year. The company floated on the Alternative Investment Market in July last year, to fund the expansion that Bailey is now seeing through. Shares have risen from 64p to 107p over the period. The rapid growth in sales is thanks to that expansion and investment, both in stores and online, rather than an explosion of people taking up fishing as a hobby. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fishing [as a pursuit] is pretty stable. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re winning on market share, though we are working very hard on bringing new anglers into the sport,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. As for his own hobby, Bailey doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get out fishing as much as he would like to these days. He went fishing for the first time in 2018 last week, on the River Trent. The ideal weather for a spot of fishing and a further boost to sales? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m hoping for an Indian summer and a normal British winter,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bailey says.",

US President Donald Trump may have rebranded the agreement as the United States \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mexico Trade Agreement due to the apparent negative connotations associated with NAFTA but I think this may be yet another attempt to drag Canada to the negotiating table and align themselves with his idea of how it should look. </p> <p>Trump has made renegotiating trade deals a key feature of his presidency and is willing to do whatever it takes in order to get what he wants. So far, he has had limited success with China, the EU and his NAFTA partners but coming ahead of the midterm elections, this could be viewed as an important success. While the US consumer may be the primary loser in his approach and the outcome of it due to the impact it has on prices, he is receiving credit for fighting to preserve skilled US jobs. </p> <p>Whether such perception will be enough to secure him a second term will be determined in a couple of years but it does appear to be working in his favour so far. From an investor perspective, the economy is still booming and in coming to an agreement with Mexico, one trade risk has been effectively removed and for now, that is good news. </p> <p>While there are some notable data pieces out later in the week, politics is likely to continue to be a driving force in the markets. The threat of a US-initiated trade war has dragged on markets for most of the year, with tax reform helping to offset this and prevent too significant a drop in the US.

So the prospect of a trade war between the two countries has not yet gone away.</p> <p>In typical fashion Trump boasted about how great the new deal was, and also said the NAFTA name would be ditched:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get rid of the name Nafta.

Canada is not yet included, and effectively has until Friday to sign up.</p> <p>Markets have treated this as progress, and a sign that the free trade system on which US companies depend will not be abandoned. Details do remain limited \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is hard to fit the complexities of a trade deal into a tweet. However, this is not risk free. Not-NAFTA will require Congressional approval, and without Canada, fast track authority probably cannot be used.</p> <p>This does not have a bearing on the Chinese trade negotiations (which do not appear to be going that well). Not-NAFTA lies somewhere between the EU negotiations (keeping things as they were) and China (political problems). It does stress the unpredictable nature of a policy that depends on the personal whims of the US president. </p> </blockquote> <p>Still, as Donovan indicated, the news sent US markets sharply higher, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq hitting new records and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising more than 1%.</p> <p>European markets are also expected to benefit, with the UK having some ground to make up after the Bank Holiday weekend. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>London returns from a three-day weekend and the FTSE has some catching up to do after a positive close for European markets on Monday. A strong finish in the US amid better news on trade is setting Europe up for a higher open... </p> <p>If the deal with Mexico is a sign of things to come, emerging markets are more attractive from a valuation standpoint- but the US still has all the momentum. There is clearly bemusement amongst many economists that the rising tariffs are not causing greater concern for US investors. We think, from the beginning it has been clear investors believe there can only be one winner any these disputes and that is the US.

And the fact that Canada has not yet joined the new version of the North American Free Trade Agreement is another reason for caution. Nevertheless, after making gains on Monday, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is currently up 0.19% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.37%. The FTSE 100, which was closed for Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank Holiday, has added 0.5%. This is not as much as might have been expected given the FTSE was playing catch-up on the other European markets, with a stronger pound against the dollar limiting the rise. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Germany is considering giving financial aid to struggling Turkey, to avoid a full blown economic crisis in the region, the Wall Street Journal is reporting. The full story is here (\u00c2\u00a3). Elsewhere here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an OECD chart from economist Rupert Seggins showing how a number of countries have performed in the second quarter in terms of GDP growth: US Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin says he hopes Canada will join the Mexico-US trade deal but if not the two will go it alone. The comments came in a interview on CNBC: The pound may be falling against the euro on yet more Brexit fears, down 0.13% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1022, but it is managing to move higher against a weaker dollar. The US currency is out of favour as investors turn away towards riskier bets following the US-Mexico trade deal. So the pound is up 0.21% at $1.2918. This performance against the dollar has done nothing for the FTSE 100, which is full of international earners which benefit from a weaker pound. The index is currently up 0.3% despite the positivity around the trade situation. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets said: The FTSE100 is holding its post-Bank holiday jump above 7585, but back from its 7640 best of the day. Helping risk appetite are Miners welcoming fresh USD weakness, giving metals prices a boost, coupled with a US-Mexico trade deal offering hope that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit spat with Beijing could calm. Hindering the index is GBP strength vs USD, sending several defensives lower, and eclipsing higher Oil prices to keep heavyweight Energy shares offside. If Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not-NAFTA deal works, he is unlikely to change strategy in the other trade disputes, says Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda: While I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure investors would rather the deal include Canada and preserve NAFTA, this is at least a step in the right direction and could be an important first step towards it. US President Donald Trump may have rebranded the agreement as the United States \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mexico Trade Agreement due to the apparent negative connotations associated with NAFTA but I think this may be yet another attempt to drag Canada to the negotiating table and align themselves with his idea of how it should look. Trump has made renegotiating trade deals a key feature of his presidency and is willing to do whatever it takes in order to get what he wants. So far, he has had limited success with China, the EU and his NAFTA partners but coming ahead of the midterm elections, this could be viewed as an important success. While the US consumer may be the primary loser in his approach and the outcome of it due to the impact it has on prices, he is receiving credit for fighting to preserve skilled US jobs. Whether such perception will be enough to secure him a second term will be determined in a couple of years but it does appear to be working in his favour so far. From an investor perspective, the economy is still booming and in coming to an agreement with Mexico, one trade risk has been effectively removed and for now, that is good news. While there are some notable data pieces out later in the week, politics is likely to continue to be a driving force in the markets. The threat of a US-initiated trade war has dragged on markets for most of the year, with tax reform helping to offset this and prevent too significant a drop in the US. With progress being made, the S&amp;P 500 hitting new record highs and stocks now in their longest ever bull run, the environment seems perfect for Trump to continue to pressure the countries trade partners and force concessions so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect any change in strategy any time soon. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an interesting report from the London Evening Standard. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has apparently been asked to stay on by the government for an extra year, until 2020, the paper says, so he can give some continuity as the country stumbles its way through Brexit. The Standard is edited these days by former UK chancellor George Osborne, the man who unveiled Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appointment in 2012. US markets are expected to continue their positive run when trading begins, with the futures pointing to a 40 point or so rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Indices are steady this morning after the long weekend for the UK, but the new highs in the US have not emboldened buyers this side of the Atlantic. In the short run, the market is a momentum machine, and this is being clearly demonstrated as the US market diverges from Europe, leaving the FTSE and others trailing far behind. Still, progress on trade talks is welcome for all concerned, since it shows that the Donald can be persuaded if the right approach is used. Trade negotiators around the globe will be studying the US/Mexico talks for tips on how to get on the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good side. Further dollar weakness is continuing to bolster the euro and sterling, providing another headwind for European stocks to deal with. But with US GDP tomorrow and non-farms coming up next week this near-term weakness in the greenback may soon reverse \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and while this will help the FTSE on the sterling front, a higher dollar will hit commodity prices, limiting potential upside for the index, suggesting those looking for gains will keep their money stateside. Over in the eurozone, Italian 10 year government bond yields have hit a three month high on worries about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending plans and its debt levels. Italian deputy prime minister Luigi Di Maio told the Il Fatto Quotidiano today that its public deficit could top the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ceiling of 3% of GDP next year. Jim Reid at Deutsche Bank said: Italian politicians seems to have continued to escalate their rhetoric regarding potential budget conflict with the European Union. Deputy Prime Minister Di Maio, leader of the Five Star Movement, said that Italy has no intention of withdrawing from the union or the currency zone, but that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we will look at all measures in discussions regarding the European budget and will block what doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work for us.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The other Deputy Prime Minister, from the Northern League, Matteo Salvini, echoed Di Maio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sentiments, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to cut financing to a useless entity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The principle point of contention is immigration policy, with Italian leaders arguing that the rest of Europe needs to do more to assist Italy with their influx of migrants. The US-Mexico deal is welcome but gives little indication as to the outcome of the current dispute between Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government and China, suggests Alejo Czerwonko, emerging market strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s developments constitute a step in the right direction towards a revamped and modernized NAFTA. The road to a final agreement remains rocky. Several thorny issues must still be ironed out once Canada joins discussions. The most important of these involve the dispute resolution mechanism, government procurement, and agriculture. In addition, a final deal will have to be approved by each country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legislature. Although the exact timing is uncertain, we expect the countries to ultimately reach a trilateral deal, avoiding the serious consequences that would have resulted from President Trump carrying out his threat to withdraw from NAFTA... Importantly, we warn against extrapolating NAFTA optimism to the realm of US-China bilateral relationships. Trump administration documents demonstrate that current concerns about China reach beyond the narrow issue of trade, suggesting they are not going to dissipate easily. We recently reduced the size of our overweight position in global equities, bringing our overall global tactical asset allocation stance to broadly neutral. A key reason for our risk reduction was our view that the market was not pricing in the increased risk of the US-China tariff issue. Talks between China and the US have yielded little progress in recent days, and the US is still on track to impose 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c25% tariffs on $200bn of trade with China, and has threatened more. While we expect US-China tensions to persist over the medium term, a near-term de-escalation cannot be ruled out. In the months ahead, a reduction in trade risks or improving valuations may increase the risk/ reward for global equities. Comments from UK prime minister Theresa May on a no-deal Brexit have also done the pound little favours, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, while Chinese concerns have tempered the market enthusiasm for the Mexico deal: Though tentatively positive, the European markets hardly went doolally for Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deal with Mexico, any good will tempered by a) the unresolved, and tense situation with Canada, and b) the even more unresolved, and even more tense situation with China. The FTSE, somewhat playing catch-up after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank Holiday, jumped 0.6% after the bell, striking 7625 for the first time in nearly a fortnight. The miners played a key role in driving the UK index higher, having been something of a pest for the FTSE in recent weeks, with added gains in the banking sector. A lack of movement from the pound likely aided the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tuesday rise. Cable sat flat the wrong side of $1.29, while against the euro sterling slipped 0.1%, the currency pinned back by Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarkably chilled approach to a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit, with the PMI stating that such an outcome \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the end of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The Eurozone indices weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as enthusiastic as their UK peer on Tuesday, having climbed a fair amount on Monday. The DAX added another 30 or so points, and, a smidge shy of 12600 is sitting at its best price for 18 days; the CAC, meanwhile, started fairly flat, but is nevertheless knocking on the door of 5500. After a long weekend in the UK, traders have pushed the pound down to a one year low against the euro on continuing fears of a no-deal Brexit. Among the headlines prompting concern, French prime minister Edouard Phillipe has reportedly asked ministers to prepare contingency plans for no deal. So sterling fell to a 12 month low of 90.73p although it has recovered slightly to 90.60p, down 0.01%. With the dollar weaker as the US-Mexico trade deal sends investors into riskier assets, the pound has managed to edge 0.07% higher to $1.2900. Against a basket of currencies, the US currency dipped 0.03% to 94.74. As expected, the US-Mexico deal has eased some of the trade tensions which have been building up for months now thanks to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confrontational approach to the issue. So the FTSE 100 is up 0.56%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 0.3% better and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.2%. Continuing worries about the stand-off with China however are likely to limit the gains. Here are IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening calls for Europe: Trade tensions have been hanging over the market, and the deal with Mexico is certainly a step in the right direction, says David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets. But there is still China of course. Madden says: Traders are still mindful that the US-China talks last week didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t achieve much. It would appear that the trade spat will rumble on and there is chatter in the markets that the US is eyeing up another round of tariffs on Chinese goods, but this time it could be up to $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. The US department of agriculture has plans to financially support farmers who have been targeted by Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs, and this initiative suggests how determined Washington DC is to maintain a hard-line. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. For once there is some positive news on the US and trade. Having gone toe to toe with China and Europe over tariffs, President Trump has now agreed a new trade deal with Mexico (despite the wall he is so keen to build between the two countries). Trump had threatened to rip up the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the two countries and Canada, but this new deal with Mexico has eased the uncertainty and put pressure on Canada to also sign up. However Trump has said he could still put tariffs on Canadian made cars if it refuses to agree to the new deal and also wants concessions on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dairy products. So the prospect of a trade war between the two countries has not yet gone away. In typical fashion Trump boasted about how great the new deal was, and also said the NAFTA name would be ditched: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get rid of the name Nafta. It has a bad connotation because the United States was hurt very badly by Nafta for many years and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now a really good deal for both countries...I think it is one of the largest trade deals ever made \u00e2\u20ac\u201c maybe the largest trade deal ever made. Economist Paul Donovan at UBS said: US President Trump declared an end to NAFTA and proposed a not-NAFTA deal with Mexico (which looks a lot like NAFTA). Canada is not yet included, and effectively has until Friday to sign up. Markets have treated this as progress, and a sign that the free trade system on which US companies depend will not be abandoned. Details do remain limited \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is hard to fit the complexities of a trade deal into a tweet. However, this is not risk free. Not-NAFTA will require Congressional approval, and without Canada, fast track authority probably cannot be used. This does not have a bearing on the Chinese trade negotiations (which do not appear to be going that well). Not-NAFTA lies somewhere between the EU negotiations (keeping things as they were) and China (political problems). It does stress the unpredictable nature of a policy that depends on the personal whims of the US president. Still, as Donovan indicated, the news sent US markets sharply higher, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq hitting new records and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising more than 1%. European markets are also expected to benefit, with the UK having some ground to make up after the Bank Holiday weekend. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: London returns from a three-day weekend and the FTSE has some catching up to do after a positive close for European markets on Monday. A strong finish in the US amid better news on trade is setting Europe up for a higher open... If the deal with Mexico is a sign of things to come, emerging markets are more attractive from a valuation standpoint- but the US still has all the momentum. There is clearly bemusement amongst many economists that the rising tariffs are not causing greater concern for US investors. We think, from the beginning it has been clear investors believe there can only be one winner any these disputes and that is the US. While emerging markets, including China have fallen into bear market territory, the record US bull market presses onwards. Elsewhere it looks like another fairly quiet day on the corporate and economic front, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be keeping tabs on developments as they happen.",

For the following year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Thunderball, the car was adapted with a water cannon and a boot-stowed jetpack. The DB5 returned in Goldeneye in 1995 and in several Bond films since, including Skyfall and Spectre. The company last week announced plans to create 25 Goldfinger DB5s complete with some of Bond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gadgets, including revolving number plates. The cars, which will all come in Bond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s silver birch colour, will cost \u00c2\u00a32.75m each and will not be road legal. The company recently began production of its new Vantage sports car model, which is hand-built in Gaydon. Marking the start of production of the Vantage earlier this year, Greg Clark, secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aston Martin is an iconic brand that is an integral part of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proud automotive heritage. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Through our modern industrial strategy we are building on this success, and the new Vantage is a British-built car exemplifying the skill and innovation that sets the UK auto sector apart from its competitors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Next to hit the production line will be the DBS Superleggera, a super-GT with a top speed of 211 mph (340km/h) and 0-62 mph acceleration in 3.4 seconds. The company is building a new factory in Wales, where it is expected to base production of its Lagonda Vision emissions-free electric sports car.",

                "bodyText":"US economic growth was slightly stronger than expected in the second quarter, coming in at 4.2% rather than 4%. Meanwhile the hope that Canada will join the new trade agreement between the US and Mexico is giving some support to stock markets, although concerns about Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial position and worries about Spanish banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exposure to Turkey are limiting the gains in Europe. And the FTSE 100 is heading lower as the pound stablises against the dollar and moves higher against the euro, currently up 0.33%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. A quick view from ING strategist Viraj Patel: Anthony Kurukgy, senior sales trader at Foenix Partners, said: If the US Federal Reserve needed one final economic indicator to back a move to increase interest rates further when the FOMC meet again next month, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP reading will have provided just that. With US growth now at pre-financial crisis levels (4.2%), the futures market will continue to bet on another hike come December if growth continues in Q4. Whether Washington likes it or not, September may not be the last time the Fed tightens monetary policy this year. The US commerce department said: With this second estimate for the second quarter, the general picture of economic growth remains the same; the revision primarily reflected upward revisions to nonresidential fixed investment and private inventory investment that were partly offset by a downward revision to personal consumption expenditures. US economic growth was slightly better than forecast, turning in its best performance in four years, according to a second estimate of the figures. On an annualised basis, second quarter GDP growth came in at 4.2%, better than the initial reading of 4.1%. The performance was also better than the decline to 4% which analysts had been expecting. As mentioned previously, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency continues to come under pressure: Another possible eurozone problem child, Italy, has seen its bond yields fall and the price rise today after recent weakness. The support has come from a report in La Stampa newspaper saying that the country may seek help from the European Central Bank when it unveils new spending plans next month. Previously there have been suggestions the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s propose budget could breach eurozone targets, and this has put its bonds under pressure recently. The La Stampa report suggested Italy could ask for the ECB to buy more of its bonds to avoid financial speculation. US markets are expected to open unchanged, while Europe continues to drift lower. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a quiet start to trading on Wednesday, with equity markets in Europe slightly in the red and US futures pointing to a flat open in a few hours. With NAFTA negotiations finally making progress, there is a sense of relief that the risk of a global trade war is easing, which has been supportive for sentiment recently. There is still a long way to go with Trump recently again threatening tariffs on cars from Europe and the US preparing another $200 billion of tariffs against China but any progress is welcome and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hopefully something we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see more of in the months ahead. The Canadian dollar has gained ground in recent days on reports that it is re-joining talks and offering concessions that could result in an agreement by the end of the week. Trump had previously threatened to proceed with a US-Mexico trade agreement as a replacement for NAFTA, in effect cutting Canada out, which could have had a significant impact on the Canadian economy. While this was more than likely a bluff aimed at forcing the hand of the Canadians, it is a relief that no such move will likely be necessarily as it would have been harmful for all concerned. Another factor pressuring markets is the continuing economic trouble in Turkey. The Turkish lira has been under pressure on concerns about the outlook for the country, and is currently at a two year low. There is also a worry that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems could lead to wider contagion in emerging markets, and also spill over into Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking system. Reuters reports that analysts at Man Group believe Spanish banks in particular are vulnerable to the problems in Turkey. The agency quotes Man as saying: As the Turkey crisis persists and investors worry about contagion in the rest of the emerging markets, we believe the European banking system generally, and Spain especially, could be at risk. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex is currently one of the biggest losers among European markets, down 0.75%. Markets are slipping back after their early gains. The FTSE 100 is now down 0.38% after sterling stablised on hopes that an extension to the October Brexit deadline for agreement could lead to progress in the discussions. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index is full of overseas earners which dislike a stronger pound. The dips in Europe are less severe, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac both down just 0.02%. But worries about Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt levels have pushed the FTSE MIB down 0.32%. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive session has not been carried over into the European morning so far, with indices either flat or lower in early trading. US markets look like they are running out of momentum for the time being, with the upcoming long weekend likely to be the culprit for some usual profit-taking. After an early gain, the FTSE 100 has moved sharply into reverse, testing the 7600 level once again, this time from above. The index looks beset on two fronts this morning; first of all, the stronger dollar has stopped the commodity rally in its tracks, dragging down the mining sector, and news of a possible extension to Brexit talks has given sterling a lift. It is important to keep some perspective here though \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while the FTSE is essentially flat on the year (excluding dividends) it is at least 10% higher from the March lows. This kind of digestion of a big move higher is entirely normal in markets, so all is not lost for the index just yet. Earlier we had some disappointing consumer confidence figures from Germany. Rising inflation and the likely effect of continuing trade tensions between the US and EU contributed to a dip in the GfK consumer sentiment index to 10.5 going into September from 10.6 the previous month. Analysts had expected an unchanged figure. This was the second month in a row that sentiment deteriorated. GfK said: Despite the second decline in a row, consumers continue to assume that the good consumer economy will continue even if the dynamic could possibly drop off somewhat. Therefore, GfK expects that private consumption for this year will increase by 1.5 percent in real terms and meet the GfK forecast made at the beginning of the year. The positive outlook for the consumer economy will only continue as is if the job market remains stable, which is the current assumption, and there are no additional risks threatening from the price front. A further increase in inflation would certainly dampen the consumer climate. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a positive start in Europe, but by no means a really convincing one. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Investors continued to greet the US-Mexico trade deal with wary positivity, the European markets just about nudging higher after the bell. The FTSE, which got that belated bounce on Tuesday as it played catch-up following bank holiday Monday, opened up a few points, a smidge above 7630. There was even less of interest in the Eurozone, with the DAX and CAC at 12550 and 5500 respectively, with investors put off from doing anything else due to concerns surrounding the Italian economy. Despite more front page worries about the cost and chaos of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit, the pound managed to avoid furthering Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses as Wednesday got underway. Against the dollar it was unchanged at $1.287, while against the euro it actually rose 0.2%, lifting off of its recent near one year lows. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really not a lot to work with this Wednesday morning, beyond the various ongoing macro-tensions, leaving investors sitting on their hands until this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US Q2 GDP reading. The positive developments on the trade front following the US-Mexico deal have helped push European markets higher at the open. But the gains are limited by worries about Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, following recent comments that the country might breach eurozone caps on public spending. The FTSE 100 has opened up 0.15% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has added 0.16% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.17%. But Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is down 0.03%. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: No records are expected to be broken in European share markets just yet. Some of the optimism about the deal struck between the US and Mexico has turned to concerns over Italian debt levels. Mexico reaching an amicable solution with the US, especially in the automotive industry, increases the likelihood Europe will end with a similar result. The positive industry news bodes well for recently pressured auto shares including Volkswagen and Citroen Peugeot. Concerns about European bank exposure in Italy is a worry, hot off the heels of similar concerns over Turkey. The comments from the deputy prime minister about Italy breaching the 3% cap on public deficits is confirmation that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new populist government is even less fiscally responsible than its predecessors. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political upset combined with its high debt load are a significant risk factor for European equities though the second half of 2018. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew at 0.2% quarter on quarter in the second three months of the year, in line with initial estimates. The annualised growth rate was 1.7%, as expected. The French statistics agency INSEE said: Imports bounced back this quarter (+1.0% after \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.4%) as did exports to a lesser extent (+0.2% after \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.4%). All in all, foreign trade balance contributed negatively to GDP growth, \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.3 points, after a neutral contribution in Q1. Here are IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening calls for Europe: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets continue to be lifted by the more positive outlook for the US trade situation, following the deal between President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration and the Mexican government to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. There are hopes too that Canada, the other NAFTA signee, will join the new deal within the next few days. And although the agreement does little to indicate how things might develop in the US row with China and the EU, investors are taking the optimistic view for the moment. So with US markets hitting new peaks and Asia moving ahead overnight, European markets are expected to open higher. Here is our latest story on the positive response to the trade talks: The main economic event of the day is US GDP which is expected to show strong growth in the revised second quarter figures. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The consensus estimate is 4% ,and keep in mind the advanced reading was 4.1%. In the first-quarter the economy grew by 2.2%. There is a growing belief that President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts are kicking in, and we could see higher levels of growth at the back end of the year in comparison with the beginning. Yesterday, the US Conference Board consumer sentiment report hit is highest level since late 2000. French GDP figures are also due shortly, with annualised growth forecast to reach 1.7%.

                "bodyText":"The US economy recorded its strongest economic growth in nearly four years in the three months to the end of June, according to revised figures. Gross domestic product increased at a 4.2% annualized rate, the commerce department said on Wednesday after revising its second-quarter calculations, establishing the quarter as the strongest in terms of growth since late 2014. Many economists had forecast a downward revision of growth to about 4%. The figures helped send Wall Street to new highs on Wednesday. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq indexes both broke records for the fourth consecutive session, boosted by gains for technology companies including Amazon and Alphabet. Amazon rose 3.4% as the online retailer edged closer to becoming the second US company after Apple to be worth $1tn. Its market value stands at $971bn. After the initial calculation of 4.1% was announced in July, Donald Trump hailed the figures as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an economic turnaround of historic importance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. On Wednesday, the US treasury department attributed the revisions to higher levels of spending by businesses on software and a decline in imports, including petroleum. Balanced out against out against GDP numbers for previous quarters, the revision puts the US economy on track to hit the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of 3% annual growth. But economists warn that the growth is unlikely to be sustained as the quarter reflected unique boosters, including Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $1.5tn tax cut package, which helped tweak consumer spending upwards, and revenue from soya bean exports to China ahead of raised tariffs coming into effect. Economists had expected second-quarter GDP growth would be revised down one-tenth of a percentage point to a 4% pace in anticipation of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153America First\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd policies, including tit-for-tat tariff hikes between the US, China, the EU, Canada and Mexico coming into effect. On the downside, growth in consumer spending was lowered to 3.8% in the second quarter instead of the previously reported 4%. But the trends may be reversed in the coming months. The US Conference Board, which measures consumer confidence, a solid indicator of consumer spending which accounts for two-thirds of US economic activity, said its confidence index had hit its highest level since October 2000. The index climbed to 133.4 in August, despite expectations from a survey of Reuters economists that it would fall to 126.7, as consumers reported short-term economic optimism. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These historically high confidence levels should continue to support healthy consumer spending in the near term,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board. The rise in consumer confidence comes as US stocks hit record highs after a six-month climb back from February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market correction \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the S&amp;P 500 index has jumped 3% in the past two weeks. Trump tweeted to trumpet the news: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumer confidence pops in August to highest level since October 2000.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A plentiful job supply, coupled with a rise in the percentage of US households describing current business conditions as improving to 40.3%, from 38.1% a month earlier, are key components for the overall rise in consumer confidence.

                "body":"<p>Timing is everything in financial markets. And Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s embattled president, Mauricio Macri, just got it spectacularly wrong.</p> \n<p>Late on Wednesday, it emerged that Macri had asked the International Monetary Fund to speed up the disbursement of its $50bn (\u00c2\u00a338bn) rescue package for South America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second biggest economy. Coming at the end of a day that had seen the peso fall heavily against the US dollar, the announcement was intended to shore up confidence.</p> \n<p>Currency dealers didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it that way. Working on the assumption that Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems must be even worse than they thought, they dumped the peso in even bigger quantities when the market in Buenos Aires opened for business. That triggered the next line of defence from the central bank: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/30/argentina-raises-interest-rates-to-60-to-shore-up-peso\">an increase in interest rates from 45% to 60%</a> coupled with a commitment to hold borrowing costs at that punitive level until December.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"85408270-bd17-4430-b35e-537fbb6d631b\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p><strong>What is the IMF?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The International Monetary Fund, created in 1945, is an organisation of 189 countries based in Washington DC. It is governed by, and accountable, to member countries.<br></p>\n    <p>Its goals are to ensure the stability of the international monetary system (exchange rates and international payments), to secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>The IMF has bailed out scores of countries over the years, including the UK in 1976 when the minority Labour government borrowed \u00c2\u00a32.3bn from the fund to stabilise the value of the pound; Iceland in 2008; and Greece in 2010, 2012 and 2015.\u00e2\u20ac\u2039</p>\n    <p>The number of bailouts of African countries has also increased in recent years as states became more vulnerable to commodity price crashes.<br></p>\n    <p>The IMF was conceived at a UN conference in Bretton Woods in the US in July 1944 to build a framework for economic cooperation to avoid the devaluations that contributed to the Great Depression of the 1930s.<br></p>\n    <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u2039Most funds for IMF loans are provided by members via payments based on their position in the world economy, although the IMF can also borrow.

That there would only be a modest rally in the peso was only to be expected: Argentina is on course for an almighty recession and that could spell curtains for Macri in next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election. The country faces a toxic mix of financial, economic and political uncertainty.</p> \n<p>As if to prove the truth of Tolstoy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dictum that all unhappy families are unhappy in their own way, the other emerging market in the firing line this week has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/13/how-serious-is-turkeys-lira-crisis-and-what-are-the-implications\">Turkey</a>. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an, the president, does not like high interest rates and will not let the central bank use them to combat high inflation or to defend the currency. Nor does he want to enlist the support of the IMF.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/30/argentina-raises-interest-rates-to-60-to-shore-up-peso\">Argentina raises interest rates to 60% to shore up peso</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In the light of what happened to Macri when he tried to do things by the book, Erdo\u00c4\u0178an probably now feels his unorthodox approach has been vindicated. But so far his strategy has amounted to getting a $15bn loan from Qatar and that will not be nearly enough. The next update on inflation due next Monday looks like being a pivotal event.</p> \n<p>For years, there have been worries about what would happen to the emerging markets once global financial market conditions started to tighten. Countries that had borrowed heavily in US dollars \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as many have \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were inevitably going to find life a lot tougher when US interest rates started to rise. Those risks have now started to crystalise.</p> \n<p>Argentina and Turkey are particularly vulnerable, which is why they have been picked off first. But they are not alone.

                "bodyText":"Timing is everything in financial markets. And Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s embattled president, Mauricio Macri, just got it spectacularly wrong. Late on Wednesday, it emerged that Macri had asked the International Monetary Fund to speed up the disbursement of its $50bn (\u00c2\u00a338bn) rescue package for South America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second biggest economy. Coming at the end of a day that had seen the peso fall heavily against the US dollar, the announcement was intended to shore up confidence. Currency dealers didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it that way. Working on the assumption that Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems must be even worse than they thought, they dumped the peso in even bigger quantities when the market in Buenos Aires opened for business. That triggered the next line of defence from the central bank: an increase in interest rates from 45% to 60% coupled with a commitment to hold borrowing costs at that punitive level until December. This didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really work either. That there would only be a modest rally in the peso was only to be expected: Argentina is on course for an almighty recession and that could spell curtains for Macri in next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election. The country faces a toxic mix of financial, economic and political uncertainty. As if to prove the truth of Tolstoy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dictum that all unhappy families are unhappy in their own way, the other emerging market in the firing line this week has been Turkey. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an, the president, does not like high interest rates and will not let the central bank use them to combat high inflation or to defend the currency. Nor does he want to enlist the support of the IMF. In the light of what happened to Macri when he tried to do things by the book, Erdo\u00c4\u0178an probably now feels his unorthodox approach has been vindicated. But so far his strategy has amounted to getting a $15bn loan from Qatar and that will not be nearly enough. The next update on inflation due next Monday looks like being a pivotal event. For years, there have been worries about what would happen to the emerging markets once global financial market conditions started to tighten. Countries that had borrowed heavily in US dollars \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as many have \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were inevitably going to find life a lot tougher when US interest rates started to rise. Those risks have now started to crystalise. Argentina and Turkey are particularly vulnerable, which is why they have been picked off first. But they are not alone. Other countries to keep an eye on over the coming weeks include South Africa, Ukraine, India and Indonesia. The IMF has already warned that debt in some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poorest countries has risen to risky levels. For those with long enough memories, August has seen a worrying pattern emerge. Investors take fright at the deterioration in key economic indicators in countries that have seen hefty capital inflows in the past, and decide to shift their money somewhere safer. The resulting fall in the currency makes imports dearer and adds to inflationary pressure. Companies that have borrowed in foreign currency see their debt burdens increase. Recession bites and the contagion spreads to other countries deemed to be vulnerable. This is not yet a full-blown crisis to match that of the late 1990s but there are enough warning signs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c trade tensions, high debt levels and a global economy losing momentum \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to suggest that is the way things are heading.",

                "bodyText":"Markets are in a cautious mood, dragged lower by President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to pull the US out of the WTO. There are also growing fears that Canada and the US will fail to strike a new trade deal as tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deadline for a NAFTA agreement draws closer. Investors were caught by surprise by the big news this morning that Whitbread is selling its Costa Coffee chain to Coca-Cola for \u00c2\u00a33.9bn. The market considers it to be a good deal for Whitbread, with shares in the group up 17%. In other UK news, the opening of Crossrail has been delayed by nearly a year; the ticket resale website Viagogo is to be taken to court by the competition watchdog; and Homebase is cutting 1,500 jobs after it agreed a rescue deal with its creditors. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. US markets have opened slightly lower, as investors on both sides of the Atlantic remain concerned about prospects for global trade. Dow Jones: -0.1% at 25,954 S&amp;P 500: -0.2% at 2,897 Nasdaq: -0.1% at 8,081 DIY chain Homebase is to cut 1,500 jobs as part of a rescue deal designed to save the company from looming bankruptcy and give it breathing space to recover from the disastrous stewardship of its previous owners. Creditors owed \u00c2\u00a31.2bn by the company voted in favour of a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), that will lead to the closure of 42 out of 241 branches, with landlords on a further 70 stores agreeing to accept rent cuts of up to 90%. Approval for the deal at a crunch meeting held on Friday means Homebase will stave off administration but will also mean 1,500 of its 11,000-strong workforce are likely to be made redundant. The company has already shed more than 300 jobs at its head office under the ownership of turnaround specialist Hilco, which bought Homebase for \u00c2\u00a31 in May from Australian firm Wesfarmers, which paid \u00c2\u00a3340m for the company just two years earlier. US markets are expected to fall when Wall Street opens, as the gloomy sentiment in Europe is echoed across the Atlantic: The delay to Crossrail is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153national embarrassment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd according to the Federation of Small Businesses. Mike Cherry, National Chairman of the trade body, said: This appalling situation will cause both financial and reputational damage. It is embarrassing for the UK to be seen as unable to deliver this major infrastructure project on time or on budget, with knock-on consequences for UK PLC. For Crossrail to announce such a huge delay only three months from the due date of a ten-year project is completely unacceptable. To blame \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomplexity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is puzzling on a project which everyone knew from the beginning was complex. Small businesses along the route of the Elizabeth Line, from Berkshire to Essex and across London, have long been preparing for a December roll-out of the first phase of this vital new transport infrastructure. The delay means nine months of extra construction costs, nine months of lost revenues and nine months of continued pressure on the jam-packed transport routes Crossrail was meant to ease. In the UK, the ticket resale website Viagogo is to be taken to court by the competition watchdog for alleged breaches of consumer law after refusing repeated requests to change its practices. The Competition and Markets Authority cited a range of practices it said were breaching the rights of consumers buying tickets for live events. Andrea Coscelli, the CMA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, said: Unfortunately, while other businesses have agreed to overhaul their sites to ensure they respect the law, Viagogo has not. We will now be pursuing action through the courts to ensure that they comply with the law. Read our full story here: Over in Washington, the clock is ticking as Canadian and US negotiators attempt to reach an agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), ahead of tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deadline, imposed by Donald Trump. Our full story on Trump and the WTO: Another factor weighing on investor sentiment is Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rejection of an offer from the EU to scrap tariffs on cars if the US reciprocated. The US President said the offer was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not good enough\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding that European \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consumer habits are to buy their cars, not to buy our cars.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spread Ex, said the snub was among a number of factors dragging markets lower this morning: The main issue, as is so often the case, seems to be Donald Trump, namely the fact the sabre-rattling President rejected an offer from the European Union to eliminate auto tariffs if the US did the same, claiming the deal was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnot good enough\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. There had been some hopes the US signing a trade deal with Mexico earlier in the week meant things were perhaps moving in the right direction. However, with reports that Trump is looking to impose additional tariffs on China, his threat to pull the US out of the WTO and the tense, terse situation with both the EU and Canada, the markets are back to fretting about his next move. President Trump has said he would pull out of the World Trade Organization if it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give the US a better deal. He made the comments in an Oval office interview with Bloomberg: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shape up, I would withdraw from the WTO. Trump added the agreement establishing the body \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was the single worst trade deal ever made.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The comments have made investors jittery, adding to the (already major) uncertainty surrounding global trade. Here are the latest scores across equity markets in Europe: FTSE 100: -0.5% at 7,480 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -1.1% at 12,361 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -1.3% at 5,408 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.7% at 20,361 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.9% at 9,383 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.7% at 383 Away from Costa Coffee, there are plenty of other developments this morning. The opening of the \u00c2\u00a315bn Crossrail line across London has been delayed by nearly a year as more time is needed to finish the infrastructure and carry out safety testing. Services on what is to be known as the Elizabeth line were due to start running in December this year, but the central section between Paddington and Abbey Wood will not be opened until autumn 2019. The Crossrail chief executive, Simon Wright, said: The Elizabeth line is one of the most complex and challenging infrastructure projects ever undertaken in the UK and is now in its final stages. We have made huge progress with the delivery of this incredible project but we need further time to complete the testing of the new railway. We are working around the clock with our supply chain and Transport for London to complete and commission the Elizabeth line. Read our full story here: Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, spells out why investors think Whitbread has done a very good deal with Coca-Cola: Analysts had been valuing Costa at around 12 times EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) or \u00c2\u00a315.50 per share. The \u00c2\u00a33.9 billion sale price equates to \u00c2\u00a321.25 a share and that 575p-per-share uplift explains why the shares are up so much, especially as Whitbread clearly intends to return a chunk of the cash proceeds directly to shareholders. Whitbread shares are currently up 16% at \u00c2\u00a346.74. Not everyone is madly impressed by the \u00c2\u00a33.9bn Costa Coffee/Coca-Cola deal. Oliver Sherman, analyst for investment firm Northern Trust Capital Markets, says investors this morning have focused on the cash windfall from the deal, rather than the long-term challenges facing the remaining Whitbread business. As changes of direction go, the announcement by Whitbread chief executive Allison Brittain that the company is selling Costa to Coca-Cola for \u00c2\u00a33.9bn, rather than plan announced in April to spin it off and list it as a publicly traded company is one deserving of kudos. Whitbread has generated quite the return on the \u00c2\u00a319m paid over 20 years ago. Whitbread\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price jumped in early trading as shareholders focused on the cash windfall rather than the long-term challenges ahead for Premier Inns and its related restaurants businesses. Alison Brittain, Whitbread chief executive, has been hosting a call with City analysts. When asked by one analyst why the company hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given a trading update, alongside the deal announcement, she said she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been focused on a \u00c2\u00a33.9bn deal that was only signed at 6.52am this morning. Fair point. Some consumers are wondering what new drinks will be on offer when Coca-Cola takes ownership of Costa Coffee: The Costa Coffee brand will give Coca-Cola access to one of the few segments of the drinks market where it does not have a global brand. It also allows it to diversify away from its main business of sugary fizzy drinks, at a time when governments say they are committed to tackling rising global obesity. In Coca-Cola\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own words: For Coca-Cola, the expected acquisition adds a scalable coffee platform with critical know-how and expertise in a fast-growing, on-trend category. Costa ranks as the leading coffee company in the United Kingdom and has a growing footprint in China, among other markets. Costa has a solid presence with Costa Express, which offers barista-quality coffee in a variety of on-the-go locations, including gas stations, movie theaters and travel hubs. Costa, in various formats, has the potential for further expansion with customers across the Coca-Cola system. The acquisition will expand the existing Coca-Cola coffee lineup by adding another leading brand and platform. The portfolio already includes the market-leading Georgia brand in Japan, plus coffee products in many other countries. Costa also provides Coca-Cola with strong expertise across the coffee supply chain, including sourcing, vending and distribution. This will be a complement to existing capabilities within the Coca-Cola system. Whitbread\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are at the highest level since late 2015, as investors digest the news that the group is selling its Costa Coffee chain to Coca-Cola for \u00c2\u00a33.9bn. Whitbread has pledged this morning that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant majority\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the net proceeds from the sale of Costa will be returned to shareholders. But investors might have mixed feelings about the deal, according to Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: This is a bitter sweet moment for Whitbread investors. On the one hand \u00c2\u00a33.9 billion is an undeniably rich valuation and likely far better than Costa could achieve as an independently listed company, valuing its earnings higher than those of the mighty Starbucks. On the other, Costa has long been the jewel in Whitbread\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crown and some will be sad to see it go at any price, especially given the growth potential in China and elsewhere. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see how things could have turned out differently given the price on offer though, and Coca-Cola are one of the few companies in the world that could justify the valuation. Its global reach should turbo-charge growth in the years to come, and hot drinks are one of the few areas of the wider beverages sector where the soft drinks giant doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a killer brand. Costa will get lots of care and attention. Whitbread is the runaway leader of the FTSE 100, with shares jumping 18% in early trading to \u00c2\u00a347.55. Investors clearly think the group has got a deal, selling its Costa Coffee chain to Coca-Cola for \u00c2\u00a33.9bn (having bought it for \u00c2\u00a319m in 1995. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK: It is with some surprise that investors are digesting today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement from Coca Cola that they have agreed a deal to buy the coffee chain for $5.1bn. It would appear that the US business, like a lot of its peers, is looking to diversify away from its core business of sugary drinks, an area that has been increasingly attracting government ire due to a rising global obesity problem. Investors certainly appear to like the deal, not surprising given the pledge that most of the proceeds look set to be returned to shareholders, with the shares rising strongly on the open hitting their highest levels since December 2015. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at markets.com, says that Alison Brittain has acted faster than expected, after announcing plans in April to demerge Costa Coffee from the rest of the Whitbread group in response to investor pressure. He says it looks like a good deal for Whitbread: Clearly Coca-Cola sniffed an opportunity to gain an attractive brand with a fast-growing global presence. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty good return too on the \u00c2\u00a319m Whitbread paid for the coffee chain over 20 years ago. From the Coca-Cola perspective, initial thoughts are that it marks a substantial investment in branded coffee and places it squarely against Nestle and Starbucks. Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but feel Coca-Cola thinks this is the ideal way into a frothy market that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s maybe missed out on so far. The sale also comes at a very tough time for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high streets, and Costa has not been entirely spared, with like-for-like (LFL) sales down in the first quarter. Wilson adds: Back to the growth story at Costa, the concern is that sales growth is stalling. Costa is exposed to areas like the high street where lower footfall translates into fewer cups of coffee being sold. First quarter Costa UK sales growth of 5.2% was driven by new stores and Express machines \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we note particularly strong growth in Express of 9.6% in the quarter. But LFL declined by 2%, which management put down to the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgeneral retail market conditions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. We have been seeing and warning about declining LFL at Costa for some time and this 2% drop was a concern about how the brand is performing on the high street. Lower footfall is one thing, but we continue to see Costa facing tougher competition from artisan coffee retailers who are taking market share. Alison Brittain, Whitbread\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, has been speaking to the BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme. She said that Coca-Cola want to buy Costa because it currently has no coffee in its range. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ready to drink, cold brew coffees,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could be coming our way, she suggests. Brittain added: They want the coffee product, they have no coffee in their range. You could see Costa absolutely everywhere, in vending machines, hotels, restaurants, pubs, cafes - in all the places you see Coke today. In the last few years we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been building the brand of Costa and making it international, and so for the first time really now, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had an organisation like Coca-Cola who are really interested in the Costa business. The price they have offered us is significantly higher than the company could achieve through a de-merger or its own listing. Whitbread bought Costa in 1995 for \u00c2\u00a319m when it had only 39 shops. It is now one of the best known names on UK high streets, and the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest coffee chain after Starbucks. Costa now has almost 4,000 stores in 32 countries, including 2,400 in the UK. It also has more than 8,000 Costa Express machines in eight countries. The sale follows pressure from activist investors who argued Whitbread should be split into distinct businesses, to allow it to better focus on its Premier Inn chain of hotels and restaurant brands such as Brewers Fayre and Beefeater. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Major breaking news this morning as Whitbread announces it is selling its Costa Coffee chain to Coca Cola for \u00c2\u00a33.9bn. Alison Brittain, Whitbread chief executive, said the deal was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for shareholders as the price received from Coca-Cola was far higher than if it had decided to demerge the business instead. She added: Whitbread will also reduce debt and make a contribution to its pension fund, which will provide additional headroom for the expansion of Premier Inn. James Quincey, Coca-Cola president and chief executive said: Costa gives Coca-Cola new capabilities and expertise in coffee, and our system can create opportunities to grow the Costa brand worldwide. Hot beverages is one of the few remaining segments of the total beverage landscape where Coca-Cola does not have a global brand. Costa gives us access to this market through a strong coffee platform.
