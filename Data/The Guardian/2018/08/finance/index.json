What did Apple have to offer?</p> <p>With hindsight, the answer is obvious. The iPod looked cool: it had a sleek aluminium shell half the size of its competitors, and a physical scroll wheel that could zoom through the trademark \u00e2\u20ac\u01531,000 songs in your pocket\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>By 2003 Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advertising agency, Chiat/Day, had come up with silhouette adverts to promote the iPod. The ads were almost too successful, turning the iPod\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s white earphones into such a marker of desirability that the Metropolitan police blamed them for a 26% rise in street robberies in 2005.</p> <p>The iPod revolutionised Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fortunes, kicking off a five-fold increase in its share price over the following five years, and providing a gateway drug for winning round Windows users to its Mac ecosystem. But it also changed the company on a fundamental level, turning it from a computer manufacturer into a consumer electronics designer.</p> <p>In January 2007, the company completed this transformation, announcing that it was changing its name from Apple Computer to Apple Inc.

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meteoric rise: Goodnight. GW Apple has beaten several tech rivals for the crown of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first trillion dollar company. At one stage it looked like Amazon could get their first, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently \u00e2\u20ac\u0153only\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd worth around $880bn. Alphabet, Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, is close behind with a market capitalisation of around $850bn. Facebook, though, dropped firmly out of the running after it slashed profitability forecasts last week. One important aspect about Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revival since its 1990s slump is that it started perfecting, rather than creating, new product types. Apple wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t first with a smartphone or a digital music player, but it created compelling devices that trumped what had gone before. Our tech writer Alex Hern explains: MP3 players already existed, such as Malda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nomad Jukebox, and they were technically better, with larger hard drives, replaceable batteries, and compatibility with both Windows and Mac (the iPod would take another year to come to Windows). What did Apple have to offer? With hindsight, the answer is obvious. The iPod looked cool: it had a sleek aluminium shell half the size of its competitors, and a physical scroll wheel that could zoom through the trademark \u00e2\u20ac\u01531,000 songs in your pocket\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. By 2003 Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advertising agency, Chiat/Day, had come up with silhouette adverts to promote the iPod. The ads were almost too successful, turning the iPod\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s white earphones into such a marker of desirability that the Metropolitan police blamed them for a 26% rise in street robberies in 2005. The iPod revolutionised Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fortunes, kicking off a five-fold increase in its share price over the following five years, and providing a gateway drug for winning round Windows users to its Mac ecosystem. But it also changed the company on a fundamental level, turning it from a computer manufacturer into a consumer electronics designer. In January 2007, the company completed this transformation, announcing that it was changing its name from Apple Computer to Apple Inc. That same day, it also announced something else: the iPhone. More here: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impressive track record over the years: Apple has seen off plenty of critics on its march towards a trillion dollars, particularly in the 1990s when it was losing the Desktop PC battle to cheaper Windows machines. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shira Ovide has some examples: Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise to become America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most valuable publicly quoted firm began more than 40 years ago, when Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak began a company that would help kickstart and drive the computer revolution. Today, the firm behind the Macintosh, the iMac, the iPhone and the App Store is now worth more than Exxon Mobil, Procter &amp; Gamble (PG.N) and AT&amp;T put together. Reuters points out how the return of the late Steve Jobs two decades ago was crucial: . One of three founders, Jobs was driven out of Apple in the mid-1980s, only to return a decade later and rescue the computer company from near bankruptcy. He launched the iPhone in 2007, dropping \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Computer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name and super-charging the cellphone industry, catching Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O), Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Nokia off guard. That put Apple on a path to overtake Exxon Mobil in 2011 as the largest U.S. company by market value. The Silicon Valley stalwart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock has surged more than 50,000 percent since its 1980 initial public offering, dwarfing the S&amp;P 500\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approximately 2,000-percent increase during the same almost four decades. During that time, Apple evolved from selling Mac personal computers to becoming an architect of the mobile revolution with a cult-like following. More here. Newsflash: Apple has become the first US listed company to be worth one trillion dollars. The technology giant hit a $1 trillion market cap as its shares rallied following strong earnings results earlier this week. Apple shares jumped 3% to hit a session high of $207.05 , enough to reach the magic $1trn figure. More to follow.... Richard Flax, Chief Investment Officer at Moneyfarm, thinks today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise is hard to justify: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fact the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted in favour of a hike itself is notable. At the last meeting in June, the MPC voted by 6-3 to keep rates where they are. If anything, since then the case for rate hikes has gotten weaker not stronger. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t require too much cynicism to see the unanimous vote as some sort of message. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank and its governor are in an unenviable position - with a combination of low interest rates, low unemployment / low wage growth, sluggish economic growth, declining inflation and massive policy uncertainty around Brexit. They clearly want to normalise interest rate policy if they can - but the data hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t made it easy to justify.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reuters agrees... Higher interest rates will eat into the profits of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s buy-to-let lenders. Paul Haywood-Schiefer of accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise is a blow to the sector: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For many people who were getting no return on their capital due to long term low interest rates and decided to invest in buy to let properties this will be another blow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They wanted to get better returns and for many it was also part of their retirement plans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One solution is to push up rents, of course. And one controversial buy-to-let landlord has swiftly passed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise onto new tenants. Fergus Wilson, who owns hundreds of properties across Ashford and Maidstone in Kent, has announced: Following the interest rate rise I have increased rents in all our properties by \u00c2\u00a350 per month (fifty pounds). It is merely passing onto the tenant the additional mortgage charge. This increase starts immediately. I think this will only apply to new tenants, or when existing tenancies come up for renewal. Wilson was heavily criticised by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equality watchdog last year, as we reported: The buy-to-let mogul Fergus Wilson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ban on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coloured\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tenants because they allegedly left curry smells in his properties has been overturned in a court victory for the Equality and Human Rights Commission. At Maidstone county court, the judge, Richard Polden, granted an injunction against the landlord. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This policy clearly amounts to discrimination,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Polden said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I find the policy is unlawful. Such a policy has no place in our society.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ed Hall, director at law firm Gowling WLG, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise could hurt the economy, if it spooks consumers and businesses: Given that a quarter point rise is perceived to have a limited long-term impact on most business, the move would seem to make sense in terms of longer term strategy. However, in a period of increasing political and economic uncertainty, it can be argued that this move could damage confidence in what could be perceived as an already fragile economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Charles Hepworth, investment director at GAM, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153punchy move\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, given the uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU: Growth in the economy could hardly be described as above trend so members may have realised that this could be the last chance to move ahead before reaching the final Brexit end state. In any case the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response in a few months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time could look very different should the Brexit cliff edge slip nearer despite them saying more hikes will be needed. The currency markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t totally buying the hawkish message otherwise the pound would be rising, which it most certainly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Indeed. As you can see, the pound has dropped to its lowest level since 20th July today - not the move you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect after a rate hike. UK interest rates won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise again until at least March 2019, predicts Dean Turner, UK Economist at UBS Wealth Management. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to see further moves from the Bank ahead of Britain leaving the EU. Monetary policy is unlikely to be the key driver for sterling in the markets in the short term, as the spotlight returns to the Brexit saga. The real surprise is that all nine Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers voted to raise interest rates today. Before noon, many experts were predicting an 8-1 split, or even 7-2, with the most dovish MPC members pushing to keep rates on hold. Our Larry Elliott suggests the data doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t support such unanimity: Threadneedle Street has been overestimating wage inflation for years, and the former MPC member and labour market expert David Blanchflower says it is still doing so [something Carney rejected earlier] Recent official data has shown growth in total pay falling not rising. The economy, despite bouncing back in the second quarter, is far from booming. Retail sales were weak in June, the housing market is dead and inflation is coming back toward its 2% target more quickly than the Bank expected. In such circumstances, it is strange, even a little troubling, that not one MPC member opposed a rate hike. The inflation report makes it sound as if higher interest rates are a no-brainer. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a lot riskier than the Bank appears to think. Jon Ostler, UK CEO at price comparison site Finder.com, says savers need to be proactive to benefit from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s particularly good news for savers, who have suffered ultra-low interest rates for the past decade. They can expect a rise to their savings, albeit a small one. Now is a good time to consider switching your banking products, as banks will be reviewing their rates. Make sure you keep an eye on which banks are offering the best interest rates as not all of their products will increase by the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 25 basis points. Mortgage holders, and other borrowers, face a hit, through, he adds: For example, those paying off the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s average mortgage debt with a variable rate mortgage face paying an extra \u00c2\u00a317-\u00c2\u00a318 per month, which adds up to an extra \u00c2\u00a3200 per year or more than \u00c2\u00a36,000 over the life of a 30-year loan term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Time for a quick recap. The Bank of England has raised UK interest rates for only the second time since the financial crisis, despite concerns that Brexit could hurt the economy. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously to raise borrowing costs to 0.75%, from 0.5%, arguing that a modest increase is needed to keep inflation on target. Governor Mark Carney has defended the move. He told reporters that the economy is in a much healthier place than August 2016, when the BoE cut rates from 0.5% to 0.25%. Carney argued that: UK households were well-prepared for the rise, and that the poorest families would suffer most if the Bank allowed inflation to spike. The Bank was ready for all possibly Brexit outcomes, including Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal Monetary policy needed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153walk, not run\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to keep inflation on target and the economy growing. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a hint that future rate rises will be modest. Banks might not pass the entire increase onto savers The Bank might actually CUT rates, if Brexit negotiations go badly. The move has received a mixed reception, with business leaders criticising it and debt charities fearing that poor families will be dragged into financial difficulties. There is relief in the City that the Bank didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back away from pushing the button, having given plenty of hints that rates would rise today. But... Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious words have hit sterling; the pound is still in the red against the dollar, at $1.3050. Balraj Sroya, Sales Trader at Foenix Partners, explains why: Today the Bank of England defied Brexit uncertainty and brought music to the ears of Sterling bulls as the MPC voted unanimously to increase interest rates to 0.75%. Unfortunately, Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally higher was halted by the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd stating that the monetary policy needs to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153walk, not run, to stand still\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as the interest rates\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 natural level rises gradually. And finally, an important but technical question from the Financial Times. Q: does the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low estimate of the equilibrium level of interest rates (R*) means that quantitative easing is becoming a standard tool of economy policy, rather than just for emergencies? [explainer: if R* is really between zero and 1% today, as the Bank believes, rates might never get high enough to allow the Bank to start selling off the \u00c2\u00a3435bn of bonds it bought through QE during the crisis to stimulate the economy]. Mark Carney says this is a good question, to which he gives a long answer. The upshot is that Bank still expects to start unwinding QE when rates have risen to 1.5%. So if R* rises towards 2-3%, then this plan would still hold. Upshot: the MPC does not expect to keep holding its QE assets on its balance sheet indefinitely. Back on Brexit, and Mark Carney is defending the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach over the last two years. After the referendum, the BoE decided to take the hit in higher inflation (by cutting rates) rather than pushing unemployment up (by raising rates to strengthen the pound), he says. Q: But wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it be better to have waited a few months until we know how Brexit will pan out? No, governor Carney replies. We need a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmodest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 adjustment to policy now because wages are rising faster than inflation. He then explains that rates could rise, stay on hold, or even be cut depending how UK-EU negotiations play out. There are a wide range of Brexit outcomes, but in many of them interest rates will be at least as high as they are today. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to keep our powder dry for that. There are certain circumstances where it would be appropriate to either keep rates the same or lower them. If that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the case, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what the MPC will do. It would be a mistake to wait, wait, wait until you have perfect certainty, because you never know when that point will arise, he concludes. Q: What do you say to business groups who think this rate rise is a mistake? We have a good sense of the challenges faced by British businesses, Carney replies. The Bank knows that this has been the shallowest investment recovery in decades. But...the overwhelming issue for businesses is the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. They should be confident that we will focus on our responsibilities, keeping inflation on target while ensuring the economy is prepared for whatever the outcome is. Christopher Vecchio of DailyFX says Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious guidance on future rate rises is hitting the pound. On trade wars, Carney says the tariffs imposed by the US, China and Europe on each others imports are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of the reasons that global growth is little weaker.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Bank doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see a material impact on the UK economy, yet, but it would be hurt by a slump in global confidence and investment. Mark Carney is now giving a long explanation about the equilibrium interest rate in the UK (known as R*). This is the level at which interest rates should be set to ensure the economy stays at an even keel. The Bank has estimated today that R* is zero to 1 percent, more than 2 percentage points below its pre-financial crisis level. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because UK productivity, fiscal headwinds and economic uncertainty are all pulling R* down. If they improve, R* could move closer to the 2-3% range, Carney explains. Danny Blanchflower has hit back at Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jibe, pointing out that UK wage growth has slowed recently - and is nowhere near 3% per year today. Our economics editor Larry Elliott goes next. Q: The Bank thinks the natural rate of unemployment is 4.25% (slightly above the current rate of 4.2%), which is why you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve raised interest rates. But some experts disagree; former MPC member professor Danny Blanchflower thinks it could be 3%. Why is he wrong, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right? Where do I begin, mutters Mark Carney (somewhat recklessly), before adding that he has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great respect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Prof B, but his time on the MPC has passed. Carney then explains that policymakers need to reorientate to new reality. He points out that labour cost growth is rising, and productivity growth remains disappointing, thus the UK needs higher borrowing costs to keep inflation on target. [historical note: Danny Blanchflower called, in vain, for UK interest rate cuts before the financial crisis struck, when the rest of the MPC was more worried about inflation] Q: Will this rate rise be passed onto savers, and what will the Bank do to help on this? Mark Carney says that savers have suffered over the course of the last decade from the absolutely necessary low interest rates. But he then suggests that banks might not pass today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise on in full. H explains that when rates hit record lows after the crisis, the spread between bank lending and borrowing rates were compressed. (That ate into bank profitability, so they will want to repair that by raising borrowing costs more than saving rates). As rates move up, one should expect more of them to be passed along, Carney adds. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden weighs in, saying: Historically you never get full pass-though of interest rate changes. Q: Surely poorest households are going to suffer from this rate rise? Mark Carney rebuts this, arguing that the Bank has a responsibility to keep inflation under control. The households that are most affected by high or volatile inflation, and most likely to be out of work, unfortunately, are poorer households. The best thing we can do is keep inflation sustainably on target, and keep the economy on track, he adds. Ouch! Sterling has just dropped against the US dollar, and is now down a whole cent at $1.303. The selloff began as Mark Carney explains that monetary policy needs to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153walk not run to stand still\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as the natural level of interest rates slowly rises. That looks like a hint that borrowing costs will not rise sharply in the next couple of years. Onto questions: Q: Are households ready for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise, particularly the poorest? Governor Carney says the Bank of England has been saying for a while that interest rates will go up, at a modest rate. That \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcforward guidance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was meant to give households and businesses clarity. And it worked, Carney says, with three-quarters of households expecting interest rate to go up over the next year. The important thing to recognise is that UK households have worked hard over the last decade to get into a better financial position, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve paid down debt and put themselves in a better position to service their debts. It would take another 100 basis point increase (to 1.75%) to bring the UK debt servicing burden back to the historic average. There is a lot more capacity for UK households to service their debts, Carney concludes. He also cited new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmortgage affordability\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tests that are meant to prevent reckless borrowing. Mark Carney insists that the Bank of England is well prepared for a wide range of Brexit outcomes. The banking system has enough money to keep lending through a cliff-edge Brexit, however unlikely that will be, the governor says. We are working with the Treasury and the European Central Bank to address risks that the banks can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t solve themselves, he adds. Onto Brexit. Mark Carney says that talks between the UK and the EU are at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153critical period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Households have been resilient but not indifferent to Brexit uncertainty, he adds, but there are signs that business confidence is softening again. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts are based on a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrelatively smooth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd transition period, the governor points out (implying it could take action if we end up with a No-Deal Brexit). Carney signals that further interest rate rises will be needed. If interest rates stay at 0.75%, then inflation will be over the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target over the next three years, he explains. Mark Carney says UK exporters are in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a sweet spot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with sterling down 17% compared to its pre-Brexit levels. He adds that the UK labour market is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with signs that earnings growth will accelerate later this year. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is giving a press conference now. Carney begins by referencing a famous quote from Harold Wilson, saying: If a week is a long time in politics, then two years is an eternity in monetary policy. He reminds us that the Bank cut borrowing costs to a record low of 0.25%, after the Brexit vote. Back in 2016, there was substantial spare capacity in the economy, business confidence was its lowest since the financial crisis, and inflation was due to overshoot its target \u00e2\u20ac\u0153entirely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd due to Brexit fears which had driven the pound down. Now, though, the economy is strong enough to justify an interest rate rise to 0.75%. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, says Mark Carney and colleagues have taken a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bold move\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by raising borrowing costs today. By early 2019, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll know if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right, he adds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank has so clearly telegraphed this rate rise that markets would have been shocked had rates been left on hold. The unanimity of the decision probably reflects the view that the UK is, quite simply, running out of spare capacity. But sub-trend growth and a cloudy outlook hardly make a compelling case for a higher UK rates. In six months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time this decision will look either prescient or premature. Either way it is bold move.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Oof! Suren Thiru, Head of Economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), says the Bank of England was wrong to raise interest rates today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decision to raise interest rates, while expected, looks ill-judged against a backdrop of a sluggish economy. While a quarter point rise may have a limited long-term financial impact on most businesses, it risks undermining confidence at a time of significant political and economic uncertainty. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The increase reinforces a concerning aspect of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent approach to monetary policy, which appears to be overly focused on reinforcing an idealised direction for rates, rather than on economic reality \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an approach that unnecessarily risks UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth prospects. The central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assumption that the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speed limit has slowed is unduly pessimistic, as sustained action to fix the fundamentals at home, from closing the skills gap to greater infrastructure investment, would materially help lift the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth potential. Thiru hopes the Bank won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raise borrowing costs again anytime soon: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The MPC must carefully consider what happens next. The most preferential option would be for a sustained period of monetary stability amid the current economic and political uncertainty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Simon Underwood, business recovery partner at accountancy firm, Menzies LLP, fears that this rate rise will hurt businesses - especially those reliant on consumer spending. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The MPC may have been swayed by the summer heatwave and England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success in the World Cup, which have had a positive impact on consumer behaviour, boosting retail sales temporarily. However, it is unlikely this positive sentiment will be maintained and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to increase rates will impact consumer spending ahead of the critical final quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For businesses serving consumers in the retail and hospitality &amp; leisure sectors, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision will be very unwelcome news and we should expect more turmoil on the high street in the short to medium term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd My colleague Richard Partington reports from the Bank of England: The Bank of England has raised interest rates above the emergency level introduced straight after the financial crisis, despite mounting fears over Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal. Signalling the gradual return of higher borrowing costs, Threadneedle Street raised interest rates to 0.75% from 0.5% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the level they were dropped to in March 2009 as the economy lurched through the last recession. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee judged the economy could withstand higher interest rates, which it believes are required to curb persistently high inflation above its 2% target set by the government. An extra 0.25% interest will add \u00c2\u00a312 a month to a \u00c2\u00a3100,000 repayment mortgage and \u00c2\u00a325 on a \u00c2\u00a3200,000 loan. However, nearly 70% of homebuyers now have fixed rate mortgages so will be unaffected. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our Q&amp;A on how higher UK interest rates will affect you: Although today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise is modest, it will hurt families who are already forced to borrow to pay for the essentials. Phil Andrew, chief executive at StepChange Debt Charity, says politicians need to provide more help to theses households: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whilst a rise in interest rates might be right for the wider economy, from a consumer debt perspective many households are walking a precarious budget tightrope, as their incomes don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stretch to cover the basics each month. These are the households that a rate rise will affect most. Policymakers mustn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lose sight of what a rate rise means for real people on a tight budget. The fact that the wider economy can cope doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always mean individual households can. Government and policymakers need to take parallel steps to ensure support is there for those who are negatively affected, especially if more rate rises are coming.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I mentioned earlier this morning that Mark Carney was known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for failing to stick to his promises. Calum Bennie, savings specialist at Scottish Friendly, thinks the governor has turned over a new leaf by raising rates today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise means that Mark Carney has probably shaken off his tag of being the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for good. While the decision indicates the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is picking up steam, it also means higher borrowing costs, so households must be even more prudent to absorb the additional cost. The move is good news for savers but still cash account rates are unlikely to beat inflation, so stocks and shares Isas remain better for those looking to grow their savings long-term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much reaction in the financial markets to the rate hike - which figures, as it was widely expected. The pound has clawed back some of its losses, but is still slightly lower against the US dollar today at $1.31. Shares are still being pummelled by those trade war fears, leaving the FTSE 100 down 93 points or 1.2%. The Bank of England has hinted that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in no rush to raise interest rates again in the coming months. It say that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153any future increases in Bank Rate are likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Bank of England also has also warned that Brexit could damage the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery: The MPC continues to recognise that the economic outlook could be influenced significantly by the response of households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal. The Bank of England says it is raising interest rates because the economy has recovered from its slowdown during last snowy winter. The minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting says: Recent data appear to confirm that the dip in output in the first quarter was temporary, with momentum recovering in the second quarter. The labour market has continued to tighten and unit labour cost growth has firmed. The MPC continues to judge that the UK economy currently has a very limited degree of slack. Unemployment is low and is projected to fall a little further. The BoE also points out that prices are rising faster than its target (2%), so it is raising borrowing costs to squeeze inflation. CPI inflation was 2.4% in June, pushed above the 2% target by external cost pressures resulting from the effects of sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s past depreciation and higher energy prices. The contribution of external pressures is projected to ease over the forecast period while the contribution of domestic cost pressures is expected to rise. Every member of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nine-strong monetary policy committee voted to raise interest rates. NEWSFLASH: The Bank of England has voted to raise UK interest rates to their highest level in almost a decade. The BoE is raising Bank rate to 0.75%, from 0.5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level since March 2009, and only the second rise since the financial crisis struck a decade ago. More to follow! An interest rate rise would obviously be a blow to borrowers, as it would push up the cost of repaying debts. This chart from Resolution Foundation shows how a rise to 0.75% would force a small number of mortgage owners to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctake action\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in some way: Back in June, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MPC was split six-three -- with a trio of policymakers voting to raise interest rates. Danielle Haralambous, UK Analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts that the majority will vote to hike today, but it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a 9:0 win for the hawks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect the MPC to raise the policy rate to 0.75% today, although it is unlikely to be a unanimous vote. Some of the economic data has softened in recent months, notably core inflation and wage growth, which may prevent some MPC members from changing their vote in favour of higher interest rates. Our economics correspondent, Richard Partington, explains why the Bank of England will (probably) raise borrowing costs today: Inflation has remained stubbornly above the 2% target set for the Bank by the government, after having risen sharply straight after the EU referendum result. Some rate setters on the MPC, including the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Andy Haldane, also believe wage growth is just around the corner for workers, amid the lowest levels of unemployment since the mid 1970s, a factor that could help boost workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bargaining power for higher pay. The summer heatwave, royal wedding and England progressing to the semi-final of the World Cup helped boost the economy, triggering stronger retail sales in April and May before they unexpectedly fell back in June. The Office for National Statistics found that the warmer weather helped the economy rebound from a slowdown earlier this year after heavy snowfall from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beast from the east\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More here: Tension is rising in the City, with around 30 minutes to wait until the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision. Traders broadly expect borrowing costs to rise at noon today, to a nine-year high of 0.75%. But this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t giving the pound any love. Sterling is still bobbing at a two-week low against the dollar, with some investors speculating that the Bank could dampen expectations of further interest rate rises any time soon. John Goldie, FX Strategist at Argentex, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank of England are firmly expected to raise rates this lunch time, only the second hike since 2007. However, most commentators are expecting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dovish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hike with perhaps some dissenters within the committee (one or two may vote to keep rates on hold still) and/or the statements to play down further hiking expectations in the near term. Plus, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discount the possibility that the Bank sits on its hands again. But that would badly hurt its credibility, given its recent guidance that a rate rise is close. Sue Kershaw, managing director of major project advisory at KPMG, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders benefitted from the hot summer, but warns that Brexit could derail the recovery seen last month. She writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Seeing housebuilding come back to good health is hugely positive. As the longstanding driver of activity, the weakening demand we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d seen in recent months did cause some concern and raised questions as to whether residential construction had peaked and was heading for a steady decline. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But supply chain and cost pressures still remain a cause for concern. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing input costs continue to creep up and the outcome of Brexit negotiations is still far from clear. Those with infrastructure arms will also be concerned about the sluggish-looking civil engineering market, traditionally quite a reliable source of activity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Phil Harris, Director at BLP Insurance, fears that the collapse of the merger between shopping centre groups Hammerson and Intu could hurt construction. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153July was another strong month for commercial activity but the sector remains vulnerable to volatility. British retailers continue to close shops at a pace and the full impact of shopping centre developer, Hammerson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failed takeover of rival Intu may have yet to be fully felt. With many predicting the closure of more Hammerson sites, growth in July may prove a false dawn.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brendan Sharkey, head of construction and real estate at accountancy firm MHA MacIntyre Hudson, points out that Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock collapse in January has caused less damage than feared. However, a hard Brexit might not be shaken off as easily: Construction has been relatively slow to wake up to the dangers posed by Brexit. Given the industry doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t depend on exports, the potential pitfalls of a no-deal Brexit have perhaps been easier to overlook. Yet construction does depend on the import of raw materials, and crucially on the free movement of labour. Over the next few months we will see more focus on contingency planning and demand for additional information and support from the government. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The consequences of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse were over-hyped but only a very foolhardy captain of industry can assume the same will be true about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: China has hit back at America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threats to impose steep tariffs on its goods (see earlier post). Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commerce ministry has told reporters it is fully prepared to fight back, if America delivers on Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose 25% tariffs. This is driving financial markets deeper into the red. The FTSE 100 is now down 80 points, with mining stocks leading the selloff. Trivia corner: UK interest rate have never been pegged at 0.75%, since the Bank of England was established in 1694. Back in July 2007, the BoE raised interest rates to 5.75% just as the credit crunch began. It was began cutting as the financial crisis kicked in, including a monster Bank Rate cut from 4.5% to 3% in November 2008. In March 2009 it halved borrowing costs to 0.5%, where they remained until the Brexit vote prompted a cut to 0.25%, which was reversed in November 2017. The pick-up in building activity in July will reassure the Bank of England, as it suggest the construction sector could handle higher borrowing costs. However, yesterday we heard that manufacturing growth slowed a little last month, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mixed picture. The opposition Labour party is concerned that consumers will be hurt by higher borrowing costs. John McDonnell MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chancellor, has warned that higher interest rates will push more people into debt: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With wages still below 2010 levels and the gap between people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s income and outgoings at record levels, the concern must be that a pattern of interest rate rises will push more families into higher levels of debt. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government needs to end its counterproductive austerity programme and raise people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incomes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey of purchasing managers at UK construction firms: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders achieved an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153impressive turnaround\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in July, says Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit. He sees several signs that the construction sector has strengthened this summer: New business volumes expanded at the strongest rate since May 2017, while workforce numbers increased to the greatest extent for just over two- and-a-half years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153House building was the bright spot for construction growth in July, alongside a stronger upturn in commercial development projects. Residential activity and commercial work both increased at the sharpest pace since December 2015, which contrasted with another subdued month for civil engineering. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector has recorded its fastest growth in 14 months. Data firm Markit reports that builders picked up pace in July, led by a surge in housebuilding. This pushed Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI, which measures growth in the sector, up to 55.8 from 53.1. Anything over 50 shows growth, and this is the highest reading since May 2017. Housebuilders reported the strongest pick-up in growth since the end of 2015. More to follow.... Stock markets around the globe are sliding today, thanks to the threat of a US-China trade war. Investors have been spooked by the news that the Trump administration is considering a 25% tariff on $200bn of Chinese imports - previously it had been planning a 10% levy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest shot in an increasingly bitter and protracted trade spat between Washington and Beijing. CNN explains: The United States has already slapped 25% tariffs on Chinese goods worth $34 billion to punish Beijing for what it says are its unfair trade practices, such as forcing American companies to hand over valuable technology. China immediately responded with equal measures. In the latest step, President Donald Trump has directed US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to consider increasing the proposed tariff level on fruit and vegetables, handbags, refrigerators, and more. The trade office has extended its previous deadline of Aug. 30 to allow the public more time to comment on the new plan. Those comments are now due on September 5. In London the FTSE 100 has shed 32 points, or 0.4%, to 7620, its lowest level in over two weeks. There are heavier falls across Europe, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX shedding 1.3%. Over in Asia, the Chinese markets have tumbled by around 2%. Other markets also in the red as traders fear an escalating trade dispute will hurt growth and exports across the region. Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale says the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision is the main event of the day: Bloomberg polled 58 forecasts...10 expect no change, and 48 expect a 25 basis point hike (including us). Sterling meanwhile, continues to bump along the bottom of its historic trade-weighted range. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t nearly enough good news in a much-anticipated rate hike to propel it higher, but the downside is limited. An interest rate rise today would be risky, argues our economics editor Larry Elliott. He points out that many UK households are struggling, meaning incomes are lagging spending for the first time in three decades. Households are not borrowing because they are brimful of confidence. In many cases they are borrowing to make ends meet. The MPC knows this and will go out if its way to reassure consumers and businesses that any further policy tightening will be both modest and gradual. Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise is supposed to prevent wage inflation from taking off, underpin sterling and boost the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credibility without harming growth. The next eight months will see Brexit negotiations come to a climax and the inevitable period of uncertainty means this is the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last opportunity to raise rates for some time. Yet the fact remains that this is an ill-timed and risky venture, not least for the millions overburdened with debt. The pound will tumble if the Bank of England leaves interest rates on hold today, says Miles Eakers of global payments, FX and Treasury management firm Centtrip: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A hawkish hike will boost the Pound but only for the short term. That said, Mark Carney may catch market participants off-guard again and not increase rates, which will weaken the Pound substantially and could fall as low as its yearly nadir of $1.2956 or even below. Even if the BoE does hike, the Brexit negotiations are still under way, keeping the Pound under pressure for the foreseeable future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound is dropping this morning, as the City braces for the Bank of England interest rate decision at noon. Sterling has lost half a cent against the US dollar to $1.3068, its lowest in nearly two weeks. Normally you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect a currency to rally when interest rates go up. But there may be some anxiety over whether the Bank will actually do the deed today. Traders may also be anticipating a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdovish hike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - the BoE could raise borrowing costs to 0.75%, but hint that the next rise is a long way away. This chart shows how sterling has struggled, even as an August rate hike looked more likely. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, suspects uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is hurting the pound: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThursday could be a hugely symbolic day if the Bank of England decides to raise interest rates above 0.5% for the first time since the financial crisis. However it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually change too much on the ground. Markets are already expecting a rise, and from here on in, further hikes are going to be few and far between because UK economic growth is so fragile. We could see some reaction from sterling though, which has remained resolutely weak against the dollar, despite rising expectations of a rate rise. That probably reflects the fact that economic data hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been resoundingly positive in the lead up to this interest rate decision, plus of course the prospect of a no-deal Brexit has raised its head in recent weeks. He also points out that rates could yet be cut, if the economy falters. Even though rates are very low and will remain so for the foreseeable future, they can still move down if there is an economic shock to the system. Few people thought rates would ever be cut from 0.5%, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exactly what happened following the EU referendum result. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With Love Island finally off our screens, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favourite unreliable boyfriend to show if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mended his ways, or is as fickle as ever. The Bank of England will announce today whether UK interest rates are going up, for only the second time in a decade. The City widely expects a hike, after governor Mark Carney declared last month that the economy seems to have recovered from its slowdown at the start of 2018. The City is pricing a 91% chance of an interest rate rise today. That would take borrowing costs up to 0.75% today -- their highest level since March 2009 (but still low in historic terms). But traders are edgy. Carney has a long track record of capriciousness \u00e2\u20ac\u201c promising that a rate hike is imminent only to back away when the big day arrives. So there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a possibility that the Bank will shy away from pressing that rate hike button today. The decision is unlikely to be unanimous, as some monetary policy committee members are concerned that the economy may not be strong enough to handle higher borrowing costs. Kathleen Brooks of Capital Index explains: The market is currently expecting an 8-1 split in favour of a hike, with Sir Jon Cunliffe the only member expected to dissent and vote against a hike. However, if we get more MPC members voting against a hike then sterling could come under pressure, as it would suggest a future dovish stance by the BOE. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s four years since Labour MP Pat McFadden gave Carney his \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tag, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a title the governor appreciates. He would argue that businesses and households have understood his message -- that interest rates will rise at a modest pace as the recovery allows. Also coming up Data firm Markit will report how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector performed last month. Economists predict that growth slowed, as the bounceback after the winter freeze fades. Trade war fears are weighing on the markets again. There are reports that Donald Trump is considering slapping a 25% tariff on Chinese imports into the US, which would have a hefty impact on world trade.

                "bodyText":"And finally...here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Richard Partington on the escalating US-China trade war. China has unveiled plans to impose retaliatory tariffs on US imports worth $60bn (\u00c2\u00a346bn), firing the latest volley in the mounting trade dispute between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. Signalling the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s readiness to respond to the higher tariffs threatened by Donald Trump on $200bn of Chinese imports, officials in Beijing said countermeasures were ready and waiting for the next move from Washington. The Chinese finance ministry said 5,207 goods imported from the US could be subjected to the fresh tariffs, with levies ranging from 5% to 25% on products including aircraft, soya bean oil, smoked beef, coffee and flour. The move comes after Trump asked US trade officials to consider imposing a 25% tariff on $200bn of Chinese goods, up from the 10% level originally proposed last month, as the two countries attempt to reach an agreement on trade. China said at the time blackmail would not work and that it would hit back. Speaking just hours after China unveiled the countermeasures on Friday, Larry Kudlow, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economic adviser, said the US president was willing to follow through with his threats, in a stark warning to Beijing. Calling the Chinese economy weak from the lawn of the White House in an interview with Bloomberg TV, Kudlow said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The president has said time and again, that targeted tariffs are going to be part of the gameplan with China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unless, and until, they begin to meet our requests, and so far they have not. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They better not underestimate President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s determination to follow through on our asks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: So, with the US stock market up a bit (the Dow has gained 99 points or 0.3% to 25,425 points), that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Goodnight! GW Bad news for European consumers - the cost of vegetables, bread and even beer is being driven up by the hot summer. With crops struggling in the fields, supermarkets are finding it hard to get produce - so the law of supply and demand is kicking in..... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Ed Helmore on the latest US employment data: The London stock market has closed higher this afternoon, despite the latest trade war tensions. The blue-chip FTSE 100 gained 83 points, or 1.1%, to finish at 7,659 points. The French and German markets also gained around 0.5%, even though their economies could be hit in a trade war. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says traders shrugged off the tariff threat: Despite Beijing preparing its own retaliatory \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimport tax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on $60 billion of US goods if Trump goes ahead with his planned tariffs on $200 billion of products from China, the markets managed to continued their end of week rebound on Friday. UK shares benefitted from the weaker pound, he points out: Sterling spending the day sporadically ducking under $1.30 against the dollar following July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing services PMI and Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat that chances of a no-deal Brexit are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcuncomfortably high\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Larry Kudlow has reportedly cocked a snook at China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation: China can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually retaliate like-for-like, though, as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total imports from America don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t add up to $200bn Just in: Growth across America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector has dropped to its lowest level in almost a year, and trade wars are getting the blame. The Institute of Supply Management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly healthcheck on the sector has dropped to 55.7 in July, from 59.1 in June. Any reading over 50 shows growth, but this is a sharp monthly decline. Some service sector managers said the trade war with China is hurting their businesses One said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business is up overall, but a lot of questions loom over the rest of the year. These include concerns about international markets and the increasing tariffs that impact the landed costs of goods. Larry Kudlow has now told reporters that there have been top-level talks between the US and China on trade. Rreuters has the details: President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said on Friday there has been some communication \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at the highest level\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on trade between the United States and China in recent days. Kudlow, answering questions from reporters on the WhiteHouse driveway, would not say who was involved in the communication or what was discussed. Larry Kudlow, Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic advisor, is speaking to Bloomberg TV now. On today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report, Kudlow argues that there is still significant slack in the US labor market, even though the jobless rate has ticked down to 3.9% There are still a lot of Americans out there who could come back into the labor force. Our potential to grow is very strong, and with the right incentives we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get them working again. And on trade, Kudlow launches a blast at China, claiming that its economy is weakening. He says that the yuan has weakened because China is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lousy investment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, meaning capital is leaving the country. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153heap of trouble\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if that continues, Kudlow adds. Kudlow says: They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a weak economic position... that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a good place to be in vis a vis trade negotiations. Beijing had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better not underestimate president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s determination to follow through on our asks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Kudlow continues. That includes demands that China stops stealing intellectual property, forcing US companies to share technology, and rips up non-reciprocal tariffs and trade barriers. Q: Are you trying to exert maximum pressure on the Chinese economy, to get them to the negotiation table? We are serious, Kudlow replies, and trade negotiations often include the use of tariffs. He reveals that America hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had much discussion with China on trade in recent months, and blames the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intransigence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the Chinese side. Kudlow adds that Trump had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd meeting with European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker last week. He expects lots of announcements in the next 30 days following those talks. Speaking earlier to Fox News, Kudlow also claimed that the US was making progress with the NATFA talks, leaving China \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcincreasingly isolated\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. CNN has more details of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest tariff threat: Products in line for tariffs include meat, coffee, nuts, alcoholic drinks, minerals, chemicals, leather products, wood products, machinery, furniture and auto parts. By announcing new proposed tariffs, China risks throwing fuel on its already smouldering trade war with America. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Duties ranging from 5 percent to 25 percent will be levied on 5,207 kinds of American imports if the U.S. delivers its proposed taxes on another $200 billion of Chinese goods, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement on its website late Friday. The retaliation stands to further inflame tensions between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two biggest economies and echoes China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to the previous round of tariffs which took effect last month. President Donald Trump this week ordered officials to consider imposing a 25 percent tax on $200 billion worth of imported Chinese goods, up from an initial 10 percent rate. The move was intended to bring China back to the negotiating table for talks over U.S. demands for structural changes to the Chinese economy and a cut in the bilateral trade deficit. China has released a list of US products which could be hit with new import duties. The list includes a range of agricultural products; Beijing continues to target American farmers as the trade spat with Washington spices up. Some small aircraft are also on the list. China has also made it clear that these tariffs would only be imposed if America presses on with its tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods. In other words, Beijing is trying to stick to its position that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t intensify the trade dispute, but it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t roll over either. The trade ministry says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China always believes that consultation on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit is an effective way to resolve trade differences. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any unilateral threat or blackmail will only lead to intensification of conflicts and damage to the interests of all parties.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd James Knightley of ING agrees the America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs market remains strong, despite July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown. 2017 averaged 182,000 jobs per month whereas the first 7 months of 2018 have averaged 215,000 job gains. This will help underpin consumer sentiment and spending through the rest of the year. Knightley also believes that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts will cushion the economy from the ongoing trade disputes. There are certainly worries about protectionism and its potential economic impact, but we also have to remember that the stimulus from tax cuts dwarfs the tax hit from higher tariffs. As such we are still expecting the US economy to expand 3% this year. The US jobs report shows that manufacturers took on 37,000 new staff last month. Construction employment rose by 13,000, while service sector firms provided the bulk of the new jobs. Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics explains: We need to be a little careful with the manufacturing number, however, since 13,000 of those jobs were in motor vehicle manufacturing, which is often distorted upwards in July because fewer plants close down for annual retoolings now. Services employment increased by a relatively modest 118,000, although jobs in the better-paid professional &amp; business services increased by 51,000. Despite job creation slowing last month, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labo(u)r market still looks fairly robust. As Kully Samra, Vice President at Charles Schwab, points out: Wage growth is steady month on month and unemployment remains near its 18 year low.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, there are risks on the horizon, including a trade war and the prospect of rising interest rates: Trade isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only cause for concern\u00e2\u20ac\u201dinvestors are also eyeing the rising value of the dollar, slowing global economic growth and the possibility that the Federal Reserve could raise short-term interest rates too much and choke off domestic economic growth. However, US companies have strong balance sheets and tax reform has made it attractive to repatriate even more of their cash from foreign countries. That money can fuel business investment, expansion and stock buybacks. Wall Street isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report: Newsflash: Job creation across America has slowed, while wage growth remains steady Just 157,000 new workers were hired in the US last month, according to the new Non-Farm Payroll. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker than the 190,000 which Wall Street expected. However, June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s NFP has been revised up to 248,000, from 213,000, with May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data also better previously thought. The unemployment rate has fallen back to 3.9%, from 4% last month. On the wages front, pay rose by 0.3% in July alone, or 2.7% over the last year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in line with forecasts. Wages were also up 2.7% per year in June, so the tight labour market isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t still driving up earnings. Reaction to follow.... Newsflash: China has announced plans to impose new retaliatory tariffs on US imports, if America presses on with its trade war. Beijing says it will impose an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153import tax\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on around $60bn of American goods, if the US puts taxes on Chinese products. These taxes would range from 5% to 25%, according to Reuters. The Chinese government says the measures are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rational and restrained\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, will guard its interests, and prevent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trade frictions from escalating\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This appears to be Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s formal response to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods. Currently, both sides have tariffs on around \u00c2\u00a338bn of imports. That is already causing pain in the US farming sector, testing Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claims that trade wars are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good and easy to win\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a audio clip of Mark Carney speaking this morning, explaining how the UK economy has underperformed since the Brexit vote and why a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exit should be avoided if possible: In other financial news, Royal Bank of Scotland took another step towards normality this morning by finally reinstating its dividend. OK, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only 2p per share, but it is some relief for long-suffering shareholders who have been waiting a decade for this to happen. The UK taxpayer is one winner, picking up \u00c2\u00a3149m thanks to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s majority stake in the bank. Mark Carney also suggested this morning that UK interest rates could be cut under some Brexit scenarios (a comment he also made yesterday after, err, raising borrowing costs). This is helping to keep the pound close to an 11-month low, says Lee McDarby of foreign exchange firm Moneycorp. Despite the interest rate hike, confidence shown by the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee is not being reflected by UK businesses. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing the Pound trading lower on Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit scenario, suggesting that economic uncertainty is still front and centre in the minds of decision-makers. A Hard Brexit might not plunge Britain into a deep recession, but it might lock the country into a long period of weakness. So argues Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale, who predicts that it would hurt (but not sink) the pound: Bank of England Governor Mark Carney says that the chance of a no-deal Brexit is uncomfortably high. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty dismal prospect for growth and an awful one for the public finances. It would be bad for the pound but from current low levels, the risk is that we face years of a weak currency rather than another huge move lower.... A \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which we define as ending access to the single market and taking the UK out of the customs union... is our central case. We think it results in real GDP growth being about 0.5% lower per annum than would have been the case otherwise, for up to 10 years. We think this will result in sterling trading about 5% lower than current levels on a trade-weighted basis in the next few years, back to the 2008 lows, but not to or through the 1976 lows in real terms. For EUR/GBP it suggests a return to levels around 0.95, but not a break of parity. Kit also points out that the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all-time nadir was in 1976, when the government called in the International Monetary Fund to help prop up the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances. It also plunged on Black Wednesday in 1992, and during the financial crisis. Having tumbled after the 2016 referendum, how much further could the pound slide in 2019 if Brexit goes badly? Kit writes: The question all of this begs, is whether \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 would be worse than 1992, 2008 and 1976. In 1976 and 1992, the UK was coming out of recession (a mild one in 92, a deep one in 1976). In 2009 the UK was in its deepest post-war recession. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.2% y/y growth rate is respectable by contrast. Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention on Brexit today shows that the Bank of England is getting nervous about the pace and progress of negotiations. As Bloomberg puts it: Mark Carney threw himself back into the thick of the Brexit debate on Friday, saying the chance of the U.K. dropping out of the European Union without a deal is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncomfortably high.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The intervention suggests the Bank of England governor is growing increasingly worried that Prime Minister Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is running out of time to hammer out an agreement that will prevent disruption to business, trade and consumers. The central bank has previously drawn criticism for being too forthright in its comments and predictions surrounding Brexit, which anti-EU lawmakers see as being overly gloomy. In a BBC Radio interview on Friday, Carney said a disorderly Brexit is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly undesirable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound weakened below $1.30 as he spoke and was down 0.3 percent at $1.2982 as of 8:56 a.m. London time. Carney also said that a no-deal Brexit is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a relatively unlikely possibility, but still a possibility.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anxiety about Brexit won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector companies recover from their July stumble, says James Knightley of Dutch bank ING. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services PMI report: The report compiler cited Brexit worries as a key factor holding back investment. The uncertainty it generates means it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probable that businesses will become more wary about putting money to work in the UK. Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning this morning that the risk of a no deal Brexit is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncomfortably high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly going to help stimulate businesses into action either. The drop in UK service sector growth is disappointing, says Howard Archer of the EY Item Club. It may suggest that the Bank of England was too hasty when it raised interest rates yesterday. Chris Sood-Nicholls, managing director and head of global services at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153headwinds on the horizon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are to blame. The prospect of a rise in interest rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c confirmed yesterday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meant that people have been a little more cautious with their spending than they may otherwise have been, while difficulties recruiting staff have also prevented rising demand translating into significant numbers of new jobs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Like consumers, businesses are generally knuckling down and getting on with what they need to do, while the extent of the uncertainty they face weighs heavily on longer-term investment decisions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a result, although the environment facing services businesses might remain generally positive into next year, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unlikely to brush off that cautious approach until they see greater clarity in the mid to long-term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is from Rupert Harrison of BlackRock: Services makes up around three quarters of the UK economy, so the drop in growth in July is significant. Another worrying sign: employment growth across the sector fell to a near two-year low. Some companies blamed the tight labour market; others said they were automating business processes so they could run with fewer staff. Newsflash! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector stumbled last month, with growth hitting a three-month low -- and Brexit is getting some of the blame. Service sector bosses report that new orders grew at a slower rate last month, with business activity growth also weakening. This puled down the Markit Service PMI (which measures activity) to 53.5 in July, from 55.1 in June. Some companies blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153delayed decision-making and greater risk aversion among clients\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd due to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit, says the service sector fell back into the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slow lane\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd last month. While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to quantify the precise impact of the recent heat wave on overall business performance, some survey respondents reported that a combination of hot weather and the World Cup had weighed on consumer footfall. These short-term disruptions and a general slowdown in new business growth appear to have offset the boost to tourism-related activity from the extended dry period in July. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking at demand fundamentals, service providers commented that Brexit uncertainty had held back new project wins, reflecting risk aversion and a wait-and-see approach to investment spending among international clients. Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, also singles out Brexit as a factor: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK services sector experienced a few bumps in the road in July as consumer and client confidence remained persistently half-hearted, and pessimism around the performance of the UK economy along with Brexit concerns lingered. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Levels of new orders and jobs growth were affected along with business optimism which remained below the long-term average even with July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three-month improvement. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector would cope if the UK crashed out of the EU without a transition deal, the Bank of England believes. Mark Carney insists that the banks are much stronger than before the financial crash, and could weather a crisis at home or abroad. So even if Britain and Brussels can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reach a deal, we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a run on the banks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK financial system has tripled the amount of capital they had over the course of the last several years, they have increased the amount of liquidity - the money they have on a day-to-day basis - by 10 times over the course of the last several years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The reason they have done that is to be in a position to be able to withstand a shock, wherever the shock comes from - it could come from China, it could come from abroad, it could come from a no-deal Brexit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have meticulously gone through the types of risk associated with a no-deal Brexit. Mark Carney also warned that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit would disrupt UK trade, hurting growth: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a consequence of that [there would be] a disruption to the level of economic activity, higher prices for a period of time. Newsflash: The pound has slumped close to its lowest level since last September, as the governor of the Bank of England warned that the risks of a hard Brexit are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worryingly high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Mark Carmey told Radio Four\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today Programme that it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly undesirable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Britain to crash out of the EU without a deal...but far from impossible. He warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the possibility of a no deal is uncomfortably high at this point. People will have things to worry about in a no deal Brexit, which is still a relatively unlikely possibility but it is a possibility.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney added that a transition deal is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the interests of both the UK and the EU. He also warned that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd scenario would drive up consumer prices, as companies scrambled to keep supply chains running. Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments raise the stakes as prime minister Theresa May prepared to meet with French president Emmanuel Macron, as part of her push to get EU leaders to back her Chequers plan. Macron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support could be critical to May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to get Europe to support her compromise proposal. However, EU negotiator Michel Barnier has criticised Chequers - saying the proposal for free movement of goods, but not people, after Brexit would undermine the single market. Carney was also asked about yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise. He said market expectations that rates move to 1.5% over the next few years is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not a bad rule of thumb.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd His comments sent the pound sliding through $1.30 -- it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down half a cent to $1.2980. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s uncomfortably close to the 11-month low scraped last month. Hosting the football World Cup gave Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy a lift. Growth in the Russian service sector jumped in July, according to Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly healthcheck. It says: The IHS Markit Russia Services Business Activity Index \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a single-figure measure designed to track changes in total Russian services activity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c posted 52.8 in July, up from 52.3 in June. The latest expansion in business activity was solid despite remaining below the long-run series average. Where a rise was reported, panellists linked this to greater new order growth and an increase in activity following the recent football World Cup. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector growth has hit a four-month low today, suggesting that the trade dispute with America may be hurting. The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index (PMI) fell to 52.8 in July, down from June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 53.9, and the lowest reading since March. Service sector new orders expanded at their weakest rate for over two-and-a-half years. In another blow, overall business confidence fell to its lowest level since November 2015. Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, fears that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is slowing. The Caixin China Composite Output Index, which covers both manufacturers and service providers, fell to 52.3 in July, pointing to a weaker expansion of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. The sub- index for prices charged fell more than the one for input costs, although both remained in expansionary territory. The situation pointed to rising cost pressures. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The Bank of England took a bit of a gamble yesterday, raising UK interest rates to a near 10-year high even though real wage growth is modest and Brexit uncertainty is worrying businesses. Today we learn if the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominant service sector is strong enough to cope with higher borrowing costs. Data firm Markit is publishing its monthly surveys of purchasing managers from service sector firms (or PMIs). The UK services PMI is expected to fall to 54.7 for July, from 55.1 in June, which would show a small growth slowdown. 2018 has been a torrid year for some services sector firms, such as retailers and restaurants. But some outlets should have enjoyed a World Cup boost last month. Already this week the manufacturing PMI has shown a slowdown, while construction picked up. We also get PMI reports from across the globe. The eurozone figures are expected to confirm that growth slowed last month. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services PMI for July could well go further in showcasing that the rebound seen in the Q2 numbers isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a temporary phenomenon and has momentum. This is expected to show a modest slowdown from June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 55.1 to 54.7, as the boost from the warm weather and England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Cup run came to an end. While we appear to have seen a rebound in the UK economy in Q2, the same can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be said with any certainty with respect to the EU and France in particular which saw its own GDP come in at 0.2% in Q2. You would think that having won the World Cup that the services sector would show evidence of some sort of pickup in July, but even here expectations are modest in that we could see a slowdown to 55.3. This could be even weaker if the effects of air traffic control and rail strikes caused a bigger loss of output than has originally been estimated. The other major event of the day is the US jobs report, or Non-Farm Payroll. This will show whether America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-running labour market boom continued in July. Economists predict that 192,000 new US jobs were created last month, down from 213,000 in June. That could pull the unemployment rate down to just 3.9%, from 4%. The earnings figures are more important. Pay is expected to have risen by 0.3% during the month, up from 0.2% in June. That would leave annual wage increases pegged at 2.7%, not spectacular, given US growth hit its highest level since 2014. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be watching to see whether Donald Trump breaks with protocol (again) and tweets about the jobs number. It would make a nice change from flaming the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fake, disgusting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd news.

The selloff was blamed on international trade secretary Sir Liam Fox, and his warning that a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno-deal Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was a 60:40 chance. Fox also attacked the European Commission for being intransigent, declaring. If the theological obsession of the unelected takes priority over the economic wellbeing of the people then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bureaucrats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit. This latest sign that UK-Brussels negotiations are floundering also sent the pound down against the euro, losing half a eurocent to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.119. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman, though, insists that Britain is confident of getting a good deal (which sticking to its fallback position that no deal is better than a bad one). The EC have denied hampering Brexit talks, telling reporters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are working constructively, day and night, to reach a deal with the United Kingdom and I think this is also reflected in the fact that the next negotiation round is scheduled for 16 and 17 of August.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd City analysts are bracing for more volatility in the months ahead, as Britain heads towards Exit Day, 29th March 2019. Analysts at Capital Economics predict that the pound could fall to $1.20, if London can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree a deal with Brussels (or rise to $1.40 if the no-deal threat is avoided). Financial markets have also been jolted by a worrying drop in German factory orders. New manufacturing orders shrank by 4% in June, the biggest drop in almost 18 months. Orders from within Germany, across the eurozone, and beyond all fell -- a bad sign for economic prospects. The decline may show that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imposition of tariffs on China and the EU are damaging the global economy, denting confidence and cutting demand for German goods. Economists warned that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153horrendous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd data suggests Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s powerhouse economy is weakening. And with trade war fears escalating, the situation could worsen this autumn. This has pulled several European stock markets into the red today, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX index down 0.3%. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 ended the day flat, though, as the falling pound helped exporters and firms with overseas earnings. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Boom! Capital Economics have predicted that the pound could slide back to $1.20 if Britain can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree a deal with the EU. Even though sterling has already fallen a long way against the dollar, it would probably drop a lot more if fears of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd materialised, says analyst John Higgins. Higgins warns: After all, investors still seem to be assigning a fairly low probability to this outcome. Unlike in the run-up to the vote for Brexit in June 2016, there has been no surge in the demand for options to protect against a slump in sterling. And in the past few months, it has only fallen a few cents more against the dollar than might have been expected given the shift in UK/US rate expectations. ... The upshot is that we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised if, in the event of no deal, the exchange rate plunged towards, or even below, the level of circa $1.20/\u00c2\u00a3 that it reached in early 2017. Having said that.... Capital Economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153baseline assumption\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is that a deal is reached, pushing the pound back to $1.40 by the end of 2018 (from $1.29 today). Over in the eurozone, Greece has received the final tranche of its bailout - as it prepares to exit the programme in a fortnight. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no celebrating in Athens, following the forest fires left a trail of death and destruction east of the capital. Our correspondent HelenaSmith report from the Greek capital As the death toll rose to 94 - prime minister Alexis Tsipras, whiplashed by public discontent over its handling of the fires, accepted the resignation of the head of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s civil protection agency this morning. The resignation, which follows the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacement of the heads of the fire and police services last night, has spurred speculation Tsipras will move ahead with a far-reaching reshuffle to boost his two-party coalition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flagging popularity imminently. Government sources told the Guardian the makeover will take place well in advance of the leftist leader making his annual economic address in Thessaloniki on September 9th. Tsipras says August 21st will mark the beginning of the end of debt-stricken Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arduous nine-year odyssey on the frontline of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At long last we will reclaim our sovereignty,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told Greeks claiming \u00e2\u20ac\u0153political responsibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the fires. But as the countdown intensifies and the trauma of the fires intensifies, it feels anything but festive among those in office in Athens amid reports this morning that even the finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos may not be around for too much longer.... Steven Barrow, strategist at South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Standard Bank, thinks the pound is falling because time is running out to agree a Brexit deal. He warns (via the FT) that the selloff could intensify this autumn. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think the timescale is unrealistic and, as this starts to dawn on the market, it could just prove another factor tipping risk assets over the edge in the autumn. Sterling caught a dose of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit blues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd today, says Connor Campbell of financial spread-betting group SpreadEx. He blames Dr Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that a no-deal Brexit was a 60:40 shout, on top of Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns. Campbell says: Though the Western markets were almost uniformly in the red, the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real loser was the pound. Plunging half a percent against the dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cable is at a fresh 11 month low \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and 0.3% against the euro, sterling was spooked by the apparent increase in likelihood of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno-deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit, with international trade secretary Liam Fox echoing Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claims last week that the chances of the UK leaving the EU without an agreement in place is becoming more and more of a reality. Brexit worries have also pulled the pound down against the euro today. Sterling has dropped below \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.12 today, a decline of 0.35%. Back in April it was worth almost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.16, meaning UK holidaymakers got a little bit more for their money overseas. Polling company ORB has bad news for the government: public support for Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s handling of the Brexit negotiations has hit a record low. Just 24% of the public approve of the way things are going, they say, things are going well, down from 40% back in April. European stock markets have slipped into the red today. Investors are worrying about the decline in German factory orders in June and the lack of Brexit progress, meaning the FTSE 100 didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get its typical boost from the weakening pound. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153European stock markets opened mixed today as the trade dispute between the US and China continues to hang over investors and stocks... There has been an marked escalation in the trade war, with President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claiming the US was winning the trade dispute.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The drop in the pound has been the main event on a quiet session, says Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX Strategy BK Asset Management. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The biggest story of the day was the continued slide in cable which hit fresh 11 month highs as it dipped below towards $1.2950 support on renewed fears of a hard Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Schlossberg also warned that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153waves of uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd buffeting sterling will become choppier as the Brexit deadline approaches. Marketwatch has more details. The latest attacks on Europe from eurosceptic voices such as Liam Fox are pushing the pound down, argues Commerzbank currency strategist Ulrich Leuchtmann. Leuchtmann says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The voices forecasting a hard Brexit are becoming increasingly shrill. The FX [foreign exchange] market is slowly beginning to work out that these people might successfully torpedo a constructive solution.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound is continuing to drop, and is now down three-quarters of a cent at $1.293. Over in Downing Street, the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman has denied that Britain is likely to leave the EU without a deal. He told reporters at the regular lobby briefing that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We continue to believe that a deal is the most likely outcome because reaching a good deal is not only in the interests of the UK, it is in the interests of the EU and its 27 members.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But, he also argued that Liam Fox was right to warn that a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno-deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit is an option (spooking the pound to an 11-month low) Why a no-deal Brexit worries the City: The pound is hitting new 11-month lows, due to Brexit worries and a general move into the US dollar this morning. UBS Wealth Management has cut its recommendation for clients to go \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoverweight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on shares, due to the threat of a trade war. It fears that the dispute will get worse in the months ahead, with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153several painful rounds of talks and new tariff measures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the horizon. Caroline Simmons, deputy head of UBS Wealth Management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK Investment Office, warns that trade war spats could rumble along for Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entire presidency: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While we expect the trade disputes to ultimately be resolved before the world is tipped into another recession, our base case now assumes things will get worse before they get better. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The benign macroeconomic environment, and strong fundamentals, have emboldened a recent sense of market optimism. But there is a very real danger of overlooking the possibility of the trade situation getting worse, which could have significant impacts, such as supply-chain disruptions, reduced hiring, and lower investment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To reflect this risk and take advantage of the recent move higher in equities, we are reducing our overweight in global equities versus high grade bonds.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The drop in German factory orders may indicate that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate is slowing fast, warns Mikael Sarwe of Nordea Markets: Newsflash: The pound has hit its lowest level since last September, amid heightened worries over Brexit. Sterling fell half a cent this morning to $1.2954. That takes it below its mid-July low to the weakest point in 11 months. The selloff came after Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international trade secretary, Dr Liam Fox, warned that a no-deal Brexit was now more likely than not. Fox told the Sunday Times that there was a 60:40 chance that the UK would leave the European Union without an agreement. He accused the Commission of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intransigence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd putting EU rules above economic well-being. Last Friday, Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned that a no-deal Brexit was an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncomfortably high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd risk. He was then criticised as being a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high priest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of Project Fear; presumably Dr Fox will get the same treatment?.... Back in the UK, car sales have crept up in July, despite a drop in demand for diesel cars again. Some 163,898 new cars were registered last month, up 1.2% year-on-year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reports. Diesel registrations slumped by nearly 25% compared with July 2017, as the knock-on effect of the emissions scandal lingers. Petrol car sales jumped by 20%, while electric car sales jumped 21% - giving them 6.5% of the market. Ian Plummer, director at Auto Trader, reckons car buyers got some good deals last month: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Manufacturers have been racing to clear stock before new regulations on fuel economy and emissions take effect in September, resulting in some great opportunities for consumers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reuters reports that the Chinese media turned up the heat on Donald Trump over his trade policies: The overseas edition of the ruling Communist Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daily newspaper singled out U.S. President Donald Trump in an editorial on Monday, saying he was starring in his own \u00e2\u20ac\u0153street fighter-style deceitful drama of extortion and intimidation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Fears of a trade war with America hit China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market today. The Shanghai composite index fell by 1.25%, as traders fretted about the threat of tariffs hurting global trade. Last Friday, Beijing announced plans for new taxes on $60bn of America goods, if Washington carries out its threatened 25% tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods. Such a move, though, might trigger fresh retaliation from Washington. Yesterday, president Donald Trump claimed that his tariffs were working, indicating that he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning to change his trade policies: Factcheck: the US budget deficit is actually rising sharply, thanks to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts, while farmers are getting a $12bn bailout to protect them from the trade dispute with China. The drop in German factory orders was much steeper than expected, says Bloomberg: Orders fell 4 percent from the previous month -- eight times as much as forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists -- and the 0.8 percent drop from a year ago was the first annual decline since July 2016. The size and scale of the drop in German factory orders in June is almost too bad to be true, suggests Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services. He writes: The fact that every single category fell - be that domestic, Eurozone &amp; Non-Eurozone or Capital Goods, Consumer Durables or Intermediate Goods - looks to be highly anomalous, in so far as there is rarely ever a month where there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153parallel shift\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd down, barring events such as the global financial crisis of 2008. As such, he expects a sharp bounceback in July. Alternatively, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data might be revised up. Economist Fred Ducrozet of Pictet Bank points out that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 German factory orders also fell in June: The broader picture is that German factory orders have fallen in five of the first six months of 2018, as this chart from the Financial Times show: The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Camilla Hodgson writes that trade tensions are a factor: The data covers a month when the transatlantic trade relations between the US and the European Union were worsening, ahead of a meeting between US President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in July. Carsten Brzeski of Dutch bank ING also believes Germany is being buffeted by rising trade tensions. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data: German industrial orders took a severe hit in June, dropping by 4% month-on-month, from [up] 2.6% month-on-month in May. On the year, new orders were down by 0.8%. Even though new orders data are highly volatile, the June report could be a tentative sign of how trade tensions are hitting the German economy. Foreign orders from outside the eurozone dropped by almost 6% MoM. At the same time, domestic orders decreased by 2.8% MoM. With the sharpest drop since January 2017, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new orders data do not bode well for German industry going into the second half of the year. Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s German factory data is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153horrendous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and a sign that economic uncertainty is dampening demand. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade wars appear to be biting. New data show that German factory orders slumped by 4% in June, the biggest fall in almost 18 months. The decline was driven by weaker overseas demand, with orders from outside the eurozone slumping by 5.9%. Domestic orders dropped by 2.8%, while orders from other euro countries declined by 2.7%. Orders for capital goods and consumer goods were particularly weak, falling 4.7% and 4.5% respectively. This monthly data can be volatile, but such a big decline suggests that the tariffs imposed by America in recent months are hurting global trade. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Economy Ministry said that industrial orders fell by 1.6% in April to June, and singled out president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politics, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Regarding the latest development, uncertainty caused by trade policy probably played a role.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Given the size of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing base, this data may highlight wider problems building in the world economy... I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull together some reaction now. Also coming up. HSBC, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest bank, has posted strong-looking results this morning. Pte-tax profits rose $10.71bn for the first half of the year, beating analyst expectations. More on that shortly...

The S&amp;P report ssays:</p> <blockquote> <p>This is because China is running out of room to retaliate on goods.. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent threat to impose tariffs of 5% to 25% on a further $60 billion worth of U.S. goods (5,207 product lines) means that, together with the $50 billion of goods already announced, about 85% of its American imports (totaling $130 billion in 2017) could be taxed.</p> <p>The threat is in response to the Trump administration last week announcing that it may increase its proposed tariff rate on Chinese imports valued at about $200 billion to 25% from 10%. Together with the previously-announced tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports, the total amount of $250 billion represents about 50% of the value of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual exports to the U.S. in 2017.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153With China running out of room to retaliate on goods (i.e., 85% versus 50% coverage), China could opt to pursue non-tariff actions affecting services and investments from the U.S.,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said S&amp;P Global Ratings analyst David Tesher.</p> <p>The U.S. has a net services surplus with China. A retaliation that spilled over into services could hurt U.S. sectors that rely on China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expanding import market for growth. This step-up in tensions could also exacerbate investor worries about China, damaging business and consumer confidence and growth prospects.

From a financial markets point of view, the price of crude oil could be where these decisions are most keenly felt, with the increased animosity threatening to disrupt Tehran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significant output. This is unlikely to be reflected immediately, with Iranian production expected to remain at present levels for the time being, but should further more stringent sanctions come into play then we could well be set for a supply shock in the oil market which would trigger a sharp move higher.</p> <p>The complex nature of this situation means that it is not just the US and Iran that could be impacted, with the bulk of Iranian crude actually being sold to other countries. The issue lies in whether the US look to force allies to also shun oil from Iran, and if this occurs then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real chance that OPEC will struggle to make up the lost supply and this would drive the price of oil up. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b6969fee4b05f576d12d0b3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-07T09:45:10.676Z\">10.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Anyone trading with Iran won't be trading with US - Trump</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the Iran sanctions, and President Trump has just tweeted:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1026762818773757955\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Iran sanctions have officially been cast.

Barclays said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[This] is the strongest consistent growth in our data history. UK domestic sectors have held up year to date and resilient spending should continue to support their near-term performance.</p> </blockquote> <p>It said the strength came from in-store spending, which grew by 2.9%, the strongest growth since April 2014. Online spending grew by 10.4%, which is weaker compared to the historical data. And Barclays warned:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are reasons to be cautious, as consumers remain negative about the general economy and appetite for large purchases remains muted. </p> <p>Outside influences, such as oil price inflation and FX, combine to push up spending on Petrol. Consumer confidence moved slightly lower in July, as negativity about the general economy persists. The appetite for major purchases remained muted, with consumers cautious about making significant spending commitments, evident in subdued spending on electronics, furniture, household appliances and vehicle sales.</p> </blockquote> <p>Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at AJ Bell, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heat wave and World Cup fever boosted consumer spending in July, with people spending on picnics, BBQs and pubs.</p> <p>People are making the most of the sunshine as spending on food increased 6.7% in the month, while more families are also going on day trips and doing outdoor activities. </p> <p>The World Cup effect also continued to boost spending in the month, with money spent in pubs rising 73% on the day of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s semi-final, as people cheered on their team. Overall the amount shelled out in pubs increased by 17% in July \u00e2\u20ac\u201c marking the biggest rise since April last year.</p> <p>However, the hangover is looming as people admit they are worried about the effect of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise on their finances. The 0.25 percentage point hike last week will hit those who are in debt, including many who are already struggling to make ends meet. </p> <p>A third of those questioned said they were worried that the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move would mean they have less money each month, while confidence in finances among those questioned dropped by 6 percentage points to 59%.</p> <p>This cautiousness is also shown in the fact that households are still putting off buying big ticket items.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f479d26b2a1040c8ae0ca48695867d64c1b91b09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f479d26b2a1040c8ae0ca48695867d64c1b91b09/0_248_4173_2504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England supporters celebrate at the Lord Raglan Pub in London as England play Tunisia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England supporters celebrate at the Lord Raglan Pub in London as England play Tunisia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel French/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-08-07T09:41:02.372Z\">at 10.41am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b69616be4b05f576d12d077\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-07T09:23:35.267Z\">10.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A reasonably strong performance from US markets on Monday is one of the reasons for a more positive mood in Asia (the Nikkei 225 was up 0.69%) and Europe.

However, it could become a bumpy ride over the summer months. July, August and sometimes September months are notorious for even more volatility, given the start and end of the vacation period. The usual suspect is the car sector. In the last five years, auto production embarked on a wild rollercoaster four times. Auto companies ramp up their production before the summer holidays with a technical setback following suit one month later.

On the year, industrial production was still up by 2.5%. The drop in industrial activity was broadly-based. After three strong months, activity in the construction sector also weakened, declining by 3.2% MoM. At the same time, exports held up relatively well, despite the delayed impact from last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro strengthening and trade tensions, remaining flat in June after a 1.8% MoM increase in May. As imports increased by 1.2% MoM, the seasonally-adjusted trade surplus narrowed to 19.3bn euro, from 20.4bn euro in May.</p> <p>After yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing new orders data, speculations about an imminent downswing of the German economy have gained new momentum. Intuitively, weak June data can be associated with trade tensions. However, in our view, this intuition is not so straight-forward. The analysis of the German economy requires more nuances. Here is our take on the state of the economy.</p> <p>1. Despite this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointments, comparing economic activity data with first quarter data still points to solid growth in Q2. Construction, industrial output and consumption should all be growth drivers, not drags, in Q2. Therefore, next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP data could easily outperform the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.3% growth rate</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eac6622ce5b06b20d60d6445bdf071e8f9aff690\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eac6622ce5b06b20d60d6445bdf071e8f9aff690/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volkswagen cars wait to be shipped at the harbour in Bremerhaven, nothern Germany.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volkswagen cars wait to be shipped at the harbour in Bremerhaven, nothern Germany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrik Stollarz/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>2. Looking at bilateral trade data, German exports have gone through a slight structural shift since the start of the year. While the share of German exports to the US is currently lower than in 2017, the share of other Eurozone countries like the Netherlands, Italy or Spain has actually increased.</p> <p>3. At least in the short run, weakening demand for German products as illustrated by yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing new orders data could actually bring some relief. Particularly the manufacturing sector has been suffering from severe supply-side constraints, with capacity utilisation at its highest level since early 2008, a high lack of qualified workers and equipment as a limiting factor. Orders books are still richly filled and it would take a while before a protracted decline in demand would show in activity data.</p> <p>4. Trade tensions are weighing on sentiment, not on activity. Obviously, trade tensions are the biggest threat to the German economy at the current juncture. Not so much due to tariffs or the possibility of tariffs but simply due to the fact that a potential trade war brings uncertainty and uncertainty brings a delay in investment decisions.</p> <p>All of this means that reading and understanding the German economy has become more complex. The long series of one-offs explaining the monthly, often highly volatile, ups and downs of German macro data since the start of the year has further complicated things. Just think of the harsh winter weather, strikes, timing of Easter and long weekends. For now, the only thing that is for sure is that the economy has lost its stellar performance but this does not mean at all that it has become an underperformer. Complexity does not mean failure.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b693a7ee4b03096a5adfb6d\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-07T06:45:41.020Z\">7.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Agenda: Pound in focus, German industrial output disappoints</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong></p> <p>With growing concerns about a no-deal Brexit in the past couple of days - as warned by such diverse personalities as Bank of England governor Mark Carney and Sir Liam Fox - the pound hit an 11 month low on Monday.</p> <p>However there has been a bit of relief for sterling - and UK holidaymakers heading overseas - in early trading today.

It has gained a little ground against the dollar - up 0.03% - but is still in negative territory against the euro - down 0.37%. Oil prices are on the rise after the US introduced a new series of sanctions against Iran, prompting concerns about crude supplies. Brent crude is currently 0.9% higher at $74.42 a barrel. Meanwhile analysts at S&amp;P have warned that the US-Chinese trade row could move from goods to services. On the economic front, UK house prices grew by 1.4% month on month in July, a better result than had been expected, while consumer spending remains strong, according to Barclays. But in Germany there were disappointing industrial output figures, a day after a fall in factory orders. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The rise in the oil price has lifted US energy stocks and pushed Wall Street higher at the open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 0.4% or 101 points while the S&amp;P 500 has opened up 0.23% and the Nasdaq Composite is 0.28% better. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full story on the Halifax house price survey: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest story on the US sanctions on Iran: Donald Trump has warned America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading partners that anyone who does business with Iran will not be doing business with the US, after his administration reimposed blanket sanctions. The US president described the new sanctions, which hit Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s access to dollars, gold and precious metals, as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the most biting ever imposed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In November they ratchet up to yet another level,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he tweeted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States. I am asking for WORLD PEACE, nothing less!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Within hours of the sanctions taking effect, the German carmaker Daimler, which announced a joint venture in Iran last year, said it was halting its business activities in the country. The punitive measures came into force in the early hours of Tuesday, and follow Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision in May to renege on the landmark 2015 deal to curtail Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear ambitions. The sanctions also target a range of industries, including Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carmaking sector, and will be followed by a set of additional and even more stringent measures by 4 November, including an embargo on the import of Iranian oil and sanctions on its banking sector. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest comments appear aimed at the EU, which is attempting to protect European businesses from the sanctions and has vowed to safeguard firms. Companies have been instructed that they should not comply with demands from the White House for them to drop all business with Iran. Those who decide to pull out because of US sanctions will need to be granted authorisation from the European commission, without which they face the risk of being sued by EU member states. The full report is here: US markets are expected to open higher: The VIX index - a measure of the stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectation of volatility - is heading lower. It is currently down 2% at 11.03 having earlier fallen to 10.9, the lowest level since January. The US-China trade battle could spill over from goods into services, according to S&amp;P Global Ratings. The S&amp;P report ssays: This is because China is running out of room to retaliate on goods.. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent threat to impose tariffs of 5% to 25% on a further $60 billion worth of U.S. goods (5,207 product lines) means that, together with the $50 billion of goods already announced, about 85% of its American imports (totaling $130 billion in 2017) could be taxed. The threat is in response to the Trump administration last week announcing that it may increase its proposed tariff rate on Chinese imports valued at about $200 billion to 25% from 10%. Together with the previously-announced tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports, the total amount of $250 billion represents about 50% of the value of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual exports to the U.S. in 2017. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With China running out of room to retaliate on goods (i.e., 85% versus 50% coverage), China could opt to pursue non-tariff actions affecting services and investments from the U.S.,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said S&amp;P Global Ratings analyst David Tesher. The U.S. has a net services surplus with China. A retaliation that spilled over into services could hurt U.S. sectors that rely on China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expanding import market for growth. This step-up in tensions could also exacerbate investor worries about China, damaging business and consumer confidence and growth prospects. We note that the trade tension is already weighing on the Chinese currency and stock market sentiment. Oil prices are continuing to rise in the wake of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Iranian sanctions. Brent crude is now up 1.27% at $74.69 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has climbed 0.94% to $69.66. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB, says: The US has reimposed sanctions against this morning, with an executive order signed by President Trump that targets financial transactions involving the US dollar, the purchase of commercial plans and metals including gold and the Iranian automotive sector coming into effect. From a financial markets point of view, the price of crude oil could be where these decisions are most keenly felt, with the increased animosity threatening to disrupt Tehran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significant output. This is unlikely to be reflected immediately, with Iranian production expected to remain at present levels for the time being, but should further more stringent sanctions come into play then we could well be set for a supply shock in the oil market which would trigger a sharp move higher. The complex nature of this situation means that it is not just the US and Iran that could be impacted, with the bulk of Iranian crude actually being sold to other countries. The issue lies in whether the US look to force allies to also shun oil from Iran, and if this occurs then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real chance that OPEC will struggle to make up the lost supply and this would drive the price of oil up. Back with the Iran sanctions, and President Trump has just tweeted: UK consumers are continuing to spend, boosted by the World Cup and the heatwave, according to the latest Barclays trend survey, although there are reasons to be cautious about the outlook. Spending grew by 5% year on year in July, the third consecutive month with spending growth around this level. Barclays said: [This] is the strongest consistent growth in our data history. UK domestic sectors have held up year to date and resilient spending should continue to support their near-term performance. It said the strength came from in-store spending, which grew by 2.9%, the strongest growth since April 2014. Online spending grew by 10.4%, which is weaker compared to the historical data. And Barclays warned: There are reasons to be cautious, as consumers remain negative about the general economy and appetite for large purchases remains muted. Outside influences, such as oil price inflation and FX, combine to push up spending on Petrol. Consumer confidence moved slightly lower in July, as negativity about the general economy persists. The appetite for major purchases remained muted, with consumers cautious about making significant spending commitments, evident in subdued spending on electronics, furniture, household appliances and vehicle sales. Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at AJ Bell, said: This summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heat wave and World Cup fever boosted consumer spending in July, with people spending on picnics, BBQs and pubs. People are making the most of the sunshine as spending on food increased 6.7% in the month, while more families are also going on day trips and doing outdoor activities. The World Cup effect also continued to boost spending in the month, with money spent in pubs rising 73% on the day of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s semi-final, as people cheered on their team. Overall the amount shelled out in pubs increased by 17% in July \u00e2\u20ac\u201c marking the biggest rise since April last year. However, the hangover is looming as people admit they are worried about the effect of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise on their finances. The 0.25 percentage point hike last week will hit those who are in debt, including many who are already struggling to make ends meet. A third of those questioned said they were worried that the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move would mean they have less money each month, while confidence in finances among those questioned dropped by 6 percentage points to 59%. This cautiousness is also shown in the fact that households are still putting off buying big ticket items. A reasonably strong performance from US markets on Monday is one of the reasons for a more positive mood in Asia (the Nikkei 225 was up 0.69%) and Europe. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: UK and European markets have rallied this morning, carrying the baton over from last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better showing for US markets. Confidence has returned as the S&amp;P 500 moseys its way to towards the January record high, and it remains encouraging to see stock markets hold their ground despite a drumbeat of trade war headlines of late. Earnings season is shaping up very well indeed, which accounts for why US equities remain comfortably ahead of the likes of Europe, but a rising tide lifts all boats and will reinforce the impression that this economic recovery and its associated bull market has further to run. Reasons to be cautious still abound however, with the Reserve Bank of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overnight view that China is seeing a modest slowdown in growth reminding us that all is not entirely rosy out there, and this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline in German industrial production added to this impression, coming as it does after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grim factory orders data. The positive mood in stock markets is holding up as the morning progresses. With copper prices edging higher, mining shares are leading the FTSE 100 higher, with the leading UK index now up 0.69%. Oil is also giving support, with crude moving ahead on the prospect of curtailed supplies from Iran following the imposition of US sanctions on the country. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up 0.95% while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.84%. There are a few notes of caution over UK house prices despite the stronger than expected Halifax data. Jonathan Samuels, chief executive of property lender, Octane Capital, said: It would be premature to pop the champagne corks on the back of this seemingly robust data. The annual rate of growth may have shot up between June and July but weak supply rather than robust demand is the primary driver. The market might look punchy on the outside but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pallid on the inside. Transaction levels overall are low and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see them picking up materially in the months ahead as Brexit uncertainty heightens. The impact of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise remains to be seen. While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a massive hit in real terms, how it impacts sentiment is key. The jobs market is holding up but the direction of inflation and wage growth will be key as we enter the latter part of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, is also wary: Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, said: The market has seen far too many false dawns to allow itself to get carried away by these surprisingly strong numbers. Yet with the rate of annual price growth rising to its highest level so far this year, the progress is no flash in the pan. Rather it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the result of the tussle between pent-up demand and chronically low supply. That tussle continues, even if the last two months have seen increases in both the number of mortgage approvals and the number of homes coming onto the market. The modest momentum could also be given a short-term boost by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increase in interest rates, which, rather than cooling the market, may spur previously hesitant buyers into action during the typically busy \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcback to school\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 season next month. Yet the future course of the market is delicately balanced. With even Cabinet ministers now warning that a no-deal Brexit is more likely than an orderly exit from the EU, investment buyers are dialling up their caution. For everyone else, softening prices and better affordability are creating some attractive buying opportunities, but the market remains deeply polarised, with pockets of value and activity pulling different regions in opposing directions. Markets are holding on to their opening gains, limited though they may be. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex said: After yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war-fearing, Brexit-bitten session, the markets got off to a brighter start on Tuesday, without really any reason to do so. Though it still couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t break out of its recent trading bracket, the FTSE at least pushed to the upper end of it after the bell, climbing 25 points to hit 7685. The index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main boost came from the commodity sector. With copper up 0.7% the likes of Rio Tinto and Anglo American rose anywhere between 1.3% and 2%, while BP and Shell jumped 0.8% and 0.5% respectively as Brent Crude crossed $74 per barrel following the resumption of the US sanctions on Iran. Meanwhile sterling is currently up 0.13% against the dollar at $1.2958 but has dipped 0.1% against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1192. Across the Atlantic, the futures market is pointing to a positive start on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average expected to open around 70 points higher. Signs of life in the UK housing market with a better than expected report from mortgage lender Halifax. House prices rose 1.4% month on month in July, compared to expectations of a 0.2% increase, according to the Halifax. The 3.3% year on year increase was higher than the forecast 2.7% gain. But managing director Russell Galley said: Whilst the quarterly and annual rates of house price growth have improved, housing activity remains soft. Sterling is set for continued volatility in the run up to Brexit day next March, according to Thanos Vamvakidis, head of G-10 foreign exchange strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He told CNBC: If we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a deal, sterling can be weaker by about 10 percent, (or) even lower. If you get a deal, any deal, \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. (sterling) can be up by 10 percent. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think any other currency can have this kind of moves in the next few months. The comments echo those of Capital Economics on Monday, who said the pound could fall to $1.20 if no deal is agreed between the UK and EU. As expected, markets have got off to a slow start in Europe, but a mainly positive one. The FTSE 100 is up 0.28%, helped by a rise in commodity stocks following the stronger oil price, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.32% and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up 0.48%. One of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bigger UK fallers is Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pizza, with analysts pointing to the cost of international expansion and some caution about the outlook. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pizza reported another firm set of half-year numbers this morning as the investment in digital, especially mobile, pays off in terms of driving top line sales. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still plenty of evidence that shifting consumer habits are supportive and while the hot weather took the shine off the second quarter numbers a little, the World Cup offered some compensation. However, investment in its international expansion weighed on profit growth. Underlying profits rose 2.5% but on a statutory basis profits were down 10% due to a load of exceptional costs that seem to have mounted: \u00c2\u00a31.9m from its Warrington supply chain centre, a \u00c2\u00a32.1m hit from Norway as it transforms Dolly Dimples into Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, \u00c2\u00a31.4m from joint venture store conversion in Germany and a further \u00c2\u00a34.2m from tax, amortisation and German Market Access Fee increase charges recognised on the income statement as non-underlying items. Nevertheless the underlying picture remains positive. We note the company expects fewer stores to open this year, with management suggesting 60 new outlets in 2018 versus the 65-75 anticipated in April. This seems to reflect a more focused and disciplined approach to openings in what is undoubtedly a trickier market, but it might also signal some deeper worries about the UK market. Indeed, management struck a very cautious tone over the UK, saying that the trading environment \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccontinues to be uncertain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The June data for Germany so far has been uniformly weak, says Dr Andreas Rees, economist at UniCredit Bank: Industrial production declined 0.9% mom, while exports treaded water (yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new orders: -4.0%). However, in all three cases, the decreases (or stagnation) came after strong rises in the previous month. Going forward, we expect a moderate acceleration in the industrial sector on average, driven by global trade and solid domestic demand. However, it could become a bumpy ride over the summer months. July, August and sometimes September months are notorious for even more volatility, given the start and end of the vacation period. The usual suspect is the car sector. In the last five years, auto production embarked on a wild rollercoaster four times. Auto companies ramp up their production before the summer holidays with a technical setback following suit one month later. This effect then plays havoc with the headline figures in the corresponding two months. ...Next week on 14 August, German GDP growth for the second quarter will be released. We expect a plus of 0.4% qoq (or about 1\u00c2\u00bd% annualised) with the forecast risks skewed to the downside (for 2018 as a whole: +2.0%). The disappointing industrial figures from Germany do not necessarily mean the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is heading for trouble, suggests ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski: German industrial production took a hit in June, dropping by 0.9% MoM, from 2.4% MoM in May. On the year, industrial production was still up by 2.5%. The drop in industrial activity was broadly-based. After three strong months, activity in the construction sector also weakened, declining by 3.2% MoM. At the same time, exports held up relatively well, despite the delayed impact from last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro strengthening and trade tensions, remaining flat in June after a 1.8% MoM increase in May. As imports increased by 1.2% MoM, the seasonally-adjusted trade surplus narrowed to 19.3bn euro, from 20.4bn euro in May. After yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing new orders data, speculations about an imminent downswing of the German economy have gained new momentum. Intuitively, weak June data can be associated with trade tensions. However, in our view, this intuition is not so straight-forward. The analysis of the German economy requires more nuances. Here is our take on the state of the economy. 1. Despite this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointments, comparing economic activity data with first quarter data still points to solid growth in Q2. Construction, industrial output and consumption should all be growth drivers, not drags, in Q2. Therefore, next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP data could easily outperform the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.3% growth rate 2. Looking at bilateral trade data, German exports have gone through a slight structural shift since the start of the year. While the share of German exports to the US is currently lower than in 2017, the share of other Eurozone countries like the Netherlands, Italy or Spain has actually increased. 3. At least in the short run, weakening demand for German products as illustrated by yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing new orders data could actually bring some relief. Particularly the manufacturing sector has been suffering from severe supply-side constraints, with capacity utilisation at its highest level since early 2008, a high lack of qualified workers and equipment as a limiting factor. Orders books are still richly filled and it would take a while before a protracted decline in demand would show in activity data. 4. Trade tensions are weighing on sentiment, not on activity. Obviously, trade tensions are the biggest threat to the German economy at the current juncture. Not so much due to tariffs or the possibility of tariffs but simply due to the fact that a potential trade war brings uncertainty and uncertainty brings a delay in investment decisions. All of this means that reading and understanding the German economy has become more complex. The long series of one-offs explaining the monthly, often highly volatile, ups and downs of German macro data since the start of the year has further complicated things. Just think of the harsh winter weather, strikes, timing of Easter and long weekends. For now, the only thing that is for sure is that the economy has lost its stellar performance but this does not mean at all that it has become an underperformer. Complexity does not mean failure. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With growing concerns about a no-deal Brexit in the past couple of days - as warned by such diverse personalities as Bank of England governor Mark Carney and Sir Liam Fox - the pound hit an 11 month low on Monday. However there has been a bit of relief for sterling - and UK holidaymakers heading overseas - in early trading today. Against the dollar the pound has edged up 0.12% to $1.2956, while against the euro it is virtually flat at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1199. Markets have other things to worry about too, with the continuing trade tensions between the US and China, and now the resumption of US sanctions on Iran. The latest move by the Trump administration has helped push the oil price higher on concerns about curtailed supplies from Iran. Brent crude is currently 0.37% better at $74.02 a barrel. A rising oil price is expected to lift commodity companies, and along with the weaker pound, should help the FTSE 100 to edge higher. Other European markets are also expected to move ahead, albeit only slightly: There is not much on the agenda in terms of economic news, but the key figures from Germany are already out. German industrial output fell 0.9% in June compared to forecasts of a 0.5% decline, while the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus has come in at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac19.3bn, lower than the expected \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20.3bn. In terms of company news US billionaire Stan Kroenke, the majority owner of Arsenal football club, has made an offer to buy the rest of the club he does not already own. He has secured the backing of minority stakeholder Alisher Usmanov for a deal which values the premier league club at \u00c2\u00a31.8bn. Elsewhere car dealer Pendragon has reported a 41% drop in profits to \u00c2\u00a328.4m, with car sales hit by the scandal over diesel vehicles and the consumer uncertainty caused by Brexit. But Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pizza has boosted half year sales by 12.8%, boosted by consumers ordering takeaways during the world cup and a continuing rise in online orders.",

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap. The trade dispute between the US and China has escalated further, as neither side shows any appetite for backing down. The Chinese government unveiled tariffs on $16bn of American goods today. Medical equipment, fuels, fish meal, wood waste, paper and paper waste, metal scraps, cars and bicycles are all on list of products targeted. Beijing was retaliating against Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to slap tariffs on an extra $16bn of Chinese goods overnight. These latest tit-for-tat moves mean there are levies on $50bn of goods moving each way between the two countries. So far, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy seems to be holding up under the strain. Trade figures released overnight showed that exports rose by 12.2% year-on-year in July, while exports jumped by over 27%. The decision to allow the yuan to fall against the US dollar may be supporting manufacturers, analysts say. But if the situation escalates, the global economy could be badly hurt. With the two sides deadlocked, a ship full of soybeans has been anchored off China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coast for a month - as its owners ponder whether to swallow the tariffs. Fears of a hard Brexit have hurt the pound again. Sterling fell to an 11-month low against the US dollar, at $1.2854. Against the euro, it dropped to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1091, a nine-month low. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, explains why traders are worried: he possibility of a no-deal Brexit has been looming over the pound for a while now but it seems to have asserted itself in traders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds even more this week since Bank of England governor Mark Carney said that the likelihood was now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncomfortably high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a sentiment later echoed by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade secretary Liam Fox. Elsewhere in the markets, Tesla board members have confirmed they are evaluating whether to take the electric car market private. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still some cynicism, though, as to whether Elon Musk will actually pull the idea off. And the oil price has slipped, due to trade war worries and a smaller-than-expected drop in US crude inventories. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. GW It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a month since the US and China imposed their first wave of tariffs, in early July. And ever since, a cargo ship full of soybeans has been waiting at anchor off the port of Dalian. Having failed to reach China before the deadline, the vessel is in limbo while its owners decide what to do. If they unload the beans now, they (or the buyer) would incur hefty tariffs. My colleague Rob Davies has been looking into the issue, and explains: A shipment of soybeans worth more than $20m (\u00c2\u00a315.5m) has been bobbing aimlessly in the Pacific Ocean for a month, a casualty of the escalating trade war between China and the US. Lingering uncertainty over the cargo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fate offered a timely reminder of the fallout from a dispute that intensified on Wednesday, as the US president, Donald Trump, unveiled a second round of tariffs on $16bn of Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to respond in kind. The Peak Pegasus, a 229 metre bulk carrier weighing 43,000 tonnes, has become the reluctant symbol of the potential consequences of this tit-for-tat trade spat. The ship, owned by JP Morgan Asset Management, was scheduled to unload about 70,000 tonnes of American soybeans in the Chinese port of Dalian on 6 July, shortly after Trump imposed a first round of tariffs on $34bn-worth of goods. As it rushed to shore in the hope of clearing customs before Beijing imposed retaliatory tariffs, the ship \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and its protein-rich cargo \u00e2\u20ac\u201c became an unlikely internet sensation on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. However, the vessel arrived just too late and has been sailing around in circles ever since while the cargo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owners, understood to be the agricultural commodity trading house Louis Dreyfus, decide what to do.... More here: The US-China trade row is also being blamed for falling oil prices today. Brent crude has tumbled by 3.5% today to $71.99 per barrel, while US crude is down 3.8% at $66.60. Economists are citing the risks to global growth posed by tariffs Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy in London, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US-China trade war is set to worsen, and its impact on oil prices will be gradual as the situation develops. Crude oil and refined products affected by additional duties will reduce their competitiveness in the Chinese market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The latest oil inventory figures from America have also hit the oil price. Crude inventories fell by 1.4 million barrels in the latest week, less than half the 3.3 million barrel draw analysts had expected. Trade wars can have many casualties. And the dispute between America and China is threatening the future of a paper mill in the state of Arkansas. Associated Press has the details: A Chinese company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement two years ago that it would spend more than $1 billion and hire hundreds of workers for a paper mill on the outskirts of this rural college town was seen as a much-needed shot in the arm for the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. A web video promoting Arkadelphia \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great place to call home!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd continues to tout the Sun Paper project and its potential to generate jobs and boost development. But optimism has been giving way to concern in recent months amid President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s escalating trade dispute with China. The threat of a full-blown trade war has delayed the project further and prompted the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governor to send his top economic development official to China to make sure it stays on track. It also has caused other Chinese companies considering investing in Arkansas to put their plans on hold. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like a dark cloud hanging over the future of the project,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stephen Bell, the president and chief executive officer of the Arkadelphia Area Chamber of Commerce. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Right now, the clouds are off on the horizon. But I think no one knows where the trade situation is going right now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... More here. By announcing new tariffs today, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is sticking firmly to its tit-for-tat policy on trade, says Art Hogan, chief market strategist at investment bank B. Riley. That means that the trade war is likely to escalate, Hogan warns (via CNN): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our $16 billion comes at a scheduled time, which comes up on the 23rd. China said we see your $16 billion and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll match your $16 billion.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pretty much match what we do until they have no more levers to pull. The bad news is the trade war fears in China are escalating. The major concern right now in trade is China. In case you missed this earlier, we learned overnight that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imports and exports both rose in July. Exports jumped by over 12% year on year, indicating that the trade war hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t caused serious damage yet. These photos from Lianyungang Port, in the Jiangsu Province of China, show that plenty of vehicle were lined up for shipment today: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest wave of tariffs haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spooked the US stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 24 points, or just 0.1%, while the broader S&amp;P 500 index is flat. David Madden of CMC Markets explains why traders aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panicking: Markets had a muted reaction to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement that it plans to impose tariffs on $16 billion worth of US goods, starting on 23 August. The token retaliation from Beijing keeps the trade spat alive, and it seems like China were doing it to send a message, rather than to inflict financial pain on the US. So far, China has managed a tit-for-tat response to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade tariffs -- including today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation to US plans for tariffs on $16bn of Chinese goods. But Beijing can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t respond in kind if Donald Trump implements his threat for 25% tariffs on an extra $200bn of goods, simply because China doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buy enough from America. Oliver Jones of Capital Economics thinks Beijing might change course, and target individual US companies. He writes: While China has so far responded to US tariffs primarily with duties of its own, it is reaching the limit of its ability to respond in this way. There are already signs that China is starting to target US multinationals operating there directly instead. We think that its response will increasingly take this form if the US imposes tariffs beyond those already in the pipeline. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 take on the US-China tariffs row: China is slapping additional import tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion worth of U.S. goods ranging from oil and steel products to autos and medical equipment, the commerce ministry said, as the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies escalate their trade dispute. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a very unreasonable practice,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the commerce ministry said on its website http://www.mofcom.gov.cn, responding to the United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision to slap 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion of Chinese goods on Aug 23. The slump in sterling today has given the London stock exchange a boost. The FTSE 100 has gained 43 points, or 0.5%, to 7761 points. With the pound lower, multinational\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overseas earnings are worth more in sterling terms (updated). Basically the Footsie is acting as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcup\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 side of the see-saw, as the pound drops - currently down 0.5% against the US dollar to around $1.287. Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have dipped in early trading, down $2.5 at around $377. Wall Street may not be convinced that the company is definitely being taken private, following that announcement from the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board. After all, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taking the appropriate next steps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is rater more guarded than Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bold claim that he has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153funding secured\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to take Tesla off the stock market at $420 per share. Newsflash: Electric car maker Tesla has issued a statement, in response to founder Elon Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments yesterday about taking the company off the stock market. Tesla says that Musk \u00e2\u20ac\u0153opened discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd last week with the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board about taking it private, to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better serve\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd its long-term interests. The board have met several times since, and are now evaluating the idea. Yesterday, Musk insisted that he had secured the funding to take Tesla private - even though it would be the biggest buyout ever. Leaving the stock market would take some pressure off Tesla, as it battles to hit its production targets... However, some financial analysts are sceptical that the plan would really work: American scrap metal and waste paper will also incur 25% tariffs at the Chinese border in two weeks. So, apparently, will US \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fish meal for feed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (which I think is used to nourish farmed fish, poultry and pork). China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new retaliatory tariffs will apply to 333 US products. Coal, diesel, cars and bicycles, medical equipment and steel products are all on the list, the Chinese commerce department says. Newsflash: China has announced it will impose retaliatory 25% tariffs on $16bn of US goods. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commerce ministry says it has been forced to retaliate to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very unreasonable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd levies on $16bn of Chinese exports (announced last night). China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measures will kick-in on August 23, the same day as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest levies, as it sticks to its policy of respond in kind to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade moves. So in two weeks, the two countries will be imposing tariffs on $50bn of each others goods. American officials are already working on plans for tariffs on another $200bn of Chinese products in September. Reuters reports that City traders are taking steps to protect themselves against sterling falling further: Nine-month and one-year sterling/dollar risk-reversals fell on Wednesday to the lowest since early-March 2017, as investors rushed to protect themselves from further weakness in the British currency. Risk reversals are a gauge of investor expectations for a currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s direction and are used to hedge against expected moves. The fall in sterling risk reversals indicates greater demand for put options, derivatives that give investors the right to sell an asset. This is from Miles Eakers of foreign exchange firm Centtrip: Sterling is being hit by fears of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno-deal Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, says Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM. Sterling was pounded by the Dollar and most of its major counterparts on Wednesday as fears heightened over the UK exiting the European Union without a trade deal in place. Concerns of a potential hard Brexit scenario have haunted investor attraction towards the Pound and have left the currency vulnerable to downside shocks. The selloff is gathering pace. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest damage: Pound vs US dollar: $1.286, an 11-month low Pound vs euro: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.109, a nine-month low Economics lecturer Daniel McLaughlin says the slide in the pound is bad news for UK consumers: [It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that a weaker currency makes exports more competitive, but it also makes imported raw materials pricier - so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not an undiluted win] Newsflash: The euro has risen over 90p against the pound for the first time since last autumn. Jordan Rochester of Japanese bank Nomura predicts the pound will keep falling ahead of the next crunch EU summit in October - when Theresa May will try to persuade leaders to back her \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcChequers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 deal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We remain bearish on the pound in the short term until the Brexit mess is out the way and look for the currency to enter a $1.27-1.28 range before the leaders summit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ouch! The pound just fell through $1.29 for the first time since August 2017. UK holidaymakers heading to Europe this summer just suffered a blow. The pound has weakened against the euro to its lowest level since last November, meaning trips across the channel have become a little more expensive. Sterling fell as low as \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1129, down 0.25% today. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all! Sterling has dropped to a new 11-month low against the US dollar, at $1.2909, and is also weaker against the yen and the Swiss franc. The pound has been under pressure this week, after trade secretary Liam Fox claimed that Britain was likely to leave the EU without a deal. Such a hard-Brexit could lead to chaos at the borders, and leave companies struggling to keep their supply chains running Christophe Barraud, an economist at Market Securities brokerage in Paris, has told Reuters that firms are trying to protect themselves from a sterling crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of companies can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait for the negotiations outcome in October so a lot of course are trying to hedge against a drop in the pound.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ANZ senior China economist Betty Wang agrees that Chinese factories have benefitted from the weaker yuan - even if Beijing hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been fighting a currency war. She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Currency devaluation, which may have helped exports to some extent, has been largely market-driven in our view and is not a preferred policy tool by Chinese policy makers as part of the retaliation measures.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Figures released earlier this week showed that Beijing hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been burning through its foreign exchange reserves, suggesting it has been allowing the yuan to drop rather than fighting it: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market suffered losses today, after America finalised its plans for tariffs on another $16bn of exports. The Shanghai composite index fell by 1.2%, as traders worried that the trade war keeps ratcheting up. Washington might be disappointed to see that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imports and exports actually rose in July, says Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: If the US was hoping that its $34bn opening salvo of tariffs would have an effect on Chinese exports this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s China trade numbers would have been a disappointment to them. Chinese exports for July saw a rise of 12.2% up from 11.2% in June, supporting the premise that for the moment we seem to be in a bit of a phoney war. We also saw a big rise in imports of 27.3% showing that domestic demand remains quite strong. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus with America remained close to a record high in July, despite the trade dispute. Reuters explains: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closely watched surplus with the United States dipped only slightly to $28.09 billion last month from a record $28.97 billion in June. Washington has long criticised China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus with the United States and has demanded Beijing cut it. Still, disagreements between the two major economic powers run deeper than just the trade balance and tensions remain over market access, intellectual property, technology transfer and investment. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. America has fired another shot in the deepening trade dispute with China. Overnight, Washington said it would impose a 25% tariff on $16bn of Chinese imports, taking the total amount being targeted to $50bn. The new levy will come into force on August 23rd, and will apply to 279 product types. It mostly affects industrial products, such as machinery, chemicals and semiconductors. Motorcycles and railway cars also feature. Announcing the move, the US trade representative declared that America was penalising China for stealing its intellectual property, saying: China directs and unfairly facilitates the systematic investment in, and acquisition of, U.S. companies and assets to generate large-scale technology transfer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. China is likely to retaliate soon, escalating the dispute that has been rumbling for weeks. But... China may not be suffering from the trade war yet. Data released this morning shows that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exports jumped 12.2% year-on-year in July, beating expectations. Imports surged by a sparkling 27.3% - meaning China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus shrank during the month to $28bn (from over $41bn in June). This is significant, as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first wave of tariffs (on $34bn of Chinese goods) began in early July. Those tariffs have been blamed for a drop in German factory orders, but today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures suggest China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is holding firm. Of course, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still early days. Global trade, like the massive container ships it relies on, changes course slowly. Plus, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers may be benefitting from the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker currency, given the yuan has fallen pretty steadily recently to a 13-month low. Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist for Capital Economics, explains: Adjusting for seasonality and price effects, we estimate that export volumes were essentially flat in July. Shipments to the US did weaken slightly, which suggests the tariffs had some impact. But this was offset by stronger exports to the rest of the world, most likely buoyed by the weaker renminbi. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets agrees that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade data is encouraging, especially in the current climate. China trade data showed stronger growth in both exports and imports, notably the latter, suggesting strong consumption both domestically and internationally. But Also coming up today... Wall Street will be watching for Elon Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next move, after the inventor/entrepreneur surprisingly announced he plans to take Tesla private. Shares in the electric carmaker surged last night, burning sceptical investors who had bet against the company. Going private would take some pressure off Tesla to meet financial targets (and prevent Musk having another row with the analyst community) However, shares aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t at the $420 level which Musk pitched his somewhat vague offer at (which has sparked grumbling about market manipulation), so Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future remains uncertain. Oil is calm this morning, having risen yesterday after the US issued new sanctions on Iran. Later today we get the latest American oil inventory figures, which may show a drop in stocks.

The fallout saw European markets fall sharply, with investors worried about contagion effects, particularly on banks exposed to the Turkish currency. The escalation of yet another trade dispute hit not only European and emerging markets but Wall Street as well.

This includes in other emerging markets [EMs], which tend to have limited trade and financial ties with, as well as smaller current account deficits than, Turkey. Meanwhile, the fragilities in Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector that are now grabbing attention are more acute than in most other EMs. </p> \n   <p>Having said all of this, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes are another headwind facing EMs that has arisen in the past few months: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is now slowing, EMs are now tightening monetary policy and the trade war is escalating. So the situation in Turkey could worsen sentiment towards EMs and also strengthens our view that EM growth will weaken.</p> \n   <p>Of course, investors are also worried about the implications of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems for the euro-zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking system and economy.

Any emerging market investor who has done even a modicum of due diligence will be aware of the monetary policy problems Turkey has been running for years. President Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consistent pressure on the central bank to keep interest rates low \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a product of his erroneous belief that high interest rates lead to inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has brought Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s macroeconomic situation into serious imbalance, hence placing the country in a vulnerable position. The chickens have now come home to roost.</p> \n   <p>US President Donald Trump has, in typical fashion, wasted no time in exploiting a minor diplomatic spat over an American pastor jailed in Turkey to add insult to Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largely self-inflicted injuries by slapping tariffs on Turkey \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which will further exacerbate today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide.</p> \n   <p>The outlook for Turkey from here remains bleak. Ten years of macroeconomic mismanagement will take a long time to fix even if Turkey begins to follow sensible economic policies from here on out. A recession, and possibly a banking crisis, now look extremely likely. Does Erdogan understand how serious the situation has become? Does he suffer from the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdictator problem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, in which his advisers are scared to give him bad news and prudent advice? One thing seems clear now: if Erdogan continues to blame \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe economic war\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinterest rate lobby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 then the outlook is even more complicated and any macroeconomic improvement less plausible.</p> \n   <p>We remain underweight Turkey as we have done for some time, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to remember that this is almost entirely a self-inflicted Turkish issue. No other emerging market country has a president who believes higher rates cause inflation. Investor sentiment towards EM more widely can temporary weaken, which is normal in periods of risk aversion, but such price action is not justified. If asset prices decline in other EMs just because Turkey does not have its house in order this should be viewed as a buying opportunity and exploited ruthlessly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5b6da2e7e4b048f8247cc392\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-10T14:37:36.966Z\">3.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Earlier Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister - and Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son-in-law had also tried to ease fears about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, including concerns about the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence.

                "bodyText":"The Turkish lira was already under pressure this week on concerns about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, but Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweet threatening to double tariffs on steel and aluminium sent the currency tumbling to new lows. The fallout saw European markets fall sharply, with investors worried about contagion effects, particularly on banks exposed to the Turkish currency. The escalation of yet another trade dispute hit not only European and emerging markets but Wall Street as well. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 74.76 points or 0.97% to 7667.01 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.99% to 12,424.35 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 1.59% lower at 5414.68 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished down 2.51% at 21,090.78 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.56% lower at 9602.1 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.45% to 743.73 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 191 points or 0.75%. On the currency markets the Turkish lira, down 20% at one point, is 15.6% lower. The pound is also under pressure, as continuing Brexit concerns outweighed improving growth figures (although manufacturing moved into recession). Against the dollar sterling is down 0.6% at $1.2742 but it improved 0.5% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1183 against a euro which has been weakened by worries about European banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exposure to Turkey. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems: Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unfolding economic crisis has deepened further after Donald Trump announced he is doubling US import tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium, stoking the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency freefall and rattling financial markets. The Turkish lira plunged by more than 20% against the dollar after the president announced the move, amid a widening dispute between Washington and Ankara over the imprisonment of the US pastor Andrew Brunson. Pressure has been applied on the country in recent days to stage an emergency interest rate rise to avert further economic damage. Revealing an increase in US taxes on Turkish steel imports to 50% and on aluminium to 20%, the president tweeted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The full report is here: The fallout from Turkey is unlikely to be felt too strongly elsewhere despite fears of contagion, says John Higgins at Capital Economics: Our view is that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems will continue to mount in the face of excessively loose monetary and fiscal policy...Despite a vague acknowledgement by the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister of the need for somewhat tighter policy, Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan was devoid of detail and followed an anti-market diatribe from President Erdogan. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing difficulties will cause a lot of trouble elsewhere, though. This includes in other emerging markets [EMs], which tend to have limited trade and financial ties with, as well as smaller current account deficits than, Turkey. Meanwhile, the fragilities in Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector that are now grabbing attention are more acute than in most other EMs. Having said all of this, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes are another headwind facing EMs that has arisen in the past few months: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is now slowing, EMs are now tightening monetary policy and the trade war is escalating. So the situation in Turkey could worsen sentiment towards EMs and also strengthens our view that EM growth will weaken. Of course, investors are also worried about the implications of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems for the euro-zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking system and economy. But while these concerns add to the long list of recent headwinds for the euro, neither the overall exposure of banks in the euro-zone to Turkey nor the direct links between the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and the country is large. This is also the case for the wider world. The exposure of US and UK banks to Turkey is negligible. And Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy accounts for just one percent of the global economy at market exchange rates. Heading into the market close in Europe, and investors have taken fright at the Turkish problems, with worries about contagion uppermost in their minds. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: European stock markets have been rocked by the plunge in the Turkish lira. The European Central Bank (ECB) warned that a number of eurozone banks might be exposed to the sharp decline in the Turkish lira. A number of Spanish, French and Italian banks are connected to Turkey in the form of foreign denominated loans, and if the Turkish borrowers haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hedged their exposure it might spark defaults. Should European banks incur write-downs on account of the Turkish currency crisis, investment sentiment is likely to be weak. Many financial institutions in Europe have their own non-performing loans to contend with, and they could be facing a similar situation in Turkey. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jamie McGeever has put today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall in the Turkish lira into context: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy editor on Turkish steel exports, which will now be hit by the new Trump tariffs: Erdogan is now repeating his previous pleas to buy lira: The situation for Turkey looks bleak and it is entirely of its own making, says Jan Dehn, head of research at investment manager Ashmore Group: The situation unfolding in Turkey is fluid, but essentially unsurprising. Any emerging market investor who has done even a modicum of due diligence will be aware of the monetary policy problems Turkey has been running for years. President Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consistent pressure on the central bank to keep interest rates low \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a product of his erroneous belief that high interest rates lead to inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has brought Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s macroeconomic situation into serious imbalance, hence placing the country in a vulnerable position. The chickens have now come home to roost. US President Donald Trump has, in typical fashion, wasted no time in exploiting a minor diplomatic spat over an American pastor jailed in Turkey to add insult to Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largely self-inflicted injuries by slapping tariffs on Turkey \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which will further exacerbate today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide. The outlook for Turkey from here remains bleak. Ten years of macroeconomic mismanagement will take a long time to fix even if Turkey begins to follow sensible economic policies from here on out. A recession, and possibly a banking crisis, now look extremely likely. Does Erdogan understand how serious the situation has become? Does he suffer from the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdictator problem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, in which his advisers are scared to give him bad news and prudent advice? One thing seems clear now: if Erdogan continues to blame \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe economic war\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinterest rate lobby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 then the outlook is even more complicated and any macroeconomic improvement less plausible. We remain underweight Turkey as we have done for some time, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to remember that this is almost entirely a self-inflicted Turkish issue. No other emerging market country has a president who believes higher rates cause inflation. Investor sentiment towards EM more widely can temporary weaken, which is normal in periods of risk aversion, but such price action is not justified. If asset prices decline in other EMs just because Turkey does not have its house in order this should be viewed as a buying opportunity and exploited ruthlessly. Earlier Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister - and Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son-in-law had also tried to ease fears about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, including concerns about the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence. Associated Press reports: In a bid to ease investor concerns about Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policy, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister says the government will safeguard the independence of the central bank. Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak on Friday also vowed sustainable and healthy economic growth as well as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong struggle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd against inflation, which currently stands at close to 16 percent. Albayrak was speaking at a conference where he outlined his ministry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new economic policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as the currency plunged, raising questions about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of our principles will be ensuring the full independence of monetary policy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Investors are worried about the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unorthodox economic policies, pressure exerted on the central bank, and a dispute with the United States that has led to sanctions. Before his second speech and after Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech, Erdogan was reportedly in contact with Russia: Turkish president Erdogan is making a second speech at the moment. He is currently talking about infrastructure spending, including better roads and tunnels. He says forget the lira, forget currencies and talks about being in love with the Turkish people. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, also sees echoes of the Greek troubles: If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a black swan event, this could be it, although we must stress that so the panic is very much confined to Turkey. Nevertheless, ghosts of Greece are still vivid in the memory for European investors and today is the first sign that the problem with Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s larger dollar debts is no longer confined to its borders. Three summers ago, Greece was forced to impose capital controls to prevent a run on its banks, as its future in the eurozone hung in the balance. Gavin Friend, senior market strategist at National Australia Bank, believes Turkey could soon be forced into similar measures: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Though hiking rates would be the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred option for Turkey to stem this crisis and help deal with inflation this seems unlikely given what we heard from President Erdogan today. If we assume IMF assistance is out of the question from both sides, that leaves capital controls. That is problematic given Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s need for foreign inflows - but of course they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be coming for now and stemming the flow the other way is the issue. This won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help in building trust between Turkey and international investors. Paul McNamara, investment director at asset management firm GAM, has written a fine explanation of the causes of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic woes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think that Turkey has a toxic combination of a weak external position (current account deficit), excessive private sector debt and a high level of foreign funding in the banking system. This is coming to a head as a much-needed demand slowdown is causing asset quality problems in the banks. The role of construction in the economy for example is comparable with that in Spain or Ireland ahead of the European bust. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think the Turks have exhausted the possibilities of rate hikes, and are backed into a corner by their inadequate level of currency reserves (the IMF thinks that Turkey has the least adequate level of reserves of the major EM economies. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politics are also a problem with the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son-in-law as Finance Minister and perception of political interference with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153independent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Central Bank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s developments have been very negative: President Erdogan made a belligerent speech with no reference to the need of a change of course. Finance Minister Albayrak made a content-free speech full of consultant platitudes. Finally, US President Trump doubled tariffs on Turkish metal exports \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is likely symbolic, but symbolising a lack of US support for the Ankara regime. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our strongly-held negative view on Turkey remains intact and we have not covered any risk.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deepening currency crisis is sending fear sweeping through the financial markets. All the main European stock markets are in the red, led by financial shares. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark stock index has sunk by 3% today. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has shed 2%, while Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is down 60 points, or 0.8%. Several European banks have significant operations in Turkey, such as Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BBVA, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UniCredit and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BNP Paribas. Unicredit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have fallen by 5.6%, closely followed by BBVA (-5.4%) Deutsche Bank (-5.3%), ING (-5%) and BNP Paribas (-4.2%) According to the Financial Times, the European Central Bank is worried that Turkish borrowers might not be hedged against the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness and begin to default on foreign currency loans. Those loans make up about 40% of the Turkish banking sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets, and are now a lot more expensive to repay following the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency crisis could force president Erdogan to impose capital controls, or seek help from the International Monetary Fund, says Brad Bechtel of investment bank Jefferies: Turkey has a handful of options including seeking an IMF program, capital controls, rate hikes, yield to American demands or do nothing and so far the only option he seems to be leaning towards is do nothing. His stubborn stance against the US and twisted view of the IMF combined with a fear of higher interest rates make the situation untenable. The complete loss of credibility in the central bank was the final shoe to drop and spark for the latest rout we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in the currency. Until decisive action is taken, they will continue to spiral out of control. Turkey is now suffering one of the most painful and intense currency crises in many years: The Turkish lira is plunging to new record lows following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweet. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now down 18% (!!) today, at over 6.5 lira to the dollar, compared with 5.5 lira last night. That means the currency has lost nearly a third of its value this week. A truly shocking plunge, suggesting Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is getting into serious trouble. NEWSFLASH: Donald Trump has announced he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doubling the tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium imports, as the diplomatic row between Turkey and the US deepens. Trump announced the move in a tweet, claiming it was in response to the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent slump. This further intensifies the battle between the two countries over US pastor Andrew Brunson, who is currently imprisoned over terrorism charges. The moves comes shortly after Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president claimed there was a campaign to harm Turkey by weakening the lira. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move has sent the lira sliding deeper into trouble. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now down almost 14% today at 6.3 lira to the dollar (a month ago it traded at 4.8). Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency crisis has deepened today, as president Erdogan attempting to calm the situation with a defiant address to the nation. After watching the lira fall to record lows in recent days, Erdogan declared that Turkey is facing an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic war\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which he vowed not to lose. Erdogan also urged Turkish citizens to help, by swapping any foreign currency for lira to help stem its losses. If there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anyone who has dollars, gold or euros under their pillow, I am asking them to take them to the bank and exchange them for Turkish lira. Turkish assets have been slumping in recent days, for several reasons 1) A standoff with the U.S. over a detained American pastor that Turkey, a NATO ally, has put on trial for espionage and terror-related charges linked to a failed coup attempt in the country two years ago. Washington has imposed financial sanctions on two Turkish ministers and warned of additional measures unless the pastor is released 2) Investors are worried about the Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policies since his election win in June. He has long pushed the Turkish central banks to cut interest rates, claiming this would lower inflation (most economists take the opposite view). The lira has slumped by around 10% today, extending yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deep losses. Paul Greer, portfolio manager at Fidelity International, argues that Turkey actually needs a massive interest rate hike of perhaps 10 percentage points, to restore market confidence. However, such a move would also probably drag Turkey into recession. Greer says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s macro challenges are numerous and well known - an overheating economy, a sizable external financing requirement, an outsized structural current account deficit, persistent double digit inflation, low net FX reserves and a large private sector debt burden. As a result of this, investor confidence in President Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regime has been waning for much of the past year but key cabinet changes made after the June 24th elections have been particularly damaging for sentiment..... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fundamental challenges are numerous, there are plenty of straightforward textbook solutions which, if implemented, can halt the downward spiral of investor confidence and asset prices. An aggressive interest rate hike from the Central Bank would be a good start, something of the order of +1,000bp that Argentina delivered back in May would be appropriate at this juncture. This would help slow the economy, probably into a recession, which would help crunch the relentless demand for imports and thereby alleviate some of the current account deficit problem. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics correspondent Richard Partington on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures: Warmer weather helped the British economy grow at a faster pace in the three months to the end of June, despite official figures revealing the manufacturing sector slumped into recession for the first time since the Brexit vote. The Office for National Statistics said GDP increased by 0.4% in the second quarter from a rate of 0.2% in the previous three months, helped by stronger retail sales and good weather enabling the construction industry to make-up lost ground from the heavy snow earlier this year. The better news for the economy comes after the Bank of England lifted interest rates to 0.75% last week, their highest level since the financial crisis a decade ago. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are working hard to build a stronger, fairer economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c dealing with the deficit, helping people into work, and cutting taxes for individuals and businesses.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Service industries experienced robust growth of 0.5% in the second quarter, with the retail and wholesale sectors providing the strongest contribution, helped by the warm weather tempting shoppers back to the high street. However, the latest snapshot from the ONS painted an increasingly lopsided picture for economic growth, with Britain reliant on the services sector amid a downturn for factory output. There were also indications of slowing growth in June, with the ONS revealing May was the strongest month of the second quarter. More here: Philip Hammond also dropped a loud hint that the UK government could push for new taxes on online retailers: Asked about House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lurch into administration today, and the wider problems in the high street, he told Sky News that: We want to ensure that the high street remains resilient, and that we also make sure that taxation is fair between businesses doing business the traditional way, and those doing business online. That requires us to renegotiate international tax treaties because many of the big online businesses are international companies. The EU has been talking about a tax on online platform businesses, based on the value generated. Chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond, has blamed Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slow growth in recent quarters on Brexit uncertainty. Speaking in Coventry today, Hammond told reporters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Clearly that uncertainty is having a depressing effect on economic growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hammond has been pushing for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, under which Britain maintained close links with the European Union. Back in January, he called for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continued cross-border flow of ideas, goods, services, people and capital\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, annoying cabinet colleagues who favour a hard break with the EU. The TUC make a very important point -- if you adjust for population increases, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth has been extremely poor since the financial crisis. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady blames weak investment over the last decade, which has meant earnings growth has been poor too: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest figures cap a dismal decade for the economy. But we should not accept weak growth as the new normal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the result of bad management of the economy. There has been too little investment and a failure to focus on getting wages rising. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we want a stronger decade ahead, the UK must catch up with the levels investment we see in other OECD nations. And the government must put action to get wages rising at the heart of its plans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However...Rebecca Long Bailey MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Business Secretary, is concerned that Sports Direct now has control of House of Fraser. She argues that the UK must reform its business rates system, to help high street chains compete with online retailers. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIt is unforgivable that the Conservatives have stood by and done nothing while tens of thousands of jobs have been put at risk. Their inaction has prepared the ground for the likes of Mike Ashley, notorious for his company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor treatment of workers, to hoover up businesses. Staff will undoubtedly be concerned about what the sale means for their wages and conditions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How many more of our most recognisable high street brands have to go under before the Prime Minister steps up and addresses the broken business rates system which is turning our high streets into ghost towns? Financial experts are pleased that House of Fraser has been saved from the abyss by Sports Direct - even though we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term plans for the retailer. Simon Underwood, business recovery partner at accountancy firm, Menzies LLP, says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153welcome outcome\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is possibly the best news from the High Street this year and a positive indicator for other ailing retailers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153House of Fraser is a strong brand and this \u00c2\u00a390m bid from Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley means many of its stores will be saved and its operations streamlined. The fate of the remaining stores is uncertain - some may be sold off separately and others will be closed. The new owners will bring a timely injection of cash, ensuring a future for the various concessions and providing a more stable platform for the business to restructure its operations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In a very fast-moving set of circumstances, this is a welcome outcome for both House of Fraser and UK consumers. It shows that there is light at the end of the tunnel and at least for the moment, a mainstay of the British High Street has been saved from the brink.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Michael Mulligan, insolvency specialist at Shakespeare Martineau, thinks it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for suppliers and staff: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now that Sports Direct has acquired the House of Fraser brand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including all of the stock in the business - it will allow continued operation with a likely focus on the flagship stores. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will be welcome news not only for suppliers who rely on House of Fraser for their livelihoods, but also for all employees involved. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is yet another significant High Street rescue mission and the crisis shows no sign of abating. With interest rates rising and less money in the pocket of the UK consumer, more household names may be at risk.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is still \u00e2\u20ac\u0153struggling to gain momentum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd despite growing faster in April-June, says Mike Jakeman, senior economist at PwC, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The improvement was partly driven by one-off events, such as higher consumer spending on food and drink around the World Cup, the heatwave and the Royal Wedding. However, there was also some evidence that hot weather and wall-to-wall football deterred shoppers from buying goods other than food or drink. The net effect was that household consumption grew at the same pace as in Q1. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Instead, the acceleration was driven by investment, which rebounded after a very poor first quarter, but only to the level seen at the end of 2017. Brexit-related uncertainty is still deterring large, export-focused firms from committing to investment plans. Net trade also subtracted from growth for the first time since late 2016, as a result of weaker exports of cars and planes. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK GDP report is rather mixed: Although the 0.4 quarter on quarter per cent growth for 2018Q2 is in line with expectations, the annual growth reading of 1.3 per cent is slightly lower than that the 1.41 per cent estimate (based on market interest rate expectations) by BoE policymakers and even lower than the 1.5 per cent \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctrend growth\u00c2\u00b4 considered by the Bank as our new economic \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnorm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. So does that mean that the Bank of England was wrong to raise interest rates to 0.75% last week? Not at all, he explains: What BoE policymakers have decided to do is store up interest rate \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcammunition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 should Brexit-related developments over the next few months require deep interest rate cuts to revive the economy. It is vital that financial markets and traders see all this so that selling pressure on the sterling currency recedes. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics makes an important point -- the slump in sterling since the Brexit vote has not healed the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade woes: Anthony Gillham, head of investment at City firm Quilter Investors, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very impressed with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth report. He warns that the UK is still \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcplaying catch-up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 after slowing last winter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While growth has improved slightly, it does so from a low starting point. Over the medium term, UK growth has been thoroughly unspectacular, with the domestic economy expanding at a slower pace than most developed countries. So with the pound at a 13-month low this morning, Gillham warns that imports will become more expensive.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a real risk of stagflation on the horizon, with the recent interest rate hike failing to address the fall in the pound, and the sentiment of Mark Carney and Liam Fox even talking the value of Sterling to its lowest point against the dollar in a year. The UK finds itself in a difficult situation where the Bank of England is hiking rates to try and keep a lid on import costs that drive up inflation, but it is doing so against the backdrop of weak economic growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The general climate of uncertainty that pervades is discouraging households form making big ticket purchases, while business investment is also stifled as a result of CEOs feeling cautious about starting big projects before they have more certainty about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future relationship with European trading partners. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate remains lacklustre. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s particularly concerned by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade figures, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The higher growth in the second quarter was largely due to stronger service sector output, which helped offset a contraction in industrial output and a widening trade deficit. While there was pick-up in construction output, the improvement was from a low base, and the sector continues to add little to overall UK growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The widening of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit in the quarter is disappointing, and reflects both a decline in goods exports and a rise in imported goods. The deterioration in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net trade position is further confirmation that we are still some way from achieving a rebalancing of our economy. These charts show how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit widened last quarter, and how it became MORE reliant on trade with the EU over the last year: UK economic growth is still \u00e2\u20ac\u0153way below the gains we were used to before the financial crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Rob Hodgson, Head of Wealth Management at GWM Investment Management. Economics journalist Dharshini David agrees that 0.4% growth isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t something to shout about John McDonnell MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chancellor, says the economy is suffering from Brexit uncertainty, and years of government cutbacks: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153More than eight years of unnecessary ideologically-driven austerity has created an economy unable to cope with the instability brought about by the Tories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mismanagement of the Brexit negotiations. The result is low growth and stagnant pay. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grow this anaemic, councils are going bankrupt and the NHS is now in permanent crisis while holidaymakers are being hit by the Tories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 falling pound. Labour will bring stability to the economy and rising living standards with long term stable planning and investment and by securing a Brexit deal that puts jobs and the economy first.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chancellor Philip Hammond has tweeted: Back on GDP, and this chart shows how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers had a tough few months: Newsflash: Sports Direct has bought House of Fraser for \u00c2\u00a390m, just a couple of hours after it fell into administration. The retailer, run by Mike Ashley, is acquiring all of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 51 stores, and its stock. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear what this means for the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 17,000 staff, though. In a statement, it says: Sports Direct International plc (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Company\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Group\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) announces the acquisition of the business and assets of House of Fraser from the administrators of House of Fraser Limited, House of Fraser (Stores) Limited and James Beattie Limited, the House of Fraser group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main operating companies (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Operating Companies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), for a cash consideration of \u00c2\u00a390 million (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Transaction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). Pursuant to the Transaction, the Group has acquired all of the UK stores of House of Fraser, the House of Fraser brand and all of the stock in the business. For the year ended 28 January 2017 (the last date to which statutory accounts are available for the parent company of the Operating Companies and prior to the appointment of the administrators), the House of Fraser group had gross assets of \u00c2\u00a3946.3m and made \u00c2\u00a314.7m net profit. Although Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate picked up in the last quarter, it has been modest for the last 18 months: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the breakdown sector-by-sector, confirming that Britain relied on its service sector for growth in the last three months, with construction also making a positive contribution. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rob-Kent Smith, head of national accounts at the ONS, on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The economy picked up a little in the second quarter with both retail sales and construction helped by the good weather and rebounding from the effects of the snow earlier in the year. However, manufacturing continued to fall back from its high point at the end of last year and underlying growth remained modest by historical standards. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit noticeably worsened as exports of cars and planes declined sharply while imports rose.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade gap has worsened, as the country continues to import much more than it exports to the rest of the world. The total UK trade deficit widened by \u00c2\u00a34.7bn to \u00c2\u00a38.6bn in the three months to June 2018, due mainly to falling goods exports and rising goods imports. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector drove growth in the last quarter, growing by 0.5%. The construction sector also had a good quarter, expanding by 0.9%. But the industrial sector shrank by 0.8% in April-June. That includes a 0.9% contraction across the UK manufacturing base. That means UK manufacturing is now in recession.... Breaking! The UK economy grew by 0.4% in the second quarter of 2018. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 0.2% in the first three months of the year, as the economy got back up to speed after the bad wintery weather. More to follow! The pound has fallen to a fresh 13-month low against the US dollar this morning. Sterling shed three quarters of a cent in nervy trading to hit $1.2740, its lowest level since June 2017. This means that the pound has shed 10% of its value since April, as worries over a hard Brexit have intensified. But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls are also due to the US dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength. Nervous traders are piling into the dollar, in the face of a mounting financial crisis in Turkey. The Turkish lira has gone through the floor this morning, tumbling a staggering 12%. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister (who happens to be the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son in law) is due to unveil \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a new economic model\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on Friday, which will include plans to cut the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit. Investors, though, are losing faith - and increasingly alarmed about the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence. As Charlie Robertson of Renaissance Capital puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The markets have lost confidence in the triumvirate of President Erdogan, his son-in-law as finance minister and the [central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] ability to act as it needs to.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Overnight, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned that Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy expanded by 0.5%, thanks to a pick- up in consumer spending. Can the UK match it? Michael Hewson of CMC Markets predicts that the UK economy rebounded strongly in the last quarter: A decent recovery across construction, manufacturing and services is expected to show 0.4% growth, with the timing of Easter, a Royal Wedding and warm weather set to paint a decent picture of economic activity. In an hour we discover if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right.... Retail expert Nick Bubb thinks some parts of House of Fraser can still be saved, saying: Hopes of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pre-pack\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd deal to salvage parts of the business (with Sports Direct?) still seem high\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The House of Fraser story is moving fast. Sky News are reporting that Mike Ashley, founder of Sports Direct, is close to agreeing a deal to take control of the company. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear, though, how many of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stores he would take on. Frank Slevin, chairman of House of Fraser, says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hopeful that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future will be sorted out soon. He told investors this morning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This has been an extraordinarily challenging six months in which the business has delivered so many critical elements of the turnaround plan. Despite the very recent termination of the transaction between Cenbest and C.Banner, I am confident House of Fraser is close to securing its future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd High street chain House of Fraser has confirmed it is appointing administrators after negotiations between investors and creditors failed to reach a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153solvent solution.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The retail chain, which employs over 17,000 people, has been forced to turn to Ernst &amp; Young as administrators after days of negotiations with billionaire tycoons Mike Ashley and Philip Day, and the retail turnaround fund Alteri Investors. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 59 stores are all set to open as usual on Friday, while EY attempts to arrange a sale. Some 31 stores were previously earmarked for closure under an earlier restructuring plan, so HoF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff now face fresh uncertainty. In a statement to investors, the company says: Court hearings are expected to take place at 7:30 am today, at which orders will be sought appointing individuals from Ernst &amp; Young LLP as administrators of each of the Operating Companies with immediate effect. Significant progress has been made towards completing a sale of the Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business and assets. The proposed administrators are expected to continue to progress those discussions with a view to concluding a transaction shortly after their appointment. My colleague Sean Farrell explains how HoF could now be broken up: The group needs about \u00c2\u00a350m after C.banner, the Hong Kong-listed owner of Hamleys, pulled out of plans to raise \u00c2\u00a370m to invest in House of Fraser. Most industry experts expected any rescue to involve putting House of Fraser into administration to allow a new investor to buy its most attractive stores without taking on loss-making sites. Plum locations include shops in Glasgow as well as Bluewater in Kent, Manchester, Belfast and Meadowhall in Sheffield. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we discover how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is faring, when growth figures for the second quarter of 2018 are released. Economists expect that GDP increased by 0.4% in April-June, as businesses got back up to speed after the Beast from the East hit growth. If they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right, this would mean the economy grew twice as fast as in the first quarter of the year. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still lacklustre growth in historic terms, extending the generally weak growth since the Brexit referendum in 2016 Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says growth should have picked up in the last few months - even though consumer confidence is subdued. The second quarter was altogether brighter, with good weather, a Royal Wedding and the World Cup all driving consumer behaviour. The latest ONS retail sales data suggests that food and drink sales have been positively impacted by the sunshine and the football, while spending in pubs also increased by 9.5% year on year in June according to Barclaycard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer analysis. Not all parts of the UK economy have been making hay in the sunshine however, with big ticket items particularly under pressure. Household appliance sales fell 14.8% in the year to June according to Barclaycard, and the football combined with the warm weather led to a June drop in sales for non-food retailers according to the ONS. Also coming up today... Department chain House of Fraser is fighting for survival, after days of increasingly frantic rescue talks to secure new funding for the company. The company is going into administration, following all-night talks with potential bidders such as Mike Ashley, the owner of Sports Direct, Philip Day, the owner of Edinburgh Woollen Mill, and restructuring expert Alteri.

Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour:</p> <h2>What are the implications for the global economy?</h2> <p>The direct impact of what looks like an inevitable recession in Turkey would be relatively small because, despite a population of 80 million and strong growth in recent years, the country accounts for only 1% of global GDP. Eurozone countries run a trade surplus with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a> but it is small. In the two previous Turkish financial crises since the turn of the millennium, European exporters have been able to divert their business to other markets. The European Central Bank has expressed concern about potential contagion through the eurozone banking system, with Spain, followed by Italy, the most heavily exposed countries.<br></p> <p>A bigger danger is that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crisis will spill over into other emerging market economies and there were signs on Monday that other countries seen as vulnerable were coming under speculative attack. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems are particularly acute because it has more than $300bn of dollar-denominated corporate debt, which is getting more expensive to finance by the day. However, other countries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as Mexico and South Africa - also took advantage of low US interest rates in the years after the financial crisis to borrow heavily in dollars and saw their currencies coming under pressure. The fear is of a full-blown emerging market crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/13/how-serious-is-turkeys-lira-crisis-and-what-are-the-implications\">How serious is Turkey's lira crisis and what are the implications?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b71adabe4b0cc3a88371818\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-13T16:16:06.993Z\">5.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The lira is weakening in late trading, and is threatening to plunge back the 7 lira-to-the-US dollar mark to a new all-time low.</strong></p> <p>Andy Birch, principal economist at IHS Markit, fears the lira will keep tumbling until Turkey raises interest rates:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The changes to reserve requirements in recent days and the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unspecified action plan has done little to stabilize the lira.

                "bodyText":"This liveblog is now closed, but you can catch-up with all the latest developments here: And finally, the Turkish crisis makes the front page of Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Guardian: The Times is reporting that UK holidaymakers are taking advantage of the fact they can now get eight lira to the pound: President Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defiant speech makes the front page of the Independent, and the Financial Times: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll back on Tuesday morning, UK time, with the latest market action. Stay tuned to the Guardian website in the meantime, for any breaking developments. Goodnight! GW Over in Asia, the markets are cranking back into action for Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session. And so far, the lira looks quite orderly - trading just below 7 lira to the US dollar, as in Europe earlier. The US stock market has close down lower tonight, as the Turkey crisis weighted on sentiment. The Dow shed 125 points, or 0.5%, to finish at 25,187. The wider S&amp;P 500 lost 0.4%. Energy companies led the sell off, dropping by 1.2%. Banks and miners lost 1%, reflecting worries that the lira crisis could create financial turmoil and dent economic demand. After a busy day, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the Turkish crisis: A fresh plunge in the Turkish lira sent tremors through global currency markets on Monday, amid fears that the failure of Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government to tackle its worsening financial crisis would have a domino effect on other vulnerable countries. The Argentine peso and the South African rand were the biggest knock-on casualties of a day of turbulence that saw the lira fall 8% against the dollar and Erdogan lash out at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic terrorists on social media\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as he accused Donald Trump of stabbing Turkey in the back. But the Turkish president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insistence that his country would survive an economic siege failed to reassure financial markets alarmed at the possible collapse of the strategically-vital emerging market country. Concerns that the 45% drop in the value of the lira this year would prove ruinous for companies that had borrowed heavily in foreign currencies prompted the renewed sell off of the lira and pushed up the cost of servicing Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit. Erdogan insisted that the Turkish economy was fundamentally sound and attacked the US president for imposing sanctions and doubling tariffs on Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel and aluminium imports last week over the house arrest of an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, on disputed terrorism charges. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are together in NATO and then you stab your strategic partner in the back,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Erdogan said as he came under pressure from the markets to respond to the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall and an inflation rate of more than 15%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: My colleague Martin Chulov has discovered that the lira crisis has been fuelled by a misunderstanding between the leaders of the US and Turkey. He writes: The currency plunge imperilling Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has been fuelled by a standoff between Donald Trump and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an over the fate of a Turkish woman detained in Israel whose freedom the US president brokered, and an American pastor held in Turkey whose release he demands in return, officials in Ankara claim. Those officials say that Trump may have \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmisinterpreted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 a discussion with Erdo\u00c4\u0178an over the pair - Turkish woman Ebru \u00c3\u2013zkan, jailed for alleged links to Hamas (but released last month), and Andrew Brunson, a preacher from North Carolina. It appears that Trump thought he had reached a deal for Brunson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s release, while Erdo\u00c4\u0178an believed he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d agreed to transfer the pastor to house arrest (as happened in July). Martin explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It took place on the margins of the Nato summit,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the source told the Guardian. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Erdo\u00c4\u0178an asked Trump for help with the lady in prison in Israel. There was only the two of them and a translator. Trump said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI need some traction on the pastor first\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. When Erdo\u00c4\u0178an said OK he meant that we are working on it. Then [US vice-president Mike] Pence, due to midterm election considerations, messed things up. Trump confused a process for an agreement.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That might explains why the White House has taken such a tough line on Turkey this week, imposing new sanction and starting the process to double tariffs on steel and aluminium. One late newsflash: Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has raised its benchmark interest rate to a blistering 45% (!), from 40%. As explained earlier, the peso hit a record low as the Turkish crisis rocked emerging market currencies (and as a political scandal continued to shake confidence). This rate hike is aimed at preventing the peso plunging even further, and suggest Buenos Aires is concerned that the markets could become more volatile in the days ahead. Time for a recap The currency crisis gripping Turkey has deepened today, sending ripples through the financial world and hurting emerging market countries across the globe. Fears over Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial position sent its currency spiralling to a fresh record low, hitting 7.2 lira to the US dollar. The lira has now lost a third of its value in the last week, as the crisis has escalated alarmingly. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market also had a rough day, with bank shares tumbling by over 10%. Economists fear that Turkish companies will struggle to repay loans priced in dollars, given the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plunge in value. Contagion caused jitters elsewhere too, with India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rupee and Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peso dropping to record lows. The Russian rouble and the South African rand hit levels not seen since 2016. A cocktail of problems are to blame, from Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surging inflation rate and current account deficit to the diplomatic row with America that means the Turkish economy faces punishing sanctions. Investors believe that Turkey needs to take decisive action, such as hiking interest rates from their current level of 17.75% to an even more painful rate - perhaps over 27%. President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is refusing to bow to pressure from the markets, though. He told an audience of ambassadors in Ankara that Turkey was under attack from overseas interests: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The developments over recent weeks have shown that Turkey is under siege. It is clear that these attacks will continue for a while.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Erdo\u00c4\u0178an also blasted US sanctions against its NATO ally, calling them a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stab in the back against Turkey.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has taken some steps to prop up the lira. It has pledged to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153provide all the liquidity the banks need\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which should help them to keep providing loans to people and businesses. Delphine Arrighi, fund manager at Old Mutual Global Investors, argues that borrowing costs must rise to prevent the lira plunging to fresh depths. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Other options could include capital controls, which seem more likely than an appeal to the IMF, but that would certainly not be the least painful and would most likely precipitate a recession while postponing the return of portfolio inflows. Hence a sizable rate hike followed by drastic measures of fiscal consolidation still appear as the most viable option to re-anchor the lira and pull the Turkish economy from the brink. Turkish authorities have also launched a crackdown against social media accounts, which it blames for spreading \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and undermining confidence in the economy. Even German chancellor Angela Merkel has weighed in, saying she hoped Turkey could be economically prosperous. She also called for Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank to be properly independent -- a touchy subject, as Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has been pushing it not to raise interest rates. There are fears that currency speculators could drive Turkey deeper into the crisis in the days ahead: And on the streets of Turkey, people have spoken of their concerns as import prices jump and the value of their savings shrinks. One told the Guardian: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really understand any of it. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an argues with Trump, and we end up trapped in a corner.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can just pray to God,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. The US stock market is heading lower, as worries over Turkey ripple weigh on Wall Street. Banks are bearing the brunt, with Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan both down around 1%. Traders remain worried that the Turkish crisis will escalate, unless Ankara takes more decisive steps - such as an interest rate hike. A bit more from Ed Conway: After a day of heavy losses, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchange has closed deep in the red with the benchmark BIST 100 index losing 2.4%. Financial stocks felt the full blast of the currency crisis, with some bank stocks falling by over 10%. The slump is even worse if you adjust for the depreciation of the lira, points out Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ed Conway in this thread about the situation in Turkey: Our economics editor Larry Elliott has written a new Q&amp;A on the Turkish crisis. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: What are the implications for the global economy? The direct impact of what looks like an inevitable recession in Turkey would be relatively small because, despite a population of 80 million and strong growth in recent years, the country accounts for only 1% of global GDP. Eurozone countries run a trade surplus with Turkey but it is small. In the two previous Turkish financial crises since the turn of the millennium, European exporters have been able to divert their business to other markets. The European Central Bank has expressed concern about potential contagion through the eurozone banking system, with Spain, followed by Italy, the most heavily exposed countries. A bigger danger is that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crisis will spill over into other emerging market economies and there were signs on Monday that other countries seen as vulnerable were coming under speculative attack. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems are particularly acute because it has more than $300bn of dollar-denominated corporate debt, which is getting more expensive to finance by the day. However, other countries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as Mexico and South Africa - also took advantage of low US interest rates in the years after the financial crisis to borrow heavily in dollars and saw their currencies coming under pressure. The fear is of a full-blown emerging market crisis. The lira is weakening in late trading, and is threatening to plunge back the 7 lira-to-the-US dollar mark to a new all-time low. Andy Birch, principal economist at IHS Markit, fears the lira will keep tumbling until Turkey raises interest rates: The changes to reserve requirements in recent days and the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unspecified action plan has done little to stabilize the lira. Significantly more than just official promises of action are needed to exit the current crisis. IHS Markit continues to believe that the most immediate step to be taken to rescue the lira is a sharp central bank rate rise. If this step is taken in conjunction with a shifting of government rhetoric, the plunge of the lira could pause and portfolio investment outflows may slow. Turkish citizens are struggling to cope with the impact of the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s astonishing losses in recent days, report Kareem Shaheen and Gokce Saracoglu in Istanbul. Some fear their businesses could shut down, while others who support the president say they will buy domestic products and shun goods from abroad. Those who cater to tourists, however, hope that the decline in the value of the currency will bring more foreign holidaymakers to the country. All declined to give their full names. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Go your way, nothing will happen to this country, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen the lira much lower than this in the 1990s,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one foreign exchange office worker. Money-changing offices in Istanbul were selling dollars at a much higher rate than the banks on Monday, however, saying the fluctuation in the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value was so unstable as to render the price they set meaningless. One vegetable and fruit seller said he had been forced to raise the price of imported products. A kilogram of bananas that cost 10 lira last week was now 15 lira. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to send Erdo\u00c4\u0178an away,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. While ordinary Turks struggle to absorb the effects of high inflation and a declining currency, some foreigners who earn salaries in dollars and tourists are buying up luxury items. Pictures on social media over the weekend showed queues of foreigners outside stores such as Luis Vuitton and Chanel. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of tourists, especially Arabs, buy from our store,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the manager of a high-end design store in Galata. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But every 15 days we have to buy new supplies from Europe. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their full report: European stock markets have closed in the red, as Turkish worries weigh on shares. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 shed 24 points, or 0.3%, to end the day at 7642. Holiday firm TUI was the worst-performing stock on the Footsie, losing 2.5%. Last week, it revealed it was taking a financial hit on euro-denominated loans taken out to fund hotel building in Turkey. The lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses push up the cost of repaying that debt. European banks with exposure to the Turkish economy also had a bad day. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BBVA lost 3.2% while Unicredit shed 2.5%. Argentina has been hit by the anxiety rippling through the financial markets today. The peso has fallen to a record low, at around 30 pesos to the US dollar. Back in April it was trading around the 20 mark, before a slump in market confidence forced Buenos Aires to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. The peso is also being driven down by an unfolding scandal involving alleged bribes made to former officials of the Kirchner government (which was in power until 2015). More than a dozen business people have been arrested, after it emerged that the chauffeur of a former government official had kept diaries which allege to show payments totalling millions of dollars. The ongoing investigation has also hit share and bond prices, as traders wonder whether more executives, or politicians, will be dragged in. Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama, currency exchange offices have been operating as normal in Turkey today. Here are some photos from Istanbul: While the slump in the lira is bad news for Turkish citizens, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something of a boon for tourists. For example, one pound is now worth 8.8 lira -- compared to just 4.5 lira a year ago. That makes Turkey an attractive destination for Brits, driving down the cost of accommodation and food. Economics columnist Matt O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Brien has written a pithy explanation of the Turkish financial crisis, which new readers might find particularly helpful: In another worrying sign, the cost of insuring Turkish government bonds has jumped today. The cost of a five-year credit default swap (which would pay out if Ankara can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t repay its bonds) jumped to 573 basis points, up from 452bp on Friday. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to data firm Markit, and suggests Turkish debt is now seen as riskier. Technically, it means it would cost $573,000 per year to insure $10m of Turkish debt. After several hours of volatile trading, the Turkish lira has settled around 6.87 lira to the US dollar. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a loss of around 7% today (a whopping move by usual standards), but also a small recovery on the record low of 7.2 struck overnight. It also means the lira has still lost a third of its value in the last week. The news that the Turkish central bank is offering more liquidity to commercial banks (see earlier post) seems to have stemmed the panic. However, investors still want to see more comprehensive action to tackle its inflation and current account deficit, such as a massive hike in interest rates. Reto Foellmi, economist from the University of St Gallen, fears that further lira losses could be disastrous: The vibrant growth of Turkey relied heavily on financing in foreign-currency debt. While Turkish exports get cheaper, Turkish companies face higher repayment obligations of the loans which hurts banks as well. As the Lira has a reputation as a weak currency, Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rhetoric puts oil into the fire. With a further weakening of the Lira, Turkey faces a downward spiral, where default could be the end. The Turkish crisis dragged world stock markets to a one-month low today. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell 0.6% this morning, as the Turkish lira hit fresh record lows against the US dollar. That was driven by losses in Asia overnight, in Europe this morning, and at emerging markets across the world. Dean Popplewell of City firm OANDA says anxiety over Turkey has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153severely bullied emerging markets into near submission.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In Japan, the Nikkei tumbled -2% to a five-week low overnight as a sell-off in emerging market currencies frightened investors, with the safe-haven yen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (\u00c2\u00a5110.20) appreciation also hurting sentiment. The broader Topix dropped -2.1%. Down-under, Aussie shares ended lower overnight, weighed down by materials and banks after the crisis in Turkey hit Asian assets, while global trade turmoil pushed commodity prices lower. The S&amp;P/ASX 200 index fell -0.4%. In S. Korea, the Kospi ended down -1.5%, in line with other Asian countries. However, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is holding its nerve. Wall Street is calm in early trading, with the Dow Jones industrial average up 60 points (or 0.23%). The EIU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Agathe Demarais adds that Turkey has a lot of work to do to regain market confidence -- but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear that such measures will be taken..... With an overheated and indebted economy, Turkey will require credibly orthodox economic policies, fiscal discipline and central bank independence to reverse the current situation. A normalisation of relations with the US could also reduce the amount of legwork that the central bank will have to do to control the economic situation, but this is unlikely to happen at the moment. In view of the domestic political and economic conditions, it is therefore unclear whether the necessary steps will be taken to contain the market fallout. Agathe Demarais, Turkey analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, has predicted that Western banks will suffer losses from the Turkish lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump soon. She told the AFP newswire that the impact of the currency crisis will ripple through the financial world, as Turkish companies find they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t service loans taken out in dollars. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So far the impact of the lira crash has been limited in Europe and the rest of the world. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, within a few months western banks that have strong ties with Turkey will feel the impact of the crisis as Turkish corporates will struggle to repay debt in foreign currency. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sharp depreciation of the lira has almost doubled the local currency value of external debt repayments since the start of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd German chancellor Angela Merkel has now waded into the crisis, urging Turkey to ensure the independence of its central bank. Merkel told a news conference in Berlin that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No one has an interest in an economic destabilisation inTurkey. But everything must be done to ensure an independent central bank,. Germany would like to see an economically prosperous Turkey. This is in our interest.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Turkish central bank has been restricted by Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opposition to higher borrowing costs (he believes they cause inflation, while most economists believe they restrict it). Turkish interest rates are currently 17.75% -- very high by current standards. Some City experts, though, argue they should be hiked by over 1000 basis points (to around 27%) to prop up the lira. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Associated Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on the Turkish leader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech earlier today. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says his country is under an economic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153siege\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that has nothing to do with its economic indicators. During an address to Turkish ambassadors in the capital, Ankara, Erdogan said Monday that Turkey would overcome the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153attack\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on its economy. He insisted that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy remains strong and said the currency would soon settle \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at the most reasonable level.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In an apparent reference to the United States, Erdogan said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the bullies of the global system cannot roughly, shamelessly encroach on our gains that were paid for by blood.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Turkish leader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments came after authorities launched investigations into hundreds of social media accounts for alleged reports they claimed were helping the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plunge. Erdogan said there is an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic terror\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd being waged on social media, adding that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153traitors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd would be punished. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters first take on the Erdo\u00c4\u0178an speech: President Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an said on Monday he expected attacks on Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy to continue but predicted the lira would return to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rational levels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd soon, after the Turkish currency hit a record low of more than 7 to the U.S. dollar. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an, who has described the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall as the consequence of a plot rather than economic fundamentals, also said that spreading false news about the economy was treason and recent U.S. actions were a stab in the back against Ankara. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clip of president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an addressing the Ambassadors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 conference a moment ago: The lira is weakening, following Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that America is trying to stab Turkey in the back. It has dropped back to 6.9 lira to the US dollar, close to this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record low of 7.2. President Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has also declared that spreading false news about false news about Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153treason\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That follows this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crackdown on social media accounts blamed for sharing misleading information about the crisis. Heads-up: Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is giving a speech now, 10th annual Ambassadors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Conference in Ankara. Bloomberg say Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has told the conference that Turkey must prepare for further attacks on its economy. He has accused America of breaking World Trade Organisation principles (presumably by doubling tariffs on Turkish metal exports last week). Erdo\u00c4\u0178an adds that America is trying to stab Turkey in the back. On the market turmoil, Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has told his audience that the lira would settle at a rational level soon. There is no \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceconomic basis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for recent exchange rate moves, he adds. There will also be no retreat from free market economic policies, he insists. More details to follow soon Some UK stocks are taking a direct hit from the Turkey crisis. Travel firm TUI is leading the FTSE 100 fallers, down 3.3% this morning. In theory, the slump in the lira makes Turkey a more attractive holiday destination. In practice, reports of financial instability are likely to deter tourists. Ashmore, a fund manager focused on emerging markets, is down 5%. Stockbroker AJ Bell explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fund management group Ashmore is widely seen as the London-listed bellwether for emerging markets and its shares are unsurprisingly being sold off in the wake of the crisis in Turkey. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The recent collapse in the Turkish lira has served to trouble investors around the world and triggered a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrisk-off\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mentality. Put simply, investors are less willing to hold assets in higher risk areas such as emerging markets, and are switching instead to assets deemed to be safer havens. Fiona Cinoctta, senior market analyst at City Index, reckons the Turkish government only has a few days to stem the crisis. She warns that the slump in the lira could prompt some companies to default on their US dollar loans, triggering a domino effect: The lira had already declined 20% against the dollar on Friday on a mixture of domestic financial problems and increasing friction with the US and the decline continued this morning with the Turkish currency plumbing new lows. For the time being Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial crisis looks localised but the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has perhaps only days to stop the decline of the currency before the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s freefall results in loan defaults, starts seriously affecting the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system and potentially starts spilling over onto European banks. Into this domestically induced financial slide comes the deteriorating relationship between Turkey and the US. The US is holding it against Turkey that it is refusing to support US sanctions against Iran and that is not releasing an American pastor who is being held on terrorism charges. The US response was fairly clear cut \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on Friday when the lira was in freefall the US announced it would raise the tariffs on imports of Turkish steel to 50% and the tariffs take effect Monday morning. The selloff at the Istanbul stock market is gathering pace. The BIST 100 index has fallen 4%, with some bank stocks suffering double-digit losses. You can get up to speed on the Turkey crisis with this Q&amp;A: Plus, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics editor Larry Elliott on why Turkey needs to raise interest rates sharply, or turn to the IMF for help.... Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s answer to the financial crisis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that his followers should do their patriotic duty and exchange rapidly appreciating US dollars for ever-more worthless Turkish lira \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is laughable. Indeed, it will merely add to the belief in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets that Turkey is being led by a man who has lost touch with reality. It is clear what needs to happen. Turkey has to tackle the three causes of its current predicament: an overheating economy; Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts since his re-election in June to prevent the central bank from taking the necessary action to deal with rising prices; and the stand-off with the US. For Erdo\u00c4\u0178an, that means eating a huge plateful of humble pie. He is going to have to surrender to Trump over [jailed pastor Andrew] Brunson, because he is damaging the economy by continuing with a fight he cannot win. And he will need to accept that tough and unpopular measures are now inevitable to prevent a total collapse in the currency leading to hyper-inflation. The slump in the Turkish lira in recent weeks is quite extraordinary. It has lost a third of its value against the US dollar in a week (!) as investors have grown more anxious about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial health, its diplomatic row with the US, and its central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reluctance (or inability) to raise borrowing costs to stem the crisis. This chart shows how the crisis could spread to Europe, if Turkish banks find themselves struggling to repay dollar-denominated debts: Turkish authorities have launched a crackdown on news and social media posts which are threatening confidence in the economy, according to local reports. Turkish financial regulators are threatening legal action against those who make or publish \u00e2\u20ac\u0153erroneous and fabricated news and statements\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Almost 350 social media accounts are under investigation, for undermining the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate against the US dollar. The move comes as president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office warns that there is a co-ordinated attempt to undermine the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. H\u00c3\u00bcrriyet Daily News has the details: The Chief Prosecutor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office in Istanbul has opened an investigation into actions threatening \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic security,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial watchdog launched a separate probe into what it described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fake news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd aiming to manipulate economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An investigation has been launched according to Turkish Penal Law, Banking Law, Capital Markets Board regulations and related laws into people who displayed actions that threaten economic security through manipulative stories on media and operational social media accounts as part of the economic attacks that target the Republic of Turkey, its social peace, unity and economic security by the powers behind the [2016] coup attempt,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the prosecutor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office said in a statement on August 13, according to the state-run Anadolu Agency. In a separate statement, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Interior Ministry said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a judicial investigation has been launched into 346 social media accounts who shared posts to provoke the rise in the dollar exchange rate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meanwhile, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Crime Investigation Board (MASAK) also launched a probe into what it described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fake news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd aiming to manipulate economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153MASAK started an investigation into people and institutions that spread fake news, such as those claiming that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe state will intervene to convert foreign exchange in accounts into Turkish lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcit will fix dollar exchange rate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by ditching floating rate policy, which is a main pillar of the free market,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Treasure and Finance Ministry Press Undersecretary Ali Berber said in a tweet on Aug. 13. More here: Turkey launches probe into \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 over lira rumors Overnight, the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s communications chief, Fahrettin Altun, has claimed there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disinformation campaign\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd underway to undermine confidence in Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sector. He is unhappy about reports that President Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is threatening to seize foreign currency deposits. Over the weekend, Erdo\u00c4\u0178an warned he would take new measures if businesses rushed to withdraw their bank funds. He told an audience in Trabzon that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is industrialists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 duty too to keep this nation on its feet. Otherwise we will set into motion our plan B and C.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Altun insist on Twitter, though, that this has been misinterpreted (although he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reveal what Plans B or C might be): Emerging currencies across the globe are suffering from the Turkish crisis. The South African rand has dropped to a two-year low, while Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rouble is at its lowest against the US dollar since early 2016. India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rupee hit a record low, with traders reporting that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank had intervened to prevent an even steeper loss. The Turkish lira is still sharply lower today, down 6% at 6.8 lira to the US dollar (having plunged through 7 lira in early trading). With the US dollar strengthening, traders fear that developing economies are going to suffer capital outflows - potentially creating fresh currency crises. Neil Wilson of Markets.com fears further pain for emerging markets [EM in City jargon]. The dollar is the big winner in all this as investors turn away from EM. This may very well make things worse, particularly as long-dollar increasingly becomes something of a one-way trade. This dollar rally has a lot further to go and this will heap more misery on EM. European bank shares are leading the selloff, driven by fears that they could be dragged into the Turkish crisis. Several European financial institution, including Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BBVA, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UniCredit and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BNP Paribas, have significant operations in Turkey. They have borrowed in US dollars and may struggle to repay those debts unless the lira recovers. BBVA shares have fallen by 2.2%, Unicredit have lost 2% and BNP Paribas are down 1%. On Friday, the Financial Times reported that the European Central Bank is concerned about their exposure to the Turkish crisis. Anxiety about spillover effects from Turkey is also pinning the euro at a one-year low against the US dollar (down half a cent at $1.137 right now). Yesterday, Turkish finance minister Berat Albayrak pledged that a new economic action plan would be implemented today. He announced: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153From Monday morning onwards our institutions will take the necessary steps and will share the announcements with the market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But that promise, and the Turkish central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new measures, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to be stemming the crisis. Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at financial services group ADSS, says Turkish policymakers need to do more: Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speeches over the weekend did little to calm down investors as he remains defiant and this morning news that the Turkish central bank implemented measures to improve liquidity is not addressing the main issue which is the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline. Ergodan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unwillingness to raise interest rates suggests that the situation might not be defused soon extending the risk-off sentiment seen across all markets. Anxiety over Turkey is hitting share prices across Europe too, following those losses in Asia earlier today. The main European indices have all fallen into the red in early trading. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has lost 0.8%, and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is down 0.45% or 35 points at 7631. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says contagion fears are engulfing the markets. The panic that engulfed the markets at the end of last week is showing no signs of going anywhere at the start of the new week. Traders were met with a sea of red as indices dived across the Asian session; investors shunned riskier assets overnight while safer havens such as the Japanese yen and Swiss Franc firmed; jitters surrounding the Turkish currency crisis were showing few signs of moving on. The Turkish Lira dropped a further 6.3% in trading overnight, breaking through TL7 and hitting an all time low of TL7.2 after comments from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan over the weekend failed to calm investors. The lack of any new significant policy and a defiant stance from Erdogan means that traders are bracing themselves for another day of hectic trading on Monday. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is suffering heavy losses this morning. The BIST 30 index of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top countries has slumped by 2.5% in early trading, with virtually every share down. Financial stocks, utilities and consumer-focused companies are all leading the selloff, as investors fear that the financial crisis is escalating. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at foreign exchange firm FXTM, argues that Turkish policymakers need take much more decisive action, immediately. With inflation expected to run above 20%, a current account deficit that continues to widen, bond yields trading at record highs and growing political tensions with the U.S., the Turkish administration have limited choices to stop the Lira from bleeding. Investors need to see serious economic measures and not political ones to prevent things getting completely out of control. This includes an emergency interest rate hike by the central bank, imposing capital controls, fiscal reforms, securing a rescue package by the IMF or other lenders and ending the current diplomatic fight with Donald Trump. Until such steps are taken, investors will continue to selloff Turkish assets. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has taken action to stem the crisis, after seeing the lira slump to a record low today. The central bank of Turkey has announced several measures to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153support financial stability and sustain the effective functioning of markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This includes providing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all the liquidity the banks need\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and taking a more active role in the foreign exchange markets. In a statement (online here), the bank says: The Central Bank will closely monitor the market depth and price formations, and take all necessary measures to maintain financial stability, if deemed necessary. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an attempt to stabilize the tumbling lira and improve liquidity in the banking system. The move is having some success - the lira has recovered to around 6.7 against the dollar, from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record low of 7.2. But, that still means it has suffered a huge depreciation in the last week: Crucially, the bank has NOT raised interest rates, despite some economists arguing they need to increase by perhaps 10 percentage points. Robert Bergqvist, chief economist at Swedish bank SEB, thinks more needs to be done: Asian stock markets and emerging currencies have been hit by the Turkish crisis today, and the euro has been dragged down to its lowest level in a year. My colleague Martin Farrer explains: The Turkish lira fell almost 9% in early trading on Monday and the euro hit a one-year low as investors feared that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial crisis could spread to European markets. Despite defiant words by the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an over the weekend pledging as yet unspecified action to reverse the slide, the currency slipped alarmingly against the US dollar on Monday. Asian stock markets were also down on Monday. The Nikkei in Japan lost 1.7%, Hong Kong was off 1.8%, Shanghai -1.7%, Sydney -0.5% and the Taiwanese bourse fell 3%. The euro dropped 0.3% to a one-year low against the US dollar on Monday as the falling lira fuelled demand for safe havens, including the greenback, Swiss franc and yen. The Vix volatility index measuring turbulence in financial markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c also known as the fear index \u00e2\u20ac\u201c jumped 16% on Monday. More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fear is sweeping through the financial markets this morning as Turkey falls deeper into a currency crisis. The Turkish lira has slumped to new record lows overnight, hitting more than 7 lira to the US dollar. That followed Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s precipitous declines, as investors fear that the country could be heading towards full-blown financial chaos. The crisis has been building for months as Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has surged higher, its current account deficit has risen, and its economy has been hurt by the strengthening US dollar. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasing autocratic governing stance - including putting his son-in-law into a key post running the economy - has spooked the markets. So has his dislike of higher interest rates, which would typically be used to prop up a weakening currency like the lira. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to double Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel and aluminium tariffs on Friday has added to the sense of panic. President Erdo\u00c4\u0178an did nothing to reassure investors over the weekend. Instead, in a series of public addresses, he blasted the United States over the dispute over a jailed US pastor, and appeared to hint that Turkey \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a Nato member \u00e2\u20ac\u201c might look elsewhere for help (Russia, perhaps?) He declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will say bye bye to those, who sacrifice their strategic partnership and alliance with a country of 81 million people on the altar of their relations with terror organisations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are working day and night for alternative markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Erdo\u00c4\u0178an also urged the Turkish people to do their bit, by converting any spare dollar and euros into lira. He told supporters in the north-eastern Turkish town of \u00c3\u0153nye that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there are dollars under your pillow, take these out. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there are euros, take these out \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 immediately give these to the banks and convert to Turkish lira and, by doing this, we fight this war of independence and the future. Because this is the language they understand.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Unless Turkish policymakers can get a grip, the situation could easily cause serious problems in other markets. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: The Turkish lira has taken a battering, and the banks in Turkey who have borrowed in euros might struggle to repay their loans if they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hedged their position. Some eurozone banks have substantial shareholdings in Turkish bank, and should the default rate rise in Turkey, it could have a knock on effect around Europe. It looks like the eurozone banking system is set for another period of turmoil as the exposure that some Spanish and French banks have to Turkey could hurt confidence in the region. European banks have enough to worry about with their own non-performing loans, and let alone Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakened loan books. When it comes to the health of banks, traders usually steer clear of stocks and seek out safe-haven assets such as government bonds or the Japanese yen. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

Back in May, <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-currency/turkeys-erdogan-calls-interest-rates-mother-of-all-evil-lira-slides-idUKKBN1IC1NV\">he called interest rates the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mother and father of all evil\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</a>. A month earlier, he <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/erdogan-blasts-central-bank-over-interest-rate-policy-129826\">criticised the Bank of Turkey</a> for defying him and raising borrowing costs, making the markets concerned about central bank independence.</p> <p>The conventional view, though, is that higher borrowing costs squeeze prices down, as they make credit less affordable.</p> <p>Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell, thinks <strong>Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s </strong>views are based on experience of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous financial problems</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The current Turkish situation bears all of the hallmarks of the Asian and Russian economic crises of 1997-98, which finally spilled over into the West and led to a short, sharp bear market in developed market share prices, while Turkey last got into serious trouble in 2000-01 when the lira collapsed.</p> <p> \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That crisis followed a period of rip-roaring growth funded by a rising budget deficit and rampant overseas borrowing that left the economy overheating \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which all sounds very familiar today, given Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $200 billion-plus of overseas debt, inflation in the high-teens and a current account deficit that represents nearly 6% of GDP.</p> <p> \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When the smash came in 2000, the Turkish lira halved in value and GDP plunged while unemployment and inflation soared. This all happened under the supervision of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which offered more than $20 billion in financial assistance between 1999 and 2003, in return for a package of interest rate hikes and fiscal austerity.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This economic disaster paved the way for the 2002 general election victory of the newly-created Justice and Development (AKP) Party under Recep Tayyip Erdogan, so no investor should be surprised by how Mr Erdogan is now responding.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153His rise to power was at least partly fuelled by public discontent with the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s version of economic orthodoxy, so it is no wonder he is determined not to follow the path of higher interest rates and lower government spending now.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given that he also called interest rates \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe mother of all evil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in a speech last May, raising the question of whether he wanted to pay interest and repay overseas loans, let alone could do so, all it needed was some unexpected development to puncture confidence in Turkish assets and prompt capital flight. After all, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccapital will always go where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s welcome and stay where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well treated\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as one-time Citigroup chairman Walter Wriston once said, and it may well be that Turkey now no longer fits that bill.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b72b547e4b0a246f44006c1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-14T10:59:33.265Z\">11.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency crisis won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t abate until the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank is allowed to raise interest rates, argues </strong><strong>David Kohl, chief currency strategist at Swiss bank Julius Baer.</strong></p> <p>He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Turkish lira has depreciated dramatically over the last few days.

                "bodyText":"A late update: Donald Trump is increasingly unhappy that Turkey still hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t released Andrew Brunson from house arrest, two years after the pastor was arrested on espionage charges. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told a press briefing that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The president has a great deal of frustration on the fact that Pastor Brunson has not been released as well as the fact that other U.S. citizens and employees of diplomatic facilities have not been released. Time for a recap. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government has come out fighting today against the market turmoil that sent its currency tumbling in recent days. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an raised the stakes, declaring that Turkey will boycott electronic products from the US. The Turkish president told an audience in Ankara that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will boycott US electronic products. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If they have iPhone, the other side has Samsung. In our country there is Venus, Vestel.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Finance minister Berat Albayrak also tried to restore confidence, pledging: We will make all kinds of preparations, from A to Z.... You will see that our lira will become stronger.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Albayrak also took a swing at America, saying that the US dollar had lost credibility after being used as a tool for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153political punishment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s environment minister also jumped on the boycott bandwagon, saying US products wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be used for Turkish construction projects. After days of losses, the lira has finally caught a break. It has rallied by over 8% against the US dollar today, back to 6.3 lira to the $, from almost 6.9 on Monday night. But the diplomatic rift between Turkey and the US hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been fixed. The White House is still demanding the release of American evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson, who has been held since the 2016 coup. Analysts argue that Turkey needs to take decisive steps to prevent the market mayhem continuing; eg, an interest rate hike, improved relations with America, and a strategy to lower Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit. Ripples from the Turkish crisis pushed India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rupee to a record low this morning, apparently forcing the Indian central bank to intervene in the FX markets. Over developing market currencies, such as the Mexican peso and the South African rand, strengthened though. In other news.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate has fallen to a new 43-year low, but wage growth remains disappointingly slow. Germany has posted 0.5% growth in the last quarter, helping the wider eurozone to expand by 0.4% - the same the the UK. After a calmer day than Monday, European stock markets have closed for the night. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 fell by 30 points, or 0.4%, even though worries about Turkey have faded. Mining stocks dragged the index down, as investors switched their attention to worrying about China instead. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Mining stocks are in the red after China revealed disappointing economic indicators overnight. Beijing confirmed that fixed asset investment grew by 5.5% - a record low. Industrial output held steady at 6% in July, but economists were expecting an increase of 6.3%. Retail sales rose by 8.8%, which was below the 9.1% forecast, and it was a slower rate compared with the 9% growth in June. The updates suggest that the Chinese economy is continuing to soften, and this prompted traders to dump mining stocks like Glencore, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. The German DAX ended the day flat while the French CAC index dipped by 0.17%. And in Istanbul, the Turkish stock market closed 0.75% higher - recovering some of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. At some stage, the Turkish leadership must move on from simply promising to protect the lira, and actually take action. Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group says president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an must take three steps. allows the Central Bank to significantly hike interest rates; de-escalate tensions with the US by releasing Pastor Andrew Brunson (or signalling a commitment to doing so) restore medium-term investor confidence via a credible program of fiscal consolidation and economic reform. The Turkish crisis could be a good opportunity for the EU to strengthen its relationship with Ankara. After all, both sides have experienced Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confrontational approach to diplomatic relations and trade. Rahman says: Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unpopularity in Europe makes it highly unlikely EU leaders are going to rally behind his approach. If anything, senior EU officials point to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153commonalities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that the EU and Turkey now both face vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis the US\u00e2\u20ac\u201don tariffs, threats and much besides\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand suggest these might be used as a jumping off point for any discussion that follows: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will tell the Turks we have sympathy for the situation they are in, but not how they are handling it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says one. Multiple meetings between EU and Turkish counterparts over the coming months will present an opportunity for the EU to better assess the situation; convey its concerns about Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deep-seated economic problems and reforms needed to fix them; and to potentially strengthen co-operation with Ankara. Turkey will be represented at the EU foreign ministers meeting at the end of the month; a potential Turkey, Russia, France and Germany summit, though still not confirmed, is scheduled for 7 September; and Erdogan is slated to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the end of September. Erdogan is also likely to want to avoid triggering another crisis with the EU. Indeed, earlier yesterday, Albayrak tweeted a very positive response to German Economics Minister Peter Altmaier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of new US tariffs. The Turkish mainstream (i.e. pro-AKP) media have also been quoting dovish remarks by Merkel. This suggests EU-Turkey relations are likely to continue to thaw, as we saw on 17 May at the EU-Western Balkans summit in Sofia. The blizzard of comments from top Turkish politicians is helping to underpin the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency. As this chart shows, the lira has recovered to around 6.5 lira-to-the-US dollar today - down from 6.88 lira/$ at the close of play on Monday. Traders are cheered by finance minister Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to make the lira stronger, and his pledge to stick to free market principles. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being taken as a pledge not to impose capital controls to shore up the exchange rate. Finance minister Berat Albayrak also pledged: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will protect the lira, we will march with the lira and the lira will strengthen greatly in the coming period.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And on the US dollar, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The dollar has lost its credibility. In times when the dollar has been turned into a tool for political punishment, we will continue to strongly take steps to protect the lira in international trade.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance chief has pledged to protect Turkish companies through the currency crisis, and predicted that the lira will recover its losses. Berat Albayrak, Treasury and finance minister (and president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son-in-law), said the government would protect the economy while sticking to free market rules and maintaining fiscal discipline. Details were scarce, though - but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough to keep the lira around 6.5 to the US dollar, a 5% gain today. Albayrak told members of the ruling AK Party, that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will make all kinds of preparations, from A to Z.... You will see that our lira will become stronger.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (thanks to Associated Press for the quote). Albayrak also followed Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead, by declaring that the US dollar is being used a means to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153politically\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd punish nations, and has lost credibility. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bold claim, given the US dollar has strengthened to a one-year high, while Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency slumped to an all-time low of 7 lira to the dollar yesterday.... Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boycott of American goods is gathering pace! The Turkish environment minister, Murat Kurum, has announced that Turkey will not use US goods in construction projects, Reuters reports. Kurum added that Turkey was going through an economic siege, due to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspeculative moves\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the value of the US dollar. The idea that Turkey will stop buying iPhones has received a mixed reception on the streets of Istanbul. Some Turkish citizens support president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boycott of US electronics, but others think the idea won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. Reuters reports: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We supported him with our lives on July 15,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd shopkeeper Arif Simsek said, referring to a failed 2016 military coup. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And now we will support him with our goods. We will support him until the end.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But shopkeeper Umit Yilmaz scoffed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have a 16-year-old daughter. See if you can take her iPhone away ... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All these people are supposed to not buy iPhones now? This can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd America has renewed its efforts to get pastor Andrew Brunson released from house arrest, two years after he was accused of espionage related to the 2016 Turkish attempted coup. Reuters has the details: The U.S. Charge d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Affaires in Turkey visited Andrew Brunson, the evangelical pastor whose detention and trial on terrorism charges has sparked a crisis between the two countries, and repeated a call on Tuesday for his case to be resolved. Jeffrey Hovenier, speaking outside Brunson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home in the coastal province of Izmir where he is under house arrest, said Washington wanted the pastor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as well as the case of the other unjustly detained Americans, and the Turkish national employees of the U.S. diplomatic mission\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd resolved fairly, swiftly and transparently. I mentioned earlier that White House National Security Adviser John Bolton told Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US ambassador yesterday that relations between the two countries won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t thaw until Brunson is released. The Turkish lira is holding onto its earlier gains, and is still up 5% at 6.5 lira to the US dollar. Edward Park of investment management firm Brooks MacDonald fears the rally won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last, though, unless Ankara take decisive action. How bad could the situation in Turkey get? Nick Brooks of asset management firm Intermediate Capital Group believes things will get worse before they get better, given its weak economic position. Brooks argues for a sharp hike in interest rates (from 17.75% today): The fundamental problem in Turkey has been the build-up of unsustainable economic imbalances (current account deficit if 6.3% of GDP, Corporate foreign exchange debt is 35% of GDP, inflation rate of 16%), while the economy is now in a vicious downward spiral with the fall in the lira leading to concerns about corporate and financial sector solvency, further pushing down the currency and increasing capital outflows. Only a sharp hike in interest rates to halt capital outflows and incentivise inflows will halt the downward spiral. Capital controls, if implemented, will not be effective as Turkey needs foreign capital inflows to fund its current account deficit and to re-finance large foreign currency borrowing coming due this year. Investors will not bring new funds into the country if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe they will be able to get it back out. Miranda Xafa, a former official at the International Monetary Fund, reckons Turkey could be forced to seek a bailout. Otherwise, it will struggle to repay debts issued in foreign currencies such as the US dollar, she explains: Amid fears that the Turkish currency crisis could pull down the eurozone, the German tabloid Bild has analysed the immediate effects it might have on German consumers. In a rather flippant article, it suggests the price of the popular chocolate spread Nutella should go down (as the hazelnuts in it come from Turkey). Jeans, and other items of clothing which Germany buys en masse from Turkey, should also get cheaper, it adds. But there are risks too. German banks have a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac17bn stake in Turkey, the paper points out (paywall). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less than other eurozone nations, such as Spain, whose BBVA bank is one of the most exposed to Turkey. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems have been building for a while, points out Witold Bahrke, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management. Bahrke explains how the strengthening US dollar has made Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit (the gap between what it imports and exports) a bigger problem. Turkey is in a genuine currency crisis, with the lira falling 30% over three days. Fundamentally speaking, the reason for the Turkish meltdown is primarily a large current account deficit, which is 6% of GDP, and reliance on outside capital. Markets do not care if liquidity stays abundant but can turn toxic when global liquidity dries up due to higher interest rates, the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance sheet shrinks, and the US dollar strengthens. Making things worse, there are serious doubts about the ability of policymakers to correctly assess what kind of storm is currently brewing and how to deal with it. Adding to the pain, a dispute between Washington and Ankara around the arrest of a US pastor in Turkey has prompted Trump to impose additional tariffs on Turkey this week. Altogether, we have a perfect storm. Why is Erdo\u00c4\u0178an so implacably opposed to raising Turkish interest rates, even though inflation has bubbled to dangerous levels? In a nutshell, the Turkish leader has an unorthodox view of economics, arguing that higher rates actually create inflation. Back in May, he called interest rates the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mother and father of all evil\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A month earlier, he criticised the Bank of Turkey for defying him and raising borrowing costs, making the markets concerned about central bank independence. The conventional view, though, is that higher borrowing costs squeeze prices down, as they make credit less affordable. Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell, thinks Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views are based on experience of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous financial problems \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The current Turkish situation bears all of the hallmarks of the Asian and Russian economic crises of 1997-98, which finally spilled over into the West and led to a short, sharp bear market in developed market share prices, while Turkey last got into serious trouble in 2000-01 when the lira collapsed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That crisis followed a period of rip-roaring growth funded by a rising budget deficit and rampant overseas borrowing that left the economy overheating \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which all sounds very familiar today, given Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $200 billion-plus of overseas debt, inflation in the high-teens and a current account deficit that represents nearly 6% of GDP. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When the smash came in 2000, the Turkish lira halved in value and GDP plunged while unemployment and inflation soared. This all happened under the supervision of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which offered more than $20 billion in financial assistance between 1999 and 2003, in return for a package of interest rate hikes and fiscal austerity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This economic disaster paved the way for the 2002 general election victory of the newly-created Justice and Development (AKP) Party under Recep Tayyip Erdogan, so no investor should be surprised by how Mr Erdogan is now responding. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153His rise to power was at least partly fuelled by public discontent with the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s version of economic orthodoxy, so it is no wonder he is determined not to follow the path of higher interest rates and lower government spending now. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given that he also called interest rates \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe mother of all evil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in a speech last May, raising the question of whether he wanted to pay interest and repay overseas loans, let alone could do so, all it needed was some unexpected development to puncture confidence in Turkish assets and prompt capital flight. After all, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccapital will always go where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s welcome and stay where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well treated\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as one-time Citigroup chairman Walter Wriston once said, and it may well be that Turkey now no longer fits that bill. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency crisis won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t abate until the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank is allowed to raise interest rates, argues David Kohl, chief currency strategist at Swiss bank Julius Baer. He writes: The Turkish lira has depreciated dramatically over the last few days. However, it is not the overall macro backdrop of Turkey that is so disastrous as to justify the sharp drop of the currency. Economic activity, including export dynamics and domestic demand, is actually growing at a solid pace. The sharp depreciation of the currency is driven by the fact that the Turkish economy is in constant overheating mode, with inflation above 15%. The reluctance of the central bank to step in has been weighing on the lira. Increasing signs that President Erdogan has been expanding his powers into the central bank, preventing rate hikes and articulating an outright demonisation of high interest rates, has led to the panic selling of the currency. Reuters have published more quotes from president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech in Ankara today. On the currency crisis, he called for Turkey to stay united: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Together with our people, we will stand decisively against the dollar, forex prices, inflation and interest rates. We will protect our economic independence by being tight-knit together.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He threatened retaliatory action against America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sanctions and tariffs: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will impose a boycott on U.S. electronic products. If they have iPhones, there is Samsung on the other side, and we have our own Vestel here.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also urged businesses to keep investing, and not be put off by the market turmoil: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we postpone our investments, if we convert our currency to foreign exchange because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s danger, then we will have given into the enemy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares in Turkish electronics firm Vestel have soared by almost 8%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benefitting from president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for Turks to buy its Venus smartphone instead of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s iPhone. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always been so dismissive of iPhones. Back in the attempted coup in 2016, the Turkish leader famously used Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FaceTime service to mobilise his supporters. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an made a video call to a Turkish television network, urging the people to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153convene at public squares and airports\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to oppose the Turkish military forces who were trying to overthrow him. The appeal worked, and Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has been tightening his grip on the Turkish levers of power ever since. By threatening to boycott American electronics, president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is signalling that he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be cowed by the market turmoil. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an interesting threat. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population is almost 80 million strong, meaning plenty of potential consumers. But...given the slump in the lira, US goods such as iPhones are now much more expensive for Turkish consumers - so sales of pricy imports were already likely to fall. Investors may be concerned that Ankara isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trying to calm the crisis - instead, relations with the Trump administration could be getting worse. As Neil Wilson of Markets.com puts it: Erdogan fired a shot back at the US with a statement saying he would ban US electronic goods. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine Apple is too worried about this, but it nevertheless points to a worrying deterioration in relations between Ankara and Washington. Erdogan doubling down like this won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help market sentiment. However, the lira is still holding onto its early gains as the currency stages a cautious recovery, after days of heavy losses. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Associated Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says his country will boycott U.S.-made electronic goods amid a diplomatic spat that has helped trigger a Turkish currency crisis. Showing no signs of backing down in a standoff with the U.S., Erdogan suggested that Turkey would stop procuring U.S.-made iPhones and buy Korean Samsung or Turkish-made Vestel instead. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If they have the iPhone, there is Samsung elsewhere. We have Vestel.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It was unclear how Erdogan intended to enforce the boycott. Erdogan also renewed a call for Turks to convert their dollars into the Turkish lira, to help strengthen the currency. The Turkish lira has nosedived in value in the past week over concerns about Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policies and after the United States slapped sanctions on Turkey angered by the continued detention of an American pastor. NEWSFLASH: Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president is giving another defiant speech, threatening to boycott American electrical goods in response to US sanctions. President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has told an audience in Ankara that the US was targeting Turkey. He warns: We will boycott US electronic products. If they have iPhone, the other side has Samsung. In our country there is Venus, Vestel [the Turkish smartphone brand]. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an also makes a direct threat towards the White House, warning that those who are waging \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic warfare\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd against Turkey will pay a price. According to Bloomberg, he says: There is a price we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying for the period we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in. But there will be a price [which] those who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re waging an economic warfare against Turkey will also pay. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is vowing to maintain a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153firm political stance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as his government takes the necessary measure to protect its economy. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an also argued that flip-flopping was not in the Turkish nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s character, and that switching to foreign currencies would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153giving in to the enemy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speaking at an event organised by Turkish think tank Seta (the Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research). These charts show the divide in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market, with unemployment at a 43-year low, but wage growth decidedly underwhelming: Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate has hit a new 43-year low. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate dropped to just 4.0% in April-June 2018, down from 4.2% previously. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest level since the winter of 1975, when Harold Wilson was prime minister. The Office for National Statistics reports that the number of people in work rose, while those out of work fell. However, the number of people dropping out of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour force also rose, and more people became self-employed. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: The number of people in employment increased by 42,000 on the quarter to 32.39 million in the second quarter of 2018. Unemployment declined by 65,000 on the quarter to 1.36 million. The level of inactivity increased by 77,000 on the quarter, resulting in the inactivity rate increasing to 21.2%. The number of self-employed people increased by 22,000 on the quarter to 4.77 million in the second quarter of 2018. However, people aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feeling the benefits in their pay packets. Total earnings (including bonuses) only rose by 2.4% per year during the quarter, down from 2.5%. Germany has beaten expectations by growing by 0.5% in the second quarter of 2018. The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy benefitted from stronger domestic demand from households and companies. Statistics body Destatis also reports that German exports rose during the quarter, while imports increased at an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153even stronger\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pace. Germany has outpaced the UK over the the last quarter (UK GDP rose by 0.4%), and was rather faster than France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.2% expansion. German growth in the first quarter of 2018 was also revised higher, from 0.3% to 0.4%. Teis Knuthsen of Denmark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kirk Kapital points out that Germany has now been growing for four years in a row: However, economist Ulrik Bie thinks Germany could still falter in the months ahead, as Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crisis and the US-China trade wars bite. Despite the rupee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide, the picture is brighter in other emerging markets this morning. South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rand has gained 2%, as it bounces back after hitting a two-year low during Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff . Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rouble is up 1.5%, reaching 66.76 to the US dollar having struck 68 (also a two-year low) on Monday. The Mexican peso is also catching a break, up 1% too. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is also rallying this morning, up over 2% in early trading. That mean shares have clawed back most of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. After days of very heavy losses, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency is recovering some ground. The lira has risen by around 5%, taking it back to 6.5 lira to the US dollar from over 6.88 late last night. That could be a sign that investors are recovering their nerve - however, this still leaves the lira in a precarious place (it was worth 3.7 lira to the dollar at the start of 2018). India shares another problem with Turkey, and indeed with all emerging markets -- the strengthening US dollar. As America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates, capital is being sucked out of developing markets and back to the US (because dollars offer a higher rate of return). That weakens EM currencies, putting pressure on their central banks to raise interest rates too -- which undermines growth. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says: Economies with large current account deficits such as India, Argentina and South Africa will come under increased economic pressure as the Fed continues to tighten monetary policy. The rupee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes are a sign that emerging market contagion is worsening, says Neil Wilson of Markets.com: India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rupee slipped to a record low against the dollar, with one USD buying 70 rupees at one point this morning. This follows the chaos in the Argentine peso market on Monday as the currency plumbed fresh depths even as the central bank raised interest rates by 5 percentage points to 45%. The rand is coming off its lows but the pressure across the board is there to see. The Financial Times says the rupee is suffering from investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 concerns about India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lack of progress in fiscal consolidation and the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s widening current account deficit. That sounds rather similar to Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems (without the diplomatic row with America, of course) Overnight, America has warned Turkey that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t end the diplomatic row between the two countries until US pastor Andrew Brunson is released from house arrest. White House National Security Adviser John Bolton met Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambassador to the US, Serdar Kilic, yesterday and insisted that Brunson -- who was arrested in 2016 and charged with espionage -- must be freed. Bloomberg explains: President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top national security aide warned Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambassador on Monday that the U.S. has nothing further to negotiate until a detained American pastor is freed, according to two people familiar with the matter, signaling a standoff between the countries will continue as Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial meltdown spreads to emerging markets. More here. Last night, my colleague Martin Chulov reported that a misunderstanding between Donald Trump and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an over Brunson, and a Turkish woman detained in Israel, may have helped caused the crisis. The Indian government is urging people not to panic about the rupee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide to a record low this morning. Subhash Chander Garg, economic affairs secretary at the ministry of finance, has blame the move on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexternal factors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (a reference to the Turkish crisis, and the wider US dollar rally, I think), adding that there is no need to worry. Newsflash: India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rupee has fallen to a record low, as Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency woes sends ripples through emerging markets. The rupee fell to 70.09 to the US dollar on Tuesday morning, as investors fretted that the lira crisis will spread to other developing nations. The slide means the rupee has lost a tenth of its value so far this year. Traders in Mumbai report that the Indian central bank may have stepped in to stabilise the currency after it fell through the 70-point mark for the first time over. N. S. Venkatesh, chief executive of the Association of Mutual Funds in India, told the AFP newswire that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors are concerned that the rupee has crossed the 70 benchmark today.... The Reserve Bank of India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy has shown concern for the rupee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fluctuations so investors should not be worried by knee-jerk reactions in the forex market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Turkey is in the eye of the storm today thanks to the currency crisis that has wiped a third off the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value in the last week. As we covered yesterday, the Turkish crisis gave other emerging markets a jolt yesterday - forcing Argentina to hike its interest rates to 45% after the peso hit an all-time low. President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an refused to bow to pressure from the markets yesterday. Instead, he hit out at the US for imposing sanctions in an attempt to force Turkey to release an American pastor named Andrew Brunson, who is currently under house arrest. He declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are together in NATO and then you stab your strategic partner in the back.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Currently the lira is bobbing around 6.8 to the US dollar, close to Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all-time low of 7.2. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank seems to have calmed the crisis a little, by pledging yesterday to provide liquidity to its banking sector. But worries over Turkey are mounting; its inflation rate is pushes higher, its current account deficit is worryingly high, and its companies may struggle to repay loans taken out in US dollars. The markets remain unconvinced that Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government can cope with the currency crisis, triggered by the diplomatic spat with Washington that has resulted in higher U.S. tariffs. Many economists argue that Turkey urgently needs a big rate hike, something Erdogan has opposed in the past. European stock markets are expected to open higher, having been dragged down by Turkish worries on Monday. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says investors will be watching emerging markets today. The selloff in the Turkish Lira and the knock-on effects to other currencies and asset classes will continue to attract attention through today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session. Also coming up today New UK unemployment data is expected to show that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate stuck at 4.2%, the lowest in over 40 years. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the good news. The bad news is that wage growth probably remains weak, with basic pay expected to only rise by 2.7% year-on-year. We also get a new estimate of eurozone growth in the last quarter; it will probably confirm that the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy expanded by just 0.3% in April-June.

Most of these liabilities fall on the private sector, mainly banks and corporations; the sovereign owes only $11 billion. What makes the problem worse is that the external financing requirement is trending up over the medium term, indicative of a long-standing over-reliance on foreign-funded leverage. </p> <p>As the lira collapses, this lending boom now is undoubtedly grinding to a sudden halt. Foreign financiers, whether they exist as banks or bond investors, are re-assessing the outlook and related repayment prospects.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap: Qatar has come to Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aid today, pledging to invest $15bn in the country to help it ride out its currency crisis. The offer came as Turkish president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an hosted Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, emir of the Gulf state (photos). Analysts believe the move will help Turkey ride out the crisis - with the money committed to helping the financial sector. In the long run, though, many investors are looking for conventional measures such as an interest rate hike. Turkey has escalated the diplomatic row with the US today, by slapping hefty tariffs on American imports. Cars, spirits and beauty products will all become much more expensive, as Ankara retaliates against America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s metals tariffs. Turkey has also taken steps to prevent traders betting against its currency. Financial regulators tightens the rules around foreign exchange derivatives, making it harder to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the lira. After days of heavy losses, the lira has staged a recovery. The currency has gained over 5% today to trade around 6 lira to the US dollar, compared with a record low of 7 earlier this week. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says: The limits on shorting the Lira taken by Ankara have halted the slide in the currency, which has firmed over 4% after its 20% decline, easing contagion fears and cooling the threat on financials. Whilst this is a short-term measure, its doing the trick for now. However, it was the more confrontational move by Ankara to raise tariffs on American cars, alcohol, cigarettes, escalating tensions with the US that has caught the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention and increased flows into safe havens such as the Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc. Financial markets have indeed had a bad day. Shares fell across Europe, and commodity prices were hit by worries over emerging markets - including Turkey and China. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story on the situation in Turkey: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today (unless any major news breaks tonight....) Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Political scientist Soner Cagaptay of the Washington Institute believes Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s help could be crucial for Turkey. He also points out that Ankara stood with Doha during last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blockade drama; Erdo\u00c4\u0178an loyalty then could be paying off now (as explained earlier). With a dull clunk, the copper price has sunk into a bear market. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lost 20% of its value since June! Three factors are driving the markets down, says Charlie Robertson of Renaissance Capital -- the buoyant US dollar, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade disputes, and the prospect of US interest rates going up. He says (via Reuters) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is dollar strength, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade wars and Fed tightening. They are an ugly combination for emerging markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Robertson is also cautious about Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to invest $15bn in Turkey. When will we actually see the money, and will it be invested sensibly? After a rough day, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has sunk to its lowest closing level since 26 April. The blue-chip index shed 113 points to 7497, a loss of 1.5%. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX closed 1.6% lower, while France lost 1.8%. Many developing markets also suffered losses today, which dragged emerging market shares into a bear market. The MSCI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main EM equities index is down 2% today, and 20% lower than its recent peak in January. Oliver Jones of Capital Economics blames worries about China, rather than Turkey: While there has been comparatively little news on the Sino-US trade war in the past few days, the Chinese activity and credit data released earlier this week were weak. They confirmed that domestic headwinds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially the ongoing slowdown in credit growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are at least as big a threat to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy as US protectionism. In our view, these headwinds mean that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy will continue to slow over the rest of this year. And this is a key reason why we think that EM [emerging market] assets will generally continue to struggle, regardless of what happens in Turkey. Countries that rely heavily on trade with China, most of whom are located in Emerging Asia, are probably particularly exposed. Alongside China itself, these countries dominate the main EM equity benchmarks, including the MSCI EM Index. Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move is a start, but not enough to rescue Turkey, says Mohamed A. El-Erian of financial services giant Allianz. BREAKING: Qatar has agreed to invest $15bn in Turkey, according to Turkish officials. This pledge follows the meeting between Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani and President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an in Ankara today. The money will apparently be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchanneled into Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets and banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The lira is strengthening following this announcement, now up 6% at 5.95 lira to the US dollar, from around 6.35 last night. Wall Street is also on the back foot, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping by over 1%. The big picture today is that shares are down, commodity price are taking a hammering, and many currencies are losing ground against the US dollar. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC index is having a particularly rough time, down 2%, with Germany and Portugal both down 1.8%. Zinc is down over 6%, and oil has lost 2.5%, as traders fret that an emerging markets crisis will hurt growth. David Madden of CMC Markets says dealers are worried about the currency crisis in Turkey, and the cooling of Chinese growth. European banks have lost ground today as investors are concerned the financial problems in Turkey could spread to the eurozone. Natural resource stocks like BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Randgold Resources and Glencore are all lower on the session as metals are under severe pressure. Copper, Platinum and Palladium are weaker as traders are concerned the Chinese economy is cooling, and yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing fixed asset investment and industrial production reports from Beijing confirmed their fears. The renminbi has been steadily losing ground versus the US dollar since March and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near its all-time-low, and that sums up the cautious sentiment surrounding China. Bank shares are also having a bad day, as Turkish contagion fears ripple. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning into a rough day in the City of London. The FTSE 100 index of top share is now down 121 points, or 1.6%, at 7490. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest level since late April. Mining stocks are still being hit hard , with some natural resource giants down over 5%. The strong dollar is pushing commodity prices down, and there is also concern that global growth could be hit by the Turkish crisis. If emerging market countries are forced to raise interest rates to support their currencies, it could dampen demand. Sterling is also being hurt by the dollar rally. The pound is down half a cent at $1.267, its lowest level in 14 months. Newsflash: Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president has held talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel. The two leaders agreed to strengthen their bilateral ties, according to Turkish officials. Associated Press has more details: Officials from Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office said during their conversation on Wednesday the two leaders confirmed their commitment to maintaining high-level visits and contacts to strengthen cooperation. They said that Turkish Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak would meet with his German counterpart, but did not provide a date. The two also discussed their planned meeting in Berlin at the end of next month, the officials said. Relations between Berlin and Ankara have been strained over the last couple of years. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an was angered when Germany blocked several rallies in the run-up to last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum, while Berlin protested when Die Welt reporter Deniz Y\u00c3\u00bccel was imprisoned - for a year - on propaganda charges. Just in: Photos of the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, conducting his \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworking visit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an today: A court in Istanbul has decided to release the Honorary Chair of Amnesty International Turkey, Taner Kilic, after more than fourteen months behind bars. Kilic had been detained in June 2017 and charged with membership of a terrorist organisation, which he denies. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interesting that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being released now -- at a time when Turkey is looking for help and support from other nations. Yesterday, two Greek soldiers who were arrested in March for entering Turkey illegally were released. However, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no legal progress on the case of American pastor Andrew Brunson, despite US pressure.... Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Secretary General, says the organisation is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153overjoyed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the news, and will keep pushing for more detainees to be released. Naidoo explains: Beneath the smiles of joy and relief there will be sorrow, anger and a steely determination. Sorrow for all the things Taner has missed during his cruel incarceration. Anger that the baseless charges against him and the Istanbul 10 have not been dropped. And determination to continue our fight for human rights in Turkey and for the release of all those human rights defenders, journalists and others who have been unjustly jailed in the vicious crackdown. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are overjoyed at this news. It has taken us more than a year of campaigning and struggle to get here, but it appears that Taner will finally be freed. Whilst we rejoice at this decision, our celebrations will only truly begin when he is safely back at home in the arms of his wife and daughters. Artjom Hatsaturjants, research analyst at Accendo Markets, says investors are nervous over the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153geopolitical back-and-forth between US and Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Neither side appears ready to back down over recent confrontation that sent the Turkish lira to new lows and raised a spectre of FX contagion across Europe. The turmoil in Turkey is testing stock market morale and sending the US dollar to its highest level since mid-2017, say Dean Popplewell of foreign exchange firm OANDA. U.S Treasuries prices have climbed a tad, while the greenback trades atop its 15-month highs against G20 currency pairs, again putting commodity prices under pressure. In Turkey, President Erdogan implemented an additional tax on a range of U.S imports (autos, tobacco and alcohol), signalling its squabble with the U.S. will continue. Crumbs. Foreign exchange firm International Currency Exchange (ICE) says it ran out of Turkish lira on Tuesday, after a surge in demand. ICE says that orders for Turkish Lira to its UK website www.iceplc.com jumped by 24,000% compared to the average last month. Most of its UK stores have sold out of lira, but you can still get your hands on them at London Luton Airport and Doncaster Airport. This surge in demand indicates that many British tourists have decided to take a last-minute holiday to Turkey, which are much cheaper thanks to the currency crisis. One pound is currently worth 7.7 lira on the international currency exchanges, up from 6 lira at the start of July. Louis Bridger, general manager at ICE, says there has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unprecented demand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the lira. We are working closely with our suppliers and the Turkish Central Bank to increase our stock however the demand is so high that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely we will be able to sell Turkish Lira online until tomorrow morning. We apologise if any customers are experiencing delays when purchasing their currency. For people travelling to Turkey who are unable to get their hands on Lira, they can take alternative major currencies such as US dollars and Euros which are easily exchangeable when they are out there.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European stock markets have all fallen into the red, as nervous traders pile into the US dollar. In London, the FTSE 100 has slid by 75 points, or 1%, with hefty losses on other markets too Mining shares are leading the selloff in London, with Anglo American shedding 4.5%. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re suffering from falling commodity prices, with copper and zinc on the slide. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly because the US dollar is rallying, hitting a 14-month high this morning. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, blames anxiety over the Turkish financial crisis: Turkey is nowhere near fixed, so risk appetite is struggling to make a comeback. European stock markets have steadily slipped into the red since the open, also leading a retreat by Wall Street futures. Prospects of a smooth and sustained recovery for emerging market currencies had looked too dicey to Asia-Pacific investors, so markets there mostly fell as well. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lira lost all Wednesday gains at one point, following Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bounce of more than 8%. It is now firmer again, though clearly volatile. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s uncertain whether the rebound will be sustained. Comebacks by other currencies that fell sharply in recent days, like the rand, Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rouble and Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peso, also falter. Turkish trade minister Ruhsar Pekcan says the new tariffs will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153protect the rights of Turkish companies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as well as retaliating against America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on steel and aluminium Pekcan also insisted Turkey isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dependent on the US, saying: The United States is an important trading partner, but it is not our only partner. We have other partners and alternative markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (via Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Anadolu news agency) Hiking tariffs won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help Turkey tackle its key financial challenge -- to keep servicing its foreign loans. Turkish companies owe almost $300bn in foreign denominated debt. That includes a surge in borrowing by Turkish banks, who have tapped foreign wholesale markets to help fund its credit boom. The slide in the lira in recent weeks has pushed up the cost of refinancing those loans (finding a new lender when an existing debt matures). Jurgen Odenius, Economic Counsellor at PGIM Fixed Income, explains: The root cause of the crisis lies in a leverage-financed domestic demand boom that increased the external financing requirement of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporations, banks, and government to an estimated $229 billion this year. Most of these liabilities fall on the private sector, mainly banks and corporations; the sovereign owes only $11 billion. What makes the problem worse is that the external financing requirement is trending up over the medium term, indicative of a long-standing over-reliance on foreign-funded leverage. As the lira collapses, this lending boom now is undoubtedly grinding to a sudden halt. Foreign financiers, whether they exist as banks or bond investors, are re-assessing the outlook and related repayment prospects. Western European banks from Spain and France are particularly exposed, with over half of the debt owed to them. The trouble is that the Turkish financial system and the corporate sector are short dollars. GAM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul McNamara says the issue is crucial: Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new swathe of tariffs are going to have a major impact on the cost of US goods. The list, published on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Official Gazette, shows that the levies on some products will more than double. For example: Rice: Tariff more than doubled to 50%, up from 20% Spirits: Tariff more than tripled to 140%, up from 40% Coal: Tariff raised to 14%,from 10% Beauty and make-up products: Tariff doubled to 60%, from 30% Certain types of paper: Tariff doubled to 50%, from 25% Motor cars: Tariff more than tripled to 120%, from 35% Back in Turkey, the government is preparing for show of support from Qatar. The emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, left Doha to travel to Ankara for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153working visit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an. The Gulf Times says they will discuss bilateral relations between Qatar and Turkey. They will also examine: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153means of strengthening the existing strategic cooperation between the two countries in various fields, in addition to a number of issues of mutual interest. Turkey and Qatar are close allies. There is a Turkish military base in the Gulf state, and Turkey was quick to send food aid to Qatar when Saudi Arabia imposed a blockade last year. However, the wealthy Gulf state might be reluctant to anger America by providing Ankara with financial aid at this time. Just in: New inflation figures show that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living squeeze continues. The consumer prices index rose by 2.5% in July, up from 2.4% in June - the first year-on-year increase in 2018. The wider retail prices index rose by 3.2%, down from 3.4%, and faster than basic pay (which increased by 2.7% in the last year). Total pay, including bonuses, only rose by 2.4% in the last year. This RPI figure is used to set UK rail fares, so commuters should brace for prices to increase in 2019. Turkish media are reporting that a court has rejected an appeal for the release of American pastor Andrew Brunson. Hurriyet newspaper said the court in Izmir rejected the appeal from Brunson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyer, but that a higher court would review the appeal. If Brunson remains under house arrest, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see US-Turkey relations improving.... Economist Jens Bastian fears for Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial prospects: Robert Ward of the Economist Intelligence Unit says Turkey needs a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdecisive orthodox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 response to the currency crisis (ie, a chunky interest rate hike), rather than tariffs on US goods. Bloomberg has calculated that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs cover around $1bn of US imports. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s similar to the amount of Turkish steel and aluminium exports that were subjected to higher tariffs by President Donald Trump last week, suggesting this genuinely is a tit-for-tat response. The lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery comes as Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial regulators impose new restrictions on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks. These rules make it harder for banks to buy and sell foreign exchange derivatives with overseas banks. That will prevent some investors from betting against the lira. Reuters has the details: Turkish banking watchdog BDDK on Wednesday said it is cutting the limit for Turkish banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forex swap, spot and forward transactions with foreign banks to 25 percent of a bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equity. The BDDK had said on Sunday that the limit would be 50 percent of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equity. n a statement, the BDDK said the rate will be calculated daily and new transactions will not be performed or renewed until the current excess of the amount is realised at a quarter of a bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital. Paul McNamara, investment director at asset manager GAM, says this squeeze will have helped the lira recover: Investor Martin Enlund points out that it will also make it harder for Turkish investors to protect themselves from the crisis: Boom! Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency just dipped back below the psychologically important 6-lira-to-the-dollar mark, as this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally continues. The Turkish lira has risen by 2.5% in early trading, after Ankara hit the US with fresh tariffs. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently changing hands at below 6.2 lira to the dollar, up from around 6.35 lira last night, extending Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still an extremely weak position compared to four months ago, though, when one dollar was only worth 4 lira. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Turkey has raised the stakes in its diplomatic battle with America by hiking the tariffs on some US goods. Fuat Oktay, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vice-president, says the measures are a retaliation for the US government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deliberate attacks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the Turkish economy in recent weeks. Under the plan, the tax on US alcohol will be hiked to 140%, the car tariff is going up to 120%, while tariffs on coal, cosmetics and rice are also being raised. Oktay declared on Twitter that Turkey was responding to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to double the tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium. He tweeted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The import duties were increased on some products, under the principle of reciprocity, in response to the U.S.administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deliberate attacks on our economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The move comes a day after president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an announced a boycott on US electrical goods, encouraging Turks to shun iPhones and support local manufacturer Vestel instead. Last night, the White House renewed its calls for Turkey to release the evangelical pastor who has been detained by Turkish authorities on espionage charges since 2016. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The president has a great deal of frustration on the fact that Pastor Brunson has not been released as well as the fact that other U.S. citizens and employees of diplomatic facilities have not been released.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So with the crisis still swirling, investors around the globe will remain nervous.

                "bodyText":"Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister sparked a recovery in the lira after he addressed thousands of international investors, pledging to protect beleaguered local banks and cut public spending to prevent the country defaulting on its loans. Berat Albayrak, who has faced criticism for failing to tackle the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing financial crisis, spoke to around 6,000 investors on a conference call to rebuff concerns that a funding squeeze on Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks and a damaging trade war with the US would force him to seek a rescue bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Albayrak, who was appointed as finance minister last month by his father-in-law, president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an, said Turkey will not hesitate to provide support to the banking sector, which was capable of accessing funds itself during the current turmoil in financial markets. He added that deposit withdrawals by panicked investors remained low and manageable. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are experiencing unfavourable conditions but we will overcome,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. The Turkish lira was up 4% against the US dollar following the conference call and after reassuring words from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chancellor, Angela Merkel, that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stability was important. A pledge by Qatar to invest $15bn in the financial sector has also helped stabilise the situation. However, Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to shore up confidence in the lira was quickly undermined by the US Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, who reportedly told president Donald Trump in a cabinet meeting that he was preparing further sanctions against Ankara. The lira slipped back to settle at just 1% up on the previous day. The lira had fallen by more than 40% since the beginning of the year before a rally earlier this week that buoyed investors, which was sparked by moves from the central bank to prevent speculators undermining local commercial banks. The finance minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention also touched on the impact of US trade tariffs, which Trump imposed after Turkey failed to release pastor Andrew Brunson. Last week Trump said he would increase import duties on Turkish steel imports to 50% and on aluminium to 20%, tweeting: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Albayrak said the country will turn to other partners \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as China and Germany \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to help it navigate the current situation. He added that major corporations that have large borrowings in US dollars were in a comfortable position to meet short-term liabilities. Turkish officials announced on Wednesday that they would be increasing tariffs on imports of certain US products as a local court denied the pastor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeal to be released from house arrest. Tariffs on American cars were doubled to 120% while the tariff on alcoholic drinks rose to 140%. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vice-president, Fuat Oktay, said on Twitter that the tariffs were increased \u00e2\u20ac\u0153within the framework of the principle of reciprocity in retaliation for the deliberate economic attacks by the United States\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Ankara said it will impose extra tariffs on imports of products including rice, vehicles, alcohol, coal and cosmetics without a US climbdown. Stock markets in Europe and the US, which declined on Wednesday, recovered on Thursday, although largely in reaction to better-than-expected corporate results than the situation in Turkey. The FTSE rose 0.8% to 7,562 while the German Dax nudged 0.4% higher to 12,220. The Paris CAC stood at 5,345, up 0.8%. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average showed its biggest percentage gain - 1.58% - in four months, buoyed mainly by hopes of avoiding a tariff war with China and Walmart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turnaround figures. Per Hammarlund, the chief emerging markets strategist at Nordic bank SEB, said that despite Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledges, Turkey could still be forced to seek help from the IMF.

The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) has been forced to hike interest rates sharply [earlier this year], which will have a dampening effect on credit growth. It will also increase default rates and the need for debt restructuring, hurting banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 asset quality.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153A credible commitment to grant the Turkish central bank monetary policy independence is critical. Unless the government introduces an austerity programme within the next weeks, an event such as sharply higher inflation (likely) or a large fine on Halkbank for violating US sanctions on Iran (possible) could trigger a full-blown balance of payments crisis, followed by a banking crisis. So far, the government has shown few signs of being willing to change course, either on economic policy or in its relations with the US. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The TRY is in for a bumpy ride on the road to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

It also includes tightening government spending, and giving the Turkish central bank the freedom to raise interest rates (something Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is opposed to).</p> <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Schmieding\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to-do list for Turkey:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Independent central bank</strong>: Making the CBT truly independent again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and thus able to pursue a policy that could inflict short-term pain for long-term gain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would make a policy change more credible.<br></li> <li><strong>Fiscal prudence:</strong> In emerging markets, monetary excesses often reflect prior fiscal choices. A monetary policy U-turn thus needs to be complemented by a sustainable fiscal policy. Otherwise, markets would suspect that the rising debt \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including the debt of institutions de jure or de facto directed by the government \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would eventually be accommodated by the central bank again. In such a case, the turn in monetary policy would not be sufficiently credible for long.<br></li> <li><strong>Change in key personnel:</strong> Appointing central bankers and a finance minister who command trust \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and who are perceived as being able to withstand political pressure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c could signal that Turkey is serious about a policy change. A finance minister who is the son in law of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autocratic president does not suit that description easily.<br></li> <li><strong>Mending relations with the US and the EU:</strong> US sanctions are not the cause of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s completely home-made economic problems. They merely triggered Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent sell-off. However, mending relations with the US and the EU would help in two ways. First, exactly because Erdogan may find it so difficult to ditch the policies that got him into trouble with the US and the EU, a shift in his approach to the US and EU could signal that he is serious about a change in economic policies as well. Second, US and EU concerns about Turkey partly focus on arbitrary detentions in Turkey. Anything that could be seen as strengthening the battered rule of law in Turkey may make Turkey a little more attractive for foreign direct investment again.<br></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b753973e4b030c7c692fb52\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-16T08:48:30.399Z\">9.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>Financial Times </strong>agrees that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister Albayrak faces a huge test when he speaks to investors on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/aug/16/turkish-financial-crisis-lira-finance-minister-berat-albayrak-investor-call-business-live?page=with:block-5b7513f9e4b030c7c692fa8e#block-5b7513f9e4b030c7c692fa8e\">this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conference call</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Some worry that Mr Albayrak and his team are simply out of their depth, having been caught off-guard by an economic and political crisis just weeks into the job.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have concerns that they fully comprehend the root of this problem,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a person who has dealt with members of Mr Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153They think their economy is in good shape and this is a pure economic war against them. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They keep saying there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a positive side [to what is happening] and that, if the lira is at TL6.8 to the dollar, it will improve exports and stabilise the current account deficit.</p> <p>Yes, that is true.

                "bodyText":"Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the Turkish currency crisis. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Goodnight! GW Wall Street is on a tear today, with the Dow Jones up more than 400 points (or 1.6%) in afternoon trading. Traders seem to be much more relaxed about Turkey and US-China trade wars than yesterday. Perhaps too relaxed, given we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve only seen modest progress on both issues today.... Ouch! President Trump also told his cabinet meeting that Turkey hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been a good friend, according to reports. Reuters says: The United States and Turkey have exchanged tit-for-tat tariffs in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to persuade Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to give up Brunson, who denies charges that he was involved in a coup attempt against Erdogan two years ago. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They have not proven to be a good friend,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump said of Turkey during the Cabinet meeting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They have a great Christian pastor there. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an innocent man.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd .... Trump said the United States had helped Turkey in a related incident, but that the NATO ally had not repaid the favor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They want to hold our wonderful pastor. Not fair, not right,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conference call with investors failed to really address one key issue -- whether interest rates will be raised sharply to support the lira (as some economists believe must happen). Robert Ward of the Economist Intelligence Unit say this is a big concern: The lira has pared some of its earlier gains, following Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to roll out more sanctions on Turkey. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now trading at nearly 5.9 lira to the US dollar, compared with 5.7 earlier. NEWSFLASH: America has signalled it will impose more sanctions on Turkey, unless US pastor Andrew Brunson is released from house arrest. The threat comes hot from the White House, where Donald Trump has been holding a cabinet meeting. During the meeting, the president criticised Turkey for holding the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wonderful pastor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd since 2016 on espionage charges. He then asked treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin about the state of play regarding Turkey. Mnuchin replied that America has put sanctions on Turkey, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we are prepared to do more\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to CNBC. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a timely reminder that the diplomatic row between Ankara and Washington could easily escalate, if Brunson continues to be detained. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a remarkable week for the lira. After plunging in early trading on Monday, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fought its way back as Ankara has clamped down on currency speculation, urged the public to help resist the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceconomic war\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and tried to reassure investors. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still much weaker than in April, when one dollar only bought 4 lira. A sense of relief has swirled through most of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets today. All the main indices have closer higher tonight, bar one -- Italian construction stocks declined in the aftermath of the Genoa bridge collapse tragedy. Otherwise, the FTSE 100 gained 58 points - or 0.75% - clawing back most of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Traders are a little less anxious about contagion risks Turkey today, following the Albayrak call. Worth noting, though, that the main Turkish stock index slid by 3.5% today, even though the lira recovered. Trade war worries have also ebbed, with China now planning to send a delegation to the US for fresh talks. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says: After heavy falls for the miners in the previous session, today the miners were the top sectorial gainer as metal process rebounded. News that China is sending a trade delegation to Washington for the first attempts at trade talks since the US levied tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports has boosted optimism that a deal between the two powers is still a possibility, even if a distant opportunity. Notably senior Chinese officials won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be in attendance, showing a level of caution from China over the ability of the two sides to reach a deal. However, for the markets it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a step in the right direction. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to strengthen its fiscal position (see earlier post) is likely to mean tough spending cuts. The Financial Times says: Turkey has set out plans to cut spending to bolster the lira as it seeks to navigate a way out of the crisis that has hit the currency and shaken emerging markets. In a much-anticipated conference call with 6,000 investors, Berat Albayrak, finance minister, indicated the country would largely use fiscal measures to slow down the economy and reduce a hefty current account deficit and inflation running at 16 per cent. Mr Albayrak said the government would be asking ministries for expenditure cuts of 10-30 per cent and that it would be aiming at a primary surplus of six billion Turkish lira for the rest of this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which analysts suggested could be Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest fiscal tightening this century. This chart shows how Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s external borrowing has risen sharply in the last few years, as a credit boom has driven growth: And this one shows how Ankara has run up larger budget deficits recently: Cristiana De Alessi of BNP Paribas has given Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new finance minister some credit for his comments today, but warned that Turkey faces a struggle. She cites Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reliance on external funding (its corporate sector owes around $220bn in foreign debt, according to CNBC): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The finance minister provided some comfort by acknowledging that rebalancing the economy is a priority through both fiscal and monetary policy and that capital controls aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an option.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The MTP (medium term programme) released in September will be key to see what concrete steps will be taken to turn this into sustained action. It will also provide a benchmark to measure the new government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s progress. My main concern is a lack of contingency plan if debt cannot be rolled over or if a slower growth rate exacerbates corporate NPLs. Turkey may require a stronger adjustment than is currently in their plans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Per Hammarlund, chief EM Strategist at Nordic bank SEB, fears that Turkey could be forced to seek help from the IMF -- despite Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledges today. He writes: Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak continues to reassure investors that Turkey will address its structural problems, but at this stage crisis measures, including sharply higher policy rates, a tightening of fiscal policy and support to troubled sectors such as construction, retail and banking will be key. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In sum, the economy is set to slow down sharply. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) has been forced to hike interest rates sharply [earlier this year], which will have a dampening effect on credit growth. It will also increase default rates and the need for debt restructuring, hurting banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 asset quality. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A credible commitment to grant the Turkish central bank monetary policy independence is critical. Unless the government introduces an austerity programme within the next weeks, an event such as sharply higher inflation (likely) or a large fine on Halkbank for violating US sanctions on Iran (possible) could trigger a full-blown balance of payments crisis, followed by a banking crisis. So far, the government has shown few signs of being willing to change course, either on economic policy or in its relations with the US. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The TRY is in for a bumpy ride on the road to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The CBRT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions this week and agreements with China and Qatar may take USD/TRY down to 5.50 or even lower, but without structural reform, the pair could reach 8.00 this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gulay Girgin of Turkish bank Sekerbank argues that Albayrak performed well, telling Reuters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first investor call. In general, I found it successful as the rhetoric suggests that they are aware of the problems in Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and reasonable solutions are being prepared. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very valuable that they underlined the negative effects of inflation on the economy and the target of single digit inflation was emphasized.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I also find the sustainable growth goal important. The importance of fiscal discipline was stressed. In a nutshell, it shows that problems of the economy can be discussed with investors and confidence can be restored. Paul McNamara of asset manager GAM is less effusive though: Ryan Connelly of Frontier Strategy Group was encouraged to hear Albayrak rule out capital controls: The lira is continuing to strengthen, following Berat Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conference call. It has now gained around 4.5% today, meaning one dollar is worth 5.7 lira, down from almost 6 lira to the dollar last night. Heres are the key points from Berat Alkayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first major performance before international investors: [FDI = foreign direct investment, such as the $15bn pledged by Qatar yesterday] Thousands of investors had piled onto the conference call. That shows the level of interest in Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predicament around the globe. Albayrak ends the call by saying he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like to meet investors soon. [Background: Some institutional investors have grumbled that Albayrak hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been willing to meet them and has been taking a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbunker mentality\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 since becoming treasury and finance minister in July] Earlier in the call, Berat Albayrak said he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect state-owned Turkish bank Halkbank to be fined by America for allegedly helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions. Halkbank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have jumped by 3.6% on this news. In May, a Halkbank executive was sentenced for two years and eight months in prison. He was convicted of charges of bank fraud and conspiracy to evade US sanctions for his role in a multibillion-dollar gold-for-oil scheme designed to avoid Obama-era sanctions on Iran. Some analysts have suggested that Halkbank could be targeted by Washington, if the diplomatic row with Ankara isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resolved. On US sanctions, Berat Albayrak says Turkey will turn to other parties - such as China and Germany - help it navigate the current situation. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 first take on Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conference call (which is still going on): Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said on Thursday Turkey won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hesitate to provide support to the banking sector, which was capable of managing current volatility, and there has not been major deposit flow from banks lately. In a conference call with investors, Albayrak said Turkey had already taken measures to curb forex funding and corporate sare in a comfortable position to meet short-term liabilities. Albayrak is now talking about the need to co-ordinate fiscal and monetary policy. In other words, the government and the central bank need to work together to fight the crisis. Investors, though, will want to know whether Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bankers will actually be given free rein on monetary policy, to raise interest rates. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take-home message for investors: Newsflash: Berat Albayrak says Turkey doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any plans to bring in capital controls [ie, restricting bank withdrawals and the movement of money in and out of the country]. It also isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning to turn to the International Monetary Fund, he tells investors. Albayrak is insisting that Turkey remains committed to the free market. On the fiscal side of things, Albayrak says Turkey wants to boost its primary budget surplus. All ministries have been asked to contribute to an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ambitious savings programme\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It sounds like he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promising to keep spending tight, saying that fiscal discipline is one of the anchors of the economy. Albayrak says that reducing inflation is Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top priority; it wants inflation to be in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsingle-digits\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as soon as possible. [Currently Turkish inflation is running at 15%] More snaps from Bloomberg: The crucial conference call between Turkey and thousands of investors is underway! Finance minister Berat Albayrak began by telling the call that Turkey will emerge from the current period of volatility stronger. He says that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector is healthy and strong, and capable of managing the situation. There hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been any major deposit flow from the banks either. We \u00e2\u20ac\u0153won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hesitate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to provide support to the banks if needed, Albayrak continues: More to follow.... Just in: Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic advisor has hailed the strength of the US dollar - even though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s causing serious pain in emerging markets. Speaking on CNBC, Larry Kudlow said the the strong dollar is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sign of confidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the United States, and good news for Americans \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of unrest around the world. Money is flowing into the U.S.A. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s terrific. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By the way, a strong dollar holds down commodity prices, gasoline prices are slipping, oil prices are slipping\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Kudlow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boss has also just tweeted about the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccherished\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dollar: However, a strong dollar INEVITABLY means other currencies are weaker, something Trump has labelled currency manipulation. The White House can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have it both ways. Newsflash: President Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has spoken by phone to French president Emmanuel Macron. The two leaders \u00e2\u20ac\u0153emphasised the importance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of improving bilateral investment, and economic and trade relations, according to the Turkish side. Macron also (apparently) told Erdo\u00c4\u0178an that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic stability was important to France. [He may have been thinking of the French banking sector; BNP Paribas is one of the European lenders with particular exposure to Turkey] This is why Turkey needs to persuade foreign banks to keep lending to its corporate sector: If Turkey can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t restore market confidence, it could become swept into a full-blown financial crisis that forces it to impose capital controls. This would prevent citizens and businesses emptying their bank accounts, stopping a run on the banking sector. But it could also create a wider crisis, undermining confidence in other emerging markets. Kamakshya Trivedi, co-head of emerging markets and foreign exchange research at Goldman Sachs, says capital controls wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t address Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big challenge - rolling over hundreds of billions of US-dollars worth of loans from foreign banks. He told CNBC this morning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Full-blown capital controls that everybody is worried about I think have a pretty limited chance of success, partly because they have a big external funding requirement. Back in the UK, social media personalities who gush about their favourite products -- but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reveal they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been paid -- have questions to answer. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) fears that some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153influencers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are breaching consumer protection law, which requires that any reward received for an endorsement is disclosed. It has asked a range of celebrities and social media influencers to explain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the nature of the business agreements they have in place with brands\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery today (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still up 3% at 5.8 to the dollar) There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a calmer feel in the markets today, with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 up 43 points or 0.6% at 7541. Yesterday it shed 1.5%, as investors fretted about a possible emerging market slowdown. Reports out of Beijing that the US and China will hold a new round of discussions at the end of this month has cheered the City, explains Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: This has prompted a rebound in the Chinese Renminbi from its recent lows while the continued recovery in the Turkish lira has alleviated short term concerns of a collapse in the currency. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the talks: Meanwhile in the UK, retail sales have bounced back thanks to the heatwave (which seems to have bunked off today, alas) and the football World Cup. The Office for National Statistics reports that retail spending rose by 0.7% in July, reversing a 0.5% drop in June. Food sales were strong, as Brits hit the barbecue and sustained themselves through England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s charge to the 3rd-4th place playoff. Online sales hit a new record high too, at 18.2% of total spending -- a reminder that the traditional high street is still under pressure. Turkey needs to make four changes to persuade the markets that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s serious about tackling its credit binge, argues Holger Schmieding of German bank Berenberg. And, awkwardly for Berat Albayrak, that includes appointing a finance minister who isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t married to president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daughter. It also includes tightening government spending, and giving the Turkish central bank the freedom to raise interest rates (something Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is opposed to). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Schmieding\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to-do list for Turkey: Independent central bank: Making the CBT truly independent again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and thus able to pursue a policy that could inflict short-term pain for long-term gain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would make a policy change more credible. Fiscal prudence: In emerging markets, monetary excesses often reflect prior fiscal choices. A monetary policy U-turn thus needs to be complemented by a sustainable fiscal policy. Otherwise, markets would suspect that the rising debt \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including the debt of institutions de jure or de facto directed by the government \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would eventually be accommodated by the central bank again. In such a case, the turn in monetary policy would not be sufficiently credible for long. Change in key personnel: Appointing central bankers and a finance minister who command trust \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and who are perceived as being able to withstand political pressure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c could signal that Turkey is serious about a policy change. A finance minister who is the son in law of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autocratic president does not suit that description easily. Mending relations with the US and the EU: US sanctions are not the cause of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s completely home-made economic problems. They merely triggered Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent sell-off. However, mending relations with the US and the EU would help in two ways. First, exactly because Erdogan may find it so difficult to ditch the policies that got him into trouble with the US and the EU, a shift in his approach to the US and EU could signal that he is serious about a change in economic policies as well. Second, US and EU concerns about Turkey partly focus on arbitrary detentions in Turkey. Anything that could be seen as strengthening the battered rule of law in Turkey may make Turkey a little more attractive for foreign direct investment again. The Financial Times agrees that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister Albayrak faces a huge test when he speaks to investors on this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conference call. Some worry that Mr Albayrak and his team are simply out of their depth, having been caught off-guard by an economic and political crisis just weeks into the job. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have concerns that they fully comprehend the root of this problem,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a person who has dealt with members of Mr Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They think their economy is in good shape and this is a pure economic war against them. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They keep saying there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a positive side [to what is happening] and that, if the lira is at TL6.8 to the dollar, it will improve exports and stabilise the current account deficit. Yes, that is true. But can you imagine how many people will declare bankruptcy one after another?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fledgling finance minister put to the test Berat Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family connections make it harder for him to establish confidence with investors. After all, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that the best possible candidate to become finance minister is also the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son-in-law. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a great look. Reuters has a good take: Albayrak must convince jittery markets that Turkish monetary policy will be determined by economic reality - and an independent central bank - rather than the powerful family chief behind his meteoric rise. Economists attributed the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s modest recovery on Wednesday to central bank measures which squeezed lira liquidity, raising borrowing costs without hiking the benchmark interest rate. Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public statements have so far had less success. Last Friday, from a hall in the ornate Ottoman-era Dolmabahce palace on the shores of the Bosphorus, he outlined the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new economic plan in a powerpoint presentation to bankers and business leaders. He promised central bank independence, tighter budget discipline, structural reform and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sustainable and healthy growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But the lack of detail or clear action worried markets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The issue here is that he lacks credibility,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Piotr Matys, an emerging markets strategist at Rabobank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to give him the benefit of the doubt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Berat Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise to power has attracted comparisons to another well-connected son-in-law, Jared Kushner. My colleague Martin Chulov explains how Albayrak has shimmied up the greasy pole: Albayrak completed a master\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of finance at New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pace University, before completing a PhD in Turkey. In 2006, two years after his marriage, he was appointed the chief executive of the energy and media conglomerate \u00c3\u2021al\u00c4\u00b1k, a role that opened connections across the region. In 2015, Albayrak was named energy minister \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the same year he became an MP. By later that year he had begun to consolidate political power, moving from one of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most influential businessmen to a figure at the heart of the power base \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and unmistakably tied to his father-in-law. He displayed a ruthless streak, eliminating perceived rivals within the ruling AKP party, such as Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s then prime minister, Ahmet Davuto\u00c4\u0178lu, and anyone perceived to be disloyal to Erdo\u00c4\u0178an. In the following years, Albayrak became both feared and formidable, acting as Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enforcer, while at the same time gathering powers that made him almost untouchable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as long as Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current leader remains in power. The pair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship has grown so close that Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trust has been described by those who know the pair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dynamic as almost unconditional.... More here: The lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally suggests Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to repel speculators is paying off. Yesterday, Turkish financial regulators imposed new restrictions on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks, which effectively made it harder and more expensive to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, or bet against, the lira. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s helping the lira to struggle back, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly room for further improvement: There are encouraging signs for Turkey in the financial markets today: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Living up to family expectations can be tough. But few sons-in-law will have faced such a daunting challenge as Berat Albayrak, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister. Albayrak, who just happens to be married to president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daughter Esra, has been facing a growing currency crisis since becoming Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treasury and finance minister last month. The surprise, and frankly questionable, promotion of the 40-year old Albayrak to such a crucial job arguably contributed to Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency crisis, as it indicated Erdo\u00c4\u0178an would be taking a more authoritative approach to economic issues. Today, Albayrak gets the chance to prove he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up to the task when he holds a conference call with international investors. Up to 3,000 investors and economists will dial in, Reuters believes. Albayrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s task is to calm the jitters that drove the lira to record lows this week. That means proving that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank is actually independent, and that Ankara is committed to tackling inflation, and reining in its current account deficit. With talk swirling that Turkey could be forced into capital controls, or an IMF bailout, Albayrak needs a solid performance -- something that shows that Erdo\u00c4\u0178an didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t goof when he kept such a vital role in the family. The call takes place at 4pm local time, or 2pm BST. There is some optimism in the markets this morning. The Lira has risen to 5.7 lira to the US dollar, up 3% today. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an improvement on Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record low of 7.2, but still 20% less than a month ago. Some traders are encouraged that Qatar offered Turkey $15bn of investment yesterday. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no progress in the diplomatic row with America over the US pastor, Andrew Brunson, who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still under house arrest. Yesterday was a ropey day in the City, and beyond. Shares fell across Europe, while emerging markets fell into a bear market, having lost 20% of their value since January. Commodity prices also got thumped, amid fears over Turkey, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, and trade war fears. Today may be a bit brighter, though; China has said it will send a delegation to Washington to discuss trade issues later this month.

He says:</p> <p><strong>Exports:</strong> The eurozone earns 0.57% of its GDP by selling goods to Turkey. Even a 20% fall in exports to Turkey would not subtract more than 0.1ppt from annual Eurozone GDP growth. As global demand remains healthy, eurozone firms could likely contain the damage further by switching to other markets for some of these affected goods with only modest reductions in their selling prices.</p> <p><strong>Financial linkages:</strong> Spain, France and Italy are the most exposed eurozone countries to Turkey. According to BIS data, the exposure to Turkey of banks domiciled in these countries stands at $81bn for Spain, $35bn for France and $18bn for Italy. A major part of this consists of equity stakes in Turkish banks rather than in more dangerous intra-company loans or direct credit exposure. Turkish losses may well affect individual institutions in the Eurozone visibly. </p> <p>Still, eurozone banks are in much better shape than they were during the 2011-2012 euro crisis which had come right in the wake of the 2008/2009 mega-recession. The risk that the exposure of some banks to Turkey could turn into a systemic problem for the eurozone and/or cause a tightening of credit conditions in Spain, Italy or France remains remote.</p> <p><strong>Confidence effect:</strong> The real risk stems from the level of noise. Confidence and hence the readiness to spend and invest often drives the business cycle. As confidence is currently fickle with no established trend, even small but highly visible problems can nourish the feeling that the world is a dangerous place rather than full of exciting opportunities. We therefore see a clear risk that any noisy crisis - such as the Turkish turmoil - could take some toll on the Eurozone and retard the upturn in markets and business sentiment for a while.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b76c184e4b016cd4306bc62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-17T12:39:19.379Z\">1.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Holger Schmieding, economist at Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Berenberg, says the bank has lowered its year-end forecasts for the euro to $1.17 from $1.21, due to the Turkey crisis.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Turkey is no small fry.

                "bodyText":"The Turkish lira has taken another battering today, falling 5% to 6.1 to the dollar (it lost nearly 7% at one stage) and the Turkish stock market is down 1%. It has been a tumultuous week that saw the lira go into meltdown on Monday when it hit a record low of 7.2 against the dollar and the panic spread to other emerging markets. A pledge by Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank to provide liquidity to banks and other measures, a pledge from Qatar to provide $15bn in loans to Turkey, and reassuring words from the finance minister yesterday helped calm nerves. But this afternoon, a Turkish court rejected a US pastor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeal for release, a day after the United States warned of further sanctions unless Ankara hands over Andrew Brunson, who is under house arrest. Reuters reported that a court in the western province of Izmir rejected an appeal to release the paster, saying evidence was still being collected and he posed a potential flight risk, according to a copy of the court ruling seen by the news agency. The lira has lost nearly 40% of its value against the dollar this year. The currency crisis has deepened concerns about the Turkish economy, in particular its dependence on energy imports and its foreign-currency debt burden. Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is expected to downgrade Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign credit rating after the markets close today. Turkish markets will be closed from midday on Monday for the rest of the week for the Muslim Eid al-Adha festival. European stock markets are down \u00e2\u20ac\u201c UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index down 0.4% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax down 0.7% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC down 0.5% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB down 0.9% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex down 0.3% On Wall Street, the Dow Jones and Nasdaq are flat. We are closing the blog for today. Have a great weekend. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. Even so, Schmieding reckons that the impact on the eurozone will be very limited. He says: Exports: The eurozone earns 0.57% of its GDP by selling goods to Turkey. Even a 20% fall in exports to Turkey would not subtract more than 0.1ppt from annual Eurozone GDP growth. As global demand remains healthy, eurozone firms could likely contain the damage further by switching to other markets for some of these affected goods with only modest reductions in their selling prices. Financial linkages: Spain, France and Italy are the most exposed eurozone countries to Turkey. According to BIS data, the exposure to Turkey of banks domiciled in these countries stands at $81bn for Spain, $35bn for France and $18bn for Italy. A major part of this consists of equity stakes in Turkish banks rather than in more dangerous intra-company loans or direct credit exposure. Turkish losses may well affect individual institutions in the Eurozone visibly. Still, eurozone banks are in much better shape than they were during the 2011-2012 euro crisis which had come right in the wake of the 2008/2009 mega-recession. The risk that the exposure of some banks to Turkey could turn into a systemic problem for the eurozone and/or cause a tightening of credit conditions in Spain, Italy or France remains remote. Confidence effect: The real risk stems from the level of noise. Confidence and hence the readiness to spend and invest often drives the business cycle. As confidence is currently fickle with no established trend, even small but highly visible problems can nourish the feeling that the world is a dangerous place rather than full of exciting opportunities. We therefore see a clear risk that any noisy crisis - such as the Turkish turmoil - could take some toll on the Eurozone and retard the upturn in markets and business sentiment for a while. Holger Schmieding, economist at Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Berenberg, says the bank has lowered its year-end forecasts for the euro to $1.17 from $1.21, due to the Turkey crisis. Turkey is no small fry. It contributes 1% to global GDP. Beyond the obvious geopolitical concerns, a major Turkish recession would pose a significant challenge for financial markets and for other economies. Remembering the tremors which Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s smaller neighbour Greece once sent through European and global markets, investors are understandably nervous. Adding to concerns about Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget and Brexit uncertainty, the noise from Turkey could delay the rebound in eurozone business confidence and growth for a few more months despite the easing of US-EU trade tensions. Over in the US, Donald Trump has revealed that he has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to look into whether American companies should report earnings on a half-year, rather than a quarterly basis. The Turkish lira is still down 5.4% on the day, with one dollar buying 6.14 lira. The Turkish stock market has turned positive, however, gaining 0.6%. Other emerging markets currencies are also under pressure, with the Mexian peso down 0.7% and the South African rand losing 0.9%. European stock markets have turned negative, after a Turkish court rejected the US pastor Andrew Brunson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeal for release. UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index down 0.46% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax down 0.58% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC down 0.28% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB down 1.2% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex down 0.4% Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, has tweeted: He wrote earlier this morning: A $15bn rescue package from Qatar, and a limited package of exchange controls in limiting banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to take out short positions has bought the Turkish lira some brief respite in the last few days, but let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not kid ourselves here, unless president Erdogan takes steps to restore confidence in his stewardship of the Turkish economy then we could well see the lira come under further pressure. The US doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear in any mood to relieve the pressure on the Turkish government in securing the release of their pastor, if recent comments from vice President Mike Pence, and Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin are any guide. President Erdogan may be able to defray some of the risks to the Turkish economy by trying to improving his ties with Germany and Russia, but if the US really wanted to turn the screws it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely that these countries would be able to do much about it. One currency trader told Reuters that the weakness of the lira was driven by the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new US sanctions threat and the S&amp;P decision, with position-closing in markets ahead of the public holiday\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is expected to downgrade Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign credit rating after markets close today. Next week, the Turkish markets will be closed for Eid al-Adha, the Festival of Sacrifice, from Tuesday until Friday. The Turkish stock market has slid 1.3% today. William Jackson of Capital Economics said: There has been no sign that the central bank will be allowed to raise interest rates significantly and return rates to positive territory. Similarly, there has been no improvement in relations with the US, and additional sanctions may be on the horizon. The Turkish lira is under pressure again, falling nearly 7% against the dollar at one stage to 6.24. It is now trading at 6.04, down 4% on the day. The currency has lost almost 40% against the dollar this year, hit by a diplomatic row with the US and and investor concerns about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial policies and its foreign-currency debts. The independence of the Turkish central bank and its finance minister have been called into question. The central bank is refusing to raise interest rates to curb inflation, with Turkish president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an opposed to rate hikes. The appointment of his son-in-law Berat Albayrak as finance and treasury minister last month also alarmed investors, although Albayrak managed to calm nerves yesterday when he addressed thousands of investors and analysts on a conference call. After nearly nine years of financial crises and austerity, Greece is about to come out of its third bailout programme \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on Monday, at midnight. Greece borrowed more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac288bn from international creditors in the biggest bailout in history. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, said earlier this week that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes would not affect Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the bailout. He said: A clean exit is based on the following: the Eurogroup agreement on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt management, and the cash buffer the government has created which guarantees that the public sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s funding needs will be met in the next two or three years. Therefore, the Greek government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans are not affected by short-term turmoil in the markets. On 21 August, Greece is turning the page, and this is final. You can read more here. According to the Deutsche Bank economist Oliver Harvey, the UK, Germany and the US have lent the most to Turkey, says Ed Conway, economics editor at the Times. We are trying to get hold of the note... Turkish president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration has been adamant that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. Qatar pledged about $15bn in loans on Wednesday but provided few details. Turkey and its companies face repayments of nearly $3.8bn on foreign currency bonds in October, according to Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency woes has sparked worries about Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s external debts and the ability of its firms and banks to repay them. For companies, the cost of servicing their foreign borrowings has risen by a quarter in the past two months, due to the sharp fall in the lira. Jason Daw at Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale said: Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s external financing requirements are large (IMF estimates around $250bn per year). It has the highest foreign-exchange-denominated debt in emerging markets and short-term external debt of $180bn and total external debt of $460bn. According to his calculations, Turkish firms have $1.8bn of foreign-currency denominated bonds maturing by the end of the year while $1.25bn of government bonds also come due. There is $2.3bn in interest payments. The worst month for repayments is October, when $3bn in principal and $762m in interest are due. Daw said: Principal and interest payments should be close watched to year-end \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is 25% more costly for the corporate sector to repay their obligations compared to June given FX depreciation. How will Turkey roll over existing debt? Refinancing via the bond market could be challenging. An IMF support would be the logical place to seek financing. It is unlikely that Turkey would request, or be granted a package given current diplomatic tensions, Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rhetoric, and the restrictive fiscal and monetary policy conditions policymakers would need to abide by. Chinese banks have been lending to infrastructure projects and local banks in the last six months and this could increase. Inflation in the eurozone has been confirmed at 2.1% in July \u00e2\u20ac\u201c above the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of 2%. The annual rate rose from 2% in June, pushed up by higher energy costs, according to the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics office Eurostat. This means the ECB can push ahead with plans to end its bond purchasing programme by the end of the year, and possibly raise interest rates next year. Inflation was highest in Estonia (3.3%), Latvia and Belgium (both 2.7%), while Greece and Ireland posted the slowest inflation rates, of 0.8% and 1% respectively. Once all 28 EU countries are included, Romania had the highest inflation rate, of 4.3%. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, the parent of Pimco where he served as chief executive, and the former chairman of Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Global Development Council, writes: Can Turkey rewrite the rulebook for crises in emerging markets? By rejecting the conventional approach, Erdo\u00c4\u0178an risks greater trouble \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and not just for Turkey. Whether by accident or design, Turkey is trying to rewrite the chapter on crisis management in the emerging-market playbook. Rather than opting for interest-rate hikes and an external funding anchor to support domestic policy adjustments, the government has adopted a mix of less direct and more partial measures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this at a time when Turkey is in the midst of an escalating tariff tit-for-tat with the US, as well as operating in a more fluid global economy. How all this plays out is important not only for Turkey, but also for other emerging economies that already have had to cope with waves of financial contagion. The initial phases of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crisis were a replay of past emerging-market currency crises. A mix of domestic and external events \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an over-stretched credit-led growth strategy; concerns about the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy autonomy and effectiveness; and a less hospitable global liquidity environment, owing in part to rising US interest rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c destabilised the foreign-exchange market. You can read the full article here. The euro is rising for a second day, heading towards $1.14, after coming under pressure on concerns over the exposure of major European banks to Turkey, after the lira went into meltdown. There is a sense of relief in financial markets today, following the news that Beijing will resume trade talks with Washington next week, although at a lower level than previously. It is the first round of trade talks since June and offers some hope to those worried about the impact of the tit-for-tat trade war on the world economy. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, said: Although the chances of a breakthrough deal from lower-level talks are seen as unlikely, the meeting could be a positive step towards easing trade tensions between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. The Turkish lira has staged a remarkable recovery since Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meltdown when it hit a record low below 7.23 to the dollar. The currency is currently trading at 5.79, up 0.4% on the day. While the Turkish authorities have been criticised for adopting half-measures, the lira was thrown a lifeline on Wednesday when Qatar pledged to shore up Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shaky finances with loans worth $15bn. Yesterday, finance minister Albayrak managed to calm nerves during a conference call with thousands of investors, although this was later marred by news from Washington that Turkey faces more sanctions if the US paster Andrew Brunson is not freed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty quiet on the corporate front as well. Royal Bank of Scotland has announced that its deputy chief financial officer Katie Murray will stand in as interim finance chief after Ewen Stevenson leaves on 30 September to go to HSBC on a \u00c2\u00a310.6m deal. A search for a successor for Stevenson is under way, RBS said. The FTSE 100 index in London has opened flat, trading down 2.5 points at 7553.84. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is also flat, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC is up 0.1%, Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex has gained 0.2% and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB has slipped 0.1%. Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING, expects the lira to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tread water\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with US-Turkey relations on a knife-edge as the White House said it may increase sanctions. Next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market holiday should offer some respite \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Istanbul stock exchange will be closed from Tuesday until Friday for Eid al-Adha. Patel adds: All the noise from Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister Albayrak appeared to be on the right lines in terms of reassuring global investors that Ankara remains credibly committed to addressing the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation problem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and in the status quo free-market spirit. In effect, Turkish policymakers have bought themselves a bit of time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least until early September, when markets will be expecting to see some sort of joint fiscal and monetary tightening in the Medium-Term Economic Plan. While we did see Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign CDS rally following the finance minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investor call, the lira failed to push on much further beyond 5.75 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as markets had largely priced in a conciliatory outcome. S&amp;P are due to downgrade Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign credit rating today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but again this is in the price of the currency. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The Turkish lira has become volatile again at the end of a tumultuous week, after the United States warned of more sanctions against Turkey. The embattled currency weakened in early London trading, with one dollar buying 5.86 lira, but has just recovered to 5.8, up 0.26%. On Monday the lira hit a record low of 7.2, dragging down other emerging markets currencies. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister sparked a recovery in the lira yesterday after he addressed thousands of international investors on a conference call. Berat Albayrak, the son-in-law of president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an, pledged to protect beleaguered local banks and cut public spending to prevent the country defaulting on its loans. But a few hours later US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin assured president Donald Trump at a cabinet meeting that sanctions were ready to be put in place if US pastor Andrew Brunson, who is on house arrest in Turkey over terrorism charges, is not released. Trump later tweeted that the US \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will pay nothing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the release \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but we are cutting back on Turkey!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is expected to downgrade Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign credit rating later today. Asian stock markets rose overnight, heartened by news that Beijing and Washington agreed to hold their first trade talks since June next week. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei advanced 0.35% while Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng the Australian stock market both rose 0.2%, although the Shanghai stock exchange lost 1.3%.

However, this has not been able to stabilise the lira at the start of the week, which has suffered another rout today.</p> <p>The problem for investors is two-fold: firstly, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and S&amp;P, the credit rating agencies, cut Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt to junk status at the end of last week, which limits the amount of sovereign debt larger investors like pension funds can purchase, it could also make a bailout by the likes of Germany less likely.</p> <p>Secondly, the spat between the US and Turkey continues to gain pace. As the US threatens more tariffs, shots were fired this morning at the US embassy in Ankora. Until Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government frees pastor Andrew Bunson, it is hard to see the Trump administration cutting Turkey some slack.

Post\u00e2\u20ac\u201cbailout Greece has committed to produce primary surpluses of 3.5 % of GDP until 2022 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a feat achieved by only a handful of countries since the seventies - and 2.2 % until 2060.</p> <p>For professor Kevin Featherstone who has followed the twists and turns of the crisis as head of the Hellenic Observatory at the London School of Economics, such obligations amount to perpetual purgatory.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153No other government in Europe would choose to follow this path.

Reforms have the feature that it takes a bit until you see the impact and so the benefits of the reforms weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t occurring right at the start or right from the moment when they were taken, but they are coming in now and I think this process will continue.

Unemployment is still about 20%, and youth unemployment is more than double that. Despite undertaking the biggest post-crisis fiscal adjustment of any euro zone country, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public debt is equal to about 180% of GDP. ESM fiscal and structural reform policies, to which Greece will remain subject after the third economic adjustment programme expires, are unlikely to generate sufficient economic growth to mitigate the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt burden or reduce popular disaffection. Grexit is not a short-term risk, but Greece will struggle to improve competitiveness inside the euro area or grow its way out of its huge debt burden (179.1% of GDP in 2017), so it will remain a significant risk over the medium and long term.</p> <p>The past eight years of bailouts have exacted a high cost in per capita GDP, employment, wages, pensions, living standards, life satisfaction and social and political cohesion. Greece has lowest life satisfaction rating of any OECD country. Divisions of income, equality, class and politics have sharpened. Greek sovereignty and democracy undermined as the country became subject to external tutelage. There is no popular enthusiasm for any party: popular cynicism and disaffection reign.</p> <p>Greece has been benefiting from cyclical upswing in the euro zone in 2017-18; and tourism and merchandise exports have also performing well. These factors will remain important, and point to stronger real GDP growth of around 2% this year, after 1.3% growth in 2017. However, Greece faces formidable medium- and long-term challenges, including a very poor demographic outlook; a dysfunctional labour market and a huge emigration of Greeks during the past decade; still weak public finances; poor banking asset quality; closed professions; bad regulation; and an unsustainable public debt load. These structural weakness, together with a commitment to deliver annual primary budget surplus targets of 3.5% of GDP in 2018-22 and of 2% of GDP in 2023- 2060 will shackle growth.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b7a9472e4b0f6601fba18c3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-20T10:27:15.829Z\">11.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek reforms laid groundwork for sustainable recovery - Moscovici</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The austerity measures undertaken by Greece will lead to a sustainable recovery, says European economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici.</p> <p>Speaking as the country exits its bailout programme, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The extensive reforms Greece has carried out have laid the ground for a sustainable recovery: this must be nurtured and maintained to enable the Greek people to reap the benefits of their efforts and sacrifices.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said the Greek economy is expected to grow by around 2% after 1.4% growth last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LiveSquawk/status/1031481875032944640\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">EU&#39;s Moscovici Says Greece Must Ensure Continued Implementation Of Reforms<br>EU&#39;s Moscovici Says Greek Economic Growth Expected To Remain Around 2Pct In 2018, 2019</p>&mdash; LiveSquawk (@LiveSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LiveSquawk/status/1031481875032944640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 20, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b7a9576e4b00f6a2ff7f86b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-20T10:19:23.314Z\">11.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with Greece, and here is a link to the European summary of the main statistics:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/A_Breidthardt/status/1031483068421431296\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The conclusion of Greece&#39;s stability support programme opens the door to a new chapter for Greece.

It was reported that emerging market funds were already trimming their exposure to the country in July, and that was even before the severe decline in the lira. Over the weekend, the central banks of Qatar and Turkey signed a currency swap agreement, and this follows on from the $15 billion that the gulf state pledged to invest in the country. Dealers are still scared that banks that have lent money to Turkish finance houses could face defaults, and it is possible we might see an increase in non-performing loans in the Turkish banking system, and that could seep into the eurozone. </p> </blockquote> <p>Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, says there could be more volatility ahead:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Turkish markets are closed this week, which means volumes will be particularly low, therefore big swigs could be expected potentially unnerving traders once again.</p> </blockquote> <p>On a more positive note, traders are hopeful that a planned meeting this week between Chinese and US representatives may ease some of the trade war fears that have overshadowed the markets in recent months.</p> </div>   </div>",
                "bodyText":"Greece has turned the page to become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd member of the single currency, European Union authorities in Brussels declared as the country finally exited its eight-year bailout programm, writes Jennifer Rankin. Its three bailouts during the eurozone crisis totalled \u00e2\u201a\u00ac288.7bn (\u00c2\u00a3258bn) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest-ever financial rescue. During that time, as the crisis that threatened to lead to the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ejection from the single currency \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Greece has had four governments and endured one of the worst recessions in economic history. Marking the official end of the third bailout programme on Monday, Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, said Greece was beginning a new chapter after eight \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very difficult\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have had eight very difficult years, often very painful years, where we have had three successive programmes. But now Greece can finally turn the page in a crisis that has lasted too long,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told journalists. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The worst is over.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Our full report is here: On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The Turkish lira continues to come under pressure, now down 1.66%. Kathleen Brooks, research director at Capital Index, says: Germany may say no now, but it is becoming increasingly likely that Turkey will need significant amounts of financial aid in the months to come. Qatar has come in with a credit line to backstop the economy, and has promised $15bn of investment in Turkey. However, this has not been able to stabilise the lira at the start of the week, which has suffered another rout today. The problem for investors is two-fold: firstly, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and S&amp;P, the credit rating agencies, cut Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt to junk status at the end of last week, which limits the amount of sovereign debt larger investors like pension funds can purchase, it could also make a bailout by the likes of Germany less likely. Secondly, the spat between the US and Turkey continues to gain pace. As the US threatens more tariffs, shots were fired this morning at the US embassy in Ankora. Until Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government frees pastor Andrew Bunson, it is hard to see the Trump administration cutting Turkey some slack. Regardless of your view on the rights or wrongs of what the US is doing to Turkey financially, with Trump as President, it certainly doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay to mess with the US, especially when you upset the evangelical wing of the US this close to the mid-terms. Meanwhile in Athens it has not gone unnoticed that Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has chosen to remain silent about Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much-awaited bailout exit, writes Helena Smith from Athens. His only public utterance today has been to tweet his congratulations to the county\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s youth water polo team on its world championship victory. Has this got something to do, perhaps, with the fact that his leftist-led government has signed up to a staggering array of ambitious targets? Post\u00e2\u20ac\u201cbailout Greece has committed to produce primary surpluses of 3.5 % of GDP until 2022 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a feat achieved by only a handful of countries since the seventies - and 2.2 % until 2060. For professor Kevin Featherstone who has followed the twists and turns of the crisis as head of the Hellenic Observatory at the London School of Economics, such obligations amount to perpetual purgatory. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No other government in Europe would choose to follow this path. It is Ordoliberalism gone wild,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told the Guardian. With the fiscal straightjacket remaining so tight, there will be little scope for future administrations to improve economic competitiveness through investment, or accelerate social support for those pauperised by austerity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rehabilitation falls well short,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Professor Featherstone said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The prospect of a recurrence of the debt crisis has been eliminated but nothing has been done to help Greek society overcome the trauma of excessively high unemployment and bankruptcies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tsipras had hoped to mark the exit with a visit to Kastelorizo, the remote Aegean isle where the drama began. Celebrating Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcliberation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the place where former Prime Minister George Papandreou had in April 2010 first announced that Athens would seek help from the EU and IMF \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after surging Greek bond yields made borrowing on capital markets prohibitive - seemed appropriate to coming full-circle. But the outcry over his government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s handling of last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wildfires \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a calamity that has left 94 dead and brought devastation and ruination to hundreds more \u00e2\u20ac\u201c put paid to the idea. Fanfare, aides say, will be kept to a minimum. The chief economist of the ESM rescue fund has admitted there were mistakes made with Greece. In an interview with CNBC Rolf Strauch said: This was a severe crisis situation and obviously it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to claim that everything went well in the sense that everything was completely right at the time. I think the overall direction of the programme was right and what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing now, are particularly the consequences of those many reforms that were taken, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that also the Greek people deserve a lot of respect for what they did over the years. Reforms have the feature that it takes a bit until you see the impact and so the benefits of the reforms weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t occurring right at the start or right from the moment when they were taken, but they are coming in now and I think this process will continue. You should see the projected growth rates, they are about 2%. This is good news, the task is now to stay on course and reap the benefits of what was done in the past. He also says that the efforts Greece has to make are not yet over: Obviously, it takes a lot to restructure an economy, and therefore [Greece has agreed] the steps to be taken by the Greek authorities in the coming years and they have made some commitments on that. The head of the European Stability Mechanism, the euro zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout fund, has wasted no time stressing the point that the debt-Stricken country will be subject to a strict regime of enhanced surveillance post-bailout, reports Helena Smith from Athens: Speaking to the Greek daily Ethnos this morning Klaus Regling, the rescue fund chief, emphasized that Athens will be strictly monitored in the coming years so there is no let up in reform implementation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece is exceptional. It has received much more loans from us than any other country,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told the paper, saying that Athens unlike any other member state had also benefited from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 huge amounts of debt relief.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No other programme country has received anything comparable. Therefore, the monitoring will be tighter than in the other cases and this will take the form of the so-called enhanced surveillance.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meanwhile the Greek government spokesman was hailing the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new phase\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the country was about to enter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Citizens will soon feel the difference,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dimitris TzAnnakopoulos told a radio station earlier today. He said prime minister Alexis Tsipras would soon be announcing handouts when he gave his annual economic address at the Thessaloniki trade fair next month and elaborated how the budget surplus would be handled. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an earlier piece looking at the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future following the bailout exit: And Greece will also continue to be monitored: On the other hand, Greece still faces serious challenges, according to Joan Hoey, director for Europe at The Economist Intelligence Unit: There has been lots of pain, but to what gain, and to what purpose has the Greek government signed up to multi-decade, large primary budget surplus targets which are likely to hobble growth? The economy has been in almost permanent recession since 2010, and real GDP has shrunk by more than a quarter from its pre-crisis peak in 2007-08. Unemployment is still about 20%, and youth unemployment is more than double that. Despite undertaking the biggest post-crisis fiscal adjustment of any euro zone country, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public debt is equal to about 180% of GDP. ESM fiscal and structural reform policies, to which Greece will remain subject after the third economic adjustment programme expires, are unlikely to generate sufficient economic growth to mitigate the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt burden or reduce popular disaffection. Grexit is not a short-term risk, but Greece will struggle to improve competitiveness inside the euro area or grow its way out of its huge debt burden (179.1% of GDP in 2017), so it will remain a significant risk over the medium and long term. The past eight years of bailouts have exacted a high cost in per capita GDP, employment, wages, pensions, living standards, life satisfaction and social and political cohesion. Greece has lowest life satisfaction rating of any OECD country. Divisions of income, equality, class and politics have sharpened. Greek sovereignty and democracy undermined as the country became subject to external tutelage. There is no popular enthusiasm for any party: popular cynicism and disaffection reign. Greece has been benefiting from cyclical upswing in the euro zone in 2017-18; and tourism and merchandise exports have also performing well. These factors will remain important, and point to stronger real GDP growth of around 2% this year, after 1.3% growth in 2017. However, Greece faces formidable medium- and long-term challenges, including a very poor demographic outlook; a dysfunctional labour market and a huge emigration of Greeks during the past decade; still weak public finances; poor banking asset quality; closed professions; bad regulation; and an unsustainable public debt load. These structural weakness, together with a commitment to deliver annual primary budget surplus targets of 3.5% of GDP in 2018-22 and of 2% of GDP in 2023- 2060 will shackle growth. The austerity measures undertaken by Greece will lead to a sustainable recovery, says European economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici. Speaking as the country exits its bailout programme, he said: The extensive reforms Greece has carried out have laid the ground for a sustainable recovery: this must be nurtured and maintained to enable the Greek people to reap the benefits of their efforts and sacrifices. He said the Greek economy is expected to grow by around 2% after 1.4% growth last year. Back with Greece, and here is a link to the European summary of the main statistics: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the tensions between Turkey and the US: President Tayyip Erdogan has been speaking again about the crisis which has laid low Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency and prompted a market sell-off. Reuters reports: [Erdogan] said on Monday an attack on Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy was no different from a strike against its flag or the Islamic call to prayer, responding to a recent currency sell-off in stark religious and nationalist terms ahead of a major Muslim holiday. In a pre-recorded address to mark the four-day Eid al-Adha festival, which starts on Tuesday, a defiant Erdogan said the aim of the currency crisis was to bring \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Turkey and its people to their knees\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The lira has tumbled some 40 percent this year, hit by worries about Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s influence over monetary policy and a worsening diplomatic rift with the United States. The sell-off has spread to other emerging market currencies and global stocks in recent weeks. Amid the tension, several gunshots were fired on Monday from a vehicle at the U.S. Embassy in the Turkish capital. Nobody was hurt. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The attack on our economy has absolutely no difference from attacks on our call to prayer and our flag. The goal is the same. The goal is to bring Turkey and the Turkish people to their knees - to take it prisoner,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Erdogan said in the televised address. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those who think they can make Turkey give in with the exchange rate will soon see that they are mistaken.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Erdogan stopped short of directly naming any countries or institutions, but he has, in the past, blamed a shadowy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153interest rate lobby\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Western ratings agencies and financiers. The lira is currently down around 1.5% against the dollar. Meanwhile a German government spokesman has said that it is up to Turkey to decide whether it wants to ask the International Monetary Fund for help. Markets are continuing to head higher, as investors shrug off the continuing concerns about Turkey and concentrate on the prospects for US-China trade talks. The FTSE 100 is up 0.55%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has added 0.93% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.63%. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: The fears of last week seem to have been washed away with a renewed optimism over the direction of US-China trade. Markets often find it difficult to focus on one topic, and thus with the focus now shifting away from Turkey and towards China, it comes as no surprise that the pessimism of last week is fading into obscurity. Wednesday will see a trade delegation from China kick off a two-day meeting with their US counterparts, and as long as there is hope for some form of breakthrough, markets are likely to be in a more optimistic mood. However, this optimism is likely to be ill-founded, for all the previous meetings have shown precious few signs of anything that looks like a breakthrough. As Greece exits its bailout, new government figures show a drop in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account surplus compared to a year ago, but a rise in tourist revenues. Reuters reports: Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account balance showed a smaller surplus in June compared to the same month a year earlier on the back of a wider trade deficit, the Bank of Greece said on Monday. Central bank data showed the surplus fell to 210 million euros ($240.18 million) from a surplus of 737 million euros in June 2017. Tourism revenues increased to 2.33 billion euros from 2.007 billion in the same month a year earlier. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In June the current account ... (was) down by 527 million euros year-on-year, as a result of a deterioration principally in the balance of goods and to a lesser extent in the primary income account,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Bank of Greece said. It said the trade gap rose by 535 million euros as imports outstripped exports, mainly the result of a worsening in the oil balance. In January to June, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account showed a deficit of 3.8 billion euros, up by 555 million euros year-on-year as the trade deficit widened and the primary income account surplus shrank. In 2017 as a whole, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit reached 1.5 billion euros, down by 418 million year-on-year. And another reality check: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more on the forthcoming press conference on Greece: Back in the UK, and luxury handbag marker Mulberry has seen its shares slump 26% after it warned it would take a \u00c2\u00a33m hit from House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration. Our full report is here: And G4S is down 1% after the UK ministry of justice took over HMP Birmingham from the company after drink, drugs and violence among prisoners: Over in Turkey and the lira has edged lower again, down 1.4% at 6.09 against the dollar. But this is a far cry from its all time worst level against the US currency of 7.24 which it hit at the start of last week as economic crisis unfolded. But the strain between Turkey and the US over the detention of a US pastor can be seen by the firing of gun shots at the American embassy in Ankara earlier this morning. Jamie McGeever at Reuters has a few sobering facts as Greece \u00e2\u20ac\u0153returns to normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: Markets in Europe are marginally better as traders return to their desks after the weekend break. The FTSE 100 is up 0.33%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.32% and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 0.34% better. Earlier Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s produce price index rose by 3% year on year in July, the same level as the previous month and in line with expectations. Today Greece returns to normal, according to Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister and head of the eurogroup: Giorgos Papakonstantinou, who was finance minister when Greece signed up to the bailout, said he would do the same again if the country was in the same position. He told the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wake up to Money programme: The choice we had at that point was either to allow the country to go bankrupt by not paying our debts... at which point we would not have been able to pay salaries and pensions and provide basic public services. Or to sign a bailout which would give us time to reduce those deficits. But he admitted there had been tremendous pain and suffering along the way as austerity measures hit hard. And Zsolt Darvas of the Bruegel think tank said Greece could still face further problems. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme, he said: Unfortunately I give a high probability that Greece will enter a new crisis three to five years from now, partly because Greece still has a very high level of debt and it has to repay a lot in the near term. If Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth slows down long-term, then markets might become very nervous and Greece will enter a new crisis. European markets are expected to make a mixed start to the week: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a momentous day for Greece and its government led by prime minister Alexis Tsipras. After eight years and innumerable late night eurozone crisis meetings, the country is exiting its bailout programme. The so-called troika of creditors - the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund loaned Greece a total of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac289bn in three tranches in 2010, 2012 and 2015. The country is now free to borrow money on the capital markets, something it has not been able to do while the bailout programme was underway. But it has suffered under tough austerity measures demanded by its creditors, and everyone involved understands there is still a long way to go. Here is our report on the news: Later this morning Pierre Moscovici, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic affairs commissioner, is expected to hail Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the bailout. But our economics editor Larry Elliott says the programme has been a failure: It is a tale of incompetence, of dogma, of needless delay and of the interests of banks being put before the needs of people. And there will be long-term consequences. When Greece first received help in 2010, the plan was for it to have access to the financial markets within two years. It has taken two further rescue packages and six years for that to happen. His full analysis is here: Elsewhere Turkey is likely to remain in focus after the recent collapse of the lira and concerns that its economic problems will spread elsewhere. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The slump in the Turkish lira is on traders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds as the fear of contagion into the eurozone is likely to remain a dominant theme. It was reported that emerging market funds were already trimming their exposure to the country in July, and that was even before the severe decline in the lira. Over the weekend, the central banks of Qatar and Turkey signed a currency swap agreement, and this follows on from the $15 billion that the gulf state pledged to invest in the country. Dealers are still scared that banks that have lent money to Turkish finance houses could face defaults, and it is possible we might see an increase in non-performing loans in the Turkish banking system, and that could seep into the eurozone. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, says there could be more volatility ahead: Turkish markets are closed this week, which means volumes will be particularly low, therefore big swigs could be expected potentially unnerving traders once again. On a more positive note, traders are hopeful that a planned meeting this week between Chinese and US representatives may ease some of the trade war fears that have overshadowed the markets in recent months.",

                "bodyText":"Markets continue to drift as the concerns about the US-China trade rift continue, along with uncertainty about how the problems facing Donald Trump will play out. The FTSE 100 is currently up just 0.17%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up a similar amount while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.37%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. A positive sign for the US economy with better than expected capital goods orders. The Commerce Department said new orders for non-defence capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a key indicator for business investment - climbed by 1.4% in July. This is sharply higher than June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure of 0.6% - itself revised upwards from 0.2% - and better than the forecasts of a 0.4% increase. But overall orders for durable goods decreased by 1.7% as demand for civilian aircraft - a volatile measure - fell. Back with Trump and Italy: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the latest housing data: Mortgage lending in Britain dropped last month before the Bank of England raised interest rates above the level set since the financial crisis, new banking industry figures show. The industry body UK Finance said the number of mortgages approved for new house purchases dropped by 4.3% in July to 39,584 compared with the same month a year ago. City economists had forecast around 40,700, suggesting a renewed slowdown in the housing market. Threadneedle Street raised the cost of borrowing earlier this month, making it more expensive for prospective homeowners to secure a mortgage, while concerns about a no-deal Brexit are also discouraging buyers. Analysts said the rise in rates to 0.75% from 0.5% could further weigh on demand for mortgages. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the figures demonstrate the housing market is fundamentally slowing, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The hike [from the Bank of England] will unnerve many buyers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The full report is here: President Donald Trump offered to buy Italian sovereign bonds when he met prime minister Giuseppe Conte at the White House last month, according to the Corriere della Sera newspaper. Rome is scheduled to issue about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac400bn worth of debt in 2019, and recent political uncertainty has seen a jump in Italian borrowing costs as investors move out of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bonds. The paper said that while Italy is keen to find new investors, it was unclear how the US could step in to guarantee the debt. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the view from an ING strategist: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the market reaction: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is currently up 0.75%, outpacing other European markets. Three senior executives at TSB, which suffered a disastrous IT meltdown beginning in April, are leaving the bank, according to the Financial Times. Ian Firth, Rachel Lock and Nigel Gilbert - TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treasurer, head of human resources and chief marketing officer - are all set to depart, says the report (\u00c2\u00a3). The fiasco is the subject of independent investigations, and helped push the bank into a loss for the year: ScottishPower has become the fourth of the big six energy suppliers to announce a second price rise this year, in response to rising wholesale prices. Around 900,000 customers on the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s default tariff will be hit with a \u00c2\u00a346 price hike from 8 October, pushing up their annual dual fuel bill 3.7%, to \u00c2\u00a31,257. The bad news for consumers comes on top of a 5.5% hike by ScottishPower in June. The company, which is owned by Spanish energy giant Iberdrola, blamed wholesale electricity and gas costs, which it had said had increased more than a fifth since April. Analysts have warned householders to expect further price rises, and one challenger firm, Bulb, has told customers a third rise this year is likely. Oil is being lifted again amid signs that US sanctions on Iran are beginning to have an impact on supplies. Brent crude is up 0.8% at $75.33 a barrel while US crude has climbed 0.9% to $68.45. The US government re-imposed sanctions on Iran this month after it withdrew from a 2015 international nuclear agreement. Jason Gammel, equity analyst at investment bank Jefferies, said: Multiple third-party reports indicate that Iranian tanker loadings are already down by around 700 kbd in the first half of August relative to July, which if it holds will exceed most expectations. We expect that by the fourth quarter the market will be dealing with either undersupply, dwindling spare capacity - or both. The UK mortgage figures are weighing on housebuilders, with Berkeley Group, Persimmon, Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey all down around 1%. A downgrade on Persimmon from analysts at Canaccord is not helping the sector. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: In thin August trading housebuilders have taken a knock as a double whammy of lower new approved mortgages and a five-month low in net mortgage lending weighed on the sector. Fortunately, the lower weighting for the likes of Taylor Wimpey in the FTSE means that these losses have been easily countered by gains for mining stocks off the back of a weaker US dollar. So overall the FTSE 100 remains virtually unchanged, edging up 0.12%. The number of mortgage approvals by the main high street banks slipped last month compared to a year ago. Approvals in July fell by 0.8%, but within this there was a 2.8% rise in existing households remortgaging ahead of the well-flagged interest rate rise earlier this month, according to data from industry body UK Finance. Credit card spending was 8.1% higher that a year earlier, but annual consumer credit growth slowed to 3.7%. Peter Tyler, director at UK Finance, said: July saw steady growth in gross mortgage lending, driven largely by remortgaging as homeowners locked into attractive deals in anticipation of the recent base rate rise. Card spending has also strengthened, reflecting increased expenditure during the holiday period and an uplift in retail sales due to the World Cup and warm weather. However the broader economic outlook remains mixed, with households continuing to see their incomes being squeezed by rising inflation. This may explain the shift towards deposits held in instant access accounts, as consumers opt to keep their money close to hand. With the European Central Bank being the latest to warn of the dangers of growing protectionism (in Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minutes), here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an interesting chart from HSBC (hat-tip Ransquawk): So would the markets crash if Donald Trump was impeached, as the president suggested? Paul Donovan, global chief economist at UBS Wealth Management, thinks not: Impeachment (by the House) may be more likely than conviction (by the Senate), but neither seems highly probable. A conviction would lead to President Pence. Pence\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic track record gives no grounds for assuming a negative equity reaction. The markets may be fairly subdued at the moment, but it could be a lot worse, says Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell: There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a lot to Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open, the lack of progress between the US and China following the latest round of trade talks leading to a muted start to the session. Given the amount of bad news out there at the moment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade talk-undermining tariff tit-for-tatting between the US and China, the ominous clouds of a no deal Brexit, and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential legal problems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the markets have done well to not lose their heads this week. The FTSE was unchanged after the bell, lurking just above 7560. The index failed to capitalise on a rebound from its mining stocks, that sector having been something of a burden in the last few sessions. The pound, meanwhile, needs to try and claw back the losses it incurred followed Dominic Raab\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poorly received no deal Brexit advice on Thursday. It hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been particularly successful so far: against the dollar it rose 0.1%, pushing cable above $1.283, while against the euro it actually slipped another 0.1%, keeping it the wrong side of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.11 for the first time in over a fortnight. As for the Eurozone indices, a solid second quarter German GDP reading \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was confirmed at 0.5% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c allowed the DAX to nudge 20 points higher. The CAC, meanwhile, could only add a handful of points, pushing above 5425 in the process. News of the latest prime ministerial appointment in Australia has seen a recovery in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency. Neil Wilson at Markets.com said: Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dollar rose after Scott Morrison was voted the next prime minister. The Australian dollar/US dollar had sold off as Malcolm Turnbull was forced to resign, briefly touching on 0.720, its lowest since the start of 2017, before paring losses to trade around 0.7280. But the longer-term downtrend remains in play with trend resistance seen at 0.73750. Politics won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a factor for long for the Australian dollar, which tends to ride this kind of shenanigans \u00e2\u20ac\u201cforex traders should be pretty used to a changing Australian prime ministers and will shrug it off quickly. With the continuing trade row between the US and China, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s travails and the spotlight on US interest rates, markets are making a cautious end to the week. The FTSE 100 is virtually flat, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up 0.25%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed just 0.12% while Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is up 0.1%. On the trade dispute, Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com said: With the US mulling $200bn in additional 25% tariffs, this is not going away. The real worry is what does China do then. While Beijing cannot match the US in terms of raw firepower as it imports far less from the US, it can respond with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcqualitative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 measures, which could seriously impede US firms doing business in China. The German GDP figures show that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has not yet been hit too badly by the current trade tensions, says ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski, although this could of course change: German growth data suggest that at least in the second quarter, the ongoing trade tensions were a threat but did not leave any significant marks on the economy. Obviously, this could change in the coming months. Even though the EU seems to be off US radar screens at least for the time being, the series of German export partners being hurt by sanctions, tariffs or economic crises is getting longer. Just think of China, Russia, Turkey, Iran or potentially the UK. The strength of the German export sector has always been its diversity and the fact that it is not dependent on a single export partner. And while the weak euro should cushion any adverse effects stemming from tariffs or sanctions, the list of troubled countries should obviously not get too long. While risks from the external side are increasing, the domestic side of the German economy offers both challenges but also opportunities. Just think of an increasingly complicated political landscape, too few new investments and structural reforms and supply-side constraints in the manufacturing sector. Many potential risks ahead but at least for now, there is only one good reaction to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth data: enjoy and savour. Here are IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening calls for European markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There was little expectation that this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talks between the US and China to resolve their trade tensions would make much of a breakthrough. And so it proved, as they ended on Thursday with no real progress. President Trump had already set the tone, suggesting there was unlikely to be any quick resolution, and discussions can hardly have been helped by the two sides slapping a new range of tariffs on each others\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 goods as the talks were underway. White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the officials \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exchanged views on how to achieve fairness, balance, and reciprocity in the economic relationship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the discussions including \u00e2\u20ac\u0153addressing structural issues in China\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd including its intellectual property and technology transfer policies. Later China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister Liu Kun told Reuters the country would keep hitting back at the US. He said: China doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wish to engage in a trade war, but we will resolutely respond to the unreasonable measures taken by the United States. Economists at UniCredit said a new round of tariffs was likely to come into force in September, with the US targeting $200bn of imports from China: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beijing is said to be willing to start new talks only after the US mid-term elections.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So markets continue to be edgy as the row rumbles on, with Wall Street finishing in the red and Asian markets vacillated between negative and positive. European markets are expected to make a mixed start. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: A spokesperson for the Beijing administration described the meeting as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconstructive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, but it sends a message to traders that this situation won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be resolved quickly. The negative press surrounding President Trump isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t boosting investor confidence either. Indeed Trump declared that impeaching him would lead to a stock market crash, although the thing markets hate most is uncertainty, which is what we have here. Elsewhere US Federal Reserve members speaking at the two day meeting of central bankers at Jackson Hole in Wyoming tried to make it clear that despite Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of their rate raising policy, they would not be swayed by his comments. CMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Madden said: Esther George, the Kansas City Fed President issued an upbeat view of the US economy, as she believes the Federal Reserve can hike interest rates several more times before it can get to a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcneutral\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 position. Ms George made it clear that President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views regarding the hiking cycle, will not influence the central bank. Robert Kaplan, Dallas Fed President, reiterated the independence of the Federal Reserve, making it clear that Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t influence decisions in relation to interest rates. The stimulus effect is boosting the economy, but it will start to fade in 2019, according to Mr Kaplan. There is little economic news expected, with US durable goods due at 1.30 UK time. We have already had the latest German GDP figures, which showed a 0.5% rise in the second quarter, the same as the previous three months and in line with expectations. Year on year the figure was 2.3%, again as forecast.",

                "bodyText":"Pound reaches record low for 2018 Fears over a no-deal Brexit sent the pound to the lowest level against the dollar and the euro this year, as Theresa May continued to struggle to gain support for her plan for Britain leaving the EU. Speculation against the pound has intensified over the course of the past month as markets have digested warnings from Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, and leading Brexit backers arguing the UK would be prepared to walk away from Brussels without a deal. FTSE 100 falters amid trade tensions The FTSE 100 lost ground over the course of the last month, amid renewed tensions over Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade tariffs on Chinese imports and concerns over the fallout from an unfolding economic crisis in Turkey. The Turkish lira plunged by more than 20% against the dollar earlier in August, after Trump said he would double tariffs on Turkish imports to the US, amid a diplomatic row over an imprisoned American pastor. The weak pound has helped support the FTSE 100, as many of the largest firms in the index derive much of their profit from overseas. The leading index of UK company shares has dropped by about 1% in the past month. Meets forecast Higher petrol prices drive inflation increase The rising price of petrol triggered the first increase in inflation this year, placing renewed pressure on household budgets. The consumer prices index hit an annual rate of 2.5% last month, after holding at 2.4% in the previous three months, thanks to high global energy prices. The July reading for the retail price index, used for the setting of rail fire increases, rose at 3.2%, lower than the 3.4% in June but still triggering outrage from commuters after multiple cancellations for services across the country this year. Better than forecast Trade deficit narrows The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c how much imports exceed exports \u00e2\u20ac\u201c narrowed slightly, despite falling exports of car and aircraft amid weaker manufacturing output in Britain. The trade in goods deficit shrank to \u00c2\u00a311.4bn in June from \u00c2\u00a312.5bn in the previous month, beating economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts for a deficit of about \u00c2\u00a312bn. The overall UK trade deficit for goods and services widened by \u00c2\u00a34.7bn to reach \u00c2\u00a38.6bn in the three months to June as fears mounted about the impact of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade tariffs on Europe and the rest of the world. Worse than forecast Surveys point towards slowing growth There were weaker readings for the British economy from closely watched surveys of business activity, pointing towards a surprise fall in output for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominant services industry. The latest snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index for the sector fell from 55.1 in June to 53.5 last month against expectations for a more modest decline to 54.7. Anything above 50 indicates expansion versus contraction. The PMI for the manufacturing sector also pointed towards slowing growth, while the construction industry continued a recovery after suffering amid heavy snowfall earlier this year. Worse than forecast Pay growth drops despite record unemployment The rate of pay growth for British workers unexpectedly dropped to its weakest in almost a year, despite a fall in unemployment to a new 43-year low and the biggest drop in workers from the EU since modern records began. The Office for National Statistics said average weekly earnings rose by 2.4% on the year in the three months to June, down from the previous three months when they grew by 2.5% and falling short of economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts for the rate to remain unchanged. The worrying trend from the labour market confounds Bank of England expectations for rising pay, with the jobless rate falling from 4.2% to 4%, the lowest level since the winter of 1974-75. Better than forecast Heatwave and World Cup boosts retail sales England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extended World Cup run and the continued summer heatwave provided an unexpected lift for retail sales in July, as consumers bought more food and drink from supermarkets. Providing breathing space for many struggling retailers, sales volumes rose by 0.7% last month from June, and were 3.5% higher than a year earlier, beating economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts for a 0.2% monthly rise and a 3% annual gain. However, there are warnings the underlying trend for weaker sales since the EU referendum and the switch to online shopping is unlikely to reverse a trend for shop closures and redundancies across the sector. Better than forecast Public finances hand Hammond wiggle room Britain recorded the biggest July budget surplus in 18 years, welcoming news for the chancellor, Philip Hammond, as he considers ways to pay for the promised increase in NHS funding. The ONS reported public sector net borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, went into surplus for July by \u00c2\u00a32bn, comfortably beating City analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts. The latest figures show government borrowing for the financial year so far is around \u00c2\u00a38.5bn below the same point last year, which could give Hammond more room for manoeuvre at the autumn budget.

Pay growth in Britain has dropped to its weakest in almost a year despite the unemployment rate hitting a 43-year low. At the same time, recent weakness in the pound amid the growing chance of a no-deal Brexit is poised to push up the rate of inflation, triggering a renewed squeeze on living standards. Despite some pockets of strength for the economy, there are growing signs of weakness after the Bank of England raised interest rates above the emergency level set since the financial crisis. Ushering in a new era of higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, the move comes as ministers prepare the public for Britain crashing-out of the EU without a deal with Brussels. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate-setting monetary policy committee, said heightened talk of a no-deal Brexit would hold back business investment, while arguing higher inflation would limit the spending power of consumers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Though GDP growth picked up in the second quarter of this year, it would be premature to conclude that the Brexit-induced slowdown in the UK economy is coming to an end,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.

US President Donald Trump may have rebranded the agreement as the United States \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mexico Trade Agreement due to the apparent negative connotations associated with NAFTA but I think this may be yet another attempt to drag Canada to the negotiating table and align themselves with his idea of how it should look. </p> <p>Trump has made renegotiating trade deals a key feature of his presidency and is willing to do whatever it takes in order to get what he wants. So far, he has had limited success with China, the EU and his NAFTA partners but coming ahead of the midterm elections, this could be viewed as an important success. While the US consumer may be the primary loser in his approach and the outcome of it due to the impact it has on prices, he is receiving credit for fighting to preserve skilled US jobs. </p> <p>Whether such perception will be enough to secure him a second term will be determined in a couple of years but it does appear to be working in his favour so far. From an investor perspective, the economy is still booming and in coming to an agreement with Mexico, one trade risk has been effectively removed and for now, that is good news. </p> <p>While there are some notable data pieces out later in the week, politics is likely to continue to be a driving force in the markets. The threat of a US-initiated trade war has dragged on markets for most of the year, with tax reform helping to offset this and prevent too significant a drop in the US. With progress being made, the S&amp;P 500 hitting new record highs and stocks now in their longest ever bull run, the environment seems perfect for Trump to continue to pressure the countries trade partners and force concessions so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect any change in strategy any time soon.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b8523fde4b0b69fd6c571ca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-28T10:32:44.145Z\">11.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an interesting report from the London Evening Standard.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-diary/the-londoner-bank-chief-carney-asked-to-stay-a-year-a3921451.html\">Bank of England governor Mark Carney has apparently been asked to stay on by the government for an extra year,</a> until 2020, the paper says, so he can give some continuity as the country stumbles its way through Brexit.</p> <p>The Standard is edited these days by former UK chancellor George Osborne, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/26/mark-carney-bank-of-england-governor\">the man who unveiled Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appointment in 2012.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b38c0e8e476de849956d3948ba1f4a4c7ca4acf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b38c0e8e476de849956d3948ba1f4a4c7ca4acf/0_102_3858_2316/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carney and Osborne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carney and Osborne.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-08-28T10:34:27.796Z\">at 11.34am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b8511d6e4b0447fbe86106a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-28T09:33:20.565Z\">10.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets are expected to continue their positive run when trading begins, with the futures pointing to a 40 point or so rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

But with US GDP tomorrow and non-farms coming up next week this near-term weakness in the greenback may soon reverse \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and while this will help the FTSE on the sterling front, a higher dollar will hit commodity prices, limiting potential upside for the index, suggesting those looking for gains will keep their money stateside. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b850a4ae4b0bdafc1627586\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-28T08:50:16.392Z\">9.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Italian bond yields climb</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over in the eurozone, Italian 10 year government bond yields have hit a three month high on worries about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending plans and its debt levels.</p> <p>Italian deputy prime minister Luigi Di Maio told the Il Fatto Quotidiano today that its public deficit could top the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ceiling of 3% of GDP next year.

                "bodyText":"News of the US-Mexico trade deal has lifted European markets, albeit the gains are limited by concerns about the other big disputes that President Trump has embarked upon, notably with China. And the fact that Canada has not yet joined the new version of the North American Free Trade Agreement is another reason for caution. Nevertheless, after making gains on Monday, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is currently up 0.19% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.37%. The FTSE 100, which was closed for Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank Holiday, has added 0.5%. This is not as much as might have been expected given the FTSE was playing catch-up on the other European markets, with a stronger pound against the dollar limiting the rise. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Germany is considering giving financial aid to struggling Turkey, to avoid a full blown economic crisis in the region, the Wall Street Journal is reporting. The full story is here (\u00c2\u00a3). Elsewhere here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an OECD chart from economist Rupert Seggins showing how a number of countries have performed in the second quarter in terms of GDP growth: US Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin says he hopes Canada will join the Mexico-US trade deal but if not the two will go it alone. The comments came in a interview on CNBC: The pound may be falling against the euro on yet more Brexit fears, down 0.13% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1022, but it is managing to move higher against a weaker dollar. The US currency is out of favour as investors turn away towards riskier bets following the US-Mexico trade deal. So the pound is up 0.21% at $1.2918. This performance against the dollar has done nothing for the FTSE 100, which is full of international earners which benefit from a weaker pound. The index is currently up 0.3% despite the positivity around the trade situation. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets said: The FTSE100 is holding its post-Bank holiday jump above 7585, but back from its 7640 best of the day. Helping risk appetite are Miners welcoming fresh USD weakness, giving metals prices a boost, coupled with a US-Mexico trade deal offering hope that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit spat with Beijing could calm. Hindering the index is GBP strength vs USD, sending several defensives lower, and eclipsing higher Oil prices to keep heavyweight Energy shares offside. If Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not-NAFTA deal works, he is unlikely to change strategy in the other trade disputes, says Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda: While I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure investors would rather the deal include Canada and preserve NAFTA, this is at least a step in the right direction and could be an important first step towards it. US President Donald Trump may have rebranded the agreement as the United States \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mexico Trade Agreement due to the apparent negative connotations associated with NAFTA but I think this may be yet another attempt to drag Canada to the negotiating table and align themselves with his idea of how it should look. Trump has made renegotiating trade deals a key feature of his presidency and is willing to do whatever it takes in order to get what he wants. So far, he has had limited success with China, the EU and his NAFTA partners but coming ahead of the midterm elections, this could be viewed as an important success. While the US consumer may be the primary loser in his approach and the outcome of it due to the impact it has on prices, he is receiving credit for fighting to preserve skilled US jobs. Whether such perception will be enough to secure him a second term will be determined in a couple of years but it does appear to be working in his favour so far. From an investor perspective, the economy is still booming and in coming to an agreement with Mexico, one trade risk has been effectively removed and for now, that is good news. While there are some notable data pieces out later in the week, politics is likely to continue to be a driving force in the markets. The threat of a US-initiated trade war has dragged on markets for most of the year, with tax reform helping to offset this and prevent too significant a drop in the US. With progress being made, the S&amp;P 500 hitting new record highs and stocks now in their longest ever bull run, the environment seems perfect for Trump to continue to pressure the countries trade partners and force concessions so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect any change in strategy any time soon. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an interesting report from the London Evening Standard. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has apparently been asked to stay on by the government for an extra year, until 2020, the paper says, so he can give some continuity as the country stumbles its way through Brexit. The Standard is edited these days by former UK chancellor George Osborne, the man who unveiled Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appointment in 2012. US markets are expected to continue their positive run when trading begins, with the futures pointing to a 40 point or so rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Indices are steady this morning after the long weekend for the UK, but the new highs in the US have not emboldened buyers this side of the Atlantic. In the short run, the market is a momentum machine, and this is being clearly demonstrated as the US market diverges from Europe, leaving the FTSE and others trailing far behind. Still, progress on trade talks is welcome for all concerned, since it shows that the Donald can be persuaded if the right approach is used. Trade negotiators around the globe will be studying the US/Mexico talks for tips on how to get on the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good side. Further dollar weakness is continuing to bolster the euro and sterling, providing another headwind for European stocks to deal with. But with US GDP tomorrow and non-farms coming up next week this near-term weakness in the greenback may soon reverse \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and while this will help the FTSE on the sterling front, a higher dollar will hit commodity prices, limiting potential upside for the index, suggesting those looking for gains will keep their money stateside. Over in the eurozone, Italian 10 year government bond yields have hit a three month high on worries about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending plans and its debt levels. Italian deputy prime minister Luigi Di Maio told the Il Fatto Quotidiano today that its public deficit could top the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ceiling of 3% of GDP next year. Jim Reid at Deutsche Bank said: Italian politicians seems to have continued to escalate their rhetoric regarding potential budget conflict with the European Union. Deputy Prime Minister Di Maio, leader of the Five Star Movement, said that Italy has no intention of withdrawing from the union or the currency zone, but that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we will look at all measures in discussions regarding the European budget and will block what doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work for us.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The other Deputy Prime Minister, from the Northern League, Matteo Salvini, echoed Di Maio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sentiments, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to cut financing to a useless entity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The principle point of contention is immigration policy, with Italian leaders arguing that the rest of Europe needs to do more to assist Italy with their influx of migrants. The US-Mexico deal is welcome but gives little indication as to the outcome of the current dispute between Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government and China, suggests Alejo Czerwonko, emerging market strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s developments constitute a step in the right direction towards a revamped and modernized NAFTA. The road to a final agreement remains rocky. Several thorny issues must still be ironed out once Canada joins discussions. The most important of these involve the dispute resolution mechanism, government procurement, and agriculture. In addition, a final deal will have to be approved by each country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legislature. Although the exact timing is uncertain, we expect the countries to ultimately reach a trilateral deal, avoiding the serious consequences that would have resulted from President Trump carrying out his threat to withdraw from NAFTA... Importantly, we warn against extrapolating NAFTA optimism to the realm of US-China bilateral relationships. Trump administration documents demonstrate that current concerns about China reach beyond the narrow issue of trade, suggesting they are not going to dissipate easily. We recently reduced the size of our overweight position in global equities, bringing our overall global tactical asset allocation stance to broadly neutral. A key reason for our risk reduction was our view that the market was not pricing in the increased risk of the US-China tariff issue. Talks between China and the US have yielded little progress in recent days, and the US is still on track to impose 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c25% tariffs on $200bn of trade with China, and has threatened more. While we expect US-China tensions to persist over the medium term, a near-term de-escalation cannot be ruled out. In the months ahead, a reduction in trade risks or improving valuations may increase the risk/ reward for global equities. Comments from UK prime minister Theresa May on a no-deal Brexit have also done the pound little favours, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, while Chinese concerns have tempered the market enthusiasm for the Mexico deal: Though tentatively positive, the European markets hardly went doolally for Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deal with Mexico, any good will tempered by a) the unresolved, and tense situation with Canada, and b) the even more unresolved, and even more tense situation with China. The FTSE, somewhat playing catch-up after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank Holiday, jumped 0.6% after the bell, striking 7625 for the first time in nearly a fortnight. The miners played a key role in driving the UK index higher, having been something of a pest for the FTSE in recent weeks, with added gains in the banking sector. A lack of movement from the pound likely aided the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tuesday rise. Cable sat flat the wrong side of $1.29, while against the euro sterling slipped 0.1%, the currency pinned back by Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarkably chilled approach to a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit, with the PMI stating that such an outcome \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the end of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The Eurozone indices weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as enthusiastic as their UK peer on Tuesday, having climbed a fair amount on Monday. The DAX added another 30 or so points, and, a smidge shy of 12600 is sitting at its best price for 18 days; the CAC, meanwhile, started fairly flat, but is nevertheless knocking on the door of 5500. After a long weekend in the UK, traders have pushed the pound down to a one year low against the euro on continuing fears of a no-deal Brexit. Among the headlines prompting concern, French prime minister Edouard Phillipe has reportedly asked ministers to prepare contingency plans for no deal. So sterling fell to a 12 month low of 90.73p although it has recovered slightly to 90.60p, down 0.01%. With the dollar weaker as the US-Mexico trade deal sends investors into riskier assets, the pound has managed to edge 0.07% higher to $1.2900. Against a basket of currencies, the US currency dipped 0.03% to 94.74. As expected, the US-Mexico deal has eased some of the trade tensions which have been building up for months now thanks to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confrontational approach to the issue. So the FTSE 100 is up 0.56%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 0.3% better and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.2%. Continuing worries about the stand-off with China however are likely to limit the gains. Here are IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening calls for Europe: Trade tensions have been hanging over the market, and the deal with Mexico is certainly a step in the right direction, says David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets. But there is still China of course. Madden says: Traders are still mindful that the US-China talks last week didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t achieve much. It would appear that the trade spat will rumble on and there is chatter in the markets that the US is eyeing up another round of tariffs on Chinese goods, but this time it could be up to $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. The US department of agriculture has plans to financially support farmers who have been targeted by Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs, and this initiative suggests how determined Washington DC is to maintain a hard-line. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. For once there is some positive news on the US and trade. Having gone toe to toe with China and Europe over tariffs, President Trump has now agreed a new trade deal with Mexico (despite the wall he is so keen to build between the two countries). Trump had threatened to rip up the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the two countries and Canada, but this new deal with Mexico has eased the uncertainty and put pressure on Canada to also sign up. However Trump has said he could still put tariffs on Canadian made cars if it refuses to agree to the new deal and also wants concessions on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dairy products. So the prospect of a trade war between the two countries has not yet gone away. In typical fashion Trump boasted about how great the new deal was, and also said the NAFTA name would be ditched: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get rid of the name Nafta. It has a bad connotation because the United States was hurt very badly by Nafta for many years and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now a really good deal for both countries...I think it is one of the largest trade deals ever made \u00e2\u20ac\u201c maybe the largest trade deal ever made. Economist Paul Donovan at UBS said: US President Trump declared an end to NAFTA and proposed a not-NAFTA deal with Mexico (which looks a lot like NAFTA). Canada is not yet included, and effectively has until Friday to sign up. Markets have treated this as progress, and a sign that the free trade system on which US companies depend will not be abandoned. Details do remain limited \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is hard to fit the complexities of a trade deal into a tweet. However, this is not risk free. Not-NAFTA will require Congressional approval, and without Canada, fast track authority probably cannot be used. This does not have a bearing on the Chinese trade negotiations (which do not appear to be going that well). Not-NAFTA lies somewhere between the EU negotiations (keeping things as they were) and China (political problems). It does stress the unpredictable nature of a policy that depends on the personal whims of the US president. Still, as Donovan indicated, the news sent US markets sharply higher, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq hitting new records and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising more than 1%. European markets are also expected to benefit, with the UK having some ground to make up after the Bank Holiday weekend. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: London returns from a three-day weekend and the FTSE has some catching up to do after a positive close for European markets on Monday.

                "bodyText":"The US economy recorded its strongest economic growth in nearly four years in the three months to the end of June, according to revised figures. Gross domestic product increased at a 4.2% annualized rate, the commerce department said on Wednesday after revising its second-quarter calculations, establishing the quarter as the strongest in terms of growth since late 2014. Many economists had forecast a downward revision of growth to about 4%. The figures helped send Wall Street to new highs on Wednesday. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq indexes both broke records for the fourth consecutive session, boosted by gains for technology companies including Amazon and Alphabet. Amazon rose 3.4% as the online retailer edged closer to becoming the second US company after Apple to be worth $1tn. Its market value stands at $971bn. After the initial calculation of 4.1% was announced in July, Donald Trump hailed the figures as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an economic turnaround of historic importance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. On Wednesday, the US treasury department attributed the revisions to higher levels of spending by businesses on software and a decline in imports, including petroleum. Balanced out against out against GDP numbers for previous quarters, the revision puts the US economy on track to hit the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of 3% annual growth. But economists warn that the growth is unlikely to be sustained as the quarter reflected unique boosters, including Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $1.5tn tax cut package, which helped tweak consumer spending upwards, and revenue from soya bean exports to China ahead of raised tariffs coming into effect. Economists had expected second-quarter GDP growth would be revised down one-tenth of a percentage point to a 4% pace in anticipation of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153America First\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd policies, including tit-for-tat tariff hikes between the US, China, the EU, Canada and Mexico coming into effect. On the downside, growth in consumer spending was lowered to 3.8% in the second quarter instead of the previously reported 4%. But the trends may be reversed in the coming months. The US Conference Board, which measures consumer confidence, a solid indicator of consumer spending which accounts for two-thirds of US economic activity, said its confidence index had hit its highest level since October 2000. The index climbed to 133.4 in August, despite expectations from a survey of Reuters economists that it would fall to 126.7, as consumers reported short-term economic optimism. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These historically high confidence levels should continue to support healthy consumer spending in the near term,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board. The rise in consumer confidence comes as US stocks hit record highs after a six-month climb back from February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market correction \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the S&amp;P 500 index has jumped 3% in the past two weeks. Trump tweeted to trumpet the news: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumer confidence pops in August to highest level since October 2000.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A plentiful job supply, coupled with a rise in the percentage of US households describing current business conditions as improving to 40.3%, from 38.1% a month earlier, are key components for the overall rise in consumer confidence. In a note to clients, Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, noted that consumer optimism \u00e2\u20ac\u0153suggests a degree of skepticism about trade, inflation or anything else knocking the economy off track\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Baird warned however that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consumers may be caught by surprise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd should any of those develop into a larger problem.",
