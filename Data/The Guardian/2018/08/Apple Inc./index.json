Markit said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>US manufacturing firms signalled a strong improvement in operating conditions in July, despite the headline PMI falling to a five-month low. Weaker rises in output and employment were seen in July, while export sales fell for the second month in a row. Meanwhile, companies reported the greatest deterioration in vendor performance since the series began and a faster rate of input cost inflation. That said, business confidence remained strongly positive, and was supported by hopes of further increases in overall new orders. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"229fcaf4943b426b3e0f5d17bf54c1384b6c92c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/229fcaf4943b426b3e0f5d17bf54c1384b6c92c5/0_0_873_518/500.jpg\" alt=\"uspmi1aug\" width=\"500\" height=\"297\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US manufacturing sector continued to expand in July, but shows increasing signs of struggling against headwinds of supply shortages, rising prices and deteriorating exports. </p> <p>The latest survey showed output rising at a rate roughly equivalent to an annualised 1% pace of expansion, which is the weakest since late last year. While a weakening of new export orders for a second successive month suggested foreign demand has waned compared to earlier in the year, the slowdown can be also in part attributed to increased difficulties in sourcing sufficient quantities of inputs. Suppliers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 delivery delays were more widespread than at any time in the survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history. With producers often scrambling to buy enough raw materials, suppliers enjoyed greater pricing power. Not surprisingly, with tariffs also kicking in, cost pressures spiked higher again.</p> <p>Some relief for manufacturers came from strong domestic demand, which meant firms were increasingly able to pass higher costs on to customers. Average prices charged for goods consequently rose at the steepest rate for seven years, which is likely to feed through to higher consumer prices in coming months.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b61b799e4b0081aec3b9962\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T13:38:50.581Z\">2.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise has helped lift technology stocks on Wall Street, pushing the Nasdaq Composite 0.39% higher.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average - which also includes Apple - is marginally higher, up 0.04% while the S&amp;P 500 has opened 0.17% higher.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b61b0b8e4b0081aec3b991c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T13:31:22.438Z\">2.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Apple shares open up 4.4%</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Following its forecast-beating results and upbeat outlook, Apple shares have jumped 4.4% to $198.4. at the start of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading, helping support a US market rattled by renewed concerns about a damaging trade war between the US and China.</p> <p>The move means Apple is close to becoming the first company to be valued at $1tn.

Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Apple shares leapt 4% in after-hours trade and are set to open at a record high just shy of the $200 level. Although it would be a bit of a stretch, a push up to the $1tn mark today is a possibility - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a matter of time before it achieves a valuation of $1tn. If it does, cue some big profit taking but it would be a moment to savour for Tim Cook.</p> <p> We need the share price to break $203 to hit $1tn in market cap \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a little more than $5 above the after-hours level at $197-$198. Rather like the Dow at 25k, you kind of get the feeling investors will conspire to nudge it over the line. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in FAANGs now I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see why you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rotate some equity out of more exposed companies like Facebook and Netflix and opt for relative safety in Apple, whose multiples remain well short of FAANG peers. What might weigh today is broader market fears about trade wars with China as the White House sets out fresh tariff plans on $200bn of Chinese goods. Tim Cook was pretty circumspect on trade and tariffs on the call.</p> <p> Results were very impressive with a beat on revenues and EPS. iPhone sales were a shade weaker than forecast but on a number of important fronts we saw excellent numbers.</p> </blockquote> <p>The FAANGs - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-owner Alphabet - and the wider technology sector have been under pressure in recent days after poor results from Facebook and Twitter.

But the downbeat survey is unlikely to discourage the Bank of England from raising interest rates on Thursday, he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At 54.0, the latest UK manufacturing PMI is the lowest in three months and is a far cry from the levels seen towards the end of 2017. Weaker domestic demand saw new orders fall and the rate of output growth slip to the lowest in 16 months. Interestingly though, demand from abroad hit a six-month high, implying that firms are still reaping the rewards of better global growth, despite the recent moderation in Europe.</p> <p>But over coming months, life for manufacturers is unlikely to get any easier. The recent escalation in trade tensions is clearly a challenge, but increasingly the biggest headache for businesses is likely to be the threat of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit. This scenario would likely see huge congestion at ports and disruption to supply chains. While we suspect the probability of the UK leaving without an agreement in March next year is relatively low, an agreement may not come until late in the day.</p> <p>Until then, confidence could begin to fall as uncertainty increases \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the latest PMI suggests the degree of positive sentiment is already at a 21-month low.</p> <p>Having said all of that, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slip in the PMI is unlikely to faze Bank of England policymakers ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. Representing around 10% of output, manufacturing is a relatively small part of the UK growth mix. Importantly, the recent data flow \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly in the much larger service sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has largely backed up the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view that the economy has regained poise after the weak first quarter.</p> <p>For that reason, we think the Bank of England will increase interest rates this week. But the key thing to watch is what the Bank has to say on its next steps. In an ideal world, we think policymakers would like to hike rates again much sooner than markets are currently pricing (towards the end of 2019). But with Brexit uncertainty considerably ramping up, realistically we think the Bank will struggle to raise rates again before the UK leaves the EU next March.</p> <p>After Thursday, we currently don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anticipate another hike before May 2019.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b61725ee4b0353e1304fc95\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T08:43:22.623Z\">9.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The prospect of a trade war between the US and China is the biggest worry for UK manufacturers, says Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The dip in the [PMI] reading comes after an eventful month politically. But if manufacturers are not completely ignoring the Brexit uncertainty, they are nevertheless ploughing on regardless.</p> <p>If anything, the biggest current worry for a sector with so many exporters is the prospect of an all-out trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. The fear is that UK manufacturers become collateral damage in any tit-for-tat tariffs that are imposed at a time when firms are benefiting from their exposure to the still relatively buoyant global economy.</p> <p>The automotive industry is facing a particularly anxious time grappling as it is with weaker consumer sentiment, ambivalence towards diesel engines and uncertainty about those future trade arrangements. This is a real worry given the number of jobs and exports supported by the sector.</p> <p>But by contrast, UK aerospace enjoyed a good July, boosted by the Farnborough Airshow.

Overall production slowed, whilst new order growth took a leisurely pace, and it was the unbalanced reliance on export orders that kept the sector afloat with domestic clients keeping their distance. </p> <p>This general manufacturing malaise was compounded by a scarcity of essential raw materials and vendor delivery times lengthened at a pace not seen for ten months as supply chains stuttered and stumbled to meet contractual obligations. </p> <p>On the price front, firms raised client prices again in a bid to prevent another sudden increase in their own costs from gnawing away at hard-won profits. But, this strategy may not offer long-term solutions as uncertainty remains enemy no.1. Should operating conditions remain unchanged, this damp squib of a performance may persist and the UK has to look to other sectors to inject some vitality into its economic performance.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T09:23:48.300Z\">at 10.23am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b616f9fe4b0353e1304fc7b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-01T08:32:02.873Z\">9.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK manufacturing worse than expected</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories have performed slightly worse than forecast in July.</p> <p>IHS Markit/CIPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 54 last month, less than the 54.2 expected.

                "bodyText":"A host of manufacturing surveys for July showed a disappointing outcome for the UK, while eurozone growth was also sluggish. Over in the US factory growth slipped in July, while a jobs report was better than expected although it came with a warning on the outlook. The latest UK housing market report from Nationwide showed a 2.5% annual rise in July ahead of an expected Bank of England interest rate rise on Thursday. Overall markets were subdued after reports of an escalation in the trade dispute between the US and China, with President Trump said to be considering raising the existing 10% tariff on $200bn of imports from China to 25%. And following its positive results on Tuesday, Apple shares opened up 4.4%, pushing the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value close to a record $1tn. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. US factory growth dipped slightly in July, according to the latest manufacturing survey, partly due to falling exports and supply problems. The IHS Markit US manufacturing PMI came in at 55.3 last month, down from 55.4 and lower than the initial estimate of 55.5. Markit said: US manufacturing firms signalled a strong improvement in operating conditions in July, despite the headline PMI falling to a five-month low. Weaker rises in output and employment were seen in July, while export sales fell for the second month in a row. Meanwhile, companies reported the greatest deterioration in vendor performance since the series began and a faster rate of input cost inflation. That said, business confidence remained strongly positive, and was supported by hopes of further increases in overall new orders. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: The US manufacturing sector continued to expand in July, but shows increasing signs of struggling against headwinds of supply shortages, rising prices and deteriorating exports. The latest survey showed output rising at a rate roughly equivalent to an annualised 1% pace of expansion, which is the weakest since late last year. While a weakening of new export orders for a second successive month suggested foreign demand has waned compared to earlier in the year, the slowdown can be also in part attributed to increased difficulties in sourcing sufficient quantities of inputs. Suppliers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 delivery delays were more widespread than at any time in the survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history. With producers often scrambling to buy enough raw materials, suppliers enjoyed greater pricing power. Not surprisingly, with tariffs also kicking in, cost pressures spiked higher again. Some relief for manufacturers came from strong domestic demand, which meant firms were increasingly able to pass higher costs on to customers. Average prices charged for goods consequently rose at the steepest rate for seven years, which is likely to feed through to higher consumer prices in coming months. Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise has helped lift technology stocks on Wall Street, pushing the Nasdaq Composite 0.39% higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average - which also includes Apple - is marginally higher, up 0.04% while the S&amp;P 500 has opened 0.17% higher. Following its forecast-beating results and upbeat outlook, Apple shares have jumped 4.4% to $198.4. at the start of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading, helping support a US market rattled by renewed concerns about a damaging trade war between the US and China. The move means Apple is close to becoming the first company to be valued at $1tn. It would need to hit $203.25 to reach that level. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IG index on the expected opening for Wall Street: In pre-trading Apple shares are currently up around 4%, not quite enough so far to push it above a $1tn valuation. US private sector employers took on more workers than expected in July, according to a new report, partly due to this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hefty tax cuts. Ahead of the non-farm payroll numbers on Friday, ADP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment report showed a 219,000 increase in private sector jobs last month, compared to expectations of a 185,000 rise. Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of the ADP Research Institute, said: The labour market is on a roll with no signs of a slowdown in sight. Nearly every industry posted strong gains and small business hiring picked up. But there could be storm clouds ahead given President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariff plans and trade disputes. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Analytics which helped compile the report, said: The job market is booming, impacted by the deficit-financed tax cuts and increases in government spending. Tariffs have yet to materially impact jobs, but the multinational companies shed jobs last month, signalling the threat. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all good news for Apple despite its upbeat results and its approach towards a $1tn valuation. Samuel Gibbs reports: Huawei overtook Apple to become the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest smartphone seller behind Samsung in the second quarter, the first time in seven years that any contender has managed to split the top two. Multiple market analysts said that Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise came as the slowdown in China, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest market for smartphones, eased, with growing market share in Europe. Huawei failed in its recent bid to launch in the US after government action against companies deemed a security threat. Despite Apple being historically weak in the second quarter, analysts described the rise of Huawei as significant. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The importance of Huawei overtaking Apple this quarter cannot be overstated,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Canalys analyst Ben Stanton. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is the first time in seven years that Samsung and Apple have not held the top two positions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Our full report is here: The FTSE 100 has taken a turn for the worse in the course of the morning. Trade tensions are uppermost in investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds following reports that the US plans to raise the tariffs it plans of $200bn worth of imports from China from the original 10% to 25%. So commodity stocks are among the leading fallers on concerns that any slowdown in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy would hit the sector hard. Sharp falls in the likes of Next, Direct Line and Rio Tinto after their latest updates is also hitting the market, leaving the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index 1% or 77 points lower at 7671. So is this the day Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market value hits $1tn? All eyes will be on Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open to see how the better than expected results are received. Will investors push Apple higher or decide to take profits? Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, says: Apple shares leapt 4% in after-hours trade and are set to open at a record high just shy of the $200 level. Although it would be a bit of a stretch, a push up to the $1tn mark today is a possibility - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a matter of time before it achieves a valuation of $1tn. If it does, cue some big profit taking but it would be a moment to savour for Tim Cook. We need the share price to break $203 to hit $1tn in market cap \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a little more than $5 above the after-hours level at $197-$198. Rather like the Dow at 25k, you kind of get the feeling investors will conspire to nudge it over the line. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in FAANGs now I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see why you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rotate some equity out of more exposed companies like Facebook and Netflix and opt for relative safety in Apple, whose multiples remain well short of FAANG peers. What might weigh today is broader market fears about trade wars with China as the White House sets out fresh tariff plans on $200bn of Chinese goods. Tim Cook was pretty circumspect on trade and tariffs on the call. Results were very impressive with a beat on revenues and EPS. iPhone sales were a shade weaker than forecast but on a number of important fronts we saw excellent numbers. The FAANGs - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-owner Alphabet - and the wider technology sector have been under pressure in recent days after poor results from Facebook and Twitter. But Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures could give some badly needed support to the sector. The pound is not getting much help from the prospect of an interest rate rise on Thursday. Against the dollar it is down 0.05% at $1.3117, while against the euro is has edged up 0.05% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1229. The survey is positive about exports but less so about domestic demand, says Helena Sans, head of manufacturing at Barclays: A disappointing result for the manufacturing sector in July with PMI at a three-month low, although still firmly in positive territory. Of more concern is the weakest business confidence score for 21 months, indicating that the industry is desperate for a degree of clarity and progress on the Brexit negotiations and a better understanding of what the final outcome will mean for manufacturers. It looks like a tale of two markets at the moment, with export growth accelerating but domestic demand struggling to keep pace. Aside from the encouraging news for exporters, the only other real bright spot was more job growth, with two full years of consecutive monthly employment increases no mean feat. Following the weaker than expected UK manufacturing report, things are unlikely to improve in the immediate future, says ING Bank economist James Smith. But the downbeat survey is unlikely to discourage the Bank of England from raising interest rates on Thursday, he says: At 54.0, the latest UK manufacturing PMI is the lowest in three months and is a far cry from the levels seen towards the end of 2017. Weaker domestic demand saw new orders fall and the rate of output growth slip to the lowest in 16 months. Interestingly though, demand from abroad hit a six-month high, implying that firms are still reaping the rewards of better global growth, despite the recent moderation in Europe. But over coming months, life for manufacturers is unlikely to get any easier. The recent escalation in trade tensions is clearly a challenge, but increasingly the biggest headache for businesses is likely to be the threat of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit. This scenario would likely see huge congestion at ports and disruption to supply chains. While we suspect the probability of the UK leaving without an agreement in March next year is relatively low, an agreement may not come until late in the day. Until then, confidence could begin to fall as uncertainty increases \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the latest PMI suggests the degree of positive sentiment is already at a 21-month low. Having said all of that, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slip in the PMI is unlikely to faze Bank of England policymakers ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. Representing around 10% of output, manufacturing is a relatively small part of the UK growth mix. Importantly, the recent data flow \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly in the much larger service sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has largely backed up the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view that the economy has regained poise after the weak first quarter. For that reason, we think the Bank of England will increase interest rates this week. But the key thing to watch is what the Bank has to say on its next steps. In an ideal world, we think policymakers would like to hike rates again much sooner than markets are currently pricing (towards the end of 2019). But with Brexit uncertainty considerably ramping up, realistically we think the Bank will struggle to raise rates again before the UK leaves the EU next March. After Thursday, we currently don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anticipate another hike before May 2019. The prospect of a trade war between the US and China is the biggest worry for UK manufacturers, says Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking: The dip in the [PMI] reading comes after an eventful month politically. But if manufacturers are not completely ignoring the Brexit uncertainty, they are nevertheless ploughing on regardless. If anything, the biggest current worry for a sector with so many exporters is the prospect of an all-out trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. The fear is that UK manufacturers become collateral damage in any tit-for-tat tariffs that are imposed at a time when firms are benefiting from their exposure to the still relatively buoyant global economy. The automotive industry is facing a particularly anxious time grappling as it is with weaker consumer sentiment, ambivalence towards diesel engines and uncertainty about those future trade arrangements. This is a real worry given the number of jobs and exports supported by the sector. But by contrast, UK aerospace enjoyed a good July, boosted by the Farnborough Airshow. Bumper orders for the major aircraft manufacturers will help the small- and medium-sized businesses in their supply chains and the launch of the new Tempest fighter jet has the potential to safeguard thousands of highly-skilled jobs. The weaker than expected figures could give the Bank of England second thoughts if it really is planning to raise UK interest rates on Thursday, suggests IHS Markit director Rob Dobson: The financial markets still seem to have an interest rate increase nailed on for August. However, if the combination of weaker growth and a softening of pipeline cost pressures at manufacturers is mirrored in the larger service sector, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision will be far from unanimous and they may even yet find some cause for pause. The figure of 54 for July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK manufacturing PMI is a three month low, albeit that any number over 50 shows the sector is expanding. Markit said: The softer growth patch of the UK manufacturing sector continued at the start of the third quarter. July saw slower rates of expansion in both output and new orders, as weaker growth of new work from domestic sources offset a stronger increase in new export orders. Price pressures also remained elevated as a strong increase in average input costs led to the steepest rise in selling prices since February... July saw the degree of positive sentiment dip to a 21-month low, amid reports of uncertainty regarding both Brexit and the exchange rate. Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply which co-compiles the survey, said: There was a flatline feel to manufacturing this month, as the sector held its ground, but only just. Overall production slowed, whilst new order growth took a leisurely pace, and it was the unbalanced reliance on export orders that kept the sector afloat with domestic clients keeping their distance. This general manufacturing malaise was compounded by a scarcity of essential raw materials and vendor delivery times lengthened at a pace not seen for ten months as supply chains stuttered and stumbled to meet contractual obligations. On the price front, firms raised client prices again in a bid to prevent another sudden increase in their own costs from gnawing away at hard-won profits. But, this strategy may not offer long-term solutions as uncertainty remains enemy no.1. Should operating conditions remain unchanged, this damp squib of a performance may persist and the UK has to look to other sectors to inject some vitality into its economic performance. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories have performed slightly worse than forecast in July. IHS Markit/CIPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 54 last month, less than the 54.2 expected. This was lower than the June figure of 54.3, itself revised down from the initial estimate of 54.4. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s country by country manufacturing PMIs for July: The overall eurozone manufacturing sector was subdued in July, according to IHS Markit, and there could be worse to come. The final purchasing managers index edged up from 54.9 in June to 55.1 as trade tensions and rising prices dented optimism. The final figure was unchanged from the initial estimate, and follows disappointing second quarter eurozone GDP figures released on Tuesday. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: A marginal uptick in the PMI provides little cause for cheer given it is the second weakest number for more than one-and-a-half years. The past two months have seen the most subdued spell of factory output growth since late-2016. Worse may be to come. Even this reduced rate of output growth continued to outpace order book growth, resulting in the smallest rise in order book backlogs for two years. The clear implication is that manufacturers may have to adjust production down in coming months unless demand revives. Clues to the current soft patch lie in the export growth trend, which has deteriorated dramatically since the start of the year across all member states to reach a near-two year low, with France and Austria seeing exports fall into decline in July. The survey responses indicate that the slowdown likely reflects worries about trade wars, tariffs and rising prices, as well as general uncertainty about the economic outlook. Optimism about the future remained at one of the lowest levels seen over the past two years. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector recovered from June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 18 month low last month, albeit more slowly than initial estimates. IHS Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s purchasing managers index rose from 55.9 in June to 56.9, lower than the initial reading of 57.3. IHS Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economist Sian Jones said: The beginning of the second half of the year brought a faster rise in manufacturing growth among German manufacturers. Following a dip in overall performance in June, the upturn in output and new orders strengthened. That said, the increase in production continued to outpace that of new orders as firms expanded their efforts to clear backlogs. Although slightly weaker than June, employment growth continued to grow sharply, with greater production requirements a key factor behind sustained job creation. Panellists also reported stronger optimism towards future output growth, the most robust since April. Concerns were raised however, with some respondents noting uncertainty surrounding tariffs and further marked rises in input costs as risks to future growth. In turn, pressure on supply chains remained significant as firms continued to comment on bottlenecks at suppliers. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories did better in July than analysts had been expecting. IHS/Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing purchasing managers index climbed from 52.5 in June to 53.3, compared to an initial reading of 53.1. Output and new orders increased but exports fell back amid global trade tensions. IHS Markit economist Alex Gill said: July saw renewed growth momentum in the French manufacturing sector, with output and new orders rising at sharper rates, moving off their recent lows seen in June. Stronger client demand encouraged firms to take on additional staff, raise their purchasing activity and boosted hopes of further near-term growth. The only slight blip was a first fall in new export orders since September 2016, as global trade tensions hamper foreign demand. With trade tensions on the rise again, investors are in a cautious mood despite Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than expected results. The FTSE 100 is down 0.44%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has edged up 0.21% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.35%. Among the companies reporting, Lloyds Banking Group is leading the FTSE 100 risers, up 1.8% but Next is down nearly 6% despite a good second quarter as it expressed caution about the prospects for August sales. Among the mid-caps in the FTSE 250, BBA Aviation has slumped 15% after saying it expected \u00e2\u20ac\u0153modest growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd this year. Outsourcing group Capita is down 9.5% as it said its turnaround plan was on track after a collapse in profits but it would be a long road ahead. Commenting on the Nationwide house price index, Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, said: Two steps forward, one step back \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual rate of price growth has barely shifted from where it was a year ago. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tempting to see such a meandering market as the fruit of a cautious consensus. Instead it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a byproduct of the collision of three conflicting forces; pent-up demand, low supply and patchy confidence. With activity levels slowly picking up, the rising tension is creating some big regional anomalies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c making the national average as misleading as it is insipid. The future course of the market is balanced on a knife edge. With the Bank of England set to notch up interest rates tomorrow, the prospect of more expensive mortgages should jolt some previously hesitant buyers into action. Yet any extra impetus is likely to be immediate but ephemeral. By contrast, the forces holding back the market will get steadily stronger if the UK sleepwalks into a no-deal Brexit. If the prospect of Britain crashing out of the EU continues its shift from long shot to likely, the top end of the market could slip into full retreat as investment buyers go into lockdown. For everyone else, softening prices and better affordability will create buying opportunities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly for the bold and strategic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in what will become an increasingly fractured market. Signs of strength in the UK housing market. The Press Association reports: Annual house price growth accelerated in July as the average property value hit a new record high of \u00c2\u00a3217,010, according to an index. Across the UK, house prices were up by 2.5% annually in July, compared with a 2% annual increase in June, Nationwide Building Society said. House prices increased by 0.6% month on month in July - the second month of increases in a row following a 0.7% upturn in June. With speculation that the Bank of England base rate could edge up on Thursday from 0.5% to 0.75%, Nationwide said a 0.25 percentage point rise is likely to have only a modest immediate impact on borrowers, many of whom are locked into fixed-rate deals. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Providing the economy does not weaken further, the impact of a further small rise in interest rates on UK households is likely to be modest. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is partly because only a relatively small proportion of borrowers will be directly impacted by the change. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most lending on personal loans and credit cards is fixed or tends to be unaffected by movements in the bank rate. Similarly, in recent years, the vast majority of new mortgages have been extended on fixed interest rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But, he continued: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the impact for most borrowers is likely to be modest, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to note that household budgets have been under pressure for some time because wages have not been rising as fast as the cost of living. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Indeed, in real terms (after adjusting for inflation) wage rates are still at levels prevailing in 2005.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mr Gardner said that, overall, Nationwide continues to expect house prices to increase by 1% over the course of 2018. Here are IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening calls for European markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Will Apple become the first company in history to be valued at $1tn? The company reported better than expected results after the market closed on Tuesday, helped by strong sales of the higher-cost iPhone X profits jumped 32%, and its shares rose 4% in the after-market, putting it tantalisingly close to the magic $1tn figure. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: Traders breathed a sigh of relief as Apple reported strong earnings after the close, putting a spark back into the Nasdaq... What was there not to like about these numbers? This was the news that the markets had been hoping for; there had been concerns going into this release that the iPhone X numbers just weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to stack up, but that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the case and Apple has managed to pull it out of the bag again, proving why it should be the first trillion-dollar company. The final 7% lift in the share price required to hit that trillion-dollar level shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be so tough achieve after a set of figures like that. Here is our report on the Apple numbers: Elsewhere it is another big day for company results, with Lloyds Banking Group reporting a 23% rise in pre-tax profit and Next defying the current retail blues with a 2.8% increase in second quarter full-price sales, helped by the warm weather boosting demand for summer outfits. We will also get the first snapshot of how the manufacturing sector has performed in July, with PMI figures from the UK, Europe and US. China has already reported, with its manufacturing sector growing at the slowest pace in eight months, with exports declining amid trade tensions. The Caixin/Markit PMI fell from 51 in June to 50.8 last month. The UK numbers are also expected to see a slight dip, from 54.4 to 54.2. But any figure above 50 shows expansion, and the decline is unlikely to deter the Bank of England if it really wants to raise interest rates on Thursday. As for Europe, Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also set to be another important day for economic data especially in light of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing EU Q2 GDP numbers which came in unexpectedly lower than anticipated. For most of this year we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been told that the slowdown that we saw in Q1 was going to be temporary, and likely weather related. The weak Q2 French GDP numbers and yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker than expected EU numbers would appear to give the lie to that perception, and more worryingly inflation appears to be showing signs of picking up. This is likely to be a concern for the European Central Bank especially if we see no evidence that Q3 is gearing to pick up the slack, with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s July manufacturing PMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taking on a much greater importance in terms of looking for a rebound in economic activity after the weaker readings we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen so far this year. Early indications aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t particularly encouraging if last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flash numbers from Germany and France are any guide though Germany did show some improvement, which should be confirmed at 57.3. France slowed to 53.1, while Spain and Italy are also expected to do the same, coming in at 53.1 and 53 respectively, both lower than their June readings. Much later the US Federal Reserve will announce its latest rate decision, although no change is expected this month, with an increase more likely in September. Markets remain edgy, especially with the latest reports suggesting an escalation in the current trade tensions. The US is said to be considering increasing its 10% tariffs on $200bn worth of Chinese imports to 25%.

But it also changed the company on a fundamental level, turning it from a computer manufacturer into a consumer electronics designer.</p> <p>In January 2007, the company completed this transformation, announcing that it was changing its name from Apple Computer to Apple Inc.

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meteoric rise: Goodnight. GW Apple has beaten several tech rivals for the crown of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first trillion dollar company. At one stage it looked like Amazon could get their first, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently \u00e2\u20ac\u0153only\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd worth around $880bn. Alphabet, Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, is close behind with a market capitalisation of around $850bn. Facebook, though, dropped firmly out of the running after it slashed profitability forecasts last week. One important aspect about Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revival since its 1990s slump is that it started perfecting, rather than creating, new product types. Apple wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t first with a smartphone or a digital music player, but it created compelling devices that trumped what had gone before. Our tech writer Alex Hern explains: MP3 players already existed, such as Malda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nomad Jukebox, and they were technically better, with larger hard drives, replaceable batteries, and compatibility with both Windows and Mac (the iPod would take another year to come to Windows). What did Apple have to offer? With hindsight, the answer is obvious. The iPod looked cool: it had a sleek aluminium shell half the size of its competitors, and a physical scroll wheel that could zoom through the trademark \u00e2\u20ac\u01531,000 songs in your pocket\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. By 2003 Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advertising agency, Chiat/Day, had come up with silhouette adverts to promote the iPod. The ads were almost too successful, turning the iPod\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s white earphones into such a marker of desirability that the Metropolitan police blamed them for a 26% rise in street robberies in 2005. The iPod revolutionised Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fortunes, kicking off a five-fold increase in its share price over the following five years, and providing a gateway drug for winning round Windows users to its Mac ecosystem. But it also changed the company on a fundamental level, turning it from a computer manufacturer into a consumer electronics designer. In January 2007, the company completed this transformation, announcing that it was changing its name from Apple Computer to Apple Inc. That same day, it also announced something else: the iPhone. More here: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impressive track record over the years: Apple has seen off plenty of critics on its march towards a trillion dollars, particularly in the 1990s when it was losing the Desktop PC battle to cheaper Windows machines. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shira Ovide has some examples: Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise to become America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most valuable publicly quoted firm began more than 40 years ago, when Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak began a company that would help kickstart and drive the computer revolution. Today, the firm behind the Macintosh, the iMac, the iPhone and the App Store is now worth more than Exxon Mobil, Procter &amp; Gamble (PG.N) and AT&amp;T put together. Reuters points out how the return of the late Steve Jobs two decades ago was crucial: . One of three founders, Jobs was driven out of Apple in the mid-1980s, only to return a decade later and rescue the computer company from near bankruptcy. He launched the iPhone in 2007, dropping \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Computer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name and super-charging the cellphone industry, catching Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O), Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Nokia off guard. That put Apple on a path to overtake Exxon Mobil in 2011 as the largest U.S. company by market value. The Silicon Valley stalwart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock has surged more than 50,000 percent since its 1980 initial public offering, dwarfing the S&amp;P 500\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approximately 2,000-percent increase during the same almost four decades. During that time, Apple evolved from selling Mac personal computers to becoming an architect of the mobile revolution with a cult-like following. More here. Newsflash: Apple has become the first US listed company to be worth one trillion dollars. The technology giant hit a $1 trillion market cap as its shares rallied following strong earnings results earlier this week. Apple shares jumped 3% to hit a session high of $207.05 , enough to reach the magic $1trn figure. More to follow.... Richard Flax, Chief Investment Officer at Moneyfarm, thinks today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise is hard to justify: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fact the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted in favour of a hike itself is notable. At the last meeting in June, the MPC voted by 6-3 to keep rates where they are. If anything, since then the case for rate hikes has gotten weaker not stronger. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t require too much cynicism to see the unanimous vote as some sort of message. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank and its governor are in an unenviable position - with a combination of low interest rates, low unemployment / low wage growth, sluggish economic growth, declining inflation and massive policy uncertainty around Brexit. They clearly want to normalise interest rate policy if they can - but the data hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t made it easy to justify.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reuters agrees... Higher interest rates will eat into the profits of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s buy-to-let lenders. Paul Haywood-Schiefer of accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise is a blow to the sector: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For many people who were getting no return on their capital due to long term low interest rates and decided to invest in buy to let properties this will be another blow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They wanted to get better returns and for many it was also part of their retirement plans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One solution is to push up rents, of course. And one controversial buy-to-let landlord has swiftly passed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise onto new tenants. Fergus Wilson, who owns hundreds of properties across Ashford and Maidstone in Kent, has announced: Following the interest rate rise I have increased rents in all our properties by \u00c2\u00a350 per month (fifty pounds). It is merely passing onto the tenant the additional mortgage charge. This increase starts immediately. I think this will only apply to new tenants, or when existing tenancies come up for renewal. Wilson was heavily criticised by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equality watchdog last year, as we reported: The buy-to-let mogul Fergus Wilson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ban on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coloured\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tenants because they allegedly left curry smells in his properties has been overturned in a court victory for the Equality and Human Rights Commission. At Maidstone county court, the judge, Richard Polden, granted an injunction against the landlord. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This policy clearly amounts to discrimination,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Polden said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I find the policy is unlawful. Such a policy has no place in our society.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ed Hall, director at law firm Gowling WLG, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise could hurt the economy, if it spooks consumers and businesses: Given that a quarter point rise is perceived to have a limited long-term impact on most business, the move would seem to make sense in terms of longer term strategy. However, in a period of increasing political and economic uncertainty, it can be argued that this move could damage confidence in what could be perceived as an already fragile economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Charles Hepworth, investment director at GAM, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153punchy move\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, given the uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU: Growth in the economy could hardly be described as above trend so members may have realised that this could be the last chance to move ahead before reaching the final Brexit end state. In any case the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response in a few months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time could look very different should the Brexit cliff edge slip nearer despite them saying more hikes will be needed. The currency markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t totally buying the hawkish message otherwise the pound would be rising, which it most certainly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Indeed. As you can see, the pound has dropped to its lowest level since 20th July today - not the move you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect after a rate hike. UK interest rates won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise again until at least March 2019, predicts Dean Turner, UK Economist at UBS Wealth Management. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to see further moves from the Bank ahead of Britain leaving the EU. Monetary policy is unlikely to be the key driver for sterling in the markets in the short term, as the spotlight returns to the Brexit saga. The real surprise is that all nine Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers voted to raise interest rates today. Before noon, many experts were predicting an 8-1 split, or even 7-2, with the most dovish MPC members pushing to keep rates on hold. Our Larry Elliott suggests the data doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t support such unanimity: Threadneedle Street has been overestimating wage inflation for years, and the former MPC member and labour market expert David Blanchflower says it is still doing so [something Carney rejected earlier] Recent official data has shown growth in total pay falling not rising. The economy, despite bouncing back in the second quarter, is far from booming. Retail sales were weak in June, the housing market is dead and inflation is coming back toward its 2% target more quickly than the Bank expected. In such circumstances, it is strange, even a little troubling, that not one MPC member opposed a rate hike. The inflation report makes it sound as if higher interest rates are a no-brainer. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a lot riskier than the Bank appears to think. Jon Ostler, UK CEO at price comparison site Finder.com, says savers need to be proactive to benefit from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s particularly good news for savers, who have suffered ultra-low interest rates for the past decade. They can expect a rise to their savings, albeit a small one. Now is a good time to consider switching your banking products, as banks will be reviewing their rates. Make sure you keep an eye on which banks are offering the best interest rates as not all of their products will increase by the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 25 basis points. Mortgage holders, and other borrowers, face a hit, through, he adds: For example, those paying off the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s average mortgage debt with a variable rate mortgage face paying an extra \u00c2\u00a317-\u00c2\u00a318 per month, which adds up to an extra \u00c2\u00a3200 per year or more than \u00c2\u00a36,000 over the life of a 30-year loan term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Time for a quick recap. The Bank of England has raised UK interest rates for only the second time since the financial crisis, despite concerns that Brexit could hurt the economy. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously to raise borrowing costs to 0.75%, from 0.5%, arguing that a modest increase is needed to keep inflation on target. Governor Mark Carney has defended the move. He told reporters that the economy is in a much healthier place than August 2016, when the BoE cut rates from 0.5% to 0.25%. Carney argued that: UK households were well-prepared for the rise, and that the poorest families would suffer most if the Bank allowed inflation to spike. The Bank was ready for all possibly Brexit outcomes, including Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal Monetary policy needed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153walk, not run\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to keep inflation on target and the economy growing. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a hint that future rate rises will be modest. Banks might not pass the entire increase onto savers The Bank might actually CUT rates, if Brexit negotiations go badly. The move has received a mixed reception, with business leaders criticising it and debt charities fearing that poor families will be dragged into financial difficulties. There is relief in the City that the Bank didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back away from pushing the button, having given plenty of hints that rates would rise today. But... Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious words have hit sterling; the pound is still in the red against the dollar, at $1.3050. Balraj Sroya, Sales Trader at Foenix Partners, explains why: Today the Bank of England defied Brexit uncertainty and brought music to the ears of Sterling bulls as the MPC voted unanimously to increase interest rates to 0.75%. Unfortunately, Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally higher was halted by the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd stating that the monetary policy needs to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153walk, not run, to stand still\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as the interest rates\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 natural level rises gradually. And finally, an important but technical question from the Financial Times. Q: does the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low estimate of the equilibrium level of interest rates (R*) means that quantitative easing is becoming a standard tool of economy policy, rather than just for emergencies? [explainer: if R* is really between zero and 1% today, as the Bank believes, rates might never get high enough to allow the Bank to start selling off the \u00c2\u00a3435bn of bonds it bought through QE during the crisis to stimulate the economy]. Mark Carney says this is a good question, to which he gives a long answer. The upshot is that Bank still expects to start unwinding QE when rates have risen to 1.5%. So if R* rises towards 2-3%, then this plan would still hold. Upshot: the MPC does not expect to keep holding its QE assets on its balance sheet indefinitely. Back on Brexit, and Mark Carney is defending the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach over the last two years. After the referendum, the BoE decided to take the hit in higher inflation (by cutting rates) rather than pushing unemployment up (by raising rates to strengthen the pound), he says. Q: But wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it be better to have waited a few months until we know how Brexit will pan out? No, governor Carney replies. We need a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmodest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 adjustment to policy now because wages are rising faster than inflation. He then explains that rates could rise, stay on hold, or even be cut depending how UK-EU negotiations play out. There are a wide range of Brexit outcomes, but in many of them interest rates will be at least as high as they are today. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to keep our powder dry for that. There are certain circumstances where it would be appropriate to either keep rates the same or lower them. If that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the case, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what the MPC will do. It would be a mistake to wait, wait, wait until you have perfect certainty, because you never know when that point will arise, he concludes. Q: What do you say to business groups who think this rate rise is a mistake? We have a good sense of the challenges faced by British businesses, Carney replies. The Bank knows that this has been the shallowest investment recovery in decades. But...the overwhelming issue for businesses is the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. They should be confident that we will focus on our responsibilities, keeping inflation on target while ensuring the economy is prepared for whatever the outcome is. Christopher Vecchio of DailyFX says Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious guidance on future rate rises is hitting the pound. On trade wars, Carney says the tariffs imposed by the US, China and Europe on each others imports are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of the reasons that global growth is little weaker.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Bank doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see a material impact on the UK economy, yet, but it would be hurt by a slump in global confidence and investment. Mark Carney is now giving a long explanation about the equilibrium interest rate in the UK (known as R*). This is the level at which interest rates should be set to ensure the economy stays at an even keel. The Bank has estimated today that R* is zero to 1 percent, more than 2 percentage points below its pre-financial crisis level. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because UK productivity, fiscal headwinds and economic uncertainty are all pulling R* down. If they improve, R* could move closer to the 2-3% range, Carney explains. Danny Blanchflower has hit back at Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jibe, pointing out that UK wage growth has slowed recently - and is nowhere near 3% per year today. Our economics editor Larry Elliott goes next. Q: The Bank thinks the natural rate of unemployment is 4.25% (slightly above the current rate of 4.2%), which is why you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve raised interest rates. But some experts disagree; former MPC member professor Danny Blanchflower thinks it could be 3%. Why is he wrong, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right? Where do I begin, mutters Mark Carney (somewhat recklessly), before adding that he has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great respect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Prof B, but his time on the MPC has passed. Carney then explains that policymakers need to reorientate to new reality. He points out that labour cost growth is rising, and productivity growth remains disappointing, thus the UK needs higher borrowing costs to keep inflation on target. [historical note: Danny Blanchflower called, in vain, for UK interest rate cuts before the financial crisis struck, when the rest of the MPC was more worried about inflation] Q: Will this rate rise be passed onto savers, and what will the Bank do to help on this? Mark Carney says that savers have suffered over the course of the last decade from the absolutely necessary low interest rates. But he then suggests that banks might not pass today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise on in full. H explains that when rates hit record lows after the crisis, the spread between bank lending and borrowing rates were compressed. (That ate into bank profitability, so they will want to repair that by raising borrowing costs more than saving rates). As rates move up, one should expect more of them to be passed along, Carney adds. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden weighs in, saying: Historically you never get full pass-though of interest rate changes. Q: Surely poorest households are going to suffer from this rate rise? Mark Carney rebuts this, arguing that the Bank has a responsibility to keep inflation under control. The households that are most affected by high or volatile inflation, and most likely to be out of work, unfortunately, are poorer households. The best thing we can do is keep inflation sustainably on target, and keep the economy on track, he adds. Ouch! Sterling has just dropped against the US dollar, and is now down a whole cent at $1.303. The selloff began as Mark Carney explains that monetary policy needs to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153walk not run to stand still\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as the natural level of interest rates slowly rises. That looks like a hint that borrowing costs will not rise sharply in the next couple of years. Onto questions: Q: Are households ready for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise, particularly the poorest? Governor Carney says the Bank of England has been saying for a while that interest rates will go up, at a modest rate. That \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcforward guidance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was meant to give households and businesses clarity. And it worked, Carney says, with three-quarters of households expecting interest rate to go up over the next year. The important thing to recognise is that UK households have worked hard over the last decade to get into a better financial position, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve paid down debt and put themselves in a better position to service their debts. It would take another 100 basis point increase (to 1.75%) to bring the UK debt servicing burden back to the historic average. There is a lot more capacity for UK households to service their debts, Carney concludes. He also cited new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmortgage affordability\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tests that are meant to prevent reckless borrowing. Mark Carney insists that the Bank of England is well prepared for a wide range of Brexit outcomes. The banking system has enough money to keep lending through a cliff-edge Brexit, however unlikely that will be, the governor says. We are working with the Treasury and the European Central Bank to address risks that the banks can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t solve themselves, he adds. Onto Brexit. Mark Carney says that talks between the UK and the EU are at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153critical period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Households have been resilient but not indifferent to Brexit uncertainty, he adds, but there are signs that business confidence is softening again. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts are based on a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrelatively smooth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd transition period, the governor points out (implying it could take action if we end up with a No-Deal Brexit). Carney signals that further interest rate rises will be needed. If interest rates stay at 0.75%, then inflation will be over the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target over the next three years, he explains. Mark Carney says UK exporters are in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a sweet spot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with sterling down 17% compared to its pre-Brexit levels. He adds that the UK labour market is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with signs that earnings growth will accelerate later this year. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is giving a press conference now. Carney begins by referencing a famous quote from Harold Wilson, saying: If a week is a long time in politics, then two years is an eternity in monetary policy. He reminds us that the Bank cut borrowing costs to a record low of 0.25%, after the Brexit vote. Back in 2016, there was substantial spare capacity in the economy, business confidence was its lowest since the financial crisis, and inflation was due to overshoot its target \u00e2\u20ac\u0153entirely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd due to Brexit fears which had driven the pound down. Now, though, the economy is strong enough to justify an interest rate rise to 0.75%. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, says Mark Carney and colleagues have taken a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bold move\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by raising borrowing costs today. By early 2019, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll know if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right, he adds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank has so clearly telegraphed this rate rise that markets would have been shocked had rates been left on hold. The unanimity of the decision probably reflects the view that the UK is, quite simply, running out of spare capacity. But sub-trend growth and a cloudy outlook hardly make a compelling case for a higher UK rates. In six months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time this decision will look either prescient or premature. Either way it is bold move.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Oof! Suren Thiru, Head of Economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), says the Bank of England was wrong to raise interest rates today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decision to raise interest rates, while expected, looks ill-judged against a backdrop of a sluggish economy. While a quarter point rise may have a limited long-term financial impact on most businesses, it risks undermining confidence at a time of significant political and economic uncertainty. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The increase reinforces a concerning aspect of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent approach to monetary policy, which appears to be overly focused on reinforcing an idealised direction for rates, rather than on economic reality \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an approach that unnecessarily risks UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth prospects. The central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assumption that the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speed limit has slowed is unduly pessimistic, as sustained action to fix the fundamentals at home, from closing the skills gap to greater infrastructure investment, would materially help lift the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth potential. Thiru hopes the Bank won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raise borrowing costs again anytime soon: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The MPC must carefully consider what happens next. The most preferential option would be for a sustained period of monetary stability amid the current economic and political uncertainty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Simon Underwood, business recovery partner at accountancy firm, Menzies LLP, fears that this rate rise will hurt businesses - especially those reliant on consumer spending. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The MPC may have been swayed by the summer heatwave and England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success in the World Cup, which have had a positive impact on consumer behaviour, boosting retail sales temporarily. However, it is unlikely this positive sentiment will be maintained and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to increase rates will impact consumer spending ahead of the critical final quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For businesses serving consumers in the retail and hospitality &amp; leisure sectors, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision will be very unwelcome news and we should expect more turmoil on the high street in the short to medium term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd My colleague Richard Partington reports from the Bank of England: The Bank of England has raised interest rates above the emergency level introduced straight after the financial crisis, despite mounting fears over Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal. Signalling the gradual return of higher borrowing costs, Threadneedle Street raised interest rates to 0.75% from 0.5% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the level they were dropped to in March 2009 as the economy lurched through the last recession. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee judged the economy could withstand higher interest rates, which it believes are required to curb persistently high inflation above its 2% target set by the government. An extra 0.25% interest will add \u00c2\u00a312 a month to a \u00c2\u00a3100,000 repayment mortgage and \u00c2\u00a325 on a \u00c2\u00a3200,000 loan. However, nearly 70% of homebuyers now have fixed rate mortgages so will be unaffected. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our Q&amp;A on how higher UK interest rates will affect you: Although today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise is modest, it will hurt families who are already forced to borrow to pay for the essentials. Phil Andrew, chief executive at StepChange Debt Charity, says politicians need to provide more help to theses households: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whilst a rise in interest rates might be right for the wider economy, from a consumer debt perspective many households are walking a precarious budget tightrope, as their incomes don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stretch to cover the basics each month. These are the households that a rate rise will affect most. Policymakers mustn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lose sight of what a rate rise means for real people on a tight budget. The fact that the wider economy can cope doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always mean individual households can. Government and policymakers need to take parallel steps to ensure support is there for those who are negatively affected, especially if more rate rises are coming.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I mentioned earlier this morning that Mark Carney was known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for failing to stick to his promises. Calum Bennie, savings specialist at Scottish Friendly, thinks the governor has turned over a new leaf by raising rates today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise means that Mark Carney has probably shaken off his tag of being the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for good. While the decision indicates the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is picking up steam, it also means higher borrowing costs, so households must be even more prudent to absorb the additional cost. The move is good news for savers but still cash account rates are unlikely to beat inflation, so stocks and shares Isas remain better for those looking to grow their savings long-term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much reaction in the financial markets to the rate hike - which figures, as it was widely expected. The pound has clawed back some of its losses, but is still slightly lower against the US dollar today at $1.31. Shares are still being pummelled by those trade war fears, leaving the FTSE 100 down 93 points or 1.2%. The Bank of England has hinted that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in no rush to raise interest rates again in the coming months. It say that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153any future increases in Bank Rate are likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Bank of England also has also warned that Brexit could damage the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery: The MPC continues to recognise that the economic outlook could be influenced significantly by the response of households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal. The Bank of England says it is raising interest rates because the economy has recovered from its slowdown during last snowy winter. The minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting says: Recent data appear to confirm that the dip in output in the first quarter was temporary, with momentum recovering in the second quarter. The labour market has continued to tighten and unit labour cost growth has firmed. The MPC continues to judge that the UK economy currently has a very limited degree of slack. Unemployment is low and is projected to fall a little further. The BoE also points out that prices are rising faster than its target (2%), so it is raising borrowing costs to squeeze inflation. CPI inflation was 2.4% in June, pushed above the 2% target by external cost pressures resulting from the effects of sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s past depreciation and higher energy prices. The contribution of external pressures is projected to ease over the forecast period while the contribution of domestic cost pressures is expected to rise. Every member of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nine-strong monetary policy committee voted to raise interest rates. NEWSFLASH: The Bank of England has voted to raise UK interest rates to their highest level in almost a decade. The BoE is raising Bank rate to 0.75%, from 0.5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level since March 2009, and only the second rise since the financial crisis struck a decade ago. More to follow! An interest rate rise would obviously be a blow to borrowers, as it would push up the cost of repaying debts. This chart from Resolution Foundation shows how a rise to 0.75% would force a small number of mortgage owners to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctake action\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in some way: Back in June, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MPC was split six-three -- with a trio of policymakers voting to raise interest rates. Danielle Haralambous, UK Analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts that the majority will vote to hike today, but it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a 9:0 win for the hawks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect the MPC to raise the policy rate to 0.75% today, although it is unlikely to be a unanimous vote. Some of the economic data has softened in recent months, notably core inflation and wage growth, which may prevent some MPC members from changing their vote in favour of higher interest rates. Our economics correspondent, Richard Partington, explains why the Bank of England will (probably) raise borrowing costs today: Inflation has remained stubbornly above the 2% target set for the Bank by the government, after having risen sharply straight after the EU referendum result. Some rate setters on the MPC, including the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Andy Haldane, also believe wage growth is just around the corner for workers, amid the lowest levels of unemployment since the mid 1970s, a factor that could help boost workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bargaining power for higher pay. The summer heatwave, royal wedding and England progressing to the semi-final of the World Cup helped boost the economy, triggering stronger retail sales in April and May before they unexpectedly fell back in June. The Office for National Statistics found that the warmer weather helped the economy rebound from a slowdown earlier this year after heavy snowfall from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beast from the east\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More here: Tension is rising in the City, with around 30 minutes to wait until the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision. Traders broadly expect borrowing costs to rise at noon today, to a nine-year high of 0.75%. But this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t giving the pound any love. Sterling is still bobbing at a two-week low against the dollar, with some investors speculating that the Bank could dampen expectations of further interest rate rises any time soon. John Goldie, FX Strategist at Argentex, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank of England are firmly expected to raise rates this lunch time, only the second hike since 2007. However, most commentators are expecting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dovish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hike with perhaps some dissenters within the committee (one or two may vote to keep rates on hold still) and/or the statements to play down further hiking expectations in the near term. Plus, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discount the possibility that the Bank sits on its hands again. But that would badly hurt its credibility, given its recent guidance that a rate rise is close. Sue Kershaw, managing director of major project advisory at KPMG, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders benefitted from the hot summer, but warns that Brexit could derail the recovery seen last month. She writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Seeing housebuilding come back to good health is hugely positive. As the longstanding driver of activity, the weakening demand we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d seen in recent months did cause some concern and raised questions as to whether residential construction had peaked and was heading for a steady decline. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But supply chain and cost pressures still remain a cause for concern. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing input costs continue to creep up and the outcome of Brexit negotiations is still far from clear. Those with infrastructure arms will also be concerned about the sluggish-looking civil engineering market, traditionally quite a reliable source of activity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Phil Harris, Director at BLP Insurance, fears that the collapse of the merger between shopping centre groups Hammerson and Intu could hurt construction. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153July was another strong month for commercial activity but the sector remains vulnerable to volatility. British retailers continue to close shops at a pace and the full impact of shopping centre developer, Hammerson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failed takeover of rival Intu may have yet to be fully felt. With many predicting the closure of more Hammerson sites, growth in July may prove a false dawn.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brendan Sharkey, head of construction and real estate at accountancy firm MHA MacIntyre Hudson, points out that Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock collapse in January has caused less damage than feared. However, a hard Brexit might not be shaken off as easily: Construction has been relatively slow to wake up to the dangers posed by Brexit. Given the industry doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t depend on exports, the potential pitfalls of a no-deal Brexit have perhaps been easier to overlook. Yet construction does depend on the import of raw materials, and crucially on the free movement of labour. Over the next few months we will see more focus on contingency planning and demand for additional information and support from the government. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The consequences of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse were over-hyped but only a very foolhardy captain of industry can assume the same will be true about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: China has hit back at America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threats to impose steep tariffs on its goods (see earlier post). Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commerce ministry has told reporters it is fully prepared to fight back, if America delivers on Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose 25% tariffs. This is driving financial markets deeper into the red. The FTSE 100 is now down 80 points, with mining stocks leading the selloff. Trivia corner: UK interest rate have never been pegged at 0.75%, since the Bank of England was established in 1694. Back in July 2007, the BoE raised interest rates to 5.75% just as the credit crunch began. It was began cutting as the financial crisis kicked in, including a monster Bank Rate cut from 4.5% to 3% in November 2008. In March 2009 it halved borrowing costs to 0.5%, where they remained until the Brexit vote prompted a cut to 0.25%, which was reversed in November 2017. The pick-up in building activity in July will reassure the Bank of England, as it suggest the construction sector could handle higher borrowing costs. However, yesterday we heard that manufacturing growth slowed a little last month, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mixed picture. The opposition Labour party is concerned that consumers will be hurt by higher borrowing costs. John McDonnell MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chancellor, has warned that higher interest rates will push more people into debt: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With wages still below 2010 levels and the gap between people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s income and outgoings at record levels, the concern must be that a pattern of interest rate rises will push more families into higher levels of debt. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government needs to end its counterproductive austerity programme and raise people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incomes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey of purchasing managers at UK construction firms: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders achieved an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153impressive turnaround\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in July, says Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit. He sees several signs that the construction sector has strengthened this summer: New business volumes expanded at the strongest rate since May 2017, while workforce numbers increased to the greatest extent for just over two- and-a-half years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153House building was the bright spot for construction growth in July, alongside a stronger upturn in commercial development projects. Residential activity and commercial work both increased at the sharpest pace since December 2015, which contrasted with another subdued month for civil engineering. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector has recorded its fastest growth in 14 months. Data firm Markit reports that builders picked up pace in July, led by a surge in housebuilding. This pushed Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI, which measures growth in the sector, up to 55.8 from 53.1. Anything over 50 shows growth, and this is the highest reading since May 2017. Housebuilders reported the strongest pick-up in growth since the end of 2015. More to follow.... Stock markets around the globe are sliding today, thanks to the threat of a US-China trade war. Investors have been spooked by the news that the Trump administration is considering a 25% tariff on $200bn of Chinese imports - previously it had been planning a 10% levy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest shot in an increasingly bitter and protracted trade spat between Washington and Beijing. CNN explains: The United States has already slapped 25% tariffs on Chinese goods worth $34 billion to punish Beijing for what it says are its unfair trade practices, such as forcing American companies to hand over valuable technology. China immediately responded with equal measures. In the latest step, President Donald Trump has directed US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to consider increasing the proposed tariff level on fruit and vegetables, handbags, refrigerators, and more. The trade office has extended its previous deadline of Aug. 30 to allow the public more time to comment on the new plan. Those comments are now due on September 5. In London the FTSE 100 has shed 32 points, or 0.4%, to 7620, its lowest level in over two weeks. There are heavier falls across Europe, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX shedding 1.3%. Over in Asia, the Chinese markets have tumbled by around 2%. Other markets also in the red as traders fear an escalating trade dispute will hurt growth and exports across the region. Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale says the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision is the main event of the day: Bloomberg polled 58 forecasts...10 expect no change, and 48 expect a 25 basis point hike (including us). Sterling meanwhile, continues to bump along the bottom of its historic trade-weighted range. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t nearly enough good news in a much-anticipated rate hike to propel it higher, but the downside is limited. An interest rate rise today would be risky, argues our economics editor Larry Elliott. He points out that many UK households are struggling, meaning incomes are lagging spending for the first time in three decades. Households are not borrowing because they are brimful of confidence. In many cases they are borrowing to make ends meet. The MPC knows this and will go out if its way to reassure consumers and businesses that any further policy tightening will be both modest and gradual. Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise is supposed to prevent wage inflation from taking off, underpin sterling and boost the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credibility without harming growth. The next eight months will see Brexit negotiations come to a climax and the inevitable period of uncertainty means this is the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last opportunity to raise rates for some time. Yet the fact remains that this is an ill-timed and risky venture, not least for the millions overburdened with debt. The pound will tumble if the Bank of England leaves interest rates on hold today, says Miles Eakers of global payments, FX and Treasury management firm Centtrip: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A hawkish hike will boost the Pound but only for the short term. That said, Mark Carney may catch market participants off-guard again and not increase rates, which will weaken the Pound substantially and could fall as low as its yearly nadir of $1.2956 or even below. Even if the BoE does hike, the Brexit negotiations are still under way, keeping the Pound under pressure for the foreseeable future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound is dropping this morning, as the City braces for the Bank of England interest rate decision at noon. Sterling has lost half a cent against the US dollar to $1.3068, its lowest in nearly two weeks. Normally you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect a currency to rally when interest rates go up. But there may be some anxiety over whether the Bank will actually do the deed today. Traders may also be anticipating a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdovish hike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - the BoE could raise borrowing costs to 0.75%, but hint that the next rise is a long way away. This chart shows how sterling has struggled, even as an August rate hike looked more likely. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, suspects uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is hurting the pound: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThursday could be a hugely symbolic day if the Bank of England decides to raise interest rates above 0.5% for the first time since the financial crisis. However it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually change too much on the ground. Markets are already expecting a rise, and from here on in, further hikes are going to be few and far between because UK economic growth is so fragile. We could see some reaction from sterling though, which has remained resolutely weak against the dollar, despite rising expectations of a rate rise. That probably reflects the fact that economic data hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been resoundingly positive in the lead up to this interest rate decision, plus of course the prospect of a no-deal Brexit has raised its head in recent weeks. He also points out that rates could yet be cut, if the economy falters. Even though rates are very low and will remain so for the foreseeable future, they can still move down if there is an economic shock to the system. Few people thought rates would ever be cut from 0.5%, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exactly what happened following the EU referendum result. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With Love Island finally off our screens, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favourite unreliable boyfriend to show if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mended his ways, or is as fickle as ever. The Bank of England will announce today whether UK interest rates are going up, for only the second time in a decade. The City widely expects a hike, after governor Mark Carney declared last month that the economy seems to have recovered from its slowdown at the start of 2018. The City is pricing a 91% chance of an interest rate rise today. That would take borrowing costs up to 0.75% today -- their highest level since March 2009 (but still low in historic terms). But traders are edgy. Carney has a long track record of capriciousness \u00e2\u20ac\u201c promising that a rate hike is imminent only to back away when the big day arrives. So there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a possibility that the Bank will shy away from pressing that rate hike button today. The decision is unlikely to be unanimous, as some monetary policy committee members are concerned that the economy may not be strong enough to handle higher borrowing costs. Kathleen Brooks of Capital Index explains: The market is currently expecting an 8-1 split in favour of a hike, with Sir Jon Cunliffe the only member expected to dissent and vote against a hike. However, if we get more MPC members voting against a hike then sterling could come under pressure, as it would suggest a future dovish stance by the BOE. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s four years since Labour MP Pat McFadden gave Carney his \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tag, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a title the governor appreciates. He would argue that businesses and households have understood his message -- that interest rates will rise at a modest pace as the recovery allows. Also coming up Data firm Markit will report how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector performed last month. Economists predict that growth slowed, as the bounceback after the winter freeze fades. Trade war fears are weighing on the markets again. There are reports that Donald Trump is considering slapping a 25% tariff on Chinese imports into the US, which would have a hefty impact on world trade.

                "body":"<p>Wall Street investors are still hot for music technology \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least that was the message Sonos Inc broadcast this week after its stock SONO surged 33% above its IPO price in its market debut. </p> <p>Shrugging off lacklustre opening trading, the maker of popular, high-end wireless and voice recognition speakers, closed out the day at over $19 a share on Thursday, giving the 16-year-old Californian company an implied market value of $1.95bn .</p> <p>If it holds, Sonos flotation could end a curse that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been hanging over commodity technology since companies like <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/stocks/fit/\">Fitbit</a> and<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/investing/gopro-stock-sinks-losses-increase/\"> GoPro</a> surged at IPO and then crashed. What makes Sonos different, company executives argued last week, is that unlike, say, smartphones and headphones, their speakers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t locked into updating cycles. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are used to buying commodity tech that needs to be replaced, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re differentiated because our product persists,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mike Groeninger, Sonos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vice president of finance, told <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/news/market-watch/TDJNMW_20180802677/why-sonos-thinks-its-hardware-ipo-will-be-different.html\">Marketwatch.</a></p> <p>With Sonos, the argument goes, consumers perceive brand loyalty because the Sonos systems are of high quality and will simply add to existing systems when they move or add music-streaming to new areas of the homes. </p> <p>Sonos backs up that argument with data showing that said 27% of Sonos households own four or more products, and more than 61% of its households have registered more than one device.</p> <p>Where Sonos products need to be replaced, Groeninger continued, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because its hardware can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t support advances in streaming technology. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not forcing obsolescence,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he pointed out. </p> <p>But if that were all true, and Sonos was uniquely blessed with longterm customer loyalty, then stock analysts could reasonably expect Sonos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 first day numbers to come in more robustly. </p> <p>One potential problem is that Sonos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 greatest asset in partnering with streaming services Amazon, Apple, Google and Spotify is also its most glaring consumer tech weakness: those companies could decide to move into the hardware business. </p> <p>Jordan Hiscott, chief trader at Ayondo markets, commented that despite Sonos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 opening day performance his main concern is that Sonos will experience a negative share price performance similar to Fitbit.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fitbit is another well-run company with popular products, yet its future profitability can be heavily affected when tech conglomerates, like Apple or Google, decide to produce and manufacture similar, niche devices themselves, which consequently undermines market share.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vulnerability to Amazon, for instance, was revealed earlier this month when it was revealed in an SEC filing that the e-shopping giant could disable its Alexa voice recognition technology on Sonos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 speakers on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153limited notice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>In its filing, Sonos also acknowledged that not only could Amazon disable Alexa integration but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Amazon could also begin charging us for this integration which would harm our operating results\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the filing, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just been very upfront about the fact that we could turn off people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service, they could turn them off.

                "bodyText":"Wall Street investors are still hot for music technology \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least that was the message Sonos Inc broadcast this week after its stock SONO surged 33% above its IPO price in its market debut. Shrugging off lacklustre opening trading, the maker of popular, high-end wireless and voice recognition speakers, closed out the day at over $19 a share on Thursday, giving the 16-year-old Californian company an implied market value of $1.95bn . If it holds, Sonos flotation could end a curse that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been hanging over commodity technology since companies like Fitbit and GoPro surged at IPO and then crashed. What makes Sonos different, company executives argued last week, is that unlike, say, smartphones and headphones, their speakers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t locked into updating cycles. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are used to buying commodity tech that needs to be replaced, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re differentiated because our product persists,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mike Groeninger, Sonos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vice president of finance, told Marketwatch. With Sonos, the argument goes, consumers perceive brand loyalty because the Sonos systems are of high quality and will simply add to existing systems when they move or add music-streaming to new areas of the homes. Sonos backs up that argument with data showing that said 27% of Sonos households own four or more products, and more than 61% of its households have registered more than one device. Where Sonos products need to be replaced, Groeninger continued, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because its hardware can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t support advances in streaming technology. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not forcing obsolescence,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he pointed out. But if that were all true, and Sonos was uniquely blessed with longterm customer loyalty, then stock analysts could reasonably expect Sonos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 first day numbers to come in more robustly. One potential problem is that Sonos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 greatest asset in partnering with streaming services Amazon, Apple, Google and Spotify is also its most glaring consumer tech weakness: those companies could decide to move into the hardware business. Jordan Hiscott, chief trader at Ayondo markets, commented that despite Sonos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 opening day performance his main concern is that Sonos will experience a negative share price performance similar to Fitbit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fitbit is another well-run company with popular products, yet its future profitability can be heavily affected when tech conglomerates, like Apple or Google, decide to produce and manufacture similar, niche devices themselves, which consequently undermines market share.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vulnerability to Amazon, for instance, was revealed earlier this month when it was revealed in an SEC filing that the e-shopping giant could disable its Alexa voice recognition technology on Sonos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 speakers on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153limited notice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In its filing, Sonos also acknowledged that not only could Amazon disable Alexa integration but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Amazon could also begin charging us for this integration which would harm our operating results\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the filing, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just been very upfront about the fact that we could turn off people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service, they could turn them off. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re transparent by nature, so that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in there,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sonos CEO Patrick Spence told CNBC on Thursday. Morgan Stanley recently estimated that more than 70% of US households will own a smart speaker with voice commerce capabilities by 2022 and half of all web searches will be voice activated. The category will become so important to the data tech giants, the report recommended, that Google should give away a free Home Mini smart speaker to every US household. The $3.3bn this would cost Google parent Alphabet to execute would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153small price to pay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the opportunity, it added, since the potential to make money off the trend will likely go to Amazon and Google because of their dominance in their voice recognition technologies and smart speaker technology. For Sonos, then, perhaps the best policy would be to remain on good terms. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales have been increasing, albeit modestly from a loyal customer base that drove sales to nearly $1bn last year.

                "body":"<p>It has been a tumultuous couple of weeks for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high-flying technology stocks, even by their own unique standards. Their shares have been soaring since the start of the year, despite being buffeted by trade war fears as President Trump talked of limiting Chinese investments in the US and restricting American technology imports to China.</p> <p>But now there are signs that cracks may be starting to appear in some of the biggest firms in the sector. Facebook suffered the biggest ever one-day drop in a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c losing more than \u00c2\u00a390bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after its growth slowed in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p> <p>Twitter lost 20%, or $5bn, as it reported a surprise fall in active monthly users, while streaming service Netflix missed its targets for subscriber numbers.</p> <p>On the other hand, electric car specialist Tesla managed to head in the right direction despite making a $717m second-quarter loss, as its controversial chief executive, Elon Musk, regained investor confidence after apologising for previous outbursts. That was in marked contrast to a conference call for the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous set of figures, when he accused a Wall Street analyst of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boring bonehead questions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and ignored queries from investors.</p> <p>But the pick of the bunch remains Apple, which beat Amazon and Google to reach the landmark $1 trillion valuation on Thursday.</p> <p>Despite the recent rollercoaster ride, the five key tech stocks, known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Faangs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet-owned Google \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have reached breathtaking heights. The total value of the five companies amounts to a staggering 19% of total US GDP. But their surge in value has prompted fears of a re-run of the dotcom boom of the late 1990s, when technology businesses dominated the stock market before coming crashing to earth.</p> <p>Russ Mould at investment group AJ Bell says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That [19%] compares to the 15.5% of US GDP reached by the five biggest companies by value at the US stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peak in the fourth quarter of 1999, just before the technology, media and telecoms bubble burst and that particular mania came to grief.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Here we look at where the big names stand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and where they could go from here.</p> <h2>Facebook</h2> <p>The social network\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market value <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/29/facebook-results-running-out-new-users-goodwill\">plunged by more than \u00c2\u00a390bn</a> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the largest one-day drop in corporate history \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it felt the effect of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\">Cambridge Analytica data scandal</a>. The group made more than $5bn (\u00c2\u00a33.8bn) profit in the last three months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slightly ahead of expectations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but some 3 million Europeans quit the website amid concerns about what Facebook does with personal data. Finance chief David Wehner warned revenue growth was likely to slow, while costs soared by 50% to $7.4bn as the company spent vast sums on improving data security.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-3902HEHbgs63337q/\" data-alt=\"Facebook shares\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-3902HEHbgs63337q/\">Facebook shares</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Verdict </strong>For all the bluster around the largest one-day fall in history, the reasons behind it make the case for a founder-leader with absolute control better than anything else Mark Zuckerberg has done in the past decade. Facebook, shaken by Cambridge Analytica and the election interference scandal, decided to slash its profits in half in order to fund a response: 50,000 new moderators, a substantial investment into its trust and safety engineering, and a commitment to carry on doing the same for at least another year. Wall Street, predictably, hated it, but it was the right thing to do. A weaker leader could have been toppled for doing it, or might never have tried in the first place. Yes, Zuckerberg led the company into this swamp, but maybe he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the only one who can get it back out.</p> <p>However, there are storm clouds on the horizon as well. In the future, look out for the shift from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feeds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to self-deleting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stories\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which could be as momentous as its shift from desktop to mobile. Facebook believes it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be that long before the majority of content across its four platforms is shared as stories, the format it cloned from Snapchat two years ago, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling to achieve advertiser buy-in.</p> <h2>Alphabet</h2> <p>Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company smashed Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit expectations, sending its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/23/google-alphabet-profits-5bn-fine-shares-surge\">shares soaring to a record high</a>. Net profit was actually lower than last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down from $4.9bn to $3.5bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but that included a $2.7bn fine levied on Google by the European commission for anti-competitive behaviour. The company is set to appeal, so could still get its money back. The business raked in more than $26bn of revenue in the three-month period \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well up on the $21bn recorded in the same period last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-39023vu72D1VPfPJ/\" data-alt=\"Alphabet shares\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-39023vu72D1VPfPJ/\">Alphabet shares</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Verdict </strong>Even though the general tech sell-off hit Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, and profits fell year-on-year, the future looks fairly bright for Alphabet. Yes, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine over Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Android monopoly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good for the company, and it was large enough to hit profits directly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for the $2.7bn penalty, Alphabet would have actually seen profits grow this quarter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the most significant wrongs that Google was accused of are largely in the past, and it is unlikely to feel too constrained going forward.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the search business prints money. Almost every open-ended query on the web starts at Google, and that makes its advertising revenues enormous and secure. YouTube could be a shining gem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and certainly seems to be if you speak to anyone under 20, for whom it, not Netflix, is the new TV \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it will have problems down the line over the same dodgy content now causing such pain for Facebook.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"931af6ffd10fe477756d17cf40862818ea649179\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/931af6ffd10fe477756d17cf40862818ea649179/0_141_4644_2787/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon Web Services inflatable display at a trade fair\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cloud computing division has seen extraordinary growth in profits.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mauritz Antin/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Amazon</h2> <p>The globe-spanning online retailer announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/26/amazon-profit-second-quarter-2018-advertising-cloud\">record quarterly profits of $2.5bn</a> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c double the level Wall Street experts had expected \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sending the share price to an all-time high.

Well, Amazon is the AWS (Amazon Web Services) company now. The record profits of the cloud-computing division led to an astonishing 1,286% year-on-year growth in overall profits, thanks to the extremely high margins that Amazon makes on selling computing time. It now stretches from its own consumer retail business to the Marketplace platform \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building a shopping mall of internet stores \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to AWS, which provides the backbone to the internet. And don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget its bets on the future, particularly with Echo and Alexa. Voice control may yet prove to be a dead-end in the annals of computing, but if not, Amazon could well own the iPhone of the 2020s.</p> <h2>Apple</h2> <p>Apple made history on Thursday, becoming the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">first public company to be valued at $1 trillion</a>, reaching the landmark 42 years after the company was founded and two decades after it almost went bust. Financial results for the most recent three months, filed earlier in the week, showed revenues topped $53bn. The company shipped more than 41m phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slightly less than anticipated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but because the expensive iPhone X has proved popular, the average price consumers paid for them went up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-3902KmLt1o6pmxWJ/\" data-alt=\"Apple shares\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/archive-zip/giv-3902KmLt1o6pmxWJ/\">Apple shares</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Verdict</strong> Making nice things and selling them for a lot of money to tens of millions of people is a very good business to be in. The engine of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business, the iPhone, generated 60% of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits, and it shows no sign of letting up.</p> <p>The iPhone X has been a resounding success, proving the hypothesis that millions of people will pay whatever Apple asks for the best phone on the planet. The average selling price of an iPhone is now more than $700. More promisingly still, that has held up in the second quarter, usually the time when sales fall off as savvy customers hold on for the inevitable upgrade in September.</p> <p>But while the iPhone provides the reliable profit, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the growth opportunity. That lies in the two lines at the bottom of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153services\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153other products\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Services \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which include the App Store, Apple Pay and income from Apple Music \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have been growing rapidly since the company stopped viewing them just as a tool for boosting phone sales and started seeing them as a business. Apple invented the idea of the App Store and is taking a 30% cut on everything in it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32d8f9963390ea58bbfb94ee79ad4680315df206\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32d8f9963390ea58bbfb94ee79ad4680315df206/0_46_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elon Musk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elon Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent outbursts have worried investors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gene Blevins/ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Tesla</h2> <p>Tesla has had a difficult few months, with increasing concerns about the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sustainability and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/18/elon-musk-apologises-for-calling-thai-cave-rescue-diver-a-pedo\">outbursts from its billionaire founder Elon Musk</a> that have seen him labelled the Trump of Tech.

                "bodyText":"It has been a tumultuous couple of weeks for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high-flying technology stocks, even by their own unique standards. Their shares have been soaring since the start of the year, despite being buffeted by trade war fears as President Trump talked of limiting Chinese investments in the US and restricting American technology imports to China. But now there are signs that cracks may be starting to appear in some of the biggest firms in the sector. Facebook suffered the biggest ever one-day drop in a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c losing more than \u00c2\u00a390bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after its growth slowed in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Twitter lost 20%, or $5bn, as it reported a surprise fall in active monthly users, while streaming service Netflix missed its targets for subscriber numbers. On the other hand, electric car specialist Tesla managed to head in the right direction despite making a $717m second-quarter loss, as its controversial chief executive, Elon Musk, regained investor confidence after apologising for previous outbursts. That was in marked contrast to a conference call for the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous set of figures, when he accused a Wall Street analyst of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boring bonehead questions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and ignored queries from investors. But the pick of the bunch remains Apple, which beat Amazon and Google to reach the landmark $1 trillion valuation on Thursday. Despite the recent rollercoaster ride, the five key tech stocks, known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Faangs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet-owned Google \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have reached breathtaking heights. The total value of the five companies amounts to a staggering 19% of total US GDP. But their surge in value has prompted fears of a re-run of the dotcom boom of the late 1990s, when technology businesses dominated the stock market before coming crashing to earth. Russ Mould at investment group AJ Bell says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That [19%] compares to the 15.5% of US GDP reached by the five biggest companies by value at the US stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peak in the fourth quarter of 1999, just before the technology, media and telecoms bubble burst and that particular mania came to grief.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here we look at where the big names stand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and where they could go from here. Facebook The social network\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market value plunged by more than \u00c2\u00a390bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the largest one-day drop in corporate history \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it felt the effect of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. The group made more than $5bn (\u00c2\u00a33.8bn) profit in the last three months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slightly ahead of expectations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but some 3 million Europeans quit the website amid concerns about what Facebook does with personal data. Finance chief David Wehner warned revenue growth was likely to slow, while costs soared by 50% to $7.4bn as the company spent vast sums on improving data security. Verdict For all the bluster around the largest one-day fall in history, the reasons behind it make the case for a founder-leader with absolute control better than anything else Mark Zuckerberg has done in the past decade. Facebook, shaken by Cambridge Analytica and the election interference scandal, decided to slash its profits in half in order to fund a response: 50,000 new moderators, a substantial investment into its trust and safety engineering, and a commitment to carry on doing the same for at least another year. Wall Street, predictably, hated it, but it was the right thing to do. A weaker leader could have been toppled for doing it, or might never have tried in the first place. Yes, Zuckerberg led the company into this swamp, but maybe he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the only one who can get it back out. However, there are storm clouds on the horizon as well. In the future, look out for the shift from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feeds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to self-deleting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stories\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which could be as momentous as its shift from desktop to mobile. Facebook believes it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be that long before the majority of content across its four platforms is shared as stories, the format it cloned from Snapchat two years ago, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling to achieve advertiser buy-in. Alphabet Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company smashed Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit expectations, sending its shares soaring to a record high. Net profit was actually lower than last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down from $4.9bn to $3.5bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but that included a $2.7bn fine levied on Google by the European commission for anti-competitive behaviour. The company is set to appeal, so could still get its money back. The business raked in more than $26bn of revenue in the three-month period \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well up on the $21bn recorded in the same period last year. Verdict Even though the general tech sell-off hit Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, and profits fell year-on-year, the future looks fairly bright for Alphabet. Yes, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine over Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Android monopoly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good for the company, and it was large enough to hit profits directly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for the $2.7bn penalty, Alphabet would have actually seen profits grow this quarter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the most significant wrongs that Google was accused of are largely in the past, and it is unlikely to feel too constrained going forward. Meanwhile, the search business prints money. Almost every open-ended query on the web starts at Google, and that makes its advertising revenues enormous and secure. YouTube could be a shining gem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and certainly seems to be if you speak to anyone under 20, for whom it, not Netflix, is the new TV \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it will have problems down the line over the same dodgy content now causing such pain for Facebook. Amazon The globe-spanning online retailer announced record quarterly profits of $2.5bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c double the level Wall Street experts had expected \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sending the share price to an all-time high. Advertising and cloud computing were the big growth areas. Verdict Remember when it just sold books? Well, Amazon is the AWS (Amazon Web Services) company now. The record profits of the cloud-computing division led to an astonishing 1,286% year-on-year growth in overall profits, thanks to the extremely high margins that Amazon makes on selling computing time. It now stretches from its own consumer retail business to the Marketplace platform \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building a shopping mall of internet stores \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to AWS, which provides the backbone to the internet. And don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget its bets on the future, particularly with Echo and Alexa. Voice control may yet prove to be a dead-end in the annals of computing, but if not, Amazon could well own the iPhone of the 2020s. Apple Apple made history on Thursday, becoming the first public company to be valued at $1 trillion, reaching the landmark 42 years after the company was founded and two decades after it almost went bust. Financial results for the most recent three months, filed earlier in the week, showed revenues topped $53bn. The company shipped more than 41m phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slightly less than anticipated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but because the expensive iPhone X has proved popular, the average price consumers paid for them went up. Verdict Making nice things and selling them for a lot of money to tens of millions of people is a very good business to be in. The engine of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business, the iPhone, generated 60% of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits, and it shows no sign of letting up. The iPhone X has been a resounding success, proving the hypothesis that millions of people will pay whatever Apple asks for the best phone on the planet. The average selling price of an iPhone is now more than $700. More promisingly still, that has held up in the second quarter, usually the time when sales fall off as savvy customers hold on for the inevitable upgrade in September. But while the iPhone provides the reliable profit, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the growth opportunity. That lies in the two lines at the bottom of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153services\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153other products\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Services \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which include the App Store, Apple Pay and income from Apple Music \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have been growing rapidly since the company stopped viewing them just as a tool for boosting phone sales and started seeing them as a business. Apple invented the idea of the App Store and is taking a 30% cut on everything in it. Tesla Tesla has had a difficult few months, with increasing concerns about the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sustainability and outbursts from its billionaire founder Elon Musk that have seen him labelled the Trump of Tech. On Wednesday the electric-car maker reported a record $717m loss for the last three months, but the shares climbed because revenue hit $4bn and Musk promised profitability later this year. He said there had been a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mind-blowing leap forward\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the number of cars rolling off the lines. Verdict Elon Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s responsible-boss routine on Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings call appeared to restore investor confidence following his disastrous performance three months ago, when he rejected \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boring bonehead questions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from Wall Street analysts concerned about Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fundamentals. But whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a responsible boss or an unpredictable tech genius, Musk still has an uphill struggle on his hands, turning Tesla from a niche maker of expensive cars for the Silicon Valley set into a mass-market manufacturer of electric cars that can compete on equal terms with the likes of BMW and Nissan. Tesla is finally producing its self-imposed quota of 5,000 of its mass-market Model 3s a week, but to do so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had to shift production to an external \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and take a record $700m loss for the quarter. And simply matching its legacy competitors on one mass-market vehicle isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to justify its sky-high valuation (Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock-market value is roughly the same as BMW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to deliver on at least one of its moonshots: self-driving cars, a radically redesigned charging infrastructure, or the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first commercially feasible electric truck. Twitter Twitter lost more than a fifth of its value in two days, despite reporting a record profit, because investors were worried about hugely disappointing forecasts for user numbers. It lost 1 million users in the last three months and predicted a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mid-single-digit millions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd decline in the next three-month period. The social media service reported net income of $100m during the second quarter, but tech companies need to show they can deliver uninterrupted growth to impress Wall Street. Verdict In 2016, Twitter moved its app from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153social networking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd section of the App Store to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd section.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap. The trade dispute between the US and China has escalated further, as neither side shows any appetite for backing down. The Chinese government unveiled tariffs on $16bn of American goods today. Medical equipment, fuels, fish meal, wood waste, paper and paper waste, metal scraps, cars and bicycles are all on list of products targeted. Beijing was retaliating against Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to slap tariffs on an extra $16bn of Chinese goods overnight. These latest tit-for-tat moves mean there are levies on $50bn of goods moving each way between the two countries. So far, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy seems to be holding up under the strain. Trade figures released overnight showed that exports rose by 12.2% year-on-year in July, while exports jumped by over 27%. The decision to allow the yuan to fall against the US dollar may be supporting manufacturers, analysts say. But if the situation escalates, the global economy could be badly hurt. With the two sides deadlocked, a ship full of soybeans has been anchored off China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coast for a month - as its owners ponder whether to swallow the tariffs. Fears of a hard Brexit have hurt the pound again. Sterling fell to an 11-month low against the US dollar, at $1.2854. Against the euro, it dropped to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1091, a nine-month low. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, explains why traders are worried: he possibility of a no-deal Brexit has been looming over the pound for a while now but it seems to have asserted itself in traders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds even more this week since Bank of England governor Mark Carney said that the likelihood was now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncomfortably high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a sentiment later echoed by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade secretary Liam Fox. Elsewhere in the markets, Tesla board members have confirmed they are evaluating whether to take the electric car market private. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still some cynicism, though, as to whether Elon Musk will actually pull the idea off. And the oil price has slipped, due to trade war worries and a smaller-than-expected drop in US crude inventories. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. GW It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a month since the US and China imposed their first wave of tariffs, in early July. And ever since, a cargo ship full of soybeans has been waiting at anchor off the port of Dalian. Having failed to reach China before the deadline, the vessel is in limbo while its owners decide what to do. If they unload the beans now, they (or the buyer) would incur hefty tariffs. My colleague Rob Davies has been looking into the issue, and explains: A shipment of soybeans worth more than $20m (\u00c2\u00a315.5m) has been bobbing aimlessly in the Pacific Ocean for a month, a casualty of the escalating trade war between China and the US. Lingering uncertainty over the cargo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fate offered a timely reminder of the fallout from a dispute that intensified on Wednesday, as the US president, Donald Trump, unveiled a second round of tariffs on $16bn of Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to respond in kind. The Peak Pegasus, a 229 metre bulk carrier weighing 43,000 tonnes, has become the reluctant symbol of the potential consequences of this tit-for-tat trade spat. The ship, owned by JP Morgan Asset Management, was scheduled to unload about 70,000 tonnes of American soybeans in the Chinese port of Dalian on 6 July, shortly after Trump imposed a first round of tariffs on $34bn-worth of goods. As it rushed to shore in the hope of clearing customs before Beijing imposed retaliatory tariffs, the ship \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and its protein-rich cargo \u00e2\u20ac\u201c became an unlikely internet sensation on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. However, the vessel arrived just too late and has been sailing around in circles ever since while the cargo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owners, understood to be the agricultural commodity trading house Louis Dreyfus, decide what to do.... More here: The US-China trade row is also being blamed for falling oil prices today. Brent crude has tumbled by 3.5% today to $71.99 per barrel, while US crude is down 3.8% at $66.60. Economists are citing the risks to global growth posed by tariffs Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy in London, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US-China trade war is set to worsen, and its impact on oil prices will be gradual as the situation develops. Crude oil and refined products affected by additional duties will reduce their competitiveness in the Chinese market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The latest oil inventory figures from America have also hit the oil price. Crude inventories fell by 1.4 million barrels in the latest week, less than half the 3.3 million barrel draw analysts had expected. Trade wars can have many casualties. And the dispute between America and China is threatening the future of a paper mill in the state of Arkansas. Associated Press has the details: A Chinese company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement two years ago that it would spend more than $1 billion and hire hundreds of workers for a paper mill on the outskirts of this rural college town was seen as a much-needed shot in the arm for the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. A web video promoting Arkadelphia \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great place to call home!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd continues to tout the Sun Paper project and its potential to generate jobs and boost development. But optimism has been giving way to concern in recent months amid President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s escalating trade dispute with China. The threat of a full-blown trade war has delayed the project further and prompted the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governor to send his top economic development official to China to make sure it stays on track. It also has caused other Chinese companies considering investing in Arkansas to put their plans on hold. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like a dark cloud hanging over the future of the project,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stephen Bell, the president and chief executive officer of the Arkadelphia Area Chamber of Commerce. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Right now, the clouds are off on the horizon. But I think no one knows where the trade situation is going right now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... More here. By announcing new tariffs today, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is sticking firmly to its tit-for-tat policy on trade, says Art Hogan, chief market strategist at investment bank B. Riley. That means that the trade war is likely to escalate, Hogan warns (via CNN): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our $16 billion comes at a scheduled time, which comes up on the 23rd. China said we see your $16 billion and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll match your $16 billion.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pretty much match what we do until they have no more levers to pull. The bad news is the trade war fears in China are escalating. The major concern right now in trade is China. In case you missed this earlier, we learned overnight that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imports and exports both rose in July. Exports jumped by over 12% year on year, indicating that the trade war hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t caused serious damage yet. These photos from Lianyungang Port, in the Jiangsu Province of China, show that plenty of vehicle were lined up for shipment today: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest wave of tariffs haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spooked the US stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 24 points, or just 0.1%, while the broader S&amp;P 500 index is flat. David Madden of CMC Markets explains why traders aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panicking: Markets had a muted reaction to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement that it plans to impose tariffs on $16 billion worth of US goods, starting on 23 August. The token retaliation from Beijing keeps the trade spat alive, and it seems like China were doing it to send a message, rather than to inflict financial pain on the US. So far, China has managed a tit-for-tat response to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade tariffs -- including today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation to US plans for tariffs on $16bn of Chinese goods. But Beijing can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t respond in kind if Donald Trump implements his threat for 25% tariffs on an extra $200bn of goods, simply because China doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buy enough from America. Oliver Jones of Capital Economics thinks Beijing might change course, and target individual US companies. He writes: While China has so far responded to US tariffs primarily with duties of its own, it is reaching the limit of its ability to respond in this way. There are already signs that China is starting to target US multinationals operating there directly instead. We think that its response will increasingly take this form if the US imposes tariffs beyond those already in the pipeline. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 take on the US-China tariffs row: China is slapping additional import tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion worth of U.S. goods ranging from oil and steel products to autos and medical equipment, the commerce ministry said, as the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies escalate their trade dispute. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a very unreasonable practice,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the commerce ministry said on its website http://www.mofcom.gov.cn, responding to the United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision to slap 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion of Chinese goods on Aug 23. The slump in sterling today has given the London stock exchange a boost. The FTSE 100 has gained 43 points, or 0.5%, to 7761 points. With the pound lower, multinational\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overseas earnings are worth more in sterling terms (updated). Basically the Footsie is acting as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcup\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 side of the see-saw, as the pound drops - currently down 0.5% against the US dollar to around $1.287. Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have dipped in early trading, down $2.5 at around $377. Wall Street may not be convinced that the company is definitely being taken private, following that announcement from the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board. After all, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taking the appropriate next steps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is rater more guarded than Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bold claim that he has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153funding secured\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to take Tesla off the stock market at $420 per share. Newsflash: Electric car maker Tesla has issued a statement, in response to founder Elon Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments yesterday about taking the company off the stock market. Tesla says that Musk \u00e2\u20ac\u0153opened discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd last week with the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board about taking it private, to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better serve\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd its long-term interests. The board have met several times since, and are now evaluating the idea. Yesterday, Musk insisted that he had secured the funding to take Tesla private - even though it would be the biggest buyout ever. Leaving the stock market would take some pressure off Tesla, as it battles to hit its production targets... However, some financial analysts are sceptical that the plan would really work: American scrap metal and waste paper will also incur 25% tariffs at the Chinese border in two weeks. So, apparently, will US \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fish meal for feed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (which I think is used to nourish farmed fish, poultry and pork). China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new retaliatory tariffs will apply to 333 US products. Coal, diesel, cars and bicycles, medical equipment and steel products are all on the list, the Chinese commerce department says. Newsflash: China has announced it will impose retaliatory 25% tariffs on $16bn of US goods. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commerce ministry says it has been forced to retaliate to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very unreasonable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd levies on $16bn of Chinese exports (announced last night). China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measures will kick-in on August 23, the same day as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest levies, as it sticks to its policy of respond in kind to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade moves. So in two weeks, the two countries will be imposing tariffs on $50bn of each others goods. American officials are already working on plans for tariffs on another $200bn of Chinese products in September. Reuters reports that City traders are taking steps to protect themselves against sterling falling further: Nine-month and one-year sterling/dollar risk-reversals fell on Wednesday to the lowest since early-March 2017, as investors rushed to protect themselves from further weakness in the British currency. Risk reversals are a gauge of investor expectations for a currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s direction and are used to hedge against expected moves. The fall in sterling risk reversals indicates greater demand for put options, derivatives that give investors the right to sell an asset. This is from Miles Eakers of foreign exchange firm Centtrip: Sterling is being hit by fears of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno-deal Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, says Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM. Sterling was pounded by the Dollar and most of its major counterparts on Wednesday as fears heightened over the UK exiting the European Union without a trade deal in place. Concerns of a potential hard Brexit scenario have haunted investor attraction towards the Pound and have left the currency vulnerable to downside shocks. The selloff is gathering pace. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest damage: Pound vs US dollar: $1.286, an 11-month low Pound vs euro: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.109, a nine-month low Economics lecturer Daniel McLaughlin says the slide in the pound is bad news for UK consumers: [It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that a weaker currency makes exports more competitive, but it also makes imported raw materials pricier - so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not an undiluted win] Newsflash: The euro has risen over 90p against the pound for the first time since last autumn. Jordan Rochester of Japanese bank Nomura predicts the pound will keep falling ahead of the next crunch EU summit in October - when Theresa May will try to persuade leaders to back her \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcChequers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 deal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We remain bearish on the pound in the short term until the Brexit mess is out the way and look for the currency to enter a $1.27-1.28 range before the leaders summit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ouch! The pound just fell through $1.29 for the first time since August 2017. UK holidaymakers heading to Europe this summer just suffered a blow. The pound has weakened against the euro to its lowest level since last November, meaning trips across the channel have become a little more expensive. Sterling fell as low as \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1129, down 0.25% today. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all! Sterling has dropped to a new 11-month low against the US dollar, at $1.2909, and is also weaker against the yen and the Swiss franc. The pound has been under pressure this week, after trade secretary Liam Fox claimed that Britain was likely to leave the EU without a deal. Such a hard-Brexit could lead to chaos at the borders, and leave companies struggling to keep their supply chains running Christophe Barraud, an economist at Market Securities brokerage in Paris, has told Reuters that firms are trying to protect themselves from a sterling crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of companies can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait for the negotiations outcome in October so a lot of course are trying to hedge against a drop in the pound.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ANZ senior China economist Betty Wang agrees that Chinese factories have benefitted from the weaker yuan - even if Beijing hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been fighting a currency war. She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Currency devaluation, which may have helped exports to some extent, has been largely market-driven in our view and is not a preferred policy tool by Chinese policy makers as part of the retaliation measures.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Figures released earlier this week showed that Beijing hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been burning through its foreign exchange reserves, suggesting it has been allowing the yuan to drop rather than fighting it: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market suffered losses today, after America finalised its plans for tariffs on another $16bn of exports. The Shanghai composite index fell by 1.2%, as traders worried that the trade war keeps ratcheting up. Washington might be disappointed to see that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imports and exports actually rose in July, says Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: If the US was hoping that its $34bn opening salvo of tariffs would have an effect on Chinese exports this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s China trade numbers would have been a disappointment to them. Chinese exports for July saw a rise of 12.2% up from 11.2% in June, supporting the premise that for the moment we seem to be in a bit of a phoney war. We also saw a big rise in imports of 27.3% showing that domestic demand remains quite strong. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus with America remained close to a record high in July, despite the trade dispute. Reuters explains: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closely watched surplus with the United States dipped only slightly to $28.09 billion last month from a record $28.97 billion in June. Washington has long criticised China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus with the United States and has demanded Beijing cut it. Still, disagreements between the two major economic powers run deeper than just the trade balance and tensions remain over market access, intellectual property, technology transfer and investment. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. America has fired another shot in the deepening trade dispute with China. Overnight, Washington said it would impose a 25% tariff on $16bn of Chinese imports, taking the total amount being targeted to $50bn. The new levy will come into force on August 23rd, and will apply to 279 product types. It mostly affects industrial products, such as machinery, chemicals and semiconductors. Motorcycles and railway cars also feature. Announcing the move, the US trade representative declared that America was penalising China for stealing its intellectual property, saying: China directs and unfairly facilitates the systematic investment in, and acquisition of, U.S. companies and assets to generate large-scale technology transfer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. China is likely to retaliate soon, escalating the dispute that has been rumbling for weeks. But... China may not be suffering from the trade war yet. Data released this morning shows that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exports jumped 12.2% year-on-year in July, beating expectations. Imports surged by a sparkling 27.3% - meaning China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus shrank during the month to $28bn (from over $41bn in June). This is significant, as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first wave of tariffs (on $34bn of Chinese goods) began in early July. Those tariffs have been blamed for a drop in German factory orders, but today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures suggest China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is holding firm. Of course, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still early days. Global trade, like the massive container ships it relies on, changes course slowly. Plus, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers may be benefitting from the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker currency, given the yuan has fallen pretty steadily recently to a 13-month low. Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist for Capital Economics, explains: Adjusting for seasonality and price effects, we estimate that export volumes were essentially flat in July. Shipments to the US did weaken slightly, which suggests the tariffs had some impact. But this was offset by stronger exports to the rest of the world, most likely buoyed by the weaker renminbi. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets agrees that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade data is encouraging, especially in the current climate. China trade data showed stronger growth in both exports and imports, notably the latter, suggesting strong consumption both domestically and internationally. But Also coming up today... Wall Street will be watching for Elon Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next move, after the inventor/entrepreneur surprisingly announced he plans to take Tesla private. Shares in the electric carmaker surged last night, burning sceptical investors who had bet against the company. Going private would take some pressure off Tesla to meet financial targets (and prevent Musk having another row with the analyst community) However, shares aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t at the $420 level which Musk pitched his somewhat vague offer at (which has sparked grumbling about market manipulation), so Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future remains uncertain. Oil is calm this morning, having risen yesterday after the US issued new sanctions on Iran. Later today we get the latest American oil inventory figures, which may show a drop in stocks.

Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour:</p> <h2>What are the implications for the global economy?</h2> <p>The direct impact of what looks like an inevitable recession in Turkey would be relatively small because, despite a population of 80 million and strong growth in recent years, the country accounts for only 1% of global GDP. Eurozone countries run a trade surplus with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a> but it is small. In the two previous Turkish financial crises since the turn of the millennium, European exporters have been able to divert their business to other markets. The European Central Bank has expressed concern about potential contagion through the eurozone banking system, with Spain, followed by Italy, the most heavily exposed countries.<br></p> <p>A bigger danger is that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crisis will spill over into other emerging market economies and there were signs on Monday that other countries seen as vulnerable were coming under speculative attack. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems are particularly acute because it has more than $300bn of dollar-denominated corporate debt, which is getting more expensive to finance by the day. However, other countries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as Mexico and South Africa - also took advantage of low US interest rates in the years after the financial crisis to borrow heavily in dollars and saw their currencies coming under pressure. The fear is of a full-blown emerging market crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/13/how-serious-is-turkeys-lira-crisis-and-what-are-the-implications\">How serious is Turkey's lira crisis and what are the implications?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b71adabe4b0cc3a88371818\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-13T16:16:06.993Z\">5.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The lira is weakening in late trading, and is threatening to plunge back the 7 lira-to-the-US dollar mark to a new all-time low.</strong></p> <p>Andy Birch, principal economist at IHS Markit, fears the lira will keep tumbling until Turkey raises interest rates:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The changes to reserve requirements in recent days and the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unspecified action plan has done little to stabilize the lira.

                "bodyText":"This liveblog is now closed, but you can catch-up with all the latest developments here: And finally, the Turkish crisis makes the front page of Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Guardian: The Times is reporting that UK holidaymakers are taking advantage of the fact they can now get eight lira to the pound: President Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defiant speech makes the front page of the Independent, and the Financial Times: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll back on Tuesday morning, UK time, with the latest market action. Stay tuned to the Guardian website in the meantime, for any breaking developments. Goodnight! GW Over in Asia, the markets are cranking back into action for Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session. And so far, the lira looks quite orderly - trading just below 7 lira to the US dollar, as in Europe earlier. The US stock market has close down lower tonight, as the Turkey crisis weighted on sentiment. The Dow shed 125 points, or 0.5%, to finish at 25,187. The wider S&amp;P 500 lost 0.4%. Energy companies led the sell off, dropping by 1.2%. Banks and miners lost 1%, reflecting worries that the lira crisis could create financial turmoil and dent economic demand. After a busy day, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the Turkish crisis: A fresh plunge in the Turkish lira sent tremors through global currency markets on Monday, amid fears that the failure of Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government to tackle its worsening financial crisis would have a domino effect on other vulnerable countries. The Argentine peso and the South African rand were the biggest knock-on casualties of a day of turbulence that saw the lira fall 8% against the dollar and Erdogan lash out at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic terrorists on social media\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as he accused Donald Trump of stabbing Turkey in the back. But the Turkish president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insistence that his country would survive an economic siege failed to reassure financial markets alarmed at the possible collapse of the strategically-vital emerging market country. Concerns that the 45% drop in the value of the lira this year would prove ruinous for companies that had borrowed heavily in foreign currencies prompted the renewed sell off of the lira and pushed up the cost of servicing Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit. Erdogan insisted that the Turkish economy was fundamentally sound and attacked the US president for imposing sanctions and doubling tariffs on Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel and aluminium imports last week over the house arrest of an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, on disputed terrorism charges. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are together in NATO and then you stab your strategic partner in the back,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Erdogan said as he came under pressure from the markets to respond to the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall and an inflation rate of more than 15%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: My colleague Martin Chulov has discovered that the lira crisis has been fuelled by a misunderstanding between the leaders of the US and Turkey. He writes: The currency plunge imperilling Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has been fuelled by a standoff between Donald Trump and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an over the fate of a Turkish woman detained in Israel whose freedom the US president brokered, and an American pastor held in Turkey whose release he demands in return, officials in Ankara claim. Those officials say that Trump may have \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmisinterpreted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 a discussion with Erdo\u00c4\u0178an over the pair - Turkish woman Ebru \u00c3\u2013zkan, jailed for alleged links to Hamas (but released last month), and Andrew Brunson, a preacher from North Carolina. It appears that Trump thought he had reached a deal for Brunson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s release, while Erdo\u00c4\u0178an believed he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d agreed to transfer the pastor to house arrest (as happened in July). Martin explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It took place on the margins of the Nato summit,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the source told the Guardian. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Erdo\u00c4\u0178an asked Trump for help with the lady in prison in Israel. There was only the two of them and a translator. Trump said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI need some traction on the pastor first\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. When Erdo\u00c4\u0178an said OK he meant that we are working on it. Then [US vice-president Mike] Pence, due to midterm election considerations, messed things up. Trump confused a process for an agreement.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That might explains why the White House has taken such a tough line on Turkey this week, imposing new sanction and starting the process to double tariffs on steel and aluminium. One late newsflash: Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has raised its benchmark interest rate to a blistering 45% (!), from 40%. As explained earlier, the peso hit a record low as the Turkish crisis rocked emerging market currencies (and as a political scandal continued to shake confidence). This rate hike is aimed at preventing the peso plunging even further, and suggest Buenos Aires is concerned that the markets could become more volatile in the days ahead. Time for a recap The currency crisis gripping Turkey has deepened today, sending ripples through the financial world and hurting emerging market countries across the globe. Fears over Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial position sent its currency spiralling to a fresh record low, hitting 7.2 lira to the US dollar. The lira has now lost a third of its value in the last week, as the crisis has escalated alarmingly. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market also had a rough day, with bank shares tumbling by over 10%. Economists fear that Turkish companies will struggle to repay loans priced in dollars, given the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plunge in value. Contagion caused jitters elsewhere too, with India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rupee and Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peso dropping to record lows. The Russian rouble and the South African rand hit levels not seen since 2016. A cocktail of problems are to blame, from Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surging inflation rate and current account deficit to the diplomatic row with America that means the Turkish economy faces punishing sanctions. Investors believe that Turkey needs to take decisive action, such as hiking interest rates from their current level of 17.75% to an even more painful rate - perhaps over 27%. President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is refusing to bow to pressure from the markets, though. He told an audience of ambassadors in Ankara that Turkey was under attack from overseas interests: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The developments over recent weeks have shown that Turkey is under siege. It is clear that these attacks will continue for a while.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Erdo\u00c4\u0178an also blasted US sanctions against its NATO ally, calling them a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stab in the back against Turkey.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has taken some steps to prop up the lira. It has pledged to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153provide all the liquidity the banks need\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which should help them to keep providing loans to people and businesses. Delphine Arrighi, fund manager at Old Mutual Global Investors, argues that borrowing costs must rise to prevent the lira plunging to fresh depths. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Other options could include capital controls, which seem more likely than an appeal to the IMF, but that would certainly not be the least painful and would most likely precipitate a recession while postponing the return of portfolio inflows. Hence a sizable rate hike followed by drastic measures of fiscal consolidation still appear as the most viable option to re-anchor the lira and pull the Turkish economy from the brink. Turkish authorities have also launched a crackdown against social media accounts, which it blames for spreading \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and undermining confidence in the economy. Even German chancellor Angela Merkel has weighed in, saying she hoped Turkey could be economically prosperous. She also called for Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank to be properly independent -- a touchy subject, as Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has been pushing it not to raise interest rates. There are fears that currency speculators could drive Turkey deeper into the crisis in the days ahead: And on the streets of Turkey, people have spoken of their concerns as import prices jump and the value of their savings shrinks. One told the Guardian: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really understand any of it. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an argues with Trump, and we end up trapped in a corner.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can just pray to God,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. The US stock market is heading lower, as worries over Turkey ripple weigh on Wall Street. Banks are bearing the brunt, with Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan both down around 1%. Traders remain worried that the Turkish crisis will escalate, unless Ankara takes more decisive steps - such as an interest rate hike. A bit more from Ed Conway: After a day of heavy losses, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchange has closed deep in the red with the benchmark BIST 100 index losing 2.4%. Financial stocks felt the full blast of the currency crisis, with some bank stocks falling by over 10%. The slump is even worse if you adjust for the depreciation of the lira, points out Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ed Conway in this thread about the situation in Turkey: Our economics editor Larry Elliott has written a new Q&amp;A on the Turkish crisis. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: What are the implications for the global economy? The direct impact of what looks like an inevitable recession in Turkey would be relatively small because, despite a population of 80 million and strong growth in recent years, the country accounts for only 1% of global GDP. Eurozone countries run a trade surplus with Turkey but it is small. In the two previous Turkish financial crises since the turn of the millennium, European exporters have been able to divert their business to other markets. The European Central Bank has expressed concern about potential contagion through the eurozone banking system, with Spain, followed by Italy, the most heavily exposed countries. A bigger danger is that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crisis will spill over into other emerging market economies and there were signs on Monday that other countries seen as vulnerable were coming under speculative attack. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems are particularly acute because it has more than $300bn of dollar-denominated corporate debt, which is getting more expensive to finance by the day. However, other countries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as Mexico and South Africa - also took advantage of low US interest rates in the years after the financial crisis to borrow heavily in dollars and saw their currencies coming under pressure. The fear is of a full-blown emerging market crisis. The lira is weakening in late trading, and is threatening to plunge back the 7 lira-to-the-US dollar mark to a new all-time low. Andy Birch, principal economist at IHS Markit, fears the lira will keep tumbling until Turkey raises interest rates: The changes to reserve requirements in recent days and the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unspecified action plan has done little to stabilize the lira. Significantly more than just official promises of action are needed to exit the current crisis. IHS Markit continues to believe that the most immediate step to be taken to rescue the lira is a sharp central bank rate rise. If this step is taken in conjunction with a shifting of government rhetoric, the plunge of the lira could pause and portfolio investment outflows may slow. Turkish citizens are struggling to cope with the impact of the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s astonishing losses in recent days, report Kareem Shaheen and Gokce Saracoglu in Istanbul. Some fear their businesses could shut down, while others who support the president say they will buy domestic products and shun goods from abroad. Those who cater to tourists, however, hope that the decline in the value of the currency will bring more foreign holidaymakers to the country. All declined to give their full names. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Go your way, nothing will happen to this country, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen the lira much lower than this in the 1990s,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one foreign exchange office worker. Money-changing offices in Istanbul were selling dollars at a much higher rate than the banks on Monday, however, saying the fluctuation in the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value was so unstable as to render the price they set meaningless. One vegetable and fruit seller said he had been forced to raise the price of imported products. A kilogram of bananas that cost 10 lira last week was now 15 lira. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to send Erdo\u00c4\u0178an away,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. While ordinary Turks struggle to absorb the effects of high inflation and a declining currency, some foreigners who earn salaries in dollars and tourists are buying up luxury items. Pictures on social media over the weekend showed queues of foreigners outside stores such as Luis Vuitton and Chanel. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of tourists, especially Arabs, buy from our store,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the manager of a high-end design store in Galata. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But every 15 days we have to buy new supplies from Europe. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their full report: European stock markets have closed in the red, as Turkish worries weigh on shares. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 shed 24 points, or 0.3%, to end the day at 7642. Holiday firm TUI was the worst-performing stock on the Footsie, losing 2.5%. Last week, it revealed it was taking a financial hit on euro-denominated loans taken out to fund hotel building in Turkey. The lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses push up the cost of repaying that debt. European banks with exposure to the Turkish economy also had a bad day. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BBVA lost 3.2% while Unicredit shed 2.5%. Argentina has been hit by the anxiety rippling through the financial markets today. The peso has fallen to a record low, at around 30 pesos to the US dollar. Back in April it was trading around the 20 mark, before a slump in market confidence forced Buenos Aires to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. The peso is also being driven down by an unfolding scandal involving alleged bribes made to former officials of the Kirchner government (which was in power until 2015). More than a dozen business people have been arrested, after it emerged that the chauffeur of a former government official had kept diaries which allege to show payments totalling millions of dollars. The ongoing investigation has also hit share and bond prices, as traders wonder whether more executives, or politicians, will be dragged in. Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama, currency exchange offices have been operating as normal in Turkey today. Here are some photos from Istanbul: While the slump in the lira is bad news for Turkish citizens, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something of a boon for tourists. For example, one pound is now worth 8.8 lira -- compared to just 4.5 lira a year ago. That makes Turkey an attractive destination for Brits, driving down the cost of accommodation and food. Economics columnist Matt O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Brien has written a pithy explanation of the Turkish financial crisis, which new readers might find particularly helpful: In another worrying sign, the cost of insuring Turkish government bonds has jumped today. The cost of a five-year credit default swap (which would pay out if Ankara can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t repay its bonds) jumped to 573 basis points, up from 452bp on Friday. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to data firm Markit, and suggests Turkish debt is now seen as riskier. Technically, it means it would cost $573,000 per year to insure $10m of Turkish debt. After several hours of volatile trading, the Turkish lira has settled around 6.87 lira to the US dollar. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a loss of around 7% today (a whopping move by usual standards), but also a small recovery on the record low of 7.2 struck overnight. It also means the lira has still lost a third of its value in the last week. The news that the Turkish central bank is offering more liquidity to commercial banks (see earlier post) seems to have stemmed the panic. However, investors still want to see more comprehensive action to tackle its inflation and current account deficit, such as a massive hike in interest rates. Reto Foellmi, economist from the University of St Gallen, fears that further lira losses could be disastrous: The vibrant growth of Turkey relied heavily on financing in foreign-currency debt. While Turkish exports get cheaper, Turkish companies face higher repayment obligations of the loans which hurts banks as well. As the Lira has a reputation as a weak currency, Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rhetoric puts oil into the fire. With a further weakening of the Lira, Turkey faces a downward spiral, where default could be the end. The Turkish crisis dragged world stock markets to a one-month low today. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell 0.6% this morning, as the Turkish lira hit fresh record lows against the US dollar. That was driven by losses in Asia overnight, in Europe this morning, and at emerging markets across the world. Dean Popplewell of City firm OANDA says anxiety over Turkey has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153severely bullied emerging markets into near submission.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In Japan, the Nikkei tumbled -2% to a five-week low overnight as a sell-off in emerging market currencies frightened investors, with the safe-haven yen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (\u00c2\u00a5110.20) appreciation also hurting sentiment. The broader Topix dropped -2.1%. Down-under, Aussie shares ended lower overnight, weighed down by materials and banks after the crisis in Turkey hit Asian assets, while global trade turmoil pushed commodity prices lower. The S&amp;P/ASX 200 index fell -0.4%. In S. Korea, the Kospi ended down -1.5%, in line with other Asian countries. However, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is holding its nerve. Wall Street is calm in early trading, with the Dow Jones industrial average up 60 points (or 0.23%). The EIU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Agathe Demarais adds that Turkey has a lot of work to do to regain market confidence -- but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear that such measures will be taken..... With an overheated and indebted economy, Turkey will require credibly orthodox economic policies, fiscal discipline and central bank independence to reverse the current situation. A normalisation of relations with the US could also reduce the amount of legwork that the central bank will have to do to control the economic situation, but this is unlikely to happen at the moment. In view of the domestic political and economic conditions, it is therefore unclear whether the necessary steps will be taken to contain the market fallout. Agathe Demarais, Turkey analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, has predicted that Western banks will suffer losses from the Turkish lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump soon. She told the AFP newswire that the impact of the currency crisis will ripple through the financial world, as Turkish companies find they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t service loans taken out in dollars. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So far the impact of the lira crash has been limited in Europe and the rest of the world. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, within a few months western banks that have strong ties with Turkey will feel the impact of the crisis as Turkish corporates will struggle to repay debt in foreign currency. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sharp depreciation of the lira has almost doubled the local currency value of external debt repayments since the start of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd German chancellor Angela Merkel has now waded into the crisis, urging Turkey to ensure the independence of its central bank. Merkel told a news conference in Berlin that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No one has an interest in an economic destabilisation inTurkey. But everything must be done to ensure an independent central bank,. Germany would like to see an economically prosperous Turkey. This is in our interest.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Turkish central bank has been restricted by Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opposition to higher borrowing costs (he believes they cause inflation, while most economists believe they restrict it). Turkish interest rates are currently 17.75% -- very high by current standards. Some City experts, though, argue they should be hiked by over 1000 basis points (to around 27%) to prop up the lira. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Associated Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on the Turkish leader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech earlier today. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says his country is under an economic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153siege\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that has nothing to do with its economic indicators. During an address to Turkish ambassadors in the capital, Ankara, Erdogan said Monday that Turkey would overcome the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153attack\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on its economy. He insisted that Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy remains strong and said the currency would soon settle \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at the most reasonable level.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In an apparent reference to the United States, Erdogan said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the bullies of the global system cannot roughly, shamelessly encroach on our gains that were paid for by blood.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Turkish leader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments came after authorities launched investigations into hundreds of social media accounts for alleged reports they claimed were helping the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plunge. Erdogan said there is an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic terror\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd being waged on social media, adding that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153traitors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd would be punished. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters first take on the Erdo\u00c4\u0178an speech: President Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an said on Monday he expected attacks on Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy to continue but predicted the lira would return to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rational levels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd soon, after the Turkish currency hit a record low of more than 7 to the U.S. dollar. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an, who has described the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall as the consequence of a plot rather than economic fundamentals, also said that spreading false news about the economy was treason and recent U.S. actions were a stab in the back against Ankara. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clip of president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an addressing the Ambassadors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 conference a moment ago: The lira is weakening, following Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that America is trying to stab Turkey in the back. It has dropped back to 6.9 lira to the US dollar, close to this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record low of 7.2. President Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has also declared that spreading false news about false news about Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153treason\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That follows this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crackdown on social media accounts blamed for sharing misleading information about the crisis. Heads-up: Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is giving a speech now, 10th annual Ambassadors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Conference in Ankara. Bloomberg say Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has told the conference that Turkey must prepare for further attacks on its economy. He has accused America of breaking World Trade Organisation principles (presumably by doubling tariffs on Turkish metal exports last week). Erdo\u00c4\u0178an adds that America is trying to stab Turkey in the back. On the market turmoil, Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has told his audience that the lira would settle at a rational level soon. There is no \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceconomic basis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for recent exchange rate moves, he adds. There will also be no retreat from free market economic policies, he insists. More details to follow soon Some UK stocks are taking a direct hit from the Turkey crisis. Travel firm TUI is leading the FTSE 100 fallers, down 3.3% this morning. In theory, the slump in the lira makes Turkey a more attractive holiday destination. In practice, reports of financial instability are likely to deter tourists. Ashmore, a fund manager focused on emerging markets, is down 5%. Stockbroker AJ Bell explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fund management group Ashmore is widely seen as the London-listed bellwether for emerging markets and its shares are unsurprisingly being sold off in the wake of the crisis in Turkey. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The recent collapse in the Turkish lira has served to trouble investors around the world and triggered a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrisk-off\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mentality. Put simply, investors are less willing to hold assets in higher risk areas such as emerging markets, and are switching instead to assets deemed to be safer havens. Fiona Cinoctta, senior market analyst at City Index, reckons the Turkish government only has a few days to stem the crisis. She warns that the slump in the lira could prompt some companies to default on their US dollar loans, triggering a domino effect: The lira had already declined 20% against the dollar on Friday on a mixture of domestic financial problems and increasing friction with the US and the decline continued this morning with the Turkish currency plumbing new lows. For the time being Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial crisis looks localised but the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has perhaps only days to stop the decline of the currency before the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s freefall results in loan defaults, starts seriously affecting the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system and potentially starts spilling over onto European banks. Into this domestically induced financial slide comes the deteriorating relationship between Turkey and the US. The US is holding it against Turkey that it is refusing to support US sanctions against Iran and that is not releasing an American pastor who is being held on terrorism charges. The US response was fairly clear cut \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on Friday when the lira was in freefall the US announced it would raise the tariffs on imports of Turkish steel to 50% and the tariffs take effect Monday morning. The selloff at the Istanbul stock market is gathering pace. The BIST 100 index has fallen 4%, with some bank stocks suffering double-digit losses. You can get up to speed on the Turkey crisis with this Q&amp;A: Plus, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics editor Larry Elliott on why Turkey needs to raise interest rates sharply, or turn to the IMF for help.... Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s answer to the financial crisis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that his followers should do their patriotic duty and exchange rapidly appreciating US dollars for ever-more worthless Turkish lira \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is laughable. Indeed, it will merely add to the belief in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets that Turkey is being led by a man who has lost touch with reality. It is clear what needs to happen. Turkey has to tackle the three causes of its current predicament: an overheating economy; Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts since his re-election in June to prevent the central bank from taking the necessary action to deal with rising prices; and the stand-off with the US. For Erdo\u00c4\u0178an, that means eating a huge plateful of humble pie. He is going to have to surrender to Trump over [jailed pastor Andrew] Brunson, because he is damaging the economy by continuing with a fight he cannot win. And he will need to accept that tough and unpopular measures are now inevitable to prevent a total collapse in the currency leading to hyper-inflation. The slump in the Turkish lira in recent weeks is quite extraordinary. It has lost a third of its value against the US dollar in a week (!) as investors have grown more anxious about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial health, its diplomatic row with the US, and its central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reluctance (or inability) to raise borrowing costs to stem the crisis. This chart shows how the crisis could spread to Europe, if Turkish banks find themselves struggling to repay dollar-denominated debts: Turkish authorities have launched a crackdown on news and social media posts which are threatening confidence in the economy, according to local reports. Turkish financial regulators are threatening legal action against those who make or publish \u00e2\u20ac\u0153erroneous and fabricated news and statements\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Almost 350 social media accounts are under investigation, for undermining the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate against the US dollar. The move comes as president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office warns that there is a co-ordinated attempt to undermine the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. H\u00c3\u00bcrriyet Daily News has the details: The Chief Prosecutor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office in Istanbul has opened an investigation into actions threatening \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic security,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial watchdog launched a separate probe into what it described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fake news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd aiming to manipulate economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An investigation has been launched according to Turkish Penal Law, Banking Law, Capital Markets Board regulations and related laws into people who displayed actions that threaten economic security through manipulative stories on media and operational social media accounts as part of the economic attacks that target the Republic of Turkey, its social peace, unity and economic security by the powers behind the [2016] coup attempt,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the prosecutor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office said in a statement on August 13, according to the state-run Anadolu Agency. In a separate statement, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Interior Ministry said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a judicial investigation has been launched into 346 social media accounts who shared posts to provoke the rise in the dollar exchange rate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meanwhile, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Crime Investigation Board (MASAK) also launched a probe into what it described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fake news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd aiming to manipulate economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153MASAK started an investigation into people and institutions that spread fake news, such as those claiming that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe state will intervene to convert foreign exchange in accounts into Turkish lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcit will fix dollar exchange rate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by ditching floating rate policy, which is a main pillar of the free market,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Treasure and Finance Ministry Press Undersecretary Ali Berber said in a tweet on Aug. 13. More here: Turkey launches probe into \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 over lira rumors Overnight, the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s communications chief, Fahrettin Altun, has claimed there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disinformation campaign\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd underway to undermine confidence in Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sector. He is unhappy about reports that President Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is threatening to seize foreign currency deposits. Over the weekend, Erdo\u00c4\u0178an warned he would take new measures if businesses rushed to withdraw their bank funds. He told an audience in Trabzon that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is industrialists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 duty too to keep this nation on its feet. Otherwise we will set into motion our plan B and C.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Altun insist on Twitter, though, that this has been misinterpreted (although he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reveal what Plans B or C might be): Emerging currencies across the globe are suffering from the Turkish crisis. The South African rand has dropped to a two-year low, while Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rouble is at its lowest against the US dollar since early 2016. India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rupee hit a record low, with traders reporting that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank had intervened to prevent an even steeper loss. The Turkish lira is still sharply lower today, down 6% at 6.8 lira to the US dollar (having plunged through 7 lira in early trading). With the US dollar strengthening, traders fear that developing economies are going to suffer capital outflows - potentially creating fresh currency crises. Neil Wilson of Markets.com fears further pain for emerging markets [EM in City jargon]. The dollar is the big winner in all this as investors turn away from EM. This may very well make things worse, particularly as long-dollar increasingly becomes something of a one-way trade. This dollar rally has a lot further to go and this will heap more misery on EM. European bank shares are leading the selloff, driven by fears that they could be dragged into the Turkish crisis. Several European financial institution, including Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BBVA, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UniCredit and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BNP Paribas, have significant operations in Turkey. They have borrowed in US dollars and may struggle to repay those debts unless the lira recovers. BBVA shares have fallen by 2.2%, Unicredit have lost 2% and BNP Paribas are down 1%. On Friday, the Financial Times reported that the European Central Bank is concerned about their exposure to the Turkish crisis. Anxiety about spillover effects from Turkey is also pinning the euro at a one-year low against the US dollar (down half a cent at $1.137 right now). Yesterday, Turkish finance minister Berat Albayrak pledged that a new economic action plan would be implemented today. He announced: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153From Monday morning onwards our institutions will take the necessary steps and will share the announcements with the market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But that promise, and the Turkish central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new measures, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to be stemming the crisis. Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at financial services group ADSS, says Turkish policymakers need to do more: Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speeches over the weekend did little to calm down investors as he remains defiant and this morning news that the Turkish central bank implemented measures to improve liquidity is not addressing the main issue which is the lira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline. Ergodan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unwillingness to raise interest rates suggests that the situation might not be defused soon extending the risk-off sentiment seen across all markets. Anxiety over Turkey is hitting share prices across Europe too, following those losses in Asia earlier today. The main European indices have all fallen into the red in early trading. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has lost 0.8%, and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is down 0.45% or 35 points at 7631. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says contagion fears are engulfing the markets. The panic that engulfed the markets at the end of last week is showing no signs of going anywhere at the start of the new week. Traders were met with a sea of red as indices dived across the Asian session; investors shunned riskier assets overnight while safer havens such as the Japanese yen and Swiss Franc firmed; jitters surrounding the Turkish currency crisis were showing few signs of moving on. The Turkish Lira dropped a further 6.3% in trading overnight, breaking through TL7 and hitting an all time low of TL7.2 after comments from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan over the weekend failed to calm investors. The lack of any new significant policy and a defiant stance from Erdogan means that traders are bracing themselves for another day of hectic trading on Monday. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is suffering heavy losses this morning. The BIST 30 index of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top countries has slumped by 2.5% in early trading, with virtually every share down. Financial stocks, utilities and consumer-focused companies are all leading the selloff, as investors fear that the financial crisis is escalating. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at foreign exchange firm FXTM, argues that Turkish policymakers need take much more decisive action, immediately. With inflation expected to run above 20%, a current account deficit that continues to widen, bond yields trading at record highs and growing political tensions with the U.S., the Turkish administration have limited choices to stop the Lira from bleeding. Investors need to see serious economic measures and not political ones to prevent things getting completely out of control. This includes an emergency interest rate hike by the central bank, imposing capital controls, fiscal reforms, securing a rescue package by the IMF or other lenders and ending the current diplomatic fight with Donald Trump. Until such steps are taken, investors will continue to selloff Turkish assets. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has taken action to stem the crisis, after seeing the lira slump to a record low today. The central bank of Turkey has announced several measures to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153support financial stability and sustain the effective functioning of markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This includes providing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all the liquidity the banks need\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and taking a more active role in the foreign exchange markets. In a statement (online here), the bank says: The Central Bank will closely monitor the market depth and price formations, and take all necessary measures to maintain financial stability, if deemed necessary. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an attempt to stabilize the tumbling lira and improve liquidity in the banking system. The move is having some success - the lira has recovered to around 6.7 against the dollar, from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record low of 7.2. But, that still means it has suffered a huge depreciation in the last week: Crucially, the bank has NOT raised interest rates, despite some economists arguing they need to increase by perhaps 10 percentage points. Robert Bergqvist, chief economist at Swedish bank SEB, thinks more needs to be done: Asian stock markets and emerging currencies have been hit by the Turkish crisis today, and the euro has been dragged down to its lowest level in a year. My colleague Martin Farrer explains: The Turkish lira fell almost 9% in early trading on Monday and the euro hit a one-year low as investors feared that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial crisis could spread to European markets. Despite defiant words by the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an over the weekend pledging as yet unspecified action to reverse the slide, the currency slipped alarmingly against the US dollar on Monday. Asian stock markets were also down on Monday. The Nikkei in Japan lost 1.7%, Hong Kong was off 1.8%, Shanghai -1.7%, Sydney -0.5% and the Taiwanese bourse fell 3%. The euro dropped 0.3% to a one-year low against the US dollar on Monday as the falling lira fuelled demand for safe havens, including the greenback, Swiss franc and yen. The Vix volatility index measuring turbulence in financial markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c also known as the fear index \u00e2\u20ac\u201c jumped 16% on Monday. More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fear is sweeping through the financial markets this morning as Turkey falls deeper into a currency crisis. The Turkish lira has slumped to new record lows overnight, hitting more than 7 lira to the US dollar. That followed Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s precipitous declines, as investors fear that the country could be heading towards full-blown financial chaos. The crisis has been building for months as Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has surged higher, its current account deficit has risen, and its economy has been hurt by the strengthening US dollar. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasing autocratic governing stance - including putting his son-in-law into a key post running the economy - has spooked the markets. So has his dislike of higher interest rates, which would typically be used to prop up a weakening currency like the lira. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to double Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel and aluminium tariffs on Friday has added to the sense of panic. President Erdo\u00c4\u0178an did nothing to reassure investors over the weekend. Instead, in a series of public addresses, he blasted the United States over the dispute over a jailed US pastor, and appeared to hint that Turkey \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a Nato member \u00e2\u20ac\u201c might look elsewhere for help (Russia, perhaps?) He declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will say bye bye to those, who sacrifice their strategic partnership and alliance with a country of 81 million people on the altar of their relations with terror organisations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are working day and night for alternative markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Erdo\u00c4\u0178an also urged the Turkish people to do their bit, by converting any spare dollar and euros into lira. He told supporters in the north-eastern Turkish town of \u00c3\u0153nye that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there are dollars under your pillow, take these out. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there are euros, take these out \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 immediately give these to the banks and convert to Turkish lira and, by doing this, we fight this war of independence and the future. Because this is the language they understand.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Unless Turkish policymakers can get a grip, the situation could easily cause serious problems in other markets. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: The Turkish lira has taken a battering, and the banks in Turkey who have borrowed in euros might struggle to repay their loans if they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hedged their position. Some eurozone banks have substantial shareholdings in Turkish bank, and should the default rate rise in Turkey, it could have a knock on effect around Europe. It looks like the eurozone banking system is set for another period of turmoil as the exposure that some Spanish and French banks have to Turkey could hurt confidence in the region. European banks have enough to worry about with their own non-performing loans, and let alone Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakened loan books. When it comes to the health of banks, traders usually steer clear of stocks and seek out safe-haven assets such as government bonds or the Japanese yen. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",
