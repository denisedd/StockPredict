                "bodyText":"And finally, Wall Street has closed a little higher, but with plenty of jitters around. The Dow gained 83 points, or 0.35%, to 23,675 -- only a small recovery from its 2% losses on Monday, and last Friday. Global growth worries, as reflected in the oil price\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop to a 15-month low, abounded. Investors are also edgy about what the US Federal Reserve will announce tomorrow, at its final policy meeting of the year. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest blast towards the Fed has only intensified the pressure, as the central bank tries to normalise policy without choking off growth. A tricky task, with Wall Street suffering one of its worst December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever.... Goodnight! GW US treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin has a theory -- the market turmoil is due to two factors -- high-frequency trading, and regulations brought in after the last financial crisis. Mnuchin singled out the Volcker Rule, which prevents banks from banks from taking risky bets with their own money, or pumping it into hedge funds. This, Mnuchin claims, is removing liquidity and making market moves more abrupt. He told Bloomberg: In my opinion, market structure has led to a lot more volatility. Part of this is a combination of the market presence of high-frequency traders combined with the Volcker Rule.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a theory... however, HFT and the Volcker Rule have both been around for years, so they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the only cause. Plus, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no secret that the White House want to roll back the Dodd-Frank rules (of which Volcker is part), despite concerns it could lead to more reckless behaviour. Get caught up on the markets: The US stock market is clinging onto its gains, with the S&amp;P 500 still up almost 1% today. Oil, though, continues to wallow at 15-month lows as traders anticipate weak demand in 2019. Stock market analyst Ronnie Chopra suspects that some UK companies are now vulnerable to a takeover bid, following recent stock market losses.... Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip stock index has just hit its lowest closing level in over two years. Amid worries over the global economy, and Brexit, the FTSE 100 has closed 71 points lower at 6701. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest closing level since November 2016 (although it fell below 6700 earlier this month in intraday trading). National Grid is the biggest faller, down 9%, after energy regulator Ofgem announced a shake-up that could cut bills. Energy firms BP and Royal Dutch Shell are also among the big fallers, tracking the slump in the oil price today. Technology, healthcare, and telecoms firms also had a bad day, while consumer-focused stocks also lost ground. European stock markets also fell today; the Stoxx 600 lost 0.6% as investors worry that the global economy is weakening. The Brent crude oil price has also slumped to its lowest level in over a year. Brent, sourced from the North Sea, is down almost 4% at $57.28, the lowest since October 2018. Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small recovery, this month is turning into one of the worst December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history. Indeed, Reuters has calculated that it could be the worst December since the Great Depression.... Global growth fears are sending the oil price sliding again. US crude has dropped below $48 per barrel for the first time since mid-September, 2017, extending recent losses. That indicates traders believe excessive supply, and lacklustre growth, will keep crude prices down in 2019. Back in London, the FTSE 100 is falling close to a two-year low. The blue-chip index is now down 52 points, or 0.75%, at 6,721. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less than 20 points away from the 25-month low struck earlier this month. Although Wall Street is still up, a 1% rise isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything to shout about - given the Dow lost 2% on both Friday and Monday. David Madden of CMC Markets thinks the rally lacks conviction, despite the welcome pick-up in US house-building reported today. Equity markets have bounced back today, but the upward move hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been driven by anything, and that is a little worrying, as it might just be a mixture of short covering and bargain hunting. The severe sell-off that was endured yesterday is still fresh in traders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds, and there is a sense that dealers want to get tomorrows Fed announcement out of the way, before formulating their next move. For a change, there was some upbeat housing data from the US. Building permits ticked up to 1.32 million in November, which topped the forecast of 1.25 million. Keep in mind, the October reading was 1.26 million. The housing starts reading was 1.25 million, which was an improvement on the 1.21 million in October. Admittedly, these figure weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t amazing, but they are a bright spot on a largely bleak housing figures. The Wall Street rally is being led by consumer-focused companies including Nike (+2.4%), and Visa (+1%). Industrial firms such as Boeing (+3.75%) and General Electric (+3.6%) are also up, as are financial stocks such as JP Morgan (+1.8%). The dollar, meanwhile, is dipping as investors brace for the Federal Reserve meeting tomorrow night. Fawad Razaqzada of FXTM explains: The greenback has been undermined by growing speculation that, at best, the Federal Reserve will deliver a dovish rate hike, while there is a possibility \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a small possibility, but a possibility nonetheless \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that it could even hold off hiking altogether. Most sectors of the US stock market are up, as traders try to shake off the pessimism gripping the markets. Bank share are rallying, after several tough weeks. But still, the overall picture is gloomy: Ding Ding! Wall Street is open, and shares are trying to recover after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 197 points at the open, or 0.85%. The broader S&amp;P 500 has gained 0.75%, after hitting a 14-month low yesterday. The Nasdaq index, focused on tech stocks, has gained almost 1%. Economist Ian Shepherdson makes a good point about the US housing stats: Just in: Home construction in America accelerated last month, in a sign that the economy can handle higher interest rates (whatever Donald Trump tweets). New housing starts jumped by 3.2% last month to an annual rate of 1.256 million, the Commerce Department says. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a seven-month high. The number of permits handed out for future housing projects also rose, up 5% compared with October. However... construction of single-family homes dropped to an 18-month low; the rise in housing starts was mainly due to more multi-family housing projects. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some snap reaction: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Investors are fleeing stocks and buying bonds in record numbers amid the global sell-off in equities, according to a December survey of fund managers released on Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors are approaching extreme bearishness ... this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey [found] the biggest ever one-month rotation into the asset class\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of bonds, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in the survey. The research report is one of the most widely-followed surveys of investors on Wall Street. Phew! After two days of serious losses, Wall Street is expected to rally when trading begins in 80 minutes time. The Dow is predicted to rise by over 200 points, having shed more than 500 on Monday. The Financial Times (PAYWALL) is concerned by BAML\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey of investor confidence, showing they are the gloomiest since 2008. Their Adam Samson writes: Investors have made the largest-ever shift into bonds this month, according to a widely-watched survey that also showed bets on global equities falling to the lowest in two years as concern over the economic outlook increases. Global investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 net underweight position in bonds tumbled 23 percentage points in December to 35%, according to data released on Tuesday by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. It was the biggest change in the history of the survey and brings the underweight position to the lowest level since the Brexit vote in June 2016. BAML\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Hartnett is also anxious, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors are close to extreme bearishness.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: Donald Trump has launched another broadside at the Federal Reserve, as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank begins its two-day policy meeting. Once again, Trump is urging the Fed not to raise interest rates on Wednesday. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also unhappy about its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcquantitative tightening\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 programme, which is currently taking $50bn out of the economy each month as the Fed unwinds its stimulus. Aviva Investors are also gloomy. Michael Grady, their chief economist, has predict that risk assets will give weaker returns in 2019, as global growth moderates. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In a slowing growth environment, investors tend to focus more on downside risks. Although the economic backdrop continues to provide a basis for positive returns for risk assets, expectations of more moderate growth and tighter global liquidity, and the impact of those risks, justify more restrained positioning. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We prefer to be overweight in US and emerging market equities because of the expected relative growth outperformance. Valuations in Europe look more attractive in some areas, but downside risks such as Brexit and the Italian budget continue to weigh on the outlook. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are moderately underweight government bonds as yields will continue to move higher on expectations that central banks will tighten policy in 2019. With spreads relatively tight by historical standards, we have a bigger underweight with regard to credit, including duration. Our preference is for European over US high yield due to its lower leverage and reduced sensitivity to oil prices. We have a slight preference for being long US dollars, with the main underweight against Australia on domestic challenges and Chinese growth risks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sound the alarm bells! Global investors are their gloomiest since the financial crisis, according to a new survey from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. BAML\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly check on investor sentiment shows that 53% expect global growth to weaken over the next 12 months. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the worst outlook for the global economy since October 2008 (when the wheels were coming off the financial system). The survey shows that investors have been piling into the US dollar, and into bonds, rather than crowding into tech stocks. BAML also found that investors are shunning UK stocks. A net 39% of investors are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunderweight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the UK, as they try to protect themselves from Brexit. Given the recent selloff, are stocks now actually cheap? Or just low, and heading lower? The City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finest minds are wrestling with this question as 2019 approaches. On some measures, shares are offering plenty of value, as this charts shows: The FTSE 100, for example, has lost 12% in 2018, meaning that many stocks are yielding more than a year ago (unless they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve slashed their dividend, or are going to...) Major US companies like Amazon, Apple and Facebook are offering better value than three months ago, having fallen by around 20% since September. But... that sort of thinking is scrambled, if the world economy is really cooling -- and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IFO data doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do much for confidence. Back in January, investors were being criticised for holding onto cash..... but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look such a bad call now. Financial experts are concerned that German business morale has fallen again this month, according to the IFO thinktank. IFO president Clemens Fuest says Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy appears to be cooling, with most industries sending \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bad signals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about their prospects (sending its business expectations measure to a 25-month low). Fuest told Bloomberg TV that: We think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a permanent slowdown. Not a downturn, we still expect growth next year. Teis Knuthsen, CFI at Kirk Kapital (managing the wealth of descendants of the creator of Lego), fears that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rebound from its summer contraction. Joumanna Bercetche of CNBC is also concerned: Just in: German business morale has fallen, in another sign that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy is struggling. IFO, the Munich-based thinktank, says its business climate index has dropped to just 101.0 this month, down from 102 in November. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker than expected, and the fourth decline in a row. IFO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business expectations measure slumped to just 97.3, from 98.7. That may indicate that growth will be subdued in 2019. Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wall Street rout dragged even more US companies into \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbear market territory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - more than 20% off their all-time high. Companies suffering this grizzly fate include tech giants such as Apple, Amazon, IBM, Netflix and Facebook, as this chart from Marketwatch shows. More here. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale also blames president Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloom: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s snow on the ground and gluhwein everywhere but the Christmas spirit is absent in financial markets. After a miserable afternoon for US equities, this morning actually started in a bright mood on the other side of the world, before President Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lack of any encouragement for expectations of further reform gave markets the jitters. No white beard, no sleigh, not much bowing to external pressure\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no Christmas cheer in the markets today, says Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM: December 2018 has so far been one of the ugliest Decembers in U.S. stock market history. The S&amp;P 500 declined 7.8% in 10 trading days and experienced the worst two-day selloff since October. Cheaper valuations, the U.S.-China trade truce, and dovish Fed commentary were not enough to put an end to falling stock markets. Santa Clause seems to have lost his way this year, defying hopes that stocks will rally towards the year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s end. Instead, institutional investors appear to be pulling out, taking whatever profits they have accumulated throughout this year. Splat! European stock markets have fallen in unison at the start of trading. Traders are taking their cue from Wall Street; last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff continues to reverberate around the markets. The FTSE 100 is down 52 points, or 0.7%. David Madden of CMC Markets says growth concerns are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153festering\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. US stocks sold-off yesterday as dealers were concerned about the world economy, and there is also a fear the Federal Reserve are tightening their monetary policy too fast. The S&amp;P 500 fell to a new 2018 low, while the Russell 2000 entered a bear market. Asian equity markets sold-off overnight on the back of the negative move on Wall Street. Growth fears are also weighing on the oil price today. Brent crude has dropped by almost 2% this morning, to $58.51 per barrel. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 14-month low. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president has disappointed the markets today. Xi Jinging launched a robust attack on other nations who demand Chines policy changes (yes you, America), in a high-profile speech marking 40 years of economic reform. Xi declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No one is in a position to dictate to the Chinese people what should or should not be done. We must resolutely reform what should and can be changed, we must resolutely not reform what shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be changed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t match this tough talk with any firm details of new reforms to stimulate China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, or open it up to competition. My colleague Lily Yuo explains: Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech comes as the Chinese leadership is facing criticism over slowing growth and confrontation with the US. Observers hoped his speech would lay out new directions or reforms needed to help the Chinese economy, weighed down by debt and lagging consumption, and an overly dominant state sector. Instead, Xi stressed that the Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership and strategy up to now have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely correct.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He promised to support the state sector while continuing reforms in appropriate areas. His remarks lacked any detail about new policies and failed to inspire confidence in Asian markets. Hong Kong and Shanghai both dropped sharply during the speech. They are now off 1% for the day while losses have deepened to 1.8% in Tokyo and more than 1% in Sydney. More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTis the season to be jolly nervous! Global stock markets are being buffeted by worries over global growth and trade wars, while in the UK Brexit fears are causing serious angst in the retail sector. Last night, the US stock markets suffered yet another bruising selloff. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 507 points, or 2%, while the S&amp;P 500 lurched to a 14-month low. Wall Street has now suffered the worst start to a December since 1980. Markets in Asia-Pacific have followed suit, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei slumping by 1.8% and Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P/ASX 200 down 1.2%. Europe is also heading for a chilly bath at the open. The FTSE 100 is being called down 50 points, adding to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 70-points slide, taking the Footsie close to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-year low. Investors seem to be badly worried that the world economy is slowing, and that China and the US won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resolve their trade dispute. But the number 1 issue is whether America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve raises interest rates tomorrow night, and how hawkish or dovish it sounds about next year. US president Donald Trump piled even more pressure on the Fed on Monday, arguing it would be madness to raise interest rates. However, the Fed may feel that not hiking would cause more turmoil than hiking -- as the markets are expecting borrowing costs to go up again. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains: The market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overriding fear is that the Fed will press ahead with plans to raise interest rates, which could be too much for the US economy to handle. An indication from the Fed that they will slow their pace of hikes could calm these jittery markets. However, until the Fed have confirmed that as a course of action, investors will remain skittish. The volatility index, also known as the fear gauge lifted 2.27 points to a seven-week high. The markets remain anxious about China too, following data last week showing that Chinese retail sales growth has hit a 15-year low, as industrial output growth softens. UK retailers, meanwhile, will be desperately hoping that shoppers come out in force this week. The sector has been rocked by yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning from online clothing group Asos, after a slump in trading in November. The agenda: 9am GMT: IFO survey of German business confidence for December 1.30pm GMT: US housing starts data for November",

Its 125 UK stores will remain open while talks with suppliers and potential buyers continue.</p> \n<p>Will Wright, partner at KPMG and joint administrator, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whilst we understand that [HMV] has continued to outperform the overall market decline in physical music and visual sales, as well as growing a profitable ecommerce business, the company has suffered from the ongoing wave of digital disruption sweeping across the entertainment industry. This has been in addition to the ongoing pressures facing many high street retailers, including weakening consumer confidence, rising costs and business rates pressures.</p> \n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Over the coming weeks, we will endeavour to continue to operate all stores as a going concern while we assess options for the business, including a possible sale. Customers with gift cards are advised that the cards will be honoured as usual, while the business continues to trade.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> \n<p>However, Alex Neill from the consumer group Which? advised anyone with HMV vouchers to spend them as soon as possible.

The retailer moved its flagship store back to this original site, at 363 Oxford Street, in 2013.</p>\n    <p>\u00e2\u2014\ufffd The company was originally part of the Gramophone Company, founded by Emile Berliner, a German-born American inventor.</p>\n    <p>\u00e2\u2014\ufffd In 1931 the Gramophone Company merged with a rival to create Electric and Musical Industries (EMI). EMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now-famous recording studios at Abbey Road were also opened that year. The first A&amp;R managers to spot and develop music talent in Britain were appointed in 1940.

In 1967 EMI converted HMV into a classical-only music label.</p>\n    <p>\u00e2\u2014\ufffd In its first few decades HMV traded principally from the Oxford Street store, but spread across London in the 1950s and 60s. It did not become a national chain until the 1980s, when CDs made music retailing very profitable. It reached 100 stores in 1997, and grew to more than 200 by 2004.</p>\n    <p>\u00e2\u2014\ufffd HMV bought book retailer Dillons in 1995 and three years later added Waterstones. In 2011, following a slump in book sales, HMV sold Waterstones to Russian billionaire Alexander Mamut for \u00c2\u00a353m.</p>\n    <p>\u00e2\u2014\ufffd HMV floated on the London Stock Exchange in 2002, leaving EMI with only a token shareholding.</p>\n    <p>\u00e2\u2014\ufffd Following a collapse in sales and several profits warnings, HMV collapsed into administration in January 2013.

                "bodyText":"HMV has become the first casualty of a slump in Christmas trade on the high street, collapsing into administration for the second time in six years and putting more than 2,200 jobs at risk. The music and film retailer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which accounts for nearly a third of all physical music sales in the UK and nearly a quarter of all DVD sales \u00e2\u20ac\u201c appointed insolvency experts from the accountancy firm KPMG as joint administrators at high court hearing late on Friday evening, to either find a buyer for the business or close it down. HMV said retailers of all types were facing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a tsunami of challenges\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, festive trading had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremely weak\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and sales of DVDs across the market had plunged by 30% on last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s levels. Its 125 UK stores will remain open while talks with suppliers and potential buyers continue. Will Wright, partner at KPMG and joint administrator, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whilst we understand that [HMV] has continued to outperform the overall market decline in physical music and visual sales, as well as growing a profitable ecommerce business, the company has suffered from the ongoing wave of digital disruption sweeping across the entertainment industry. This has been in addition to the ongoing pressures facing many high street retailers, including weakening consumer confidence, rising costs and business rates pressures. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Over the coming weeks, we will endeavour to continue to operate all stores as a going concern while we assess options for the business, including a possible sale. Customers with gift cards are advised that the cards will be honoured as usual, while the business continues to trade.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, Alex Neill from the consumer group Which? advised anyone with HMV vouchers to spend them as soon as possible. She added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you have recently bought anything from HMV, you may not be able to claim a refund or exchange the item if the company ceases trading.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The 97-year-old retailer, which also owns the nine-store Fopp chain, was rescued by Hilco, a restructuring company, when it collapsed in 2013. Paul McGowan, the executive chairman of HMV and Hilco, said the decline in the CD and DVD market had made the situation in the UK impossible. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153During the key Christmas trading period the market for DVDs fell by over 30% compared to the previous year and while HMV performed considerably better than that, such a deterioration in a key sector of the market is unsustainable,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153HMV has clearly not been insulated from the general malaise of the UK high street and has suffered the same challenges with business rates and other government-centric policies, which have led to increased fixed costs in the business. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business rates alone represent an annual cost to HMV in excess of \u00c2\u00a315m. Even an exceptionally well-run and much-loved business such as HMV cannot withstand the tsunami of challenges facing UK retailers over the last 12 months, on top of such a dramatic change in consumer behaviour in the entertainment market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd HMV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest troubles are a sign of the problems facing entertainment retailers during a period of rapid change for the industry, with competition ranging from online specialists to streaming sites such as Netflix and Spotify. There are now nearly 10 million subscribers to Netflix in the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more than the number of homes signed up to Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s satellite TV service. HMV is also suffering from the wider downturn on UK high streets, as shoppers buy more goods on the internet and rein in spending amid Brexit uncertainty while costs are on the rise. The number of shoppers on UK high streets was down by up to 4% over the Christmas period, according to the research group Springboard. A new survey of mid-sized retailers published on Friday by accountants BDO showed sales at traditonal shops down nearly 5% in the week to 24 December, suggesting a hoped-for boost from last-minute purchases over the final pre-Christmas weekend did not materialise. Online sales rose 17%. The problems facing retailers led to an increase of more than 4,400 shops, pubs and restaurants lying empty in the first six months of this year, according to analysts at LDC; more than double the increase ever previously recorded. Mike Ashley, the founder and chief executive of Sports Direct, warned before Christmas that this November was the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worst on record\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for retailers and would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153literally smash them to pieces\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Bonmarch\u00c3\u00a9, a budget womenswear retailer, said conditions were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unprecedented\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and worse than the 2008 recession as it warned the 300-store chain could make a loss this year because of weak trading. More than \u00c2\u00a31.3bn was wiped off the value of the online fashion retailer Asos the week before Christmas when it unveiled a shock profit warning after having to offer \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unprecedented\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd discounts to attract shoppers.

This will then likely lead to a vote to Remain, likely followed by a General Election.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153If that happens I believe the markets will continue to be volatile in early 2019 but will rally on the prospect of no Brexit.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually been a pretty poor year for markets globally though; Europe, Japan and Emerging Markets are all sharply down on the beginning of the year, and while the US has held up better, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still in negative territory, and has witnessed a pretty dramatic fall in the last three months.We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unlikely to see the gloom lift in January. Brexit looks set to reach a parliamentary crescendo, and a swathe of trading updates from the UK high street isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t likely to lighten the mood.</p> <p> Despite the negative sentiment, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unwise to bet on the direction of the stock market in the short term, as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prone to defy expectations, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse.

                "bodyText":"Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story about the markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bad year: Best wishes for 2019!! GW With the Dow up more than 200 points today, Wall Street could yet end a rough month on a moderately high note. As MarketWatch puts it: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.84% today) has declined 9.7% thus far in December, while the S&amp;P 500 index (+0.5%) is down 9.9% during the period, and the Nasdaq Composite Index (+0.55%) is off 10.2% through Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. Those declines would represent the worst monthly drops since October 2008, according to FactSet data. For the year, the Dow is in line for a 6.7% loss, with the S&amp;P 500 down 7% and the Nasdaq Composite on pace for a 4.6% fall. Trading on Monday, however, was looking up after investors saw reasons to buy in recent tweets from President Donald Trump about putative trade-negotiation progress between himself and Chinese leader Xi Jinping via weekend phone conversations. At the risk of flattening your NYE fizz, there are plenty of reasons to fret about 2019. Weak retail spending, falling house prices, a new chapter in the eurozone crisis or a deeper US-China trade war could all herald a recession. As could Brexit....... Richard Stone, chief executive at The Share Centre, says Brexit is the key factor determining if the FTSE 100 recovers, or stumbles, in 2019. He writes: No one really knows how that is going to resolve itself and it would be a brave (or untruthful) person who said they did! My central expectation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c amidst a range of possible outcomes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is that an extension to Article 50 will be requested to allow time for a second referendum as Parliament fails to coalesce around any outcome to deliver Brexit and instead abdicates its responsibility back to the people clothed in the claims that this presents the most democratic resolution of the issues. This will then likely lead to a vote to Remain, likely followed by a General Election. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If that happens I believe the markets will continue to be volatile in early 2019 but will rally on the prospect of no Brexit. This will also likely result in a bounce in the value of Sterling which will temper the rise, or at least the pace of the rise, in the FTSE 100 slightly due to the overseas earnings component of many of the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constituents. The other factor, of course, is Donald Trump: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Away from Brexit more volatile US politics and potentially increased trade tensions as President Trump continues to promote an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAmerica First\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 agenda as he starts his re-election campaign will likely weigh on US markets or at the very least cause them to be more volatile. We have already seen some of this since the mid-term elections in November 2018. Plus, the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google/Alphabet) face a crunch year: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Finally, the drive towards greater regulation and taxation of the tech giants will likely weigh on some of their performance. Personal investors will need to be alive to trying to identify the new emerging companies or trends. On Twitter, the economics team at ACS Hillingdon International School are asking whether this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses are a buying opportunity. I certainly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give investment advice #CaveatEmptor . But here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe UK stock market has definitely felt the heat of the Brexit burn in 2018, with domestically-focused UK companies finding themselves under pressure as politicians seem unable to agree on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually been a pretty poor year for markets globally though; Europe, Japan and Emerging Markets are all sharply down on the beginning of the year, and while the US has held up better, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still in negative territory, and has witnessed a pretty dramatic fall in the last three months.We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unlikely to see the gloom lift in January. Brexit looks set to reach a parliamentary crescendo, and a swathe of trading updates from the UK high street isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t likely to lighten the mood. Despite the negative sentiment, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unwise to bet on the direction of the stock market in the short term, as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prone to defy expectations, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. The appeal of putting long term savings to work in the stock market still remains, though investors who are concerned about its immediate prospects should consider drip-feeding money in gradually, to take advantage of any dips.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Over in New York, investors are attempting to inject some New Year jollity into proceedings. The Dow Jones industrial average is up around 0.6%, or 150 points, at 23212 points, as Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst December since 1931 heads towards the exit. After 2018\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses, what might next year have in store for investors, and everyone else? Andrew Milligan, Head of Global Strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments, believes 2019 will be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153middling year from an economic point of view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He told us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The world economy is not in a bad place at the start of 2019. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve talked of the slowdown in Europe and China, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still trend growth. America is above trend and will decelerate during the course of this year, but there are very few signs, currently, of any major economic problems in the immediate future. The oil price is lower, which helps. The Fed has hinted that it will not be as aggressive. Inflation is not a concern. There are debt issues out there. China remains the most worrying one. Housing markets in some countries are stretched. There is emerging market debt in some countries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Milligan said a potential downside could be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negative feedback loop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd caused by falling share prices, discouraging companies and consumers from spending. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Confidence and sentiment do matter. One can just see people being more cautious about spending and investing and the economies, just as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in Europe this year, slow and slow. That would be an adverse headwind.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added that potential upside could come from Trump and Xi coming to agreements to resolve the US-China trade dispute. The US stock market may manage a last-ditch rally, after Donald Trump tweeted that he was making progress over trade talks with China. UK housebuilders also had a rough 2018, hit by Brexit worries. Taylor Wimpey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market capitalisation has slumped by a third, while Berkeley Group are down 17%. Shares in tobacco firms went up in smoke this year. British American Tobacco lost half its value during 2018, tumbling in November when US regulators proposed a major crackdown on menthol cigarette sales. But online grocery retailer Ocado bucked the gloom, almost doubling in value this year after securing deals to supply its technology to overseas supermarkets. Stock markets across Europe have had a torrid year, with all the main indices shedding at least 10%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the damage: UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100: down 12.5% in 2018 German DAX: down 18% French CAC: down 11% Italian FTSE MIB: down 16% Spanish IBEX: down 14.9% The London stock exchange have confirmed that \u00c2\u00a3242bn was wiped off the companies which make up the FTSE 100 during 2018. Here are some more facts from the LSE: FTSE 100 highest point in 2018 was 7877.45 on 22 May 2018 FTSE 100 lowest point in 2018 was 6585.91 on 27 December 2018 Last time FTSE 100 closed down at year end was 31 December 2015: -4.93% Highest % daily rise in 2018 was on 5 April: +2.35% Highest % daily fall in 2018 was on 6 December: -3.15% Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has suffered its worst year since the financial crisis. The FTSE 100, which tracks the biggest companies listed in London, has shed 12.5% of its value this year -- or more than \u00c2\u00a3240bn (by my maths). The Footsie has just closed down 5 points at 6,728 points. It started this year at 7,687 points, before being rocked by fears over the global economy, fuelled by trade wars anxiety, and Brexit uncertainty. The FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor performance has helped to drag global markets deep into the red too. As explained earlier, the MSCI index of global stocks has fallen by around 11% during 2018, while the Chinese market has tanked by a quarter. The pound is ending the year with a small rally. Sterling is up 0.5% against the US dollar at $1.277, and 0.6% higher against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.116. These are the highest levels since Theresa May was forced to postpone the parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal, to avoid a huge defeat. The government continues to push for improvements to May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal, to assuage MP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns over the Irish backstop. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still no breakthrough. What a difference a year makes! On the last trading day of 2017, City traders were celebrating the news that the FTSE 100 had hit a new all-time high. As we blogged at the time, the blue-chip index gained over 7% during the year to finish at 7,687 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than 12% higher than today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s levels. Other countries did even better, helping to drive globe stocks up by a sizzling $9 trillion during the year. Analysts at Mizuho Bank have cautioned against getting carried away by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s held \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd talks with Chinese president Xi Jinping. They told clients: Whilst President Trump has lauded \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig progress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in trade talks with China following a phone call with Xi during the weekend, it remains to be seen how much this can boost investor confidence given that market reaction on recent positive development has largely been muted. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen plenty of dramatic scenes at the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchanges this year, with traders wallowing in gloom as shares crash, or beaming with delight as shares recovered. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delivered a bumper crop of photos from the trading floors, and no-one sums up the mood better than veteran trader Peter Tuchman - who has a real knack for capturing the state of play. My colleague Dominic Rushe caught up with Tuchman, and reports: Like most celebrities in real life, Tuchman is smaller than he looks. Twin clouds of white hair, echoed by snowy facial fuzz, frame a bald pate that slopes gently down to expressive eyes on a face that seems perpetually in motion, as are his hands and feet. Tuchman is a human emoji, a one-man metaphor for the mood of the market. But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be fooled by the clowning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Tuchman is a cool cat. What you are seeing is not necessarily what he is thinking. Tuchman, 60, came late to fame. The born-and-bred New Yorker had already been working on the floor of the NYSE for some 20 years when he first made the front pages. It was 2007 and the financial crisis was dominating the news cycle. On another day of wild swings Tuchman, snapped mouth agog, appeared on the front of the New York Post. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I had just received the bill for my son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s barmitzvah and it was way more money than I anticipated,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd jokes Tuchman. But Tuchman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jollity has a serious side too: His sangfroid, Tuchman says, comes from his parents. Marcel and Shoshana Tuchman were Holocaust survivors who were imprisoned in Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My father was a slave laborer for Siemens Corporation, which is still a public company here,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says, nodding ruefully at the trading floor. His grandmother was murdered in front of his father, most of whose family were also murdered by the Nazis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As was my mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My father went up against Josef Mengele, the death doctor [who performed deadly experiments on Auschwitz prisoners], as did my mother. My mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s whole family was gassed. They could have come out of that, you know, being angry and depressed, negative-minded people; they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. There are two options in this thing. You can come out of challenges trying to devour every day and looking at life as if the cup is half-full or you come from a negative point of view that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a victim and the cup is half-empty. I vote for the former.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Marcel Tuchman, who worked until he was 93 teaching medicine, died earlier this month aged 97. His son was back at work the next day. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My father always said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhen I die, cry and go to work.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 That was his advice.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full piece: Fiona Cincotta of City Index points out that UK-focused companies are having a decent morning (after a pretty ropey year). The FTSE opened the last trading day of the year a touch higher with a mixture of consumer, property and mining companies making moderate gains. With the pound firmer against the euro and the dollar, FTSE gainers were mostly companies with a strong domestic focus except for miners which were helped by stronger copper and oil prices. Unless Wall Street manages the mother of all rallies today, it will suffer its worst December since the Great Depression. With less than two hours trading to go in London, the FTSE 100 is up 17 points at 6751. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 12% lower than this time last year.... Holger Schmieding of German bank Berenberg suggests there are four \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extraordinary political mistakes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which might trigger fresh market mayhem in 2019. They are: for Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s radical government to plunge their country into a genuine Greek-style debt crisis; for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mostly pro-EU political class to simply let the train roll towards and then over the hard Brexit cliff instead of using the ten weeks between the likely death of May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit deal and Brexit day on 29 March 2019 to stop it through a softer Brexit option or a new vote to stay in the EU; for Donald Trump to hurt the US economy and impair his chances of re-election in late 2020 by going too far in his costly trade wars in 2019; for China to let a hard landing happen instead of using its ample policy toolbox to smooth the inevitable slowdown in cyclical momentum and trend growth. Now the good news. He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re particularly likely... For example, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget passed last night, showing that the EU and markets have imposed some rudimentary discipline on Rome. Separately, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest musings on progress in talks with China support hopes that both sides will try to strike some deal in coming months even if some of the thorny issues between the geostrategic rivals will probably not be fully resolved for many years. So, Schmieding suspects that markets may pick up during 2019: Chances are that, after a rocky start to the New Year, a less negative narrative can unfold later in 2019. That we have finally put an unexpectedly difficult 2018 behind us need not remain the only reason to celebrate the advent of a New Year tonight. Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchange managed a last-minute rally today. The Hang Seng jumped by 1.3%, lifted by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest optimistic tweet about the trade negotiations with China. But that still leaves the index down 13.6% for 2018, its worst year since 2011. The last 12 months have proved difficult for investors in stock markets around the world as fears over global growth mount up, and for many owners of commodities 2018 has proven equally tricky, my colleague Jasper Jolly writes: Prices for oil and gold, two of the most traded commodities, are both set to fall for the first calendar year since 2015. Futures for Brent crude oil, the North Sea benchmark, gained a dollar in value today, but that has not been enough to recover losses for 2018, which currently stand at around 18%. Fears of a supply glut amid weakening growth in China and other major economies depressed prices to just over $54 per barrel. Losses for West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark, have been steeper, at 23%. Gold is seen as the financial safe haven par excellence, but it is on course to suffer its first annual decline in three years. Gold futures prices slumped from above $1,350 per troy ounce in the spring to below $1,200 in the late summer. They have since recovered for a 2% fall during 2018 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c stronger than the performance of silver, prices of which have fallen by 9%. Cocoa was the top gainer among major traded commodities in 2018, leading a field of strong performances from a select group of agricultural commodities. Cocoa futures prices have gained more than 27%. Speculators looking further afield at cryptocurrencies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which share some characteristics with commodities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would not have been rewarded. Those who had bought bitcoin at the end of 2017, near the height of the cryptocurrency mania, would have lost almost three-quarters of their money. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets blames monetary policy tightening by the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central banks for this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. The Fed stopped printing easy money a few years back and increased the interest rates four times this year. The European Central Bank also ended up its quantitative easing program and there has been several discussion on the topic of the ECB normalising the interest rates. All in all, almost all the European indices are down more than 10 percent over this year and some of them are down over 15% (DAX) for this year. The Euro Stoxx 500 index is down by 13% this year\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe biggest loss since 2008. The fact is that things aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t looking really any brighter in 2019 as well because there are plenty of risk events which are going to keep investors on their toes. For instance, at the beginning of the year, the first thing which investors will have to deal with is the Brexit chaos the UK leaving the European union. Then we have the US trade war with China and the ongoing struggle about securing the funds to build the wall. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s making \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig progress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the trade negotiations with China may be giving world markets a small boost today. Wall Street is expected to open higher in a few hours time, following the news that presidents Trump and Xi spoke over the weekend. European stock markets have started trading, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little drama yet. In London the FTSE 100 index has gained 10 points, led by online supermarket Ocado (+2.1%), budget airline easyJet (1.7%) and web estate agent RightMove (1.5%). The French CAC has gained 0.5%, with Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEC up 0.4% and the Netherland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AEX up 0.3%. So with trading thin, and little news about, European stocks seem certain to suffer their worst year since 2008, as this chart shows. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchange has closed for the year, after yet another day of losses. The S&amp;P/ASX200 index dipped by 0.14%, taking its combined losses in 2018 to over 9% - the worst year since 2011. Another reason to worry about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy: In a worrying signal for 2019, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector is now contracting. The official factory Purchasing Managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Index (PMI) fell to 49.4 in December, official data shows, a two-year low. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s below the 50-point mark that shows if activity rose or fell. Manufacturers were hit by falling orders, with new export orders dropping for the seventh month in a row. That suggests the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods at the US border are hitting demand. Mike Van Dulken of City firm Accendo Markets says this data \u00e2\u20ac\u0153may fan the flames of concern about slowing global growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More here. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have suffered a particularly bleak 2018. The Shanghai composite index has crashed by 25% this year, leaving investors suffering very heavy losses. The trade war with the US has acted like a lead weight on many stocks, of course, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also concern that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is weakening. My colleague Lily Kuo explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People have started to reduce or even stop spending money because they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the economy will perform well,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ye Tan, an independent economist based in Shanghai. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Companies and individuals are wary about the economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Going into 2019, China faces not just a slowing economy but also a protracted trade war with the US, a pile of debt that threatens the world economy along with the Chinese financial system, and a populace demanding better environmental, labour, and health protections. Shanghai is closed today, as China prepares for the New Year celebrations. Investors deserve the break. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the final day of the year, and many investors will forgiven for wishing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgoodbye and good riddance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to 2018. The last 12 months have been pretty tough in the markets. Global stocks have suffered their worst losses since the financial crisis of 2008, wiping around 11% off the MSCI All Country World Index of stocks. In London, the FTSE 100 is limping towards the end of a rough year. The blue-chip index has shed 12% of its value since the start of January, hitting a series of two-year lows -- in a blow to pension funds and savers big and small. The big worry is that the long bull market, which reared up after the great recession ended in 2009, is now over. Anxiety over trade wars, a slowing global economy, Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasingly erratic behaviour and US interest rate hikes have all hurt stocks this year. In Europe, the tortuous Brexit negotiations and the long-running row between Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s populist government and Brussels have also worried investors. Trevor Greetham of Royal London Asset Management explains: We were surprised at the ferocity of the selloff in December which we put down to rising nervousness about the US-China trade dispute, an ill-judged and poorly communicated rate hike from the US Federal Reserve and an increasingly erratic pattern of behaviour from President Trump as the Mueller investigation into Russian collusion enters its final stages. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The last couple of weeks have seen a surprise unilateral decision to pull all US troops out of Syria, threats of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very long\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd government shutdown if Congress refuses to fund the Mexican border wall and a counterproductive attempt to blame the Fed for market weakness when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the trade war that investors are most worried about. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Elsewhere in the world Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chaotic postponement of the meaningful vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill has added to the jittery mood in markets, raising as it does the risk of a No Deal Brexit that would damage both the UK and euro area economies. But perhaps investors are too gloomy. Over the weekend, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping both made positive noises about a breakthrough in their trade talks, offering hope that deeper tariffs can be avoided. That is likely to give traders some much-needed optimism today. European markets are expected to open higher today, in a shortened trading session (although Germany and Italy will be closed).",
