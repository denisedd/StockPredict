                "bodyText":"Finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sarah Butler on Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views on the high street crisis: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high street might be in better shape if it could sell tickets to watch Mike Ashley in action. In an eye-catching performance, the man behind Sports Direct has unveiled a new plan to tackle Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high street -- a tax on web retailers, to encourage them to keep high bricks-and-mortar outlets running too. Under Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan, any retailer which did more than 20% of its business online would be hit by the tax. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not my fault the high street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dying, is it? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not Marks &amp; Spencer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not Debenham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very simple why the high street is dying - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the internet. The internet is killing the high street. He suggested this would catch Sports Directs itself, but it was worth it to resuscitate the high street. Sports Direct won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be pleased with me for my suggestion. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not necessarily a good fix for Sports Direct , but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fantastic fix for the high street. Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans sounds like a twist on the digital services tax which chancellor Philip Hammond announced in October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. Ashley, though, insisted that the high street was otherwise doomed, saying: The high street won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make 2030, it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get there, unless you do something really radical and grab the bulls by the horns. Ashley also criticised landlords for using \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prehistoric\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rents, including some which can only be revised higher each year. This has put some retailers into a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153downward death spiral\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the retail chief claimed, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everybody has to come together and look at this. I know it sounds very socialist, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not this crazy capitalist that everybody thinks I am.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ashley also called for retailers need to be more innovative, perhaps laying out computer games consoles for one half of a couple to play on while the other perused the aisles. MPs on the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee, who are looking at the future of the high street in 2030, looked sceptical -- asking how overseas-based e-tailers could be made to pay the levy. Ashley arrived at the Thatcher Room in Westminster, keen to give MPs the benefits of his experience running Sports Direct. But he swiftly found himself on the back foot, as MPs demanded answers about his takeover of House of Fraser this year. Ashey hotly denied ever promising to save all HoF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 59 stores, saying: What person could keep 59 stores open - beside God? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impossible, it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be done. I believe Ashley is right - in August, he spoke about hoping to save 47 stores. Even keeping 80% would be a God-like performance, Ashley continued. Ashley also found that MPs haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forgotten Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation for using zero-hours contracts (it was criticised for Victorian workhouse practices in 2016). He refused to rule out using more zero-hours contracts at HoF, insisting that many workers love them. And he denied \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stroking a white cat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd like a Bond villain, deciding which stores to axe. And finally, Mike Ashley hinted that House of Fraser could work closer with Debenhams (in which he owns a stake). He tol MPs: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I told them to work together. They should work together Mike Ashley winds up his hearing with a prediction -- Harrods and Selfridges will have a good year. One of the reasons that House of Fraser failed is that it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t elevate itself, Ashley continues. Luxury brands are on the up. Teenagers, people today, want to wear their wealth. Mike Ashley returns to his big theme - the internet has killed the high street. He tells the MPs: The web has killed the high street, not the local councils, not this, not that. Ashley concedes that everyone involved may have moved too slowly to tackle the issue. Now, unless major change is pushed through, the high street is finished. It is just going to die, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be left with Oxford Street and Bond Street. Outside of London, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a ghost town. Sorry, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be. Interestingly, Mike Ashley says that local councils have helped keep House of Fraser stores open since his Sports Direct chain took it over this year. Ashley tells the committee that some landlords have refused to cut the rent, in the hope that the department store will close - freeing them up potentially turn it into housing. Councils, though, insisted that everyone involved made an effort to keep the House of Fraser store open. Ashley suggests, though, that some stores need to downside - perhaps by turning their upper floors into residential units. I accept House of Fraser cannot have 500,000 square feet in Birmingham. Honestly, you would need an Uber to take you round. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ridiculous. Q: There are reports that high street rents might crash next year, by 20%. Wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that be good news for the retailers? But wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rents NOT fall, if landlords were able to turn high street stores into residential units (as some campaigners have asked for) You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll make me hated by every landlord in the country, but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re absolutely correct, Ashley replies. Labour MP Liz Twist, who represents the Bladon in North-East England, asks Mr Ashley to meet with her to discuss the fate of the House of Fraser Metro store. No, absolutely not, Ashey replies. Q: Why not? If I do it for one person, think of all the other people that I have let down, Ashley replies, burying his head in his hands. People keep thinking I can do these one-off things. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not easy to do, But Ashley is prepared to attend a meeting with MPs to discuss the wider issue, ideally with HoFs landlords too. Q: What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening with House of Fraser stores, and your push to cut rents? Mike Ashley says local councils are refusing to cut rents, because they can see that HoF stores are profitable...but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not recognising the overhead costs behind the scenes. So a store that seems to be making a \u00c2\u00a32m profit on paper is actually losing \u00c2\u00a32m, once you factor in the true costs of running a business. Ashley then give a fascinating insight into business, saying that accountants can make up nearly any number you like, to flatter a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accounts. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even understand what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI can make that store loss-making, or I can make it profitable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. They say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll put exceptions in - what are they when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at home?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ashley adds with (apparent) disbelief. The underlying problem in UK retail is the web, says Mike Ashley, as he continues to brief MPs on the future of the high street. Looking magnanimously at the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee, he adds kindly: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not your fault, you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it. Q: Why is there such a problem with rents in the retail sector? Landlords and retailers have always been uneasy bedfellows, says Mike Ashley. And whenever one has the upper hand, he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gets out his hammer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and bashes the other one. He says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good luck\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to any landlord who owns highly lucrative land on Bond Street. But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more critical of landlords who have got retailers on contracts where rents can only rise. Those rental agreements are a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153downward death spiral....\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ashley blames successful companies, such as McDonalds and his own Sports Direct chain, which agreed to hefty rent deals in the good times - which everyone else was then moved onto as well. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning into Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hearing on the future of the high street, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve missed... Mike Ashley now concedes that it would be difficult to implement his plan for a new tax on web companies, but insists that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s simple in principle. [Reminder, the idea is a new levy on any retailer who does over 20% of its business online] Q: Many retailers say that the solution is lower business rates and free parking.. Yes, but who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to pay for it, Ashley shoots back. He admits that Sports Direct, which he founded, would be hit in the pocket if the government took up his suggestion of a new tax on e-tailers. Sports Direct won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be pleased with me for my suggestion. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not necessarily a good fix for Sports Direct , but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fantastic fix for the high street. Otherwise, Ashley argues, the high street is destined for destruction: The high street won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make 2030, it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get there, unless you do something really radical and grab the bulls by the horns. Q: How would your plan for a new tax on web retailers work when people buy goods from abroad? In theory you could still tax them, Ashley insists, but agrees that overseas retailers would have to sign up to pay it. You want to get retailers saving the high street, he adds - through a new tax on companies who make most of their money selling online only. High stores have to change, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just about a sea of clothing any more, says Mike Ashley. He suggests retailers need to be much more innovative -- maybe with different opening hours, more self-service tills. In another burst of blue-sky thinking, Mike Ashley suggests high street stores could offer services such as free computer gaming to lure customers in. Retail analyst Neil Saunders isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some video clips of Mike Ashley in action: Mike Ashley now insists that he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sit in an office stroking a white cat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, trying to decide which House of Fraser stores to shut following this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover. Of course I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m worried about the state of the high street, he continues. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not my fault the high street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dying, is it? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not Marks &amp; Spencer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not Debenham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very simple why the high street is dying - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the internet. The internet is killing the high street. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a statement, given Sports Direct has hundreds of stores in the UK, just bought House of Fraser, and also has a stake in Debenhams. But Ashley has a cunning plan -- a new tax on web-only retailers, to encourage them to maintain a high street presence too. Q: You promised to turn House of Fraser into the Harrods of the high street and keep its 59 stores open, but now people are worried that their local store will close. How will you decide which stores to shut? Ashley looks like he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to burst a blood vessel. I never said I would keep 59 stores over. Never, never, never... Everyone knows I set a target of keep 80% of the estate open, the Sports Direct boss insists. What person could keep 59 stores open - beside God? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impossible, it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be done. Even keeping 80% open would be messianic, Ashley indicates, before adding modestly that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not comparing himself to God. Over in the UK parliament, the boss of retailer Sports Direct is testifying to MPs about the future of the high street. But Mike Ashley actually finds himself fending off tough questions about his company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business practices, following the takeover of House of Fraser. First off, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accused of letting customers down - by not refunding orders placed online just before House of Fraser went into administration. Ashley insists that customers received gift cards instead, as SPD got to grips with the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems. Ashley then asked whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be putting House of Fraser staff onto zero-hours contracts, something he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been criticised for using heavily at Sports Direct. Ashley insists that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the vast majority of staff love them\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t commit not to roll them out more heavily at HoF. Getting impassioned, Ashley insists that he needs to keep all options open. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impossible what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re asking. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make sense. The high street has to change what it offers consumers. That means stores might need to open later, and close later, Ashley suggests, telling MPs firmly: Stop trying to showboat... I thought we were here to save the high street. For all Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s optimism, many financial analysts are unconvinced that the US and China can settle their trade dispute in just 90 days. Reforming Beijing treatment of intellectual property will take much longer, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only so much US produce which China can really absorb to help mop up the trade gap. But still, the markets are up. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the immediate threat of a deeper trade war has receded. As Aninda Mitra, senior sovereign analyst at BNY Mellon Investment Management, puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To be sure, underlying problems remain unresolved. It is not as though existing tariffs are on the verge of being unwound. But what Xi has managed to extract from Trump is a stay on any escalation for three months. That interlude should see a stronger effort to set a framework for more talks and quid-pro quos. In the long term, though, achieving full trade d\u00c3\u00a9tente will be tricky: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The best one can hope for in three months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time is a trade and geopolitical deal in which we see a road-map for China to materially raise oil and agriculture imports from the U.S. to cut the bilateral surplus by more than one-half in about 1-2 years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time. That will result in a diversion of Chinese imports from U.S. foes such as Russia and Iran, and possibly Saudi and rest of OPEC. I would imagine the Chinese would also acquiesce to at least some softening of U.S. access to technology and finance in China. Signals to this effect came from Xi suggesting he would not object to the Qualcomm-NXP deal if this were presented again. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The highest priority for the Chinese authorities at the moment is to stabilize their economy. In this context, a 90-day truce should boost local sentiment, and prove more important from a psychological standpoint than recent policy stimulus which was seen as tepid, if not grudging. In another boost to the White House, the US manufacturing sector has posted another month of strong growth. The Institute for Supply Management has reported that new orders, employment levels and activity also jumped last month, while the prices paid by manufacturers fell. This drove ISM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly healthcheck on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector up to 59.3. from 57.7. That level is consistent with strong growth. There are some major names among the big movers on Wall Street today. Aircraft maker Boeing has gained 6%, construction and machinery business Caterpillar is up 4%, and Apple has gained 2.6%. That suggests investors are optimistic that the trade war time-out will yield results. Chipmakers AMD (+7.8%) and NVIDIA (+6%) are also romping ahead. Randeep Somel, Director of Global Equities at M&amp;G, explains why markets are upbeat: The rally seen this morning in equity markets show that the escalating trade disputes are a significant concern to the global growth outlook of the world economy. Whilst its very early days and the process of normalising the trading relationship with China is going to be a complex process \u00e2\u20ac\u201c today, at the very least is a signal that those negotiations can begin. Riskier assets such as base metals and oil producers, as well as the US and European car manufacturers and associated supply chains are likely to show the most positive reflection of the news as they have borne the brunt of the negative headlines for most of this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After a minute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s silence to honour President George H.W Bush, Wall Street has opened, and shares are rallying hard. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 412 points, or 1.6%, to 25,950, in early trading, following upbeat comments from Donald Trump and Stephen Mnuchin in the last couple of hours. The broader S&amp;P 500 index is up 1.5%, while the Nasdaq has gained 2%. Industrial stocks and technology firms are leading the rally, on relief that the US will not be imposing tougher tariffs on China -- at least not for 90 days. Nick Payne, head of global emerging market equities, Merian Global Investors, says investors around the globe are feeling much cheerier. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The 90-day truce in the Sino-US trade war agreed between President Xi and President Trump in Buenos Aires is a welcome development in reducing tension. The very fact that both sides have reopened dialogue is a good step forward and should help sentiment and asset prices in emerging markets. Of course, hard yards lie ahead in reaching a comprehensive agreement, but for now, both sides can claim a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153win\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. US consumers can cheer that their manufactured-in-China favourites like iPhones will not be increasing in price for Christmas. Donald Trump is claiming that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise to cut tariffs on US car imports, from 40%, is a win. However, Beijing only raised the tariff to 40% this summer after the US launched its trade war. A few months earlier, China actually cut the tariff from 25% to 15%. Brad Setser of the Council of Foreign Relations reckons the tariff won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be slashed below 15%. US treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin is also cheering the trade war truce. Speaking on CNBC a few moments ago, Mnuchin says that the 90-day hiatus is a significant step: This is the first time that we have a commitment from them that this will be a real agreement. However...Mnuchin added that Beijing to follow through on its commitments, and open its economy more widely, and fairly, to US companies: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They put on the table an offer of over $1.2 trillion in additional commitments. But the details of that still need to be negotiated. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just about buying things. This is about opening markets to U.S. companies and protecting U.S. technology. Those are very important structural issues to the president.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More optimism from the White House: The US president is awake, and in an effusive mood after his negotiations with Xi Jinping on Saturday night. Donald Trump is tweeting that the trade truce can be a win for both the US and China -- a point analysts have also made today. Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier IM, agrees that Trump and Xi made a breakthrough: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The much anticipated dinner between the two leaders resulted in the first major breakthrough since talks broke down in May. For now, China has agreed to buy more US products, including agricultural goods, and to tackle the trade imbalance concern. President Xi also agreed to designate fentanyl a controlled substance, in a move which was described as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wonderful humanitarian gesture\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in a statement issued by the White House on Saturday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On trade, President Trump said the US will not go ahead with the implementation of a 25% tariff rate scheduled for January. The tariffs on $200 billion worth of products will be left at the 10% rate for the next 90 days while both parties attempt to negotiate structural changes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Signs of rapprochement between China and the US is certainly good news. This does not reflect a definitive shift in the relationship between the US and China, but the opening up of negotiations is certainly a big step in the right direction. Stephen Cooper, Head of Industrial Manufacturing at KPMG UK, is concerned by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK factory data (even though anxious stockpiling drove growth up): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit and supply chain worries have dented November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK manufacturing data, with muted growth and optimism at a 27-month low. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The continued decline in export orders is something manufacturers need to be mindful of, particularly as the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Manufacturing PMI numbers for last month were relatively flat and there are are also wider global demand concerns. With the Eurozone as such an important market for the UK, manufacturers need to prepare carefully for Brexit and ensure they understand every aspect of their supply chains.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy chart showing how the trade dispute intensified this year, as the US and China exchanged tit-for-tat tariffs. Tony Fratto, a former White House deputy press secretary, will believe China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariff cuts when he sees them.... Influential investor Mohamed A. El-Erian of Allianz reckons the US-China trade truce is a quadruple win, at least in the short term. He writes: At the end of almost three hours of what the White House called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly successful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd discussions, the U.S. agreed to refrain for 90 days from implementing additional tariffs on $200 billion of imports from China. In return, China promised to use the time to make progress in three areas of concern to the U.S. and other countries: relaxing an array of nontariff barriers, including joint-venture requirements, that result in forced transfers of technology, operational models and other proprietary information and business practices; combatting intellectual property theft and other cyber interferences; and reducing the bilateral trade surplus by importing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very substantial\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd quantities of certain goods from the U.S. This outcome is a short-term win for both sides, as well as the global economy: China avoids additional tariffs that would further undermine its growth prospects and place even greater pressure on its financial markets. The U.S. defines a time-specific way forward to counter practices that place it at a competitive disadvantage in its bilateral economic relationship with China. And the world economy is in a better place, for now, to avoid a stagflationary trade war. It is also a short-term win for investors and markets: El-Erian adds that the world economy would have suffered if the talks had broken down. However, both sides now have to work \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cooperatively\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to turn this truce into a long-term deal. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a danger that the new 90-day deadline creates fresh political pressures, which will weigh on markets in early 2019. The trade war time-out may come too late for some American farmers. As this chart shows, soybean exports from the US to China usually peak in October and November, but not this year due to the trade dispute. Wang Cun, director of the China Automobile Dealers Association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s import committee, has welcomed the suggestion that car tariffs will be cut. Wang told reporters in Beijing that: If they cancel the extra 25 percent tariff on US-made cars, then we will see positive signs for imported cars,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wall Street is on track for a big jump when trading begins in three and a half hours. The Dow Jones is currently up 2%, or 500 points, in the futures market. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chunky move, given the US and China have only agreed a 90-day truce....and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been silence from Beijing about exactly what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve agreed too.... Shares in European car companies are surging, after Donald Trump tweeted that China has agreed to cut tariffs on auto imports. Daimler are leading the pack, up 7%, in Germany followed by BMW (+6.6%) and Volkswagen (+4%). They all have factories in the US, so should benefit from a cooling in trade war tensions. Tire maker Continental is up 3.5%. Shares in fashion chain Ted Baker have plunged by 13% this morning after the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder was accused of forcing staff into hugs, massages and other inappropriate conduct. My colleagues Sarah Butler and Jasper Jolly reported yesterday that current and former Ted Baker staff had accused Ray Kelvin of harassment. They wrote: More than 60 current or former staff are understood to have come forward to the employee campaigning platform Organise with complaints about Kelvin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged behaviour, including kissing ears and giving unwanted hugs and shoulder massages. Organise published a petition, signed by more than 1,000 people, calling for an end to forced hugging, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is part of a culture that leaves harassment unchallenged.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It also calls for new procedures allowing employees to report harassment to an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153independent, external body\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Ted Baker says it will investigate the case, adding: Hugs have become part of Ted Baker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s culture, but are absolutely not insisted upon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares in the company have fallen to \u00c2\u00a315.86 (from \u00c2\u00a318.26), their lowest level since June 2013. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing was unexpectedly strong last month, as companies rush to stockpile products ahead of a Brexit crisis. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK factory PMI, which measures activity in the sector, has jumped to 53.1 for November, up from October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 27-month low of 51.1. Most of the demand came from domestic customers amid a rush to fill inventories with important products and components, in case of trade disruption after Brexit. But the export picture is darker -- new orders from overseas shrank for the second straight month in November, the first back-to-back contraction since early-2016. Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, points out that manufacturers are still quite pessimistic. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While demand from the domestic market was a positive spur, in some cases as clients built up stocks in response to Brexit and other supply-chain uncertainties, manufacturers also reported a further decrease in new export business as slower global economic growth and Brexit worries took a bite out of foreign demand. Brexit worries also increasingly dominated the outlook for the sector. Although still forecasting growth for the year ahead, manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 confidence fell to its lowest ebb since August 2016.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Overnight, manufacturing group EEF also reported that UK manufacturers have been working hard, stockpiling products ahead a possible cliff-edge Brexit. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector slowed last month. Data firm Markit reports that its eurozone manufacturing PMI fell to 51.8 last month, down from 52 in October. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the weakest growth since August 2016, and close to the 50-point mark that shows stagnation. Italy and France were the worst-performing regions: Netherlands 56.1: 25-month low Austria 54.9: 2-month high Ireland 55.4: 2-month high Greece 54.0: 6-month high Spain 52.6: 3-month high Germany 51.8 (flash: 51.6) 31-month low France 50.8 (flash: 50.7) 26-month low Italy 48.6: 47-month low On the upside, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than the initial \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 estimate released mid-way through the month (51.5). UBS analyst Paul Donovan suggests investors shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too excited about the US-China trade truce. US President Trump may, metaphorically, be claiming to have a tweet on Twitter that promises trade peace in our time. The reality of the US-China handshake deal at the G20 is not that secure. The deal looks to be a variation on the Juncker-Trump EU handshake deal. City traders often talk about a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSanta Rally\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, in which shares end the year with solid gains. And this year, Santa may be coming early.... as the Trump-Xi truce boosts confidence across the financial markets. Neil Wilson of Markets.com explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153December is starting with a bang, with a de-escalation in Sino-US tensions positive for risk. Donald Trump tweeted yesterday that China \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwill reduce and remove\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tariffs on US auto imports, amid signs of progress on trade talks. It follows a more positive G20 meeting. The US will delay for 90 days any increase in tariffs to enable talks to take place. The US had planned to raise its 10% tariff on $200bn of Chinese goods to 25% on January 1st. Some be concerned that there was no official word from China in relation to auto tariffs, and that the two sides are saying different things about the meeting. European stock markets are a sea of green this morning, with gains across the board. In London, nearly every share is up in Mayank Mishra, global macro strategist at Standard Chartered, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 90-days truce and both U.S. and China still need to sort out multiple issues in this period, from markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perspective getting past the event risk with a positive outcome and de-escalation of tensions is clearly positive for risk sentiment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Progress! Mining stocks are surging sharply in London too. Anglo American, Glencore and BHP Group have all gained at least 6% this morning, on the prospect of higher demand for iron ore, copper and coal. Boom! Shares in London have surged to a two-week high at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 has jumped by 1.5%, or 102 points, to 7,082, as the US-China trade truce cheers investors. Other European markets are also higher, with France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC up 2%. Carmakers are among the top risers, following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that China will drop auto tariffs. Soybeans prices are moving sharply this morning, on relief that Washington and Beijing have backed away from a deeper trade war. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that China will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immediately\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd start buying more US products has driven soybean prices up by 3% on the Chicago futures market. However, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve dropped in China -- as traders anticipate a surge in supplies from America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s farmers. Bloomberg has more details: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The price spike in Chicago soybeans and the fall in Dalian is a normal market reaction to the U.S.-China trade truce because China has agreed to start buying agricultural products from American farmers immediately,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Monica Tu, an analyst at researcher Shanghai JC Intelligence Co. Still, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the market is very concerned about the outcome of further negotiations,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and whether there will be big purchases in the next few weeks, she said. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency is strengthening, on relief that America has decided not to hike tariffs on Chinese imports at the start of January. The yuan has jumped by 1% against the US dollar, to \u00c2\u00a56.88 to $1. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from \u00c2\u00a56.954 on Friday night, before the G20 summit got up to speed. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, What was delivered over the dinner was not a breakthrough, neither a long-term solution for the ongoing trade war between the largest two economies, but a 90-day window to improve relations. Introduction of new tariffs are now shelved, and trade talks will intensify over the next three months. This outcome seems to be an optimistic one from the two leaders and more than what was priced into markets beforehand, meaning that this is enough to boost sentiment and risk-on trade. But, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget the White House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 90-day deadline.... Chinese newspapers have cheered the truce hammered out between Trump and Xi at the G20 leaders meeting. The Global Times called the deal a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153momentous step forward\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daily dubbed it an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153important consensus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, China has NOT backed up the White House claim that the ceasefire will only last for 90 days, unless a permanent trade deal is reached. As CNBC explains: Official online statements about Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s briefing on the meeting did not discuss the technology transfers or the 90-day condition. The timeframe and details on areas of disagreement also did not appear in online reports from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state news agency Xinhua, People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daily \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the official Communist Party paper \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and CGTN \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the English-language version of state broadcaster CCTV. The articles did note the U.S. and China agreed to work towards mutual benefits, and generally indicated Beijing would increase purchases of U.S. goods. The state media also said the two parties discussed North Korea denuclearization. The Chinese press also said Trump upheld a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One-China Policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd regarding Taiwan \u00e2\u20ac\u201d something not mentioned in the White House statement. Sue Trinh of Royal Bank of Canada is cautious about this trade truce -- pointing out that the US and China haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t released a joint statement on what was agreed. But she also believes this is a win for president Trump: Trade wars need to be framed in terms of who hurts the least and see the G20 meeting as a stronger win for the US. China buys 3 months before tariffs on $200bn in goods rise to 25% while the US knows it will have a deal with sizeable China concessions in 90 days, or go ahead with tariffs having cleared the backlog of harvested crops from the agri sector. Tai Hui, chief market strategist for Asia Pacific at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, is also wary, saying: The negotiation is likely to remain challenging given the competition in a number of areas, especially technological development between the two countries. 90 days is not a very long to resolve these differences. The good news is that this truce should be seen as Washington recognising the potential damage on the U.S. economy if tariffs escalate further. We see an ongoing dialogue between the two sides to be an important catalyst for Asian markets to recover lost ground this year, alongside steady global growth and a weaker US dollar.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global stock markets are rallying today on relief that America and China have pulled back from escalating their trade war. In one of the most eagerly awaited dinner dates in a while, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping struck a truce at the end of the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires. After the dinner, Trump declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was an amazing and productive meeting with unlimited possibilities for both the United States and China. It is my great honor to be working with President Xi.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, the agreement is light on detail. We know that America has deferred its plan to raise the tariff on $200bn of Chinese imports from 10% to 25%, for 90 days (it was scheduled for 1 January). This kicks the can down the road a little, teeing up more tense talks before the end of March. In return, China has apparently agreed to purchase a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very substantial\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd amount of US goods - including farm, energy and industrial products. That would help narrow the massive trade gap between the two countries. Trump has declared that China is also removing tariffs on US car imports -- which would be a win for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auto sector However, the two sides will now face fraught talks over intellectual property protections, and the threat that the truce could break down at an time. Still, investors are delighted to hear peace ring out. Asian markets have surged overnight, with China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite jumping by 2.5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its biggest one-day gain in a month. Australia has gained 1.8%, and Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei is 1% higher. Stephen Innes of trading firm OANDA says: With the immense weight of the global supply chain dynamic network on their shoulder, a tariff detente has emerged after a highly anticipated dinner. Both Presidents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 XI and Trump have agreed to put on hold the menacing tariff increases expected to get imposed January 1, marking a significant de-escalation in trade tensions between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two biggest economies. Thankfully, for risk sentiment, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dinner date of the decade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ended with a sense of harmony rather than trade war discord. European markets are going to join the party too, and are expected to gain almost 2% at the open.... Also coming up today... We find out how the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories fared in November, when the latest surveys of purchasing managers are released. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably confirm that the eurozone has slowed sharply, while the US economy is more robust.

FTSE, European gauges and Dow futures were also not spared with the heavily export-oriented DAX losing 1.5%.</p> <p>Tech stocks in Asia were the hardest hit, in particular Samsung, Tokyo Electron, TDK and Tencent, pulling down Asian indexes. The US already has a low-key conflict simmering with the Chinese tech giant and has, alongside New Zealand, already blocked Huawei from selling their 5G technology in the country for fear that it could be used for malicious purposes. The latest arrest will be seen as a heavy slap in the face in China as the arrested executive, Meng Wanzhou, is the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CFO and the daughter of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder.

Ironically, Mrs May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chances could now lie in the hands of the Brexiteers. If they realise the game for a hard Brexit is up, they might prefer the deal to the other options of a softer Brexit or no Brexit at all. But this is a long shot.

That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a drop of just 0.3% - barely worth mentioning on a normal day. The tech-focused Nasdaq actually closed 0.4% higher.

Wall Street was on course for a second day of heavy losses following news of the detention of Meng Wanzhou, chief global finance officer for the Chinese telecoms company Huawei by Canadian authorities and the request by the US for her extradition to face reported cyber espionage and sanction-breaking charges. Reports of Wanzhou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demand for her release \u00e2\u20ac\u201c led to falls of 2% in the Shanghai and Tokyo markets overnight and the sell-off spread to Europe, where all the main bourses saw losses in their main indices of more than 3%.

Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full piece: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of the size and scale of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market selloff - big losses across Europe and the America.... ..., after Asia was rocked by the arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Meng Wanzhou. Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan, believes the US-China trade dispute is the primary issue hurting markets. He told CNBC that investors are worried about how bad the situation will get [a good question, now that Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CFO is facing extradition to the US]. CNBC explains: The U.S. under the Trump administration has engaged in an escalating trade war with China, though the two sides are talking and set a 90 day time frame from Dec. 1 to get an agreement. Dimon called it a trade \u00e2\u20ac\u0153skirmish.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But it is forcing business leaders to find new supply lines, rethink investments or hold off on investments. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those things are just causing uncertainty, which causes volatility.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With one hour to go until Wall Street closes for the day, the Dow Jones industrial average is solidly in the red. The Dow is down 350 points - with almost every share still down today. Boeing and JP Morgan lead the fallers Ian King, Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business editor, reckon president Trump must take responsibility for the falling stock markets. He writes that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war with China has alarmed investors, and weakened shares: Mr Trump, who tweeted regularly when the stock market was breaking new records earlier this year, has had very little to say about these recent falls. However, if he is being honest with himself, he will know he is to blame. US equities were euphoric earlier this year on the back of his corporate tax cuts. However, the sugar rush has now worn off and, in the eyes of company executives, good Trump who cut taxes for companies has been replaced by bad Trump, who erects tariffs and introduces other protectionist measures. So while there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still time for the traditional \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSanta rally\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the run-up to Christmas, investors shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bank on it this year..... Back in New York, shares are bouncing back from their earlier lows. The Dow is now only down 330 points, or 1.3% -- a chunky fall, but less severe than the 700-point slump earlier. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning into another volatile day.... Fears of a global downturn have hit markets today, says Patrick Schaffer, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market seems right now to be focused on increased risks for a 2020 recession. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very hard market to buy when you see really strong signals that we are indeed late (in the economic) cycle.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The market mayhem may bring some relief to hard-pressed US consumers. The odds of American interest rates being hiked in 2019 have fallen sharply. The big picture is that most global stock markets have lost ground this year. The FTSE 100 was already down more than 10% since the start of January, before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout. The German DAX was down 16%, while China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market has plunged by a fifth. America has done better, mainly due to the impact of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts (which have boosted corporate profits). Sky News have a good take on the selloff: A global share sell-off has seen the FTSE 100 slump on the same scale as the day after the Brexit referendum in 2016. The decline of 3.15%, or 218 points - wiping \u00c2\u00a356bn off the value of the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constituent companies - came after the arrest of a top Chinese executive on behalf of the US triggered renewed fears of a trade war. That helped unleash simmering worries about a broad cocktail of worldwide tensions, including a potential recession in the US, turning trading screens red from New York and London to Paris and Frankfurt. A slide in the oil price - with Brent crude falling by more than 3% to less than $60 a barrel - also weighed on sentiment. Back in New York, Wall Street continues to suffer its own day of losses. The Dow Jones industrial average is currently down 500-ish points, or 2%, at 24,517. That means the benchmark index has lost all its gains for 2018. The broader S&amp;P 500 index has shed 1.5%, which means it is also in the red for 2018. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off also means the FTSE 100 is actually below its level on 30th December 1999, the final day of the last millennium. However, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit more to it than that. For starters, the FTSE 100 is still almost double its nadir in March 2009, when the financial crisis had driven Britain into recession. Secondly, the raw points value of the Footsie doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t include the dividends paid out to shareholders from company profits. According to Laith Khalaf of financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d actually have doubled your money if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d invested at the end of the dot-com boom. He also puts some of the blame for the losses on the Brexit crisis.... Today, sentiment is vastly different from the end of the 1990s. Animal spirits were out of control in 1999, which led to the substantial overvaluation of the UK stock market. Now the Footsie is desperately unloved because Brexit means many investors want to put a good-sized bargepole between themselves and the UK stock market. Despite the headline value of the FTSE 100 today being close to its 1999 peak, investors in the UK stock market are putting money to work at a much cheaper level, once you take company profits into account. In 1999 the UK stock market was valued at 27 times earnings, today it stands at around 15 times earnings. While in the short term it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entirely plausible the UK market could fall further, a lower valuation suggests better long term returns are on offer. Mohamed El-Erian of Allianz reckons that shares took a dive today as investors raced to sell riskier assets, fearing more turmoil ahead. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says the shock arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CFO was a big factor behind today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market meltdown. For China the Huawei arrest will add insult to injury as the arrested executive, Meng Wangzhou, is not only the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CFO but also the Huawei founder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daughter and the prospective company successor and concerns are growing that the country could retaliate with arrests of US executives. Although Meng Wangzhou was detained in Canada on suspicions of breaching sanctions against Iran the arrest highlights a different set of tensions between the US and China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the issue of cybersecurity. The US has long suspected Huawei of foul play in cybersecurity and has restricted the sale of its 5G equipment in the US for fears that it might be used for dubious purposes. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off has driven the FTSE 100 index down to its lowest close in over two years. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, there are three reasons why markets are falling sharply today. 1) News broke last night that the chief financial officer of one of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest companies, Meng Wanzhou of Huawei, has been arrested in Canada. Meng faces extradition to the US, reportedly on charges of cyber-espionage and breaking sanctions preventing trade with Iran. Her shock detention has panicked investors, who fear that it will destabilise negotiations between the US and China over trade policies. 2) Global slowdown fears are growing. Economic data this week has shown that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies have slowed, while the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector also ran out of steam last month. 3) Ructions in the bond markets. Nervous investors are now demanding a greater return for buying short-term US government debt, rather than longer dated. This \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcyield curve inversion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 could be a sign that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is heading for recession. In points terms, the FTSE 100 has suffered its biggest drop in over three years. A reminder that all European markets suffered a bad day: Nearly every company on the FTSE 100 fell today, apart from precious metals producers (who benefitted from a dash into gold and silver). Energy firms slumped by 4.5%, mining companies fell 4%, banks lost 3.9%, and industrial groups lost 2.7%. After a day of wild selling, and deepening losses, London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has just posted its biggest one-day loss since the UK voted to leave the European Union. The FTSE 100 has just closed down 217 points, a fall of 3.15%, at 6704. That matches the 3.15% decline suffered in the aftermath of the EU referendum, on 24 June 2016. By my maths, it wipes \u00c2\u00a356bn off the value of the companies on the Footsie. More to follow! European stock markets have suffered their worst day since Britain voted to leave the EU. The Stoxx 600 index, which includes Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest stocks, has just closed for the night, down 3.3%. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has provisionally closed down 3.9%, which I think puts it in an official bear market (down more than a fifth on its record high). Amid panicky selling, the French CAC has lost 3.7% and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX shed 3.2%. The selloff on Wall Street is deepening, fast. The Dow has now tumbled by 760 points, as the rout accelerates. Each of the 30 members of the Dow is in the red. Aircraft-maker Boeing has lost 6.6%, chemicals firm DowDuPont has lost 4.4%, investment bank JP Morgan has dropped by 3.8% and construction equipment maker Caterpillar has lost 3.3%. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has just endured one of its worst days in several years.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market mayhem: Equity markets suffered severe losses as investors are worried the relationship between the US and China has been strained by the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the CFO of Huawei. The Chinese businesswomen faces possible extradition to the US as the company is alleged to have breached sanctions in relation to Iran. The US-China relationship was moving in the right direction after the G20 summit, and now dealers feel all the good work could be undone. It is a broad based sell-off that we are seeing in London, as mining, energy, financial and consumer stocks are all lower. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the scene on the New York stock exchange today, as traders reel from another heavy sell-off: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no respite on Wall Street. Instead, the Dow is now down by 525 points, or 2.1%. Over in Frankfurt, the DAX index has slumped by over 3%. That takes the index of leading German companies into a full-blown bear market, more than 20% below its recent peak. Carmaker Daimler is the biggest faller, down 5.3%. Industrial giant Thyssenkrupp have lost 4.5% and pharmaceuticals company Bayer has lost 3.6%. They would all be big casualties from a deep global trade war. Back in London, shares are hitting new two-year lows. The FTSE 100 index has now slumped by 2.8%, or 196 points, to 6724. Mining giant Antofagasta has now slumped by 7%, reflecting concerns that the US-China trade truce may not hold. Financial stocks such as Prudential(-6.7%), Schroders (-5.7%), Legal &amp; General (-4.8%) and Royal Bank of Scotland (-4%) are also among the top fallers. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks are also being pummelled in early trading, on fears of an economic slowdown. Bank of America has shed 4%, while JP Morgan has lost over 3%. Traders are alarmed by recent moves in the US bond market. The yield, or interest rate, on US two-year bonds has risen above the yields on longer-dated five-year bonds. Technically, that means the yield curve has \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinverted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and that investors are demanding a higher interest rate to hold short-dated bonds. Why does THAT matter? Because it suggests there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a greater risk that the US economy is heading towards a recession (making shorter-dated bonds riskier). Now, the curve is only just inverted. According to my Reuters machine, the two-year Treasury bills are yielding 2.713%, while 5-year Treasuries are yielding 2.708%. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough to worry Wall Street, who remember that an inverted yield curve has preceded a downturn in the past... Shares in US semiconductor-makers are leading the selloff on Wall Street. Broadcom, Micron, Intel and AMD are all in the red; they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d suffer badly if the US-China trade dispute intensifies, as so many tech products are assembled in Chinese factories. Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have fallen 2%.... and the smaller tech firms which supply chips and other components for iPads, iPhones and Macs are also suffering. DING DING! The Wall Street opening bell is being rung, kicking off what could be a brutal trading session. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 1.85%, or 466 points, to 24,560. The S&amp;P 500 (a broader measure of US stocks) is also down 1.7%, meaning it is now in the red for 2018. The tech-focused Nasdaq has lost almost 2%, as traders fear that the arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CFO will hurt the technology sector, and trigger a deeper trade war between the US and China. More to follow! Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities, says traders need their best tin hats today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The indices are headed for another tumble as the previous steep sell-off extends itself on a host of negative news. The arrest of Huawei CFO is putting in doubt the trade truce between the U.S. and China.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Unless Wall Street traders recover their nerve very quickly, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re heading into a hefty selloff at the open. The Dow Jones industrial average is expected to drop by more than more than 1.5%, which would be 400 point-plus plunge. Time for a a quick catch-up on the markets, as we brace for a bruising Wall Street open in under 30 minute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is still wallowing at a two-year low, down 172 points or 2.5% at 6748. The German DAX and the French CAC are both also down 2.5%, dragging the Europe-wide Stoxx 600 down to its own two-year low. That follows the selloff in Asia, which saw China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite index slide by 2%. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, blames the arrest of Huwaei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Financial Officer, Meng Wanzhou. This is likely to escalate the tense relationship between China and the US further. Both tech and automotive stocks have been the biggest fallers - the events emphasise the vulnerability of markets to any issues, particularly political ones, involving the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. This has sent shockwaves not only across European stock markets but around the world with Asia the worst affected as investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 early optimism about the weekend developments in trade talks dissipates. This is likely to set up a turbulent end to the year for markets and will leave investors anxiously awaiting the next development.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade gap with China has hit a record high; news that may send Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blood pressure rising too. According to the Commerce Department, the deficit swelled by 1.7% last month to $55.5bn, the highest since October 2008. The gap was driven by a surge in imports and a drop in soybean exports (which have been hit by the trade war.) This means that despite (or indeed thanks to) Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade gap has expanded for the last five months. Crucially, the goods trade deficit with China surged 7.1% to a record $43.1bn. So much for Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trade wars are good, and easy to win\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd...... The latest US jobs data isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too encouraging. American companies hired 179,000 new workers last month, according to payroll firm ADP. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 16,000 fewer than expected, and may show that the US labor market has peaked. How big is Meng Wanzhou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest? Massive, argues Politico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Marty Kady: Brad Bechtel of US investment bank Jefferies thinks Meng Wanzhou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest could trigger a new front in the US-China trade war. He writes: Everyone is focused on the Hauwei CFO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest in Canada on allegations that Hauwei violated Iran sanctions. The arrest was ordered by the US and extradition is expected. Concern of course that the arrest will damage the fragile trade truce between the two nations. If anything it tells you the administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s willingness to continue to toe the hard line on this issue and to not back down. It leads me to believe we will have a rocky road on this for the next few months and that the game has not yet begun. This was my initial reaction after the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G20 and the Trump / Xi dinner and last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price action and reaction to the arrest confirms it. The fireworks will continue straight through our winter time. Shortly after news of Mang Wanzhou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock arrest broke, China announced that it will immediately start implementing its side of the trade truce with America. Commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng told reporters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China will immediately implement the consensus both sides already reached on agricultural products, energy, autos and other specific items.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gao added that two sides would also discuss intellectual property protection, technology cooperation, market access and fair trade. These measures were agreed between president Trump and President Xi on Saturday night, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been no official joint announcement of what they actually are. More here: China expert George Magnus has tweeted about why the arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief financial officer last weekend matters: The European technology sector has slumped by 3.3% today, helping to drag markets down to two-year lows. The arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Meng Wanzhou is fuelling fears that the US-China trade war will flare up again. Any additional tariffs on Chinese exports would hurt tech companies -- last week, Donald Trump mused about slapping new tariffs on iPhones, for example. Energy shares are down 3.2%, reflecting the drop in the oil price as Opec ministers wrestle in Vienna. Mining stocks have dropped by 3% - demand for iron ore, copper, nickel and other commodities will be hit if the global economy stumbles over a trade war. Banks are down 2.7% on average -- they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d incur more bad debts in a global recession. Industrial companies have lost 2.7%, reflecting worries that order books could shrivel in a trade war. America is waking up to the news that markets are sliding.... The sell-off is turning into a full-blown slump! European stocks have plunged to their lowest level since December 2016, as investors become increasingly panicky. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 continues to bear a lot of damage - down around 2.5% this morning at its lowest level since December 2016. The German DAX has shed 2.4%, with France, Italy and Spain also under the cosh. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the damage: There are several reasons for the slump: 1) The shock arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief financial officer could trigger a new clash in the US-China trade war, undermining hopes of a peace deal. Fiona Cincotta of City Index explains: Asian markets were knocked sideways by the arrest of a senior Huawei official in Canada as the move sparked fears that tensions between the US and China would yet again intensify. FTSE, European gauges and Dow futures were also not spared with the heavily export-oriented DAX losing 1.5%. Tech stocks in Asia were the hardest hit, in particular Samsung, Tokyo Electron, TDK and Tencent, pulling down Asian indexes. The US already has a low-key conflict simmering with the Chinese tech giant and has, alongside New Zealand, already blocked Huawei from selling their 5G technology in the country for fear that it could be used for malicious purposes. The latest arrest will be seen as a heavy slap in the face in China as the arrested executive, Meng Wanzhou, is the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CFO and the daughter of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder. She was detained in Canada and could end up being extradited to the US as the company is suspected of breaching sanctions against Iran. 2) The Brexit crisis is alarming the City, as Theresa May struggles to persuade MPs to back her withdrawal agreement. Kallum Pickering of Berenberg Bank says: For different reasons, a majority of MPs in parliament seem set to vote down Mrs May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal on the first attempt. With the lower risk of a hard Brexit, Conservative Remainers might feel less compelled now to back the deal in a second vote. Ironically, Mrs May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chances could now lie in the hands of the Brexiteers. If they realise the game for a hard Brexit is up, they might prefer the deal to the other options of a softer Brexit or no Brexit at all. But this is a long shot. We cut the chances for Mrs May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal to 25% from 45%. We now see: a 20% chance that the UK will sign up to the EU customs union and single market for goods (up from 10%); a 20% chance that the UK will remain in the European Economic Area via entry into the European Free Trade Association (the Norway option, up from 12.5%); and a 25% chance that Brexit is reversed (up from 12.5%) 3) The oil price is suddenly slumping, as Opec ministers meet in Vienna today. City traders are losing confidence that Opec will agree a sharp output cut to prop up crude prices. This has sent Brent crude slumping by 5% to below $59 per barrel. Wall Street is heading for heavy losses in four hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is currently expected to plunge by around 500 points, adding to its 800-point lurch on Tuesday (Wall Street was closed yesterday). Anxiety over Brexit is pushing shares down, compounding trade war fears, says Vincent-Fre\u00c4\u203ade\u00c4\u203aric Mivelaz of Swissquote Bank. Asian shares continue down, after Canadian authorities confirmed the arrest of Huawei Technologies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 CFO Wanzhou Meng on charges of violating the USA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sanctions on exports to Iran. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei 225 dropped by 1.91% while Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CSI 300 declined 2.47% and 2.16%, their most in two weeks. European shares are also dropping, as the UK Parliament mutinies over the Prime Minister May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit plan. The Euro Stoxx 600 has hit a 2-year low while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC 40 slid 1.90% and 1.85%. Trade discussions between the USA and China officially started this week and are expected to continue for the coming 3 months. Investors are worried, especially about semiconductor manufacturers being hard hit. The FTSE 250 index, which contains smaller, UK-focused companies, is also taking a bath. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently on track for its biggest one-day fall since the rout after the EU referendum - currently down 460 points, or 2.5%, at 17809. This takes the FTSE 200 down to its lowest level since December 2016. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning into a rout in London. The FTSE 100 has now slumped by 176 points, or 2.5% -- on track for its worst daily performance since February! Although Meng Wanzhou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest is a shock, Huawei has been facing growing criticism for several years. The Financial Times points out that the US intelligence services have been concerned about the security implications of using Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardware: Huawei has been in the sights of US security officials, and the latest move comes as the Trump administration takes an aggressive stance towards China. In a speech in October, Mike Pence, the US vice-president, put China on notice that Mr Trump was prepared to take a harder stance against Beijing than his predecessors. The Shenzhen-based group has long been a lightning rod for concern about corporate espionage and cyber security. Western intelligence officials worry that reliance on Huawei by other countries could allow China to penetrate foreign telecom networks. Huawei has repeatedly denied having any connection to the Chinese security services or military, insisting it is a privately owned company. But it has struggled to erase doubts because [founder] Mr Ren is a former People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Liberation Army officer. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security service also have concerns. On Monday the head of MI6 said ministers had to decide whether to use Huawei in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new 5G networks. BT has already decided to removing Huawei equipment from key areas of its 4G network, as part of an infrastructure overhaul. Emerging economy stock markets are having a particularly bad week: Worries over global economic growth, rising interest rates and the US/China trade war are all driving markets down, says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. He agrees that the arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CFO has alarmed investors, who fear it will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stir up tensions between China and the US.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nearly every share on the FTSE 100 is down -- apart from Imperial Brands, British American Tobacco, Diageo, Severn Trent and National Grid. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All these are considered to be defensive stocks, offering goods and services people would buy regardless of economic conditions. Diageo is perhaps an exception as an alcohol seller yet investors often turn to large, robust business in times of strife. That may also explain why Unilever and Compass declined much less than the broader market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fallers were led by mining stocks which are always sensitive to any fears over the global economy and China. This chart shows how the FTSE 100 is back below its level at the end of the last millennium, just before the dot-com boom ended. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the full story, of course, as this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show the dividends paid out in the last 18 years. But even then, the picture isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sparkling - especially once you look in dollar terms: The selloff in London is gathering pace! The FTSE 100 has now shed 1.5%, or 110 points, leaving it firmly slumped at a two-year low. Most stocks are down, with financial stocks, miners and energy company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losing the most. Industrial group Melrose is the biggest faller, with major mining companies such as Glencore and Antofagasta close behind. Stocks are down across Europe too. The Stoxx 600 index has hit a six-week low, dragged down by technology stocks and car makers (who would both suffer from a US-China war). The City is reeling from the fallout following the arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Meng Wanzhou, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx: Jeez it has been an intense week for US-China relations. The post-G20 trade truce is starting to feel like a distant memory, with Tariff Man Donald Trump, and now the arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Meng Wanzhou, serving to undermine whatever (na\u00c3\u00afve) hopes of progress had built up on Monday. Wanzhou, global chief financial officer of telecoms equipment at the Shenzen-based smartphone firm and daughter of its founder, was detained in Canada last Saturday and is now facing extradition to the USA, relating to an investigation into whether or not she violated sanctions against Iran. Ouch! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has fallen by over 80 points at the start of trading, a drop of 1.2%. That takes the blue-chip index of top shares in the City down to 6840 points, its lowest level in two years. The arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Meng Wanzhou has spooked traders, who are already unsettled by Brexit uncertainty, and the prospect that the global economy is slowing. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets writes: The latest bout of anxiety stems from the arrest and planned extradition from Canada to the US of the CFO (and founder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daughter) of Chinese telecom giant Huawei, on allegations of breaching Iran sanctions and suspicions of cyber-espionage. Having swung between optimism and scepticism about a US-China trade war truce through February, and we note Chinese diplomats making positive noise overnight (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153friendly and candid atmosphere\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between Xi and Trump), traders are understandably cautious. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses also take the FTSE 100 below its level at the end of the last millennium! (when the FTSE 100 closed at 6,930 points). Huawei is insisting on Meng Wanzhou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s release, insisting they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t away of any misconduct: Technology stocks have been hit particularly hard in Asia today. In Hong Kong, Tencent was off more than 4%, while AAC and Sunny Optical each fell around 6%. South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Samsung Electronics shed 2%. Meng Wanzhou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest will probably exacerbate tensions between the US and China, my colleague Lily Kuo reports: US authorities have been investigating Huawei since at least 2016 for allegedly shipping US-origin products to Iran and other countries in violation of US export and sanctions laws, sources told Reuters in April. Huawei, one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest makers of telecommunications network equipment, said in a statement that Meng had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153temporarily detained\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and faced unspecified allegations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the Eastern district of New York. The company said it had complied with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all applicable laws and regulations where it operates,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd including sanction laws. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There has been very little information provided to Huawei on the specific allegations. Huawei is not aware of any misconduct by Ms. Meng,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Guo Ping, rotating CEO of the company said in a statement posted on his Wechat account on Thursday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The company believes the Canadian and US legal systems will ultimately reach a just conclusion,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A chilly wave of fear is rippling through the markets today, after a leading Chinese executive was arrested in Canada. Meng Wanzhou, the global chief financial officer of telecoms equipment Huawei, is facing extradition to the US -- reportedly to face charges of violating sanctions against Iran. The arrest of Meng -- who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the daughter of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder -- has rocked Asia-Pacific markets, and is likely to spark fresh jitters in Europe and the US. It threatens to reignite the trade war clashes between Washington and Beijing, just days after the two country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaders agreed a truce. The Chinese stock market has slumped by 2%, and there are heavy losses in Tokyo and Hong Kong too: Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says sentiment has been \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsmashed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 this morning. Asian markets and US futures plummeted overnight as news broke that Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CFO had been arrested in Canada to be extradited back to the US. The CFO, Wanzhou Meng, was arrested for allegedly breaching Iran sanctions. China criticized the US and Canada for the arrest, demanding her immediate release. Traders have quickly moved out of riskier assets reflecting nerves that the arrest is likely to escalate tensions between the US and China once again. The timing is fascinating, incidentally. Meng was apparently arrested 1 December, the very day that Donald Trump and Xi Jinping were enjoying dinner together at the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires. Investors will fear that the shock detention of such a significant business figure could easily anger the Chinese government, and potentially scupper plans to buy more US goods. Also coming up today Oil ministers are gathering in Vienna for an Opec meeting, where the cartel is widely expected to agree a production cut. A chunky reduction to output might push oil prices higher....on the other hand, investors may already have priced it in! Brent crude is trading around $61 per barrel this morning, around 20% lower than two months ago. Donald Trump has already chipped in: Plus, we get new manufacturing and employment data from the US. The agenda 9am GMT: Opec meeting scheduled to begin 1.30pm GMT: US weekly jobless figures 3pm GMT: US factory orders",

Leisure &amp; hospitality added only 15,000, however, and education &amp; health added only 34,000. Both below normal. State governments also shed 13,000 employees.</p> <p>The unemployment rate was unchanged at only 3.7% last month, as a 233,000 gain in the household survey measure of employment more than offset a 133,000 increase in the labour force. That said, the broader U6 measure of unemployment did rebound to 7.6%, from 7.4%. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.2% m/m in November, with the annual growth rate unchanged at 3.1%.</p> <p>Overall, employment growth may be fading a little from the unsustainable pace in the first half of this year, but there is nothing here to unduly worry the Fed or prevent it from hiking interest rates at this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FOMC meeting.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c0a80b3e4b01d1e859e6c5a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-12-07T14:21:37.353Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The European stock markets are all pushing higher, clawing back more of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses.</strong></p> <p>Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is leading the way, up almost 2%, with solid gains on Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX (0.8%) and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC (+1.5%).</p> <p>This seems to confirm that traders are relieved that the US economy is still creating jobs, but not so rapidly to force several interest rate hikes in 2019.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8fc6e7232a00edf5e971c01341be1e530134c6a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fc6e7232a00edf5e971c01341be1e530134c6a1/0_0_851_253/500.jpg\" alt=\"European stock markets\" width=\"500\" height=\"149\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">European stock markets</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MeetingRoom/Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c0a7d6ce4b01d1e859e6c39\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-12-07T14:04:45.730Z\">2.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Matt Weller of Faraday Investment Research says:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MWellerFX/status/1071041165087129600\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">See my Top 3 Takeaways from today&#39;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NFP</a> report: <a href=\"https://t.co/waPFOGJ2Cj\">pic.twitter.com/waPFOGJ2Cj</a></p>&mdash; Matt Weller CFA, CMT (@MWellerFX) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MWellerFX/status/1071041165087129600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 7, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c0a7cb7e4b0b950d12f8447\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-12-07T14:02:14.417Z\">2.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>America created tens of thousands more jobs in transportation and warehousing last month, as online shopping continued to expand.</strong></p> <p>Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll report shows that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Employment in transportation and warehousing rose by 25,000 in November</p> <p>Job gains occurred in couriers and messengers (+10,000) and in warehousing and storage (+6,000).

                "bodyText":"And finally.... Wall Street can put a brutal week behind it, as the closing bell rings. The Dow Jones industrial average has ended the day down 559 points, a drop of 2.2%. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2.3% Technology stocks led the rout, with Microsoft down 4%, Intel losing 3.75%, Cisco off 3.7%, IBM losing 3.6% and Apple shedding 3.3% This knocked Nasdaq down by over 3%. All three indices have just suffered their worst week since March, down at least 4.5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good illustration of the worry that swept Wall Street this week, as investors fretted about a slowing economy and heightening trade war fears. Next week could be dramatic too, with the Huawei case overshadowing markets and Brexit heading towards a climax.... Until then, goodnight. GW CNBC have pinned the blame for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses on Peter Navarro, a trade advisor to president Trump. Navarro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s told CNN earlier that Trump would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153simply raise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods if no deal is reached during the cease-fire. Cue a sell-off.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to remember now, but this week began with optimism following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dinner date with Xi Jinping. On Monday, investors were talking about a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctrade truce\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Now, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking at a 5% drop in US stocks over the week: Ernie Cecilia, chief investment officer at Bryn Mawr Trust Co, blames this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market gyrations on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153repricing of growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cecilia says (via Bloomberg): The bond market is essentially saying we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the kind of growth that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had. So what the market is doing is repricing stocks, particularly those that have performed extraordinarily well, to a lower growth rate. More details of Meng Wanzhou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bail hearing: The Nasdaq is now down 3%, as a late burst of selling hits the index. Over in Vancouver, Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extradition hearing is underway. Several journalists are tweeting about the case, which has spooked markets in recent days (and a major factor behind today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls in New York) Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mi-Jung Lee of CTV Vancouver: Deirdre Bosa of CNBC is also covering the trial: Technology stocks are being hit hard tonight, as persistent worries about trade wars ripple through Wall Street again. Chip makers, and consumer electronics companies such as Apple, are leading the sell-off. With two hours of the trading week to go, Wall Street is heading deeper into the red. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the damage: Dow: down 527 points or 2.1% at 24,420 S&amp;P 500: down 57 points or 2.1% at 2,638 Nasdaq: down 187 points or 2.6% at 7,000 Fiona Cincotta of City Index says the New York market is getting rather nervous... Apart from the China trade factor the US markets have been more nervous than usual over the last few sessions as investors are getting increasingly concerned that the long-term bull run in the stock markets may be nearing its end. During the week the yields in the bond markets inverted \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that is, some of the yields on longer term papers declined below the shorter term yields, a reversal of a normal situation and a signal that has in the past preceded economic downturn. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses risk dragging the Dow Jones industrial average into a bear market: Shares in US Steel are down 1.45% today, reflecting concerns over trade relations between America and China. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not too bad a fall...but look at the picture since Donald Trump started imposing tariffs: Although today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs report showed fewer new jobs than expected, and less wage growth, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a shocker. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Marketwatch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: The jobs report threaded the needle really well,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist with TD Ameritrade told MarketWatch, arguing that 155,000 new jobs is neither too high nor too low for investors. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Had the this come in really hot, the market would have interpreted it as a number that would force the Fed to raise rates not just in December, but in March too,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You also didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to miss in a huge way on the down side, as it would have shaken faith in the economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a neat chart showing where jobs were created, and lost, in the US last month: David Madden of CMC Markets blames conflicting noises from White House advisors for the losses in New York today. Markets have had a volatile few days and today is no different. The Major US indices rallied on the open, but turned lower yet again. The sharp move on Wall Street is partially driven by conflicting announcements from Washington DC. Larry Kudlow, director of the US national economic council, claimed the Federal Reserve responds to data, not President Trump. Mr Kudlow also said the US might extend the 90-day truce with China if talks don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go well. On the other hand, Peter Navarro ,advisor to Trump ,claims the US will press ahead with new tariffs if a deal hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been reached after the 90 day period. The non-farm payrolls report was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mediocre\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Madden adds. In November, 155,000 jobs were added, which was well below the 200,000 that economists were expecting. The October report was revised down to 237,000 from 250,000. The jobless rate remained unchanged at 3.7% - meeting forecasts. On a monthly basis, average earnings was 0.2%, but traders were expecting 0.3%, and the October reading was revised down to 0.1% from 0.2% The yearly average earnings reading held steady at 3.1%. There were positive aspects to the report, but the negatives made traders less fearful about potential rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. Back on Wall Street, the Dow is over 400 points down, or 1.6%. The rally weakened in the final hour, but London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has still recovered some of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big fall. The FTSE 100 has closed 1.1% higher tonight at 6,778, a gain of 74 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just over a third of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout, which cut the value of the Footsie by \u00c2\u00a356bn, in its worst fall since June 2016. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Investing.com senior analyst Barani Krishnan on the Opec deal: \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdOil traders will react positively to the OPEC deal to cut 1.2 million barrels per day... However, the market will also be watching for any signs of cheating by OPEC and punish the cartel accordingly. \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdThe bigger takeaway is what the Saudi Energy Minister would possibly have on his mind as he leaves Vienna today; a Russia that has become as powerful to OPEC as Riyadh and a U.S. that is now a net exporter of oil. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Furthermore, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not even gotten to the Khashoggi fallout and likely Trump dismay over these cuts. One can only speculate at this point to how this will play out for the Saudis and their oil business going forward.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European markets are holding onto their gains. With 30 minutes to go, the FTSE 100 is up 1.9% at 6831, a 127-point swing upwards. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our US business editor Dominic Rushe on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs report: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record breaking streak of job creation appears to be slowing. The Labor Department announced the US had added 155,000 in November, well below last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures and economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts. November was the 98th consecutive month of growth in hiring, the longest streak of jobs growth since records began. But the pace of hiring slowed dramatically last month. The US added 250,000 jobs in October and economists had expected 198,000 new jobs to be added this month. The unemployment rate remained at 3.7%, a low unseen since 1969, and the US is still adding around 200,000 jobs a month. But some market watchers believe the recovery is running out of steam. More here.... Uh oh.... Wall Street is turning south. The Dow is now down 203 points, or around 0.8%, at 24,743 points. The Nasdaq is also in the red, down 1%, while the S&amp;P 500 has lost 0.6%. Technology stocks are leading the sell-off, with IBM and Intel both down 2.2%, Apple losing 1.6% and Microsoft down 1%. Caterpillar, maker of construction equipment, is down 1.5% while Nike has lost 1.2%. Over in Vienna, Opec has finally agreed a deal to cut oil production. After long, tense wrangling, the oil cartel has agreed to cut its production by 800,000 barrels per day. Non-member states (such as Russia) will cut their production by an extra 400,000, taking the total reduction to 1.2 million barrels per day. News of the cut has sent crude prices rallying; Brent crude is up 5% to $63.15 per barrel, up three dollars. Iran, Libya and Venezuela reportedly exempt from the decision. Iranian oil minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh told the IRNA news agency: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Negotiations were tough; thank God, we are pleased with this level of reduction in oil supply.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Larry Kudlow, the head of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national economic council, has declared that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is in a good spot. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Kudlow cited supply side growth, productivity improvements, tax cuts and deregulation, saying they could help the US economy keep growing solidly next year. Kudlow also suggested that the Federal Reserve had dialled down its interest rate hike plans (after plenty of pressure from the president). Kudlow was also asked about the Huawei case -- is there any reason for US tech executives to worry about visiting China? All businesses operating in China need to keep eyes open, Kudlow replied. He added that there is now widespread agreement that China must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153change its ways and take a big reform position on the WTO\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, thanks what he called a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trading coalition of the willing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Marina Mensah-Afoakwah, senior economist at the CEBR, suspects that the US Federal Reserve will vote to raise interest rates later this month. While today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures in isolation may not give a reason for concern, the context in which they have arisen could cause some anxiety. If the weak global outlook persists amid current trade tensions, future job growth in the US may continue to disappoint.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She also sent over this chart, showing how the US unemployment rate has fallen steadily to just 3.7%, the lowest since 1969. The Dow is pushing higher.... now up 120 points, as New York investors recover their nerve. But will it last?... So far, so calm..... This time yesterday, Wall Street was falling heavily as global markets were riled by the arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CFO. Today things are calmer, thanks to the jobs report. The Dow has crept up by 18 points, or 0.07% to 24,966. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a teensy tiny move, but the significant point is that the New York stock exchange hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fallen back towards yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows (the Dow fell 780 points, but only closed 79 points lower). Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report shows that the US economy is slowing, but not drastically, says Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s written a thorough note on November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll....and here it is: The slightly more modest 155,000 gain in payroll employment in November may not go down well in markets given the heightened nervousness in recent months, but this is still a solid gain that suggests economic growth is gradually slowing back towards its potential pace. There is nothing here to suggest the economy is suffering a more sudden downturn. Admittedly, 155,000 was below the consensus forecast at 200,000 and the six-month average, which was slightly above 200,000. But gains of that magnitude should still be enough to keep the unemployment rate grinding lower. Looking at the employment breakdown, manufacturing increased by a healthy 27,000, retail added 18,000 and transportation added 25,000 (including 10,000 couriers ahead of the Holiday season). Leisure &amp; hospitality added only 15,000, however, and education &amp; health added only 34,000. Both below normal. State governments also shed 13,000 employees. The unemployment rate was unchanged at only 3.7% last month, as a 233,000 gain in the household survey measure of employment more than offset a 133,000 increase in the labour force. That said, the broader U6 measure of unemployment did rebound to 7.6%, from 7.4%. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.2% m/m in November, with the annual growth rate unchanged at 3.1%. Overall, employment growth may be fading a little from the unsustainable pace in the first half of this year, but there is nothing here to unduly worry the Fed or prevent it from hiking interest rates at this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FOMC meeting. The European stock markets are all pushing higher, clawing back more of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is leading the way, up almost 2%, with solid gains on Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX (0.8%) and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC (+1.5%). This seems to confirm that traders are relieved that the US economy is still creating jobs, but not so rapidly to force several interest rate hikes in 2019. Matt Weller of Faraday Investment Research says: America created tens of thousands more jobs in transportation and warehousing last month, as online shopping continued to expand. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll report shows that: Employment in transportation and warehousing rose by 25,000 in November Job gains occurred in couriers and messengers (+10,000) and in warehousing and storage (+6,000). Over the year, transportation and warehousing has added 192,000 jobs. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector created the bulk of the new jobs last month, hiring around 132,000 new workers. Factories also expanded their workforces, with 27,000 new hires. Economics professor Justin Wolfers reckons today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report will reassure the Federal Reserve that they have the situation under control. With jobs still being created, and wages rising modestly, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little sign that the economy is over-heating. This jobs report doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much cheer for US workers, although the unemployment rate remained at just 3.7%. Bad news IS good news for the markets! The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE is now up by 112 points, or 1.7%, close to its highest point of the day. Wall Street future, which has been down earlier, are recovering too. More disappointment! US wages only grew by 0.2% month-on-month in November, dashing hopes of a 0.3% rise. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a blow to US families in the run-up to the festive season. Annual wage growth was 3.1%, the same as in October. BREAKING: The US economy created 155,000 new jobs last month, fewer than the 200,000 which Wall Street had expected. And in another blow, October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures was revised down to 237,000, from a first estimate of 250,000. That suggests the labor market isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as strong as hoped - which will lower the pressure to raise US interest rates. More to follow..... Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies, predicts that shares will fall if the US jobs report beats forecasts....and rise if it misses. As he puts it on Bloomberg TV: Good equals bad, and bad equals good. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the markets will assume that the US Federal Reserve will step in to support the economy, if required. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right very soon! Word from the White House.... As City traders grab a quick sandwich before the US jobs report (oh the glamour!), here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a look at the markets. FTSE 100: Up 80 points at 6784, a gain of 1.2% German DAX: Up 49 points at 10,860, a gain of 0.4% French CAC: Up 61 points at 4,842, a gain of 1.3% Definitely a recovery, but a relatively muted one given European markets shed more than 3% on Thurday. A reminder of how the US monthly job-creation figures have bounced around in recent months: The London stock exchange is holding onto most of its early gains, as City traders turn their attention across the Atlantic. Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CFO, Meng Wanzhou, is expected at a bail hearing in Canada later today. That might yield more information about why she was arrested, and whether she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be extradited to the US. Mihir Kapadia of Sun Global Investments says investors are worried that Meng\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest will destabilise US-China relations. China and the US continue to have frosty relations and this has seen investors prefer to stay away than get involved in what has proven to be a volatile market for quite some time now. This reversed the hope felt earlier in the week after it was announced the US would delay tariffs on China in the aim of making progress but it is now clear that this negativity will last until the new year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Traders will also be watching for the US jobs report, in 30 minutes. Wall Street expects that around 200,000 new jobs were created last month, with wages rising by 0.3% month-on-month, or 3.1% year-on-year. A strong report might rock markets, as it would put pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in 2019. But weak job creation, and paltry earnings growth, could force the Fed to leave borrowing costs alone - which is good for equities. The Bank of England is already under fire over its warning about a no-deal Brexit. But it now faces another storm. Top officials from Venezuela have flown to London, to ask for 14 tonnes of their gold back. The Press Association has the details: The Bank is reportedly due to meet Calixto Ortega Sanchez, president of the Venezuelan Central Bank, and Simon Zerpa, the Venezuelan minister of finance, over the repatriation of 550 million US dollars (431 million) of gold. The Bank is the second largest depository of gold and has been holding Venezuela\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gold deposits since the 1980s. Andrew Lewer MP wrote to the Bank and the Treasury, criticising the move, saying a meeting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153would pose significant reputational risk to the Bank and may be in violation of US Treasury imposed sanctions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Mr Lewer said Mr Zerpa has been sanctioned by the US Treasury Department and that Mr Ortega Sanchez \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is not a legitimate president\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the Venezuelan Central Bank as his appointment \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was not ratified by the National Assembly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is entirely inappropriate for senior officials of the Bank of England to meet with an individual who has been placed on the US sanctions list for reasons of corruption. To treat with such an individual would threaten the reputation of both the Bank of England and the Government as a whole,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mr Lewer said. Although the markets are up today, fears over the global economy haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gone away. Royal Bank of Canada have cautioned that Chinese trade data due out on Saturday should be watched very closely, for signs that export growth have dropped. RBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sue Trinh says: There is compelling evidence that exports, which have surprised significantly to the upside in the last three months, have been boosted by front-loading ahead of successive tranches of tariffs. Export growth (in yuan terms) is expected to slow to 14% year-on-year from 20% previously (or from 16% to 9% in US dollar terms). But as the chart shows, there is potential for a much sharper weakening, this month or in the coming one to three months. Exports in the sectors first affected by tariffs (steel and aluminium) are already falling from their June peak. The FTSE 250 index, which contains smaller UK-focused companies, is also recovering today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gained 193 points, or over 1%. Games Workshop, the miniature wargaming firm, is among the top risers, up over 5%. It told shareholders this morning that sales and profits are in line with expectations, and that its Warhammer business is in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great shape in our core markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But while demand for GW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intricately-designed Cataphractii Terminators, Taurox armoured personnel carriers and chainsword-toting missionaries is holding up now, an economic shock could change that. Last week, company founder Ian Livingstone warned that Brexit could destabilise the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gaming sector, which contributes around \u00c2\u00a32bn to the UK economy per year. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management believes the threat of new US tariffs on Chinese goods caused Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off. But on the upside, he reckons today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll jobs report will show American workers are in demand. Equity markets had a bad day on Thursday. The fear of additional US trade taxes is really not being well received, and investors seem to see the risk as rising. Otherwise, economic data was generally pretty good. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US employment report is more likely to show firms struggling to find people to hire, than a lack of jobs available. Speaking of slowing economies...new data have confirmed that the eurozone only grew by 0.2% in the last quarter. The single currency bloc was dragged down by Germany, which contracted by 0.2%, and Italy which shrank by 0.1%. The UK outperformed the average, though, expanding by 0.6% thanks to strong growth in July. Ralf Preusser, head of rates research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says recent market instability is mainly due to concerns about the underlying global economy. That includes the impact of the US-China trade dispute, and worries that we are approaching the end of the economic cycle (ie, heading towards a recession) Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Preusser explains that the markets are paying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153particular attention\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the Federal Reserve, to see how US central bankers handle the situation. Will the Fed recognise these fears, and try to engineer a soft landing (by being more cautious about rate hikes)? Or will they press on, given that economic data suggests the US economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really slowing at all, he explains. Consumer-facing firms, telecoms, tech and industrial companies are leading the rally in London: Good news! \u00c2\u00a327bn has been wiped back onto the value of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest companies this morning. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets has now clawed back half of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump -- while European markets are also holding onto their moderate gains. But after such a choppy few weeks in the markets, further swings must be likely. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says next year could be volatile too. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A 1.6% rally in the FTSE 100 is welcome relief after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s horrible session, although this only claws back some of the losses. The important point to note is the large swings in the market on a daily basis in recent weeks, which may suggest volatility could become one of the key themes in 2019. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would be possible to draw the conclusion that investors are overreacting to every little bit of information related to politics, economics and the markets. Ultimately it does tell you that investors are extremely nervous and confidence cannot be very high as we approach the end of the year. But right now, the FTSE 100 is holding onto a triple-digit gain (just): Several property experts are blaming Brexit uncertainty for the slowdown in UK property prices. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mike Scott, chief property analyst at estate agent Yopa, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThis suggests that the usual Christmas slowdown in the housing market has started early this year, as people wait for the outcome of the current political turmoil before making long-term commitments, such as buying a new home. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHowever, the economic fundamentals of low unemployment, low interest rates, growing wages and limited supply are all positive for house prices, and we therefore expect the market to pick up again in the new year.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jonathan Samuels, CEO of the property lender, Octane Capital,agrees: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The lowest rate of growth for six years is a reflection of how Brexit uncertainty has hit the property market for six. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Without wanting to appear overly pessimistic, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s every chance 2019 could be 2009 all over again.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153People need to be preparing for that eventuality and the low level of transactions suggests they are. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All the ingredients for extreme uncertainty, both political and economic, are in the mix. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mortgages are still cheap and the employment market strong, but the great unknown of Brexit is causing prospective buyers and sellers alike to err on the side of caution. OUCH! UK house prices growth has slowed to a six year low. The Halifax has reported that the average house price declined by 1.4% in November, a substantial fall. On a quarterly basis, prices in September-November were 1.1% lower than in June-August. And annually, prices were only 0.3% higher than a year ago - that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the weakest growth rate in six years. Russell Galley, managing director, Halifax, says the lack of properties is holding prices up: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153House price growth has slowed as we approach the end of the year, falling from 1.5% in October to 0.3% in November, with the average cost of a home now \u00c2\u00a3224,578. While this is the lowest rate of growth in six years, it remains within our forecast range of 0% to 3% for 2018. High employment, wage growth and historically low mortgage rates continue to make home ownership more affordable for many, though the need to raise a significant deposit still acts as something of a restraint on the market. This is largely offset by relatively limited supply of new and existing properties for sale, which continues to sustain house prices nationally.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says the markets are recovering today thanks to the last minute recovery on Wall Street last night. The European markets were granted a reprieve on Friday, the Dow Jones\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 last minute retreat from the cliff edge on Thursday night paving the way for a greener end to the week. Though Beijing are very much displeased with the arrest of Huawei exec Meng Wanzhou \u00e2\u20ac\u201c China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s media labelled her detention as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdespicable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the fact the country nevertheless announced it was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimmediately\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 applying the trade truce measures agreed with the US appears to have helped reassure the markets that the relationship between the two superpowers hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet reverted back to its warmongering worst. Shares continue to climb in London, pushing the FTSE 100 index up by 80 points. All but three members of the Footsie have jumped this morning - quite a contrast with yesterday when all but three fell. Scottish Mortgage, the investment trust, is leading the rally - up 4%. Supermarket chain is next, up 3.6%, followed by takeaway delivery group Just Eat (+3.3%). Associated British Food is dragging the index down, though. It has shed 2.5% after warning of difficult trading at its Primark fashion chain. Neil Wilson of Markets.com thinks the Brexit crisis has also hurt UK shares. The FTSE suffered a bruising session on Thursday, declining more than three per cent to close at 6,704.05. There is still lots of pressure on the UK. For the FTSE this is about more than trade wars and the Fed, there is a real political risk premium being factored into shares now as we approach the Brexit crunch. European stock markets have bounced back from their lowest levels in two years, as trading gets underway across the region. In the City, the FTSE 100 index has risen by 0.8%, or 55 points, to 6,758. That claws back some of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 217-point rout...but certainly not all of it! But still, investors will be relieved that the sell-off seems to have abated. The French CAC and German DAX has gained 0.7%, while Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX has picked up 0.6%. All good stuff, until you remember that they fell by around 3% on Thursday..... China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s media are usually a good indication of how leaders in Beijing see an issue. And today, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve savaged the US over the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, calling it a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdespicable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attempt to undermine Chinese enterprise. My colleague Lily Kuo explains: State-run China Daily said the arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief financial officer appeared to be part of US efforts to contain the company, which is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest telecoms equipment provider, as well as its second-largest mobile phone maker. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One thing that is undoubtedly true and proven is the US is trying to do whatever it can to contain Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expansion in the world simply because the company is the point man for China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competitive technology companies,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the editorial said. State-run tabloid Global Times said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Obviously Washington is resorting to a despicable rogue\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach as it cannot stop Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 5G advance in the market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asia-Pacific stock markets recovered after the Chinese government announced it would \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimmediately\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 enforce measures agreed with the US under their trade war truce. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still anxiety on the trading floors, as Associated Press explains: Asian shares are moderately higher as worries over U.S.-China trade friction were calmed by conciliatory comments from Beijing. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark Nikkei 225 added 0.8 percent to 21,678.68, and Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P/ASX 200 gained 0.4 percent to 5,681.50. South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kospi rose 0.3 percent to 2,075.76. Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng edged 0.1 percent lower to 26,133.53, while the Shanghai Composite was flat at 2,605.89. Shares also rose in India, Indonesia and Taiwan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Clouded with much uncertainty, markets will likely remain jittery and may struggle to hold on to the gains,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jayden Loh, a trader at IG in Singapore. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors around the globe must be desperately counting down the days to the New Year, after enduring another volatile session on Thursday. More than \u00c2\u00a355bn was wiped off Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 yesterday, in the worst sell-off since the day after the UK voted to leave the EU. The blue-chip index sank by 217 points, or 0ver 3.15%, to a two-year low of 6,704. Traders blamed the shock arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CFO, Meng Wanzhou, who is due in court in Canada for a bail hearing. She faces possible extradition to the United States on charges of cyber-espionage and sanctions-busting, which the company firmly deny. Meng\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest could intensify the US-China trade war, at a time when the global economy already appears to be slowing - thus the sell-off yesterday (at least, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the theory in the City). But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rush to liquidate your portfolio yet. Wall Street managed a late recovery last night. After lurching almost 800 points into the red, the Dow ended down just 79 points (0.3%). That has triggered a rebound in Asia overnight, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei up 0.8% and Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P/ASX 200 gaining 0.4%. Europe is expected to open higher too. The FTSE is called up around 0.6% points, meaning it would recover a portion of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Stephen Innes of trading firms OANDA says these markets are not for the faint of heart, adding: The wall of worry to hurdle for flipping to bullish sentiment is about as big as the Great Wall of China. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking the markets through the day. Also coming up today: The latest US jobs report is eagerly awaited, for signs that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong growth may be fading. Traders will also scrutinise new earnings figures, for clues as to whether the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates in 2019. Opec ministers will be meeting again in Vienna, after failing to agree a deal to cut production yesterday. The cartel hope that Russia (not an Opec member) will agree to curb its own output too - but the uncertainty sent crude prices sliding yesterday. The agenda 8.30am GMT: UK house price figures for November, from Halifax 10am GMT: Updated eurozone growth figures for Q3 2018 1.30pm GMT: US non-farm payroll jobs report for November",

                "bodyText":"Thousands of protestors campaigning against Indian mining giant Adani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s controversial Queensland coalmine have taken to the streets in major cities across Australia to call on the government to stop it going ahead. Protesters marched in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Cairns on Saturday, just a week after 15,000 school students demonstrated against government inaction on climate change. It follows the announcement last month by Adani it would self-finance the controversial project after scaling back its size and scope. The coal project is being downsized from a 60-million-tonnes a year, $16.5 billion mega-mine to a more manageable 10-to-15 million tonnes a year costing around $2 billion. In Brisbane, hundreds of protestors gathered outside Adani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters to voice their opposition to the project. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No longer will we sit back and be lectured to by people who are outdated and out of touch,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thomas Cullen told the crowd. The 17-year-old was one of the thousands of students criticised by Prime Minister Scott Morrison for skipping school to stage national strikes calling for immediate action on climate change just over a week ago. This week he was among the students who travelled to Canberra for a sit-in in parliament to confront Morrison over the issue. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are preparing to show our leaders that we will not stand for their inaction,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. April McCabe, 24, said there is a growing sense of urgency among university and high school students who want their governments to do more to tackle climate change. The Queensland university student said news that major works on the Carmichael mine in the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Galilee Basin are imminent had provoked more young people to push for change. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has been talked about but now people are taking action,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. In Sydney, protesters carried an array of signs, including some reading \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Time for a COALonoscopy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no Planet B\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I bet the dinosaurs thought they had time too\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The climate is changing, why aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t we?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jean Hinchliffe, 14, said Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political leaders were displaying continued ignorance and had tried to disregard the student climate change protest she headed in Sydney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Martin Place last Friday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is something we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to sit on the fence about and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to keep fighting until the Labor party rule out Adani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coal mine and all other new coal mines for good,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. The crowd gathered outside Labor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s NSW headquarters in Sussex Street, before a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sit down\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd action planned outside deputy leader Tanya Plibersek\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office on Wednesday in the lead-up to the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national conference. It follows the release of a poll of more than 2,000 people from the Australian Youth Climate Coalition which found 58.1% of people thought Labor should oppose the mine, including 80.7% of Labor voters. In Melbourne more than 5,000 protesters marched down Swanston Street before occupying the intersection outside Flinders Street train station. Youth Climate Coalition organiser Alex Fuller said people were motivated to join the rally after seeing the recent school strikes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People were feeling really inspired that we could create change but they were also feeling really frustrated,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. Adani Mining said the company recognised there are varied opinions about the Carmichael project and encouraged everyone to voice them safely and respectfully. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All we ask is that people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opinions are based on facts and that they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put lives at risk through irresponsible, illegal and unsafe protest behaviour,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a spokesperson said in a statement.

She hoped changes to the Irish backstop could be announced just before tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote. But the EU offered only \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clarifications\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sweeteners\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - and rejected May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desperate pleas to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement.</p> <p>Indeed, in Brussels this morning, the sense was that May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last minute phone diplomacy was lacking in detailed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153asks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She also refused to share what her strategy was going to be regarding management of the Commons - both before and after the vote.</p> </blockquote> <p>Rahman also doubts that shelving the vote will do May much good....</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>May will likely respond to the overwhelming message from Tory MPs by seeking emergency talks in Brussels with European Commission and Council leaders before the two-day regular summit of EU leaders on Thursday and Friday. But we remain of the view that any substantive reopening of the Withdrawal Agreement is unlikely. EU leaders will not be pleased with new demands from May, especially as she only signed off on the deal a few weeks ago.</p> <p> The decision to shelve the vote is not without cost for May. It is a very unusual course during a five-day Commons debate, and makes her look weak. It will revive accusations that she is in office, not power, and add to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153end of days\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd atmosphere at Westminster. However, it was probably the lesser of two evils. If May had lost by a three-figure margin, she could have been forced out of office this week.</p> <p> There is also a danger that, if the EU does reopen negotiations, that some EU governments will table new demands \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as France on fishing rights in UK waters and Spain on the future of Gibraltar.</p> <p> May lives to fight another day, but her growing number of Tory critics believe it will be merely to die another day.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-12-10T13:50:21.007Z\">at 1.50pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c0e616de4b01d1e859e870b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-12-10T12:52:30.864Z\">12.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The financial markets have been plunged into fresh upheaval today, says Simon Harvey, FX Analyst at Monex Europe:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153When the market thought uncertainty had finally peaked, May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delay proves it wrong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c0e60ade4b0b950d12f9fc3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-12-10T12:48:50.865Z\">12.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/labourwhips/status/1072101732950396929\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Three statement from 330pm - you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d think this was a pretty clear hint that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to try to pull tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Meaningful Vote<br><br>1.

                "bodyText":"Following one of its most volatile trading sessions in the last few volatile years, sterling seems to have settled around $1.255 tonight, a level last seen in April 2017. So here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a summary: The pound has dropped to its lowest level for almost two years amid the growing risks to the British economy from political paralysis over Brexit and on a no-deal scenario. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to delay the parliamentary vote on her Brexit plan to avoid an embarrassing defeat for the government sent sterling tumbling by more than 1.3% against the dollar and by more than 1.1% against the euro on the foreign exchanges. The pound slumped below $1.26 to the lowest level since April 2017 after the prime minister said her Brexit plan would have been rejected by a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant margin\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in a Commons vote pencilled in for Tuesday. Sterling was worth $1.2565 against the dollar late on Monday and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1050 against the euro. Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst at the financial trading company Markets.com, said the pound had experienced one of its worst [days] since the 2016 referendum, adding that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the government [had] left investors completely in the dark about what happens next\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all from us today. Our Politics Live blog is still tracking all the drama at Westminster: Good night, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW After a rough day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 250 index has lost almost 2% of its value today. The FTSE 250, which contains UK-focused firms, shed 351 points to 17492. Holiday firm Thomas Cook shed almost 14%, housebuilder Crest Nicholson shed 8.5%, transpor group Stagecoach lost 8.3%, and Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pizza lost 8%. The FTSE 100, packed with internationally-focused companies, shed 53 points or 0.8% - close to last-week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-week low. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says shares were hit by Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s humiliating u-turn today. The vote was meant to be taking place after five days of intense debate in Parliament over Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed Brexit deal but instead the change of plans ended up with MPs baying for blood including Jeremy Corbyn asking for the PM to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153give way.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There is no clear indication about where the MPs or the Prime Minister plans to take things next. UK business groups are united in horror at events in parliament today: Theresa May has insisted several times this afternoon that she will not countenance a People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vote on her withdrawal deal. Instead, she insists, parliamentarians need to implement the 2016 vote -- despite some MPs reporting that constituents have urged them to reject her deal. Charles Hepworth, investment director at wealth manager GAM, suspects that Britain could end up holding another referendum, to end the current impasse. PM May is going back to Brussels on Thursday for an EU council meeting and the hope from her side is that further cosmetic concessions can be agreed around the controversial backstop, but in our view that equation does not quite seem to balance given the EU has already announced that it will not engage the UK government on further deal amendments. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling has once again come under selling pressure, reflecting the ongoing Brexit paralysis. We believe delaying the vote is perhaps just another step towards a second referendum (which clearly cannot take place before the March deadline, but possibly could happen within perhaps six months assuming the March deadline is further extended) as we cannot see another way for this purgatory that the UK inadvertently voted for to end.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rather than a crunch vote on Tuesday, the markets now face days of uncertainty, or quite possibly several weeks. Theresa May is refusing to say when the delayed Meaningful Vote will take place, only that it will be held once she has secured new reassurances on the backstop. The cost of insuring UK government debt against default has jumped to its highest level since the EU referendum, in another sign that investors are getting jittery. The pound remains on track for one of its worst days since the 2016 referendum. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovering, slightly, from its lowest point today -- but still down 1.6 cents at $1.256. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says the possibility that the prime minister is ousted from Downing Street is pulling sterling lower. It is not just the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit that investors are factoring into their valuations of the British Pound. Investors are also re-pricing into the market the increased likelihood that Theresa May will once again be at threat to expectations of a leadership challenge. Another emerging danger is that the decision taken today raises the threat level that the UK is falling into a disorderly Brexit trap. The news that Theresa May has kicked the Brexit vote down the parliamentary corridors will have disappointed many British business leaders. After two and a half years of uncertainty, UK PLC really wants Brexit sorted out. Many also fear a no-deal Brexit, especially those which haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t (or can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t) drawn up contingency plans to protect themselves. Stephen Martin, Director General of the Institute of Directors, says firms needs to know what will happen if the UK crashes out of the EU on 29 March: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Avoiding no deal continues to be the main priority for our members but, with Parliament seemingly gridlocked, the Government must also be much clearer about its own contingency plans, even if only regarding the areas they can control, such as imports. Many companies are still in the dark about what HMRC and border agencies would require the day after Brexit if there is no transition period. Partly because of a lack of information, only 14% of IoD members say they are fully prepared to manage no-deal, highlighting the scale of the challenge if a withdrawal agreement isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ratified.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lee McDarby, Corporate IP Managing Director at foreign exchange firm moneycorp, says Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to delay the Brexit vote will hurt the economy: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Over the course of the afternoon we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen wild swings in the value of Sterling, including a 20 month low against the dollar. Every time the Prime Minister kicks the can down the road, the uncertainty dents British business plans for 2019. Right now it seems the markets are just looking for some certainty on the future of the UK, regardless of its shape or form.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thumping today suggest that investors see a growing danger that the UK crashes out of the EU at the end of March, without a transition deal. But a sterling crisis might encourage MPs to back Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal, despite all their misgivings. Silvia Dall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Angelo, senior economist at Hermes Investment Management, believes all options are still on the table -- from crashing out without a deal, to not leaving at all. In our \u00e2\u20ac\u201c admittedly low confidence \u00e2\u20ac\u201c base case, stress in financial markets and pressure from businesses should lead to a last-minute approval of the deal in Parliament. However, the situation is fluid and other outcomes carry significant probabilities. Prime Minister May highlighted the government would step up preparations for a no-deal Brexit, but a second referendum, a soft Brexit (Norway-style) or a no-Brexit scenarios seem more realistic, especially following the European Court of Justice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling this morning that the UK can unilaterally reverse Article 50. The pound has fallen further against the euro too. Now down 1.4%, or one and a half eurocents, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1014. That means the euro is worth 90.7p, its strongest position since late August. This makes imports from Europe more expensive, and UK exports more competitive. So much for Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech being priced in! This chart shows how sterling has taken a deeper bath, as MP after MP criticise the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s handling of the Brexit negotiations. Boom! The pound is in freefall.....dropping to a new 20-month low of $1.2555 against the US dollar. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a loss of 1.4%, down 1.8 cents today. The latest drop comes as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn responds to Theresa May. Corbyn lashes the government for being in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153complete disarray\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and argues that the House of Commons should set the mandate for the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new talks with the EU. The PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position in a nutshell: Theresa May is now challenging MPs to support her deal, calling for compromise. She says MPs must admit that a second referendum risks dividing the UK again, that single market membership means maintaining free movement of people, and no deal would cause economic damage. But, the House of Commons sounds as divided as ever.... Theresa May has confirmed that the government has decided to defer the Brexit vote scheduled for tomorrow. The PM says there is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbroad support\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for much of her deal (cue heckling from the opposition benches), but also admits that the government would lose the vote, due to concern over the Irish backstop. She tells MPs that both sides are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153legally committed to using best endeavours\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to ensure the backstop is never used, and that any use would only be temporary. [Reminder: the backstop would ensure no hard border in the island of Ireland, if the UK and EU can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree a permanent trade deal at the end of a post-Brexit transition deal] Given the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clear concerns\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the House of Commons, May adds, she plans to meet fellow EU leaders in the coming days to press for more reassurances on the backstop [many MPs fear that the UK could be trapped permanently]. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much financial reaction -- the pound is still trading around $1.262, an 18-month low, down one cent today. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaks mean that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement is already priced in.... Theresa May is giving her statement to the House of Commons now. Our Politics Live blog will have full coverage. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll track financial reaction to the key points. Theresa May has been working the phones....but not finding many friends at the other end of the line. The Sun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, has tweeted that MPs might not get to vote on Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit deal until 2019. If so, that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t calm the financial jitters dragging down the pound. More pressure on the PM, from the head of the DUP - who have been propping her government up since the 2017 election. Andy Scott, Associate Director at financial risk management consultancy JCRA, fears the pound will suffer further losses as the Brexit drama plays out: Theresa May is reported to be planning to travel to Brussels to seek a legally-binding assurance on the back stop, in an attempt to gain support of MPs who fear being trapped indefinitely under the current proposal. But with her authority severely depleted, the political stakes are high for May whose position as Prime Minister could soon be deemed untenable. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The uncertainty will meanwhile continue to exert downwards pressure on Sterling.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The slump in the pound today shows that international investors are losing faith in Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government, says the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Simon Jack: MPs are due to hear from Theresa May in less than 30 minutes time, in what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certain to be a testing appearance at the dispatch box. Paul Hardy, Brexit director at legal firm DLA Piper, argues that the pain may not be worth it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The political cost to Theresa May of delaying the vote could only be justified if she can come back from Brussels with significant changes to the draft Withdrawal Treaty - this is the legally binding document which puts the Irish backstop in place. This seems unlikely if the comments of the European Commission President, Jean-Claude Junker, made at the time the deal was adopted are taken at face value: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is the best deal possible. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m inviting those who have to ratify this deal in the House of Commons to take this into consideration. This is the best deal for the UK, the best deal for Europe, this is the only deal possible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 18-month low of $1.261, the pound in your pocket is worth 15% less than on the day of the EU referendum. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still stronger than in the aftermath of the vote; sterling hit a 31-year low below $1.20 in January 2017, before managing a small recovery. And in historical terms, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just one more devaluation in a series of sterling crises.... including Black Wednesday in 1992, the Wilson devaluation in 1967, the 30% devaluation by the Attlee government, the end of the gold standard.... We also have fresh evidence that all the Brexit uncertainty is weighing on the economy. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research has estimated that UK growth will slow to 0.4% in the current quarter, down from 0.6% in July-September. That follows official data this morning, showing that UK manufacturing shrank in October, and that the wider economy only grew by 0.1% last month. Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped by confusion over whether Theresa May can actually scrap tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote or not! However, the government may use parliamentary procedure to avoid the humiliation of losing a vote on whether to cancel its own vote. My colleague Jessica Elgot explains: A government source has said that there won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a vote on a business motion to cancel Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote. (See 1.38pm.) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are replacing the business with a new statement but it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a motion and therefore isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t voteable,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the source said. Reminder: Our Politics Live blog has all the latest from Westminster (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m tracking the financial reaction here...) A further burst of selling pressure is threatening to send sterling below $1.26, for the first time since June 2017. As you can see, the pound has suffered a series of sickening jolts in the last few hours, since news broke that Theresa May was holding an emergency call with the cabinet. The latest chatter in Westminster is that May plans to return to Brussels, in search of a better deal (given the torrent of criticism over the Irish backstop). .... meanwhile, the leader of the Scottish Nationalist Party, Nicola Sturgeon, has publicly called for a vote of no confidence in the government. The pound is continuing to lose ground, as traders prepare to hear from Theresa May this afternoon. Sterling is now down a whole eurocent against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1078, the lowest since September. That means the euro is worth more than 90p. Against the US dollar, sterling has just scraped a new 18-month low, down almost one cent at $1.263. Jaws have been dropping across the City in the last few hours. Banks, stock brokers and foreign exchange firms had all drawn up plans for a big night on Tuesday, as the Meaningful Vote took place. Hotels were booked, caterers arranged, as traders prepared for a big all-nighter. Now, investors are watching Westminster to see how the saga develops. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how Brad Bechtel of investment bank Jefferies summed up the situation to clients: The risk of a disastrous vote scenario was too high and therefore they felt it prudent to delay for now. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t honestly know if that is a good or bad thing. Either the vote was going to be so bad that postponing it is a good thing, or the postponement of the vote tells you how far away from a good scenario they are. Conservative MP John Redwood is speaking on Bloomberg TV now. Redwood - a long-standing Brexiteer - argues that the UK should leave the EU without a deal, thus saving the \u00c2\u00a339bn divorce payment: We won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be crashing out, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be cashing in. Redwood says that a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit would be a great opportunity to strike new trade deals.... ...but US investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced by the MP for Wokingham. Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at investment group Bannockburn Capital, is also on the show. He says that delaying tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote means more uncertainty (bad for markets). People think that leaving without a deal would be bad for sterling. Scrapping today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote may allow Theresa May to live another day...but it could also hasten her political end. So argues Mujtaba Rahman, political analyst at Eurasia Group, who points out that the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last-ditch attempts to improve her deal have failed: She tried to limit the damage in tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote by seeking last-minute concessions from several EU leaders in telephone calls over the weekend. She hoped changes to the Irish backstop could be announced just before tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote. But the EU offered only \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clarifications\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sweeteners\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - and rejected May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desperate pleas to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement. Indeed, in Brussels this morning, the sense was that May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last minute phone diplomacy was lacking in detailed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153asks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She also refused to share what her strategy was going to be regarding management of the Commons - both before and after the vote. Rahman also doubts that shelving the vote will do May much good.... May will likely respond to the overwhelming message from Tory MPs by seeking emergency talks in Brussels with European Commission and Council leaders before the two-day regular summit of EU leaders on Thursday and Friday. But we remain of the view that any substantive reopening of the Withdrawal Agreement is unlikely. EU leaders will not be pleased with new demands from May, especially as she only signed off on the deal a few weeks ago. The decision to shelve the vote is not without cost for May. It is a very unusual course during a five-day Commons debate, and makes her look weak. It will revive accusations that she is in office, not power, and add to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153end of days\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd atmosphere at Westminster. However, it was probably the lesser of two evils. If May had lost by a three-figure margin, she could have been forced out of office this week. There is also a danger that, if the EU does reopen negotiations, that some EU governments will table new demands \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as France on fishing rights in UK waters and Spain on the future of Gibraltar. May lives to fight another day, but her growing number of Tory critics believe it will be merely to die another day. The financial markets have been plunged into fresh upheaval today, says Simon Harvey, FX Analyst at Monex Europe: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When the market thought uncertainty had finally peaked, May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delay proves it wrong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The chaos in Westminster is hurting the stock market too. Shares in house builders, who are vulnerable to an economic slowdown, are falling. Barratt Development are down 3%, Taylor Wimpey has lost 2%, and Crest Nicholson down 7%. Other UK-focused companies are suffering too, such as Primark-owner ABF (down 2%), ITV (down 3.5%) and the AA (down 5.5%). Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 250 index, which contains UK-focused companies, has fallen by 1% today. The blue-chip FTSE 100, though, is up 7 points, thanks to the weakening pound (which boosts the overseas earnings of multinational companies). No prizes for spotting the moment when traders heard that the Brexit vote might be off.... This chart shows how the pound has now dropped to its lowest level against the US dollar since June 2017 City traders are scrambling to keep up with events in Westminster. The latest news is that Theresa May will address parliament this afternoon.... Investors had been preparing for major volatility on Tuesday night, when the Meaningful Vote took place. Instead, the drama is coming a day early. Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX, said: The confusion over whether tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote will go ahead provides the market an insight into the chaos and disagreement within Downing Street. Rumours that Theresa May is set to pull tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote contradict those of a Downing Street spokesperson, and the fact the news was broken over a conference call instead of in a cabinet meeting speaks volumes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many predicted that tomorrow would be the big day for any movement in the pound. However, it has already reached three-month lows against the euro and, depending on whether the vote tomorrow goes ahead, could hit lows last seen against the dollar in August.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in the financial markets, the pound is suddenly sliding amid reports that the government will cancel tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parliamentary vote on the Brexit withdrawal deal. Theresa May is holding a conference call with ministers right now; some have apparently revealed that the vote, due on Tuesday night, has been ditched. Such a move would plunge Westminster into even deeper confusion (although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to believe that further depths can be plumbed). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got the City worried. Sterling has just slumped its lowest level against the US dollar since June 2017, down 0.5% at below $1.2660. The pound has also hit a three-month low against the euro, down 0.7% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1096. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says the situation remains very fluid... If she is pulling the vote to go back to Brussels it could suggest a renegotiation of the backstop, or at least clarification. We must note that the EU has categorically said this is the only deal and it seems unlikely it would revisit. Alternatively, this opens up the prospect of May herself going for a second referendum, with voters asked whether they accept this deal or no deal. A complete shambles is about the only way to describe this situation and investors are right to be very cautious about UK assets. The only known is that the uncertainty has increased and we are faced with more volatility for sterling and UK assets. My colleague Andy Sparrow is tracking all the political drama: S.M. Lodha, chairman of UK insulation firm Western Thermal Group, fears that the UK economy will continue to struggle until Brexit is resolved: It is evident that this economic slowdown has been impacted by the extremely low business confidence levels amongst businesses and entrepreneurs in the UK with the ongoing Brexit negotiations leaving businesses in a state of hesitancy and reluctance to invest in opportunities or growth. As long as the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future continues to be uncertain, the more business growth will be stagnated.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Another reason to worry.... Marina Mensah-Afoakwah, senior economist at the CEBR think tank, also blame Brexit for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing economy: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data show that the UK economy has continued its slowdown into Autumn, as business and consumer confidence take a hit amidst Brexit uncertainty. She also points out that the service sector provided most of the growth in the last few months, while manufacturing contracted last month: October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP growth was mainly driven by services. Rolling three-month growth in the sector was 0.3% in October, which contributed 0.23 percentage points to overall GDP growth. This was largely as a result of growth in IT and professional services, which grew by 1.7% and 1.3% respectively. Construction also contributed positive growth, up 1.2% in October. However, the manufacturing sector saw no growth at all in the three months to October, mainly due to a decline in the pharmaceutical industry. While in the three months to October growth in the manufacturing industry was flat, monthly figures for October show that sector actually contracted by 0.9%. Economist Rupert Seggins has analysed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures, and pulled out some key points: Although monthly GDP figures are volatile, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that the UK economy has slowed since the summer: The British Chambers of Commerce, which represents UK firms, has no doubt what to blame for the slowdown -- BREXIT. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the BCC, says rising cost pressures (due to the weak pound) and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153drag effect of persistent Brexit uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is taking its toll on the UK economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The slowdown on the underlying three-month measure of GDP was largely driven by weaker service sector growth as car sales fell. That said, the service sector still made the largest contribution to overall economic activity, with manufacturing and construction adding little to overall UK growth. Thiru also warns that UK factories are suffering from higher import costs: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The widening in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit is a concern and reflects a sharp rise in goods imports. Trading conditions for UK exporters are deteriorating amid moderating global growth and uncertainty over Brexit. Businesses continue to report that the persistent weakness in sterling is hurting as much as its helping, with the weakening currency raising input costs. In another blow, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade gap with the rest of the world has widened. The ONS reports that the total trade deficit in goods and services widened by \u00c2\u00a33.1bn in August-October to \u00c2\u00a310.3bn. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goods deficit widened by \u00c2\u00a31.7bn during the quarter, as imports increased \u00c2\u00a33.6 billion, while exports increased by a lesser \u00c2\u00a31.9 billion. The traditional services surplus shrank by \u00c2\u00a31.3bn, due to a \u00c2\u00a31bn fall in exports and \u00c2\u00a30.3bn increase in imports. The ONS says: Trade in unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold) and chemicals had the largest widening effect on the goods deficit, which was partially offset by trade in cars in the three months to October 2018. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade in goods deficit with the EU has actually narrowed over the last year, by \u00c2\u00a32.8bn,. However, this was wiped out by a \u00c2\u00a33.2bn increase in the deficit with non-EU countries. Geoff Tily, senior economist at the TUC, is concerned that the UK has barely posted any growth since the summer: Howard Archer of EY Item Club has summed up the data: Naeem Aslam of Think Markets blames the Brexit saga for the slowdown: There is no doubt that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic data has deteriorated and the confidence has shattered among entrepreneurs. The ongoing Brexit saga has created nothing but the bad environment. This chart shows how the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate has petered out, as the bumper consumer spending boost in July drops out of the data. [Each data point compares a three-month growth period to the previous quarter] Rob Kent-Smith, head of national accounts at the ONS, says the UK economy has weakened this autumn: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153GDP growth slowed going into the autumn after a strong summer, with a softening in services sector growth mainly due to a fall in car sales. This was offset by a strong showing from IT and accountancy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Manufacturing saw no growth at all in the latest three months, mainly due to a decline in the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry. Construction, while slowing slightly, continued its recent solid performance with growth in housebuilding and infrastructure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has now barely grown over the last three months. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth report shows that GDP was flat in August and September, before inching up by 0.1% in October Newsflash: the UK economy only grew by 0.1% in October, as manufacturing stumbles. This dragged the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarterly growth rate down to just 0.4%, from 0.6% in July-September. In a worrying sign, the Office for National Statistics also reported that manufacturing output shrank by 0.9% in October, the worst performance since March 2016. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a surprise, as we thought factories were busy stockpiling in case of a hard Brexit... The service sector grew by 0.2% in October, the ONS adds, while construction shrank by 0.2%. More to follow.... Over in Japan, prosecutors in Japan have charged Carlos Ghosn with under-reporting his income -- three weeks after the former Nissan chairman was dramatically arrested. And in another twist, prosecutors also indicted Nissan for filing false financial statements. That could leave other senior executives facing tough question, such as CEO Hiroto Saikawa, who was scathing about Ghosn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance after his arrest. Brexit anxiety is also bubbling in the markets today, as investors prepare for MPs to (probably) reject Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal tomorrow. The government is on track for a stonking defeat (assuming the vote goes ahead), meaning there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of chatter about leadership bids, no-confidence votes, and general elections. Shares in UK-focused companies such as house builders and retailers are among the top fallers in London this morning. And sterling is bobbing around $1.27, a whole five cents lower than in late September. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says Given the way political risk is starting to be priced into the market, we could see further losses if, or rather when, the prime minister loses her Brexit vote. Whilst a weaker pound could offer some support, a very high political risk premium would tend to trump that and drag the market lower. Investors will have to start, if they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already, price in the risk of a General Election and Labour-led government. In another twist, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top court has ruled that the UK can unilaterally stop the Brexit process, and remain in the EU on the same terms.... O.M.G Shares in UK outsourcing firm Interserve have cratered by three-quarters this morning, to just 6p, as the government contractor battles to negotiate its second rescue deal this year. The heavily indebted group, which has thousands of government contracts such as cleaning hospitals and serving school meals, said the rescue plan would mean substantial losses for current shareholders as the banks that have lent Interserve more than \u00c2\u00a3600m take control of the company. It hopes to wrap up a deal early next year. Interserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares plunged to 6p in early trading, giving it a market value of less than \u00c2\u00a39m. At its peak in 2014, the shares were worth more than 700p. European stock markets have followed Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead, dropping by around 0.6% in early trading. That takes them back towards last Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-year lows, wiping out some of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally. Italian FTSE MIB has lost almost 1%, leading the selloff, as investors show little appetite for risk. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153geopolitics has taken over.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The US ambassador to China has been summoned by Beijing in protest at the arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CFO, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s driving sentiment across Asia. Hopes of fruitful trade negotiations have taken a beating since the optimism that was around a week ago when the Buenos Aires G20 meeting prompted hope of a rally into the end of the year for equities. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses have dragged the Australian stock market to a two-year low (a milestone which Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 struck last week). Stock markets have also been hit by the news that Japan has suffered its worst contraction in four years. Revised GDP figures show that the Japanese economy shrank by 0.6% in July-September, or 2.5% on an annualised basis, worse than first estimated. Growth shrank as companies slashed spending, as the US-China trade war hurt demand for exports. Japan was also hit by several natural disasters during the quarter, including Typhoon Jebi (the worst in 25 years) and a destructive earthquake in Hokkaido. This forced factories to cut production. Artjom Hatsaturjants of Accendo Markets says Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contraction is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adding further fuel to the fire that set the stock markets red\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new week, but the same old story. Global financial markets are sliding amid worries about trade war tensions and the health of the global economy. Asia-Pacific stock markets have slumped today, taking their cue from Wall Street where shares closed in the red on Friday night (the Dow surrendered another 558 points). Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei has shed more than 2%, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite has lost 0.8%, while Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P/ASX 200 is the real laggard, down almost 2.3%. Stephen Innes of trading firm OANDA says investors have been left \u00e2\u20ac\u0153battered, bruised and running for cover\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses, which dragged European stocks down to a two-year low. Innes adds: A high level of circumspection continues to engulf the global market. Another day another reason to sell risk. Equity markets remain in a world of pain with everyone in search of a very elusive silver lining, or even Santa for that matter. Bloomberg argues that investors are spooked: To Nader Naeimi, a Sydney-based fund manager at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., the recent market weakness has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153narrative based\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as opposed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fundamentally based,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and investors are in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153get-me-out-of-here mood.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With every single market in the red, Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark MSCI Asia Pacific Index has erased November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.7 percent climb and is heading to its lowest level since end-October. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting a weak start in Europe too, with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 expected to dip by 0.5%. The arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief financial officer last week continues to worry the market. Investors fear that the truce agreed between Washington and Beijing will fracture, as China demands Meng Wanzhou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immediate release. As Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo, puts it:. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The biggest concerns for equity markets currently is the U.S.-China trade conflict and the Huawei incident. The trade theme will preoccupy the markets through the 90-day truce period between the United States and China, waiting for any signs of concession between the parties.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Also coming up today New GDP data will show how the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is faring. Economists predict growth of just 0.1%. The Agenda 9.30am GMT: UK GDP for October 2018 9.30am GMT: UK trade, manufacturing and services 3pm GMT: US JOLTS survey of job openings",

After nearly two years of negotiating a deal with the EU to try to pacify the Eurosceptic wing of her party, Prime Minister Theresa May is learning the hard way. There is no possible deal between the UK and the EU that respects the realities of international cooperation that can ever meet the fantasies of the Brexiteers in her party.</p> <p>The delay ultimately reflects the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s need to get parliamentary support for the Brexit outcome. Two thirds of Parliament is pro-EU or at least strongly in favour of a soft Brexit. In our view, we are seeing now the first stages of May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal failing.

A January vote on a slightly altered deal is possible but the language from her opponents isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t encouraging. A Conservative Leadership contest or a vote of no confidence engineered by the Labour Party are also possible but likewise, it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really clear what that would give us.

Goodnight! GW Not exactly a breakthrough, but maybe a glimmer of light? The pound is sliding close to Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 20-month low, following reports that the EU is stepping up its plans for a no-deal Brexit. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story: The EU is moving into full no-deal mode after Michel Barnier privately warned of a sudden escalation of risk, and France advised its fellow member states that planning for a cliff-edge Brexit now had to be their priority. As Theresa May embarked on a whistle-stop tour of EU capitals on Tuesday, Barnier, the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief negotiator, is understood to have given a stark analysis of the situation in a meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker and his fellow commissioners, suggesting that the danger of a complete breakdown had significantly increased. The European commission is to publish fresh no-deal warnings next week. During a visit to Berlin, May was reportedly told by Angela Merkel that there could be no renegotiation and that any appeals for help should be made in Brussels rather than brought to the capitals. In a sign of the heightened concerns, Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, took the unusual step of suggesting to his parliament that it was still in Downing Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gift to prevent a no-deal by revoking article 50 and turning its back on Brexit. More here: Optimism over a possible breakthrough in US-China trade negotiations helped the FTSE 100 to close 85 points higher at 6,806, up 1.27%. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax gained 1.5%, with France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC up 1.35%.

Markets are booming today as traders hold on to some hope that China and the US will strike a deal in relation to trade. There has been much detail around it, but it was confirmed that delegates from both sides are still in discussions.

The pound is dipping, amid talk that Theresa May could face a leadership battle soon. Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Beth Rigby has heard that at least 48 Conservative MPs have submitted letters of no confidence, enough to trigger a contest. This has knocked the pound down to $1.2539, a dip of 0.2% today. However, May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s critics in the European Reform Group, who dislike her deal, have struggled to mobilise support before..... Over in the eurozone, the Italian government has launched a new bid to avoid being sanctioned over its budget -- by point out that France is also breaking the rules. Italian deputy PM Luigi Di Maio has argued that the French government should also face EU disciplinary action, after promising wage rises and tax cuts to address the anger of the Gilets Jaunes protests. Di Maio declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the deficit/GDP rules are valid for Italy, then I expect them to be valid for Macron.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rome is still hoping to persuade Brussels to sign off its 2019 budget, which show a deficit of around 2.4%. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is now 130 points higher, meaning that around \u00c2\u00a333bn has been added to the value of its blue-chip members today. That will be welcomed by investors, who saw \u00c2\u00a355bn wiped off the Footsie last Thursday. Wall Street has joined the rally, as shares rise at the start of trading in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average has risen by 330 points, or 1.4%, in early deals. That report that China may cut US car tariffs is cheering investors, who are racing to buy shares in car makers and technology companies. Overnight, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former top central banker has also warned that the financial system isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prepared for the next crisis. Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve chair from 2013 to 2017, told an audience in New York that banking regulators still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the tools they need -- especially in the current drive to deregulate. Yellen warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think things have improved, but then I think there are gigantic holes in the system. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The tools that are available to deal with emerging problems are not great in the United States.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd David Lipton, the first deputy managing director of the IMF, has fired a loud warning shot this morning --- another financial crisis crisis may be looming. Speaking in London, Lipton warned that the task of preparing for the next crisis is still incomplete. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As we have put it, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfix the roof while the sun shines.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 But like many of you, I see storm clouds building, and fear the work on crisis prevention is incomplete.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lipton also called for more financial assistance for the IMF, to help the Fund fund future rescue packages. The US president has dropped a hint that China is making concessions on trade..... After a few very rough weeks, investors are grasping onto the prospect that China will soon cut tariffs on US cars. The London stock market has jumped by 1.7%, and there are even stronger gains in Frankfurt and Paris too. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still plenty of anxiety in the markets, as Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA explains: A Santa rally is looking increasingly unlikely, with risk appetite becoming more depressed by the day and the outlook for the global economy looking more challenging. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re now seeing daily commentary it seems about the progress of talks between the US and China but the reality is that this is going to be a process that moves at a glacial pace but the fact that talks are happening are a reason to be optimistic. Breaking away from Brexit... and European stock markets are surging thanks to an apparent breakthrough in the US-China trade dispute. Bloomberg sparked the rally, by reporting that Beijing had taken a step towards cutting tariffs on imported US cars. That levy is currently 40% of the car\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value - higher than for other countries. You might remember that Donald Trump claimed last week that he had won an important concession when he met president Xi Jinping at the G20 meeting. Bloomberg says: A proposal to reduce tariffs on cars made in the U.S. to 15% from the current 40% has been submitted to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cabinet to be reviewed in the coming days, according to people familiar with the matter. The step hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been finalized and could still change. Top Chinese and American trade officials spoke by phone Tuesday morning Beijing time, signaling that dialog between the two nations on trade issues is at least continuing despite a diplomatic row over the arrest of a senior Chinese businesswoman [Meng Wanzhou of Huawei]. Such a move would boost auto-makers, including European companies with factories in America. Volkswagen shares have risen by 4%, Daimler are up 2.8%, and tiremaker Continental has gained 4.05%. This has pushed the German DAX up by almost 2%, putting European stock markets on track for their best day in several months. So, a Trump triumph? Not exactly.... Beijing only hiked US car tariffs to 40% this summer, once the US began slapping tariffs on Chinese imports. So a reduction might simply being us back to where we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have been without a trade war. Theresa May has now arrived in Berlin for talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel. The visit hit a small hitch, though, as the PM was briefly unable to unilaterally exit her own car. Here are some more interesting nuggets from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK unemployment report: The pound is just clinging onto its earlier gains against the dollar, and still trading up half a cent at $1.261. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to dollar weakness. Against the euro, sterling is basically flat at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1065. Jamie McGeever of Reuters points out that sterling had one of its worst days in the last decade yesterday: There are plenty of reports that UK wage growth has hit a 10-year high. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true.... if you ignore the impact of inflation. But once that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factored in, wage growth drops from 3.3% to around 1%. The Treasury have taken a break from their no-deal Brexit planning to welcome today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment data: But TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady argues that British workers need more help, and bulkier pay packets to make up for earnings lost since the 200 crash. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The rise in pay growth is little consolation for workers in the middle of the longest pay squeeze in 200 years, with real wages expected only to get back to pre-crisis level in 2024. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need a plan that supports jobs and wages. That means the government putting the minimum wage up to \u00c2\u00a310 as quickly as possible. And it means giving unions the freedom to enter every workplace and negotiate fair pay rises.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You can see the impact of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity cutbacks in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data. Thanks to pay caps, public sector wages are lagging behind those in the private sector, with the gap widening last month: The Resolution Foundation have spotted that workers in hospitality, real estate, ICT, wholesale and health and social work are getting the chunkiest pay rises. Stephen Clarke, their senior economic analyst, adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While Brexit uncertainty and political paralysis are having a cooling effect on the wider economy, the labour market is proving more resilient.... \u00e2\u20ac\u01532019 looks set to be a far better year for pay than this one. But after a pretty appalling decade, Britain remains some way off a return to the levels of real pay we enjoyed before the crash.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The jump in wages last month suggests firms are struggling to find enough workers -- which would be a real problem if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to finalise your Brexit contingency plan. Suren Thiru, Head of Economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), confirms that recruitment is a problem: Businesses report that the political and economic turbulence, together with significant difficulties finding the right staff, are diminishing recruitment intentions, which is likely to increasingly weigh on the UK labour market over the near term. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153More must be done to support firms looking to recruit. Businesses are still waiting for the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-delayed Immigration White Paper to shed light on how they will be able to plug local shortages in the future and find the skills they need to grow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Economist Shaun Richards points out that wages seem to have accelerated strongly in October: Geraint Johnes, Professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School, has swiftly analysed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs data. His conclusion: pay growth is gathering pace as the UK economy continues to heal the wounds from the financial crisis a decade ago: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest labour force statistics indicate a rise in unemployment of 20000 over the quarter to August-October this year, the unemployment rate now standing at 4.1%. Employment, however, has continued to rise at a healthy pace, with an increase in the numbers of full-time employees of some 100000. Moreover, the gradual shift from part-time to full-time employment has continued, as has the shift of activity from self-employment to employee status. Particularly notable is a decline of 40000 in the numbers of part-time self-employed workers. These trends all align with a narrative of continued adjustment to normality following the severe labour market disruption of the recession and slow recovery. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The data on pay continue to be encouraging. On the preferred three month measure, total pay rose at an annual rate of 3.3% in October, up from 3.1% the previous month. The less reliable single month estimate indicates growth of 3.9% - though this should be treated with caution because the base figure in October 2017 appears low. Nonetheless there does now seem to be some momentum building behind pay growth, and, real pay is now consistently growing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c albeit still at a rate slower than the historical trend. This is likely to factor into Bank of England decisions on interest rates over the coming months, alongside the uncertainties surrounding Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite all the political uncertainty, around 396,000 more jobs have been created in the UK in the last year. Many were in IT, healthcare and social work, as this chart shows: The government will surely be pleased that UK firms are still creating jobs, despite uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. Bad news: The number of people unemployment in the UK rose by 20,000 in August-October. The Office for National Statistics reports that the unemployment total has risen to 1.38 million, up from 1.36m in May-July. But there are also 79,000 more people in work than in May-July, taking the total to 32.48m. This chart shows how UK wages are rising at a 10-year high. However, once you adjust for inflation, earnings are only rising at the fastest rate since the end of 2016: Newsflash: UK pay growth has hit its highest level in 10 years. Basic pay jumped by 3.3% per year in the three months to October, according to the latest survey of the labour market. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 3.2% last month. Total pay, including bonuses, also rose by 3.3% - up from 3.0%. This is the strongest nominal pay growth since the financial crisis a decade ago, and will bring households some comfort as they watch the Brexit crisis play out. It means wages are also still rising faster than prices -- inflation was 2.2% in October. More to follow.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx on the markets this morning. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the day of the big vote! Oh, wait a minute... After Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political pummelling, following zombie PM Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to delay Parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote on her Brexit deal in favour of another trip to the continent, the pound got off to an uneasily positive start on Tuesday. Against the dollar it rose 0.4%, just about lifting cable above $1.26, a smidge higher than yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 20 month nadir. Against the euro, meanwhile, it could only reclaim 0.1%, sterling languishing at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.107. After an edgy start, the pound is clawing back a little ground. Sterling has just risen back over $1.26 against the US dollar, half a cent higher than last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. The mini-recovery comes as the Leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, told BBC Radio 4 that the EU might give some last-minute concessions..... Theresa May will have a busy day, Reuters reports: The chairman of European Union summits Donald Tusk is scheduled to meet British Prime Minister Theresa May at 1600 GMT on Tuesday, his spokesman said. May is on a tour of EU capitals to seek last minute changes to the already agreed deal on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU in order to push the agreement through British parliament. She is to meet Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and finish with a meeting with Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. City investors are divided over whether the UK will end up with a hard Brexit, a soft Brexit, or even no Brexit at all But they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re united on one point -- Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation in the eyes of the world has been damaged by events yesterday. Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg reckons Theresa May is wasting precious time by jetting back to European capitals this week: While it adds to near-term uncertainty, it does not raise the hard Brexit risk by much. May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal only had a narrow chance of success on a first vote anyway. After nearly two years of negotiating a deal with the EU to try to pacify the Eurosceptic wing of her party, Prime Minister Theresa May is learning the hard way. There is no possible deal between the UK and the EU that respects the realities of international cooperation that can ever meet the fantasies of the Brexiteers in her party. The delay ultimately reflects the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s need to get parliamentary support for the Brexit outcome. Two thirds of Parliament is pro-EU or at least strongly in favour of a soft Brexit. In our view, we are seeing now the first stages of May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal failing. While exacerbating near-term uncertainty, the delay could be a step on the way to an ultimately softer Brexit outcome. We still see only a 10% chance of a hard Brexit But Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services fears Britain could plunge out on 29 March without a withdrawal agreement. The UK parliament appears to know no shame in its efforts to plunge the country ever deeper into a constitutional crisis. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation on the global stage has and will continue to be badly tarnished by this whole process, and it will take a very long time for it to be rebuilt, even if a still seemingly unlikely Article 50 withdrawal were to be the end result. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcaccidental hard #Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 probability is indeed rising. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale believes all options are still on the table: As Theresa May heads off around Europe looking for some help, the only thing that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certain is that uncertainty will be prolonged into the New Year. A January vote on a slightly altered deal is possible but the language from her opponents isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t encouraging. A Conservative Leadership contest or a vote of no confidence engineered by the Labour Party are also possible but likewise, it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really clear what that would give us. A no-deal Brexit, a version of the current deal and a second vote are all still possible, as is a General Election. Not the cheeriest breakfast meeting.... Theresa May is now in the Hague for talks with Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte (usually a UK ally). Rutte, though, wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say whether May will get anything more than breakfast out of him.... Brussels is sticking to its guns this morning. European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has insisted the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement will not be reopened. That won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give the pound much of a lift. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy guide to what on earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on.... And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what Fleet Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finest makes of it all: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound is in the eye of a big political storm this morning, after Brexit took another dramatic and surreal twist yesterday. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to postpone the parliamentary vote on her Withdrawal Agreement wiped two cents off the pound yesterday, sending it reeling to a 20-month low. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not managed much a recovery overnight, and is bobbing around $1.257 - 15% below its value before the referendum in June 2016. So City traders who had been expecting drama tonight are instead looking nervously at Westminster, wondering exactly what is going on. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says the pound is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in trouble\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as Theresa May heads to Brussels in search of a better deal (although the EU insists it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reopen the package). As the week progresses markets will be keeping a very close eye on whether May has the ability to renegotiate with Brussels in a bid to save the deal, if she will end up facing a leadership challenge, or the possibility of a second Brexit referendum. With the chaos in Westminster raising the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit scenario, the British Pound is in trouble. Already this morning, several opposition leaders have written to May, accusing her of showing contempt for Parliament over pulling the vote. They also want to know whether the previous deadline of of 21 January for the vote still applies. Meanwhile, May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s critics within her own party are renewing their push to overthrow the PM. Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister, wants fellow MPs to send in letters of no confidence - they need 48, and are someway short right now. Paul Mumford, fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management, predicts that the pound will remain jumpy in the next few weeks: Mrs May has postponed the vote to seek further assurances on the back stop agreement whilst others may want a renegotiated back stop or in a best case a complete removal. A hard exit would inevitably mean a hard border with Northern Ireland, which is likely to make life difficult moving forward with the potential for a complete and damaging reversal of the Good Friday agreement. The priority is now to get some sense of what MP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from all sides of the house will accept before May can attempt to broker a further solution. With so much noise and confusion on the subject, investors and markets are in a state of possible lock down as we await further clarity and a majority of opinion. Further market uncertainty and rumours on Brexit will dictate swings in the market, and as liquidity begins to dissipate ahead of Christmas then movements will continue to be volatile. Also coming up today New unemployment data will show whether UK workers are suffering from the Brexit uncertainty. Economists predict that wage growth was unchanged last month, at 3.2%, and that the unemployment rate stuck at just 4.1%. Bloomberg are holding a day-long conference on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Global Regulatory Forum Agenda\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That may not sound as exciting as Brexit, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important stuff -- asking whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re ready for the next crisis.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back later if there are any major market developments.... Theresa May will address Conservative MPs shortly, ahead of tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confidence vote. The City has already given its verdict, though, sending the pound up by 1.75 cents against the US dollar today to $1.266, recovering some of its tumble earlier this week: Ken Odeluga of City Index says the markets are quite buoyant, despite the British government wobbling on the brink of collapse. He reckons some traders are calculating that Brexit could yet be halted. The news that enough Conservative MPs have submitted a letter to trigger a No Confidence vote in is seismic. But markets have long been willing to look past heightened hard Brexit risk if events take a turn that could avoid Brexit entirely. Such thinking looks to be in play again. For one thing, whilst Theresa May has pledged to fight the confidence vote with everything she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got, she has also toughened warnings to Brexiteers about the chance of a No Brexit. Her statement earlier noted that a new leader \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to renegotiate a withdrawal agreement\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6so one of their first acts would have to be extending or rescinding Article 50, delaying \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or even stopping it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. At the same time, remain campaigners have dropped support for the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNorway-plus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 alternative Brexit deal to concentrate on a second referendum. Senior opposition Labour Party figures, officially neutral to the idea, have moved almost to full endorsement. Leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Sunday that another referendum would have to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153qualitatively different to the one held before\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Despite the latest drama in Westminster, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as much panic as you might expect when a prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job is hanging in the balance. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool explain: It definitely looks chaotic at the moment but we have not reached levels of national crisis yet. Economic policy uncertainty (as measured by related articles in 650 UK newspapers) currently remains 12 times lower than what we observed the day after the Referendum vote and also 2 times lower than April 18 2017 (when Mrs May announced a snap election). With this in mind, we are still far from a large-scale crisis. However, UK economic policy would look rather more uncertain if Theresa May was ousted by her own party tonight... To the extent that Mrs May survives the no confidence vote tonight, it looks more likely than not that she will take a much tougher stance against Conservative Brexiteers which should also reassure our EU partners that the British prime minister remains a strong and indeed the only negotiator (our side). Any other outcome tonight will trigger a surge in policy uncertainty which will bring to mind the events of June 24th 2016 when Mark Carney and his BoE staff had to step in to provide emergency liquidity support to boost the economy. The Dow is continuing to rise, now up 350 points at 24,721, as New York traders continue to hail signs of progress in the trade war. The war of words, and tit-for-tat tariffs, didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deter a Chinese music streaming service from floating in New York today. Tencent Music, the media wing of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s internet giant, happily rang the opening bell today to mark the occasion. However, the IPO didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raise as much money as the company hoped, as CNN explains. Tencent Music, which dominates music streaming in China, said Wednesday that its listing priced at the bottom of its targeted range. By selling shares at $13 each, the company is raising nearly $1.1 billion, roughly half the amount it was reportedly seeking to raise earlier this year.The shares start trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker TME. Tencent Music is going public at a volatile time for tech stocks, which have been rattled by the unpredictable trade war between the United States and China. Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank have both declined to comment on those reports that the German government is working towards a merger. German Finance Ministry spokesperson also said that they do not comment on media rumour or speculation.... Back in Europe, shares in Deutsche Bank have surged by 5% following reports that the German government is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intensifying efforts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to help the company. This apparently includes smoothing the way to a merger with rival Commerzbank. Bloomberg has more details: The high-level discussions -- which have included Finance Minister Olaf Scholz and Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing-- are looking at concrete ways the government can assist in a potential combination of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest lenders, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing the private deliberations. The talks include potentially changing existing laws to make the steps necessary for a merger less costly, they said. Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares hit fresh record lows this month, as the company struggles to shake off legal threats - including its involvement in the Danske Bank money-laundering scandal. Industrial firms and miners are leading the rally in Wall Street today. Construction equipment maker Caterpillar is up 2.3%, industrial conglomerate 3M is up 1.8%, and Boeing has gained 1.34%. Technology firms are also rising, with Microsoft up 1.6%. The pound is continuing to climb, and is now up 1.5 cents today at $1.264. That makes it the best-performing major currency, as traders continue to predict that Theresa May will win tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confidence vote. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a two-day high, and five whole cents below its levels in September. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, there are three reasons why trade war optimism is trumping pessimism today. 1) The WSJ is reporting that China is revising its economic plan to give foreign companies more access. That could address some of the White House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns. 2) Beijing has told US officials that it will cut the tariff on US cars from 40% down to 15%. That would take the levy back down its levels before the trade war flared up this year. 3) President Trump has hinted that he could use the arrest of Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CFO as leverage to hammer out a trade deal. He said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whatever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for this country, I would do.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Boom! Wall Street is surging in early trading, as traders grasp onto signs that the US-China trade war is cooling. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 306 points, or 1.25%, to 24,677 points. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are both rallying, up over 1%. Professor Christopher Balding, a China expert, says it would be very significant if Beijing is indeed rethinking its economic plans (see last post). Others are sceptical, such as Scott Paul of the Alliance for American Manufacturing.... ...financial commentator Jim Cramer is also cautious. NEWSFLASH: Chinese officials are rewriting their economic plans in response to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war threats, according to the Wall Street Journal. In what would be a major switch, Beijing is drafting a replacement for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Made In China 2025\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd policy driven by president Xi. The new plan would give foreign companies greater access to China -- one of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key demands. The WSJ says: China plans to replace an industrial policy savaged by the Trump administration as protectionist with a new program promising greater access for foreign companies, according to people briefed on the matter, in a move to resolve trade tensions with the U.S. Nothing official yet, of course. But it could allow Trump to claim victory in the trade talks, and potentially remove the threat of new tariffs being imposed on Chinese imports. Boom! The pound has risen back over $1.26, as the City becomes increasingly certain that Theresa May will win tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confidence vote. May needs 159 votes to ensure victory; Sky News has been totting up the various displays of loyalty, and reckon she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty much there. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a secret ballot, of course, so things could change (but if you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trust the word of a member of parliament, what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the world coming to?). So Sterling has now rallied by 1%, or 1.2 cents today, to $1.2607. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a one-day high, though. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, believes the scale of May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success will be crucial in determining what happens next... If May wins the vote by a narrow margin, fears of failure or a vote of no confidence in the Commons will intensify, although ironically the impact of a general election on sterling is difficult to call as it would introduce a real prospect of reversing Brexit altogether. If May loses tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote, all hell will break loose for sterling as several scenarios that were previously tail risks become more plausible, with the net effect being to substantially increase the likelihood of a catastrophic no deal outcome. Just in: US inflation has slowed, giving policymakers another reason not to tighten monetary policy much further. Consumer prices were unchanged month-on-month in November, as the recent drop in the oil price fed through to people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pockets. That pulled the annual inflation rate down to 2.2%, from 2.5% in October. However, core inflation (stripping out food and fuel) rose to 2.2% from 2.1% last month. The Federal Reserve is likely to still raise interest rates again next week, but it could easily resist further hikes in 2019.... Soybeans are healthy stuff - packed with protein, iron and B-vitamins. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also a handy guide to the health of the world economy. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s notable that the price of soybeans in Chicago has jumped today, on optimism that the US and China are making progress in their trade talks. Donald Trump sparked the rally, claiming last night that China was back in the market for US soybeans. The president declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I just heard today that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re buying tremendous amounts of soybeans. They are starting, just starting now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wheat prices have also risen; Reuters has the details: The most-active soybean contract on the Chicago Board Of Trade gained 0.7 percent to $9.21-3/4 a bushel, after touching its highest since Dec. 3 at $9.23 a bushel. Wheat was up 0.8 percent at $5.25-1/4 a bushel, having closed down 0.8 percent on Tuesday, and corn added 0.4 percent at $3.86-1/4 a bushel, having gained 0.2 percent in the previous session. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Richard Partington on the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction to tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confidence vote: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Stephen Martin, the director general of the Institute of Directors, also criticised MPs. Martin said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The last thing businesses needed today was even more uncertainty \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and yet politics has managed to deliver on that once again. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many business leaders, along with the rest of the country, will be tearing their hair out at the state of Westminster politics at the moment. We are edging closer and closer to no deal as a result of constant can-kicking and internal domestic political strife.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wall Street is expected to pick up the baton, and rally when trading begins in under three hours: Good news. European factories have shaken off the trade war jitters. Eurozone industrial production rose by 0.2% in October rebounding from a 0.6% decline in September. That may show that growth is still holding up, despite various headwinds. European carmakers are romping ahead today, on hopes that China will swiftly slash it tariff on American car imports. In Frankfurt, Volkswagen has gained 2.2%, BMW is up 2%, while Daimler is 1.4% higher. And in Paris, Peugeot are 3% higher, while Renault has gained 1%. Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital, thinks investors should tread cautiously. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The equity markets are taking encouragement from recent reports of a potential truce in the US-China trade dispute. China is said to be considering the removal of the increased tariff on US auto imports, with President Donald Trump saying he would intervene in the case of the arrested Huawei CFO if it would help secure a trade deal with China. Asian equity markets are all positive this morning as a result. Of course, the newsflow regarding developments in the US-China trade dispute has been notoriously erratic and positive news can quickly give way to negative news.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Deutsche Bank reckons a Theresa May win tonight would be good for stocks....while a defeat could send investors scurrying for cover: The UK stock market is pushing higher. Stocks are being boosted by trade war optimism and expectations that Theresa May will live to fight another day tonight. The FTSE 100 is now up 73 points or 1% at 6880 -- on track for its second decent rally in a row. Miners, utility companies, tech firms and banks are all among the big risers. The FTSE 250, which is more focused on the UK economy than the FTSE 100, has gained 0.75%. Retailers are struggling, though, following this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning from Superdry and the big loss at Dixons Carphone. After some number crunching, the City expects the PM to win tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confidence vote by a decent margin. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says: The markets seem somewhat shell-shocked by Westminster shenanigans and the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first reaction was to move a notch higher on a mixture of hopes that Brexit might end up being delayed or potentially not even happen. The pound may be calm now, but that would swiftly change Theresa May was forced from power by her own party tonight. Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to fight for her job has left the pound in a state of limbo. With rumours now driving the currency as much as facts, the rest of the day for both market watchers and political analysts will be spent adding up Tory MPs and trying to work out whether the PM will be ousted. Uncertainty is the word of the day, and all eyes will be on tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote. The prospect of a general election would not be good news, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no secret that sterling strives for stability.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Japanese bank Numura agrees: The British Chambers of Commerce are usually a restrained bunch. But they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve absolutely let rip this morning, at the news that Theresa May faces a confidence vote tonight, potentially plunging the UK into even more political upheaval. Dr Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), says this latest drama is simply unacceptable. With jobs and growth at risk, MPs should be focused on resolving Brexit, not trying to elbow the prime minister out of the door, he argues. Marshall declares: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At one of the most pivotal moments for the UK economy in decades, it is unacceptable that Westminster politicians have chosen to focus on themselves, rather than on the needs of the country. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The utter dismay amongst businesses watching events in Westminster cannot be exaggerated. Our firms are worried, investors around the world are baffled and disappointed, and markets are showing serious strain as this political saga goes on and on. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153History will not be kind to those who prioritise political advantage over people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s livelihoods. Businesses need politicians, regardless of party or views on Brexit, to understand that their high-stakes gambles have real-world consequences of the highest order.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sterling is managing a small rally today, as Theresa May prepares to fight for her premiership tonight. The pound has gained half a cent against the US dollar to $1.254, which is three-quarters of a cent above Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 20-month low. Investors seem unrattled by the news that the Conservative Party will vote on whether they have confidence in May tonight. They expect May to win. A string of cabinet ministers are backing the PM, who has just appeared outside Downing Street to promise to fight tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with everything I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If she loses, Brexit may be postponed. A new prime minister would surely need to extend, or even cancel, Article 50 if they wanted to reopen negotiations with the EU. Also, the City doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a clearer idea than anyone else about how this political saga will play out Michael Brown, Senior Analyst at Caxton FX says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling has remained stable this morning despite a Conservative party leadership contest being triggered as Theresa May has vowed to contest the vote. The situation remains unclear at present, with the pound set to remain under pressure in the near-term until the result of the vote is known and the impact on Brexit negotiations becomes clear.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More gloom from the UK economy: electronics retailer Dixons Carphone has posted a \u00c2\u00a3440m loss -- but it insists it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cut jobs. My colleague Jasper Jolly explains: The big loss came in part because the company, formed through the merger of Dixons with Carphone Warehouse in 2014, was forced to write down the value of the mobile retailing brand which is now unprofitable, by \u00c2\u00a3344m. The loss, recorded in the 26 weeks to 26 October, compares starkly with a profit before tax of \u00c2\u00a354m in the equivalent period last year. Revenues rose by 2% on a like-for-like basis during the first half, to \u00c2\u00a34.9bn. The company said it has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153firm plans\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for \u00c2\u00a3200m of cost savings, with IT, supply chain and central office spending targeted, but the chief executive, Alex Baldock, said they would not be achieved through job losses among its 30,000-plus staff. Ouch! Shares in UK clothing group Superdry have plunged by over 30%, after it hit investors with a profits warning. Superdry, known for jackets, coats and hoodies, said it had suffered from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unseasonably warm weather\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in November and early December. This has wiped out \u00c2\u00a311m in profits for last month, with a similar impact expected in December unless \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trading conditions improve\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (ie, it gets a lot colder. Superdray also warned that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wider economic and political uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (hello Brexit) was also hurting. It now expected to post underlying profit before tax of \u00c2\u00a355m to \u00c2\u00a370m; analysts had been expecting \u00c2\u00a388m (earnings before interest and tax). European stock markets have opened higher, fuelled by hopes of trade war d\u00c3\u00a9tente. The FTSE 100 is up 27 points, or 0.4%,at 6835. Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says: China has reportedly agreed to cut tariffs on US cars \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from 40% to 15% - in a gesture aimed at de-escalating the trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. While the details of the cut are not yet known, the move reverses the tariff hike in July in response to those imposed by the US, which is hopefully a sign of more unwinding to come. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to be optimistic though as tensions remain high, with the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou further complicating the relationship, although Trump has suggested he could intervene, which makes the timing of the arrest all the more suspicious. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. As we stagger towards the end of a turbulent year, investors are clinging onto hopes that the US and China can patch up their trade dispute, while also fearing it could get a lot worse in 2019. Today there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s optimism, after reports that China has decided to cut the import duty on American cars - currently a chunky 40% - down to 15%. Top Chinese economic official Liu He reportedly gave US Treasury Steven Mnuchin and US trade representative Robert Lighthizer the good news on Monday evening. The Financial Times calls it the first \u00e2\u20ac\u0153concrete sign\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of a cooling in the trade war. It would reverse a retaliatory tariff hike announced earlier this year, as the two sides traded blow. Investors are also relieved to hear that Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CFO, Meng Wanzhou, has been released on bail in Canada. Meng faces charges of violating US sanctions against Iran; but US president Donald Trump has also weighed in, saying he could intervene in the case if it helped resolve the trade dispute. He told Reuters: If I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for the country, if I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is a very important thing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for national security \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an unusual statement, in an era of due process and judicial independence.... But still, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s triggered a rally across Asia. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei has gained 2%, Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P/ASX 200 is 1.6% higher, while South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kospi 200 is 1.4% higher. The pound, meanwhile, remains under the cosh as news breaks of a confidence vote in Theresa May tonight! Sterling is hovering below $1.25, a 20-month low. On the economic front, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out how eurozone factories fared last month, plus US inflation figures.

                "bodyText":"The Morrison government is forecasting a larger surplus of $4.1bn in 2019-20, revised up from $2.2bn, after a windfall surge in company and superannuation taxes this year. Voters can expect the Coalition to use the vastly improved budget condition to its favour in the election, with the prospect of more tax cuts on the table. In its mid-year economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo) statement, the government said higher-than-expected commodity prices in 2018 had contributed to expected tax receipts being revised up by $25.9bn over the four years to 2021-22. The revision reflects stronger-than-expected tax collections from individuals and companies, stronger employment growth projections and higher growth in corporate profits in 2018-19, particularly mining company profits. That means the budget will move from a deficit of $5.2bn in 2018-19 to a surplus of $4.1bn in 2019-20, with that surplus projected to grow to $12.5bn in 2020-21, and to $19bn in 2021-22. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg used the opportunity to amend a famous quote from former Labor treasurer Paul Keating, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These are the surpluses that Australia needs to have.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the government is already planning to use some of the larger savings in the budget to announce billions of dollars of election commitments \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153decisions taken but not yet announced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd show the government will announce $9.2bn in extra spending over the next three years. It will allocate $2.4bn in 2019-20, $3.8bn in 2020-21 and $3bn in 2021-22. That could include future tax cuts, or personal individual tax cuts that have already been announced being brought forward. Asked if the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election pitch would include further tax cuts, Frydenberg said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are committed to targeted spending and lower taxes \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to make any announcements today.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the news for workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 wages is not so rosy, with the government cutting its forecast for wages growth from six months ago. Treasury expects wages will grow by 3% in 2019-20, down from 3.25% in the May budget. But it then projects wages growth will pick up to 3.5% in 2020-21 and 2021-22. Other important economic indicators have also been revised down. Real GDP growth for 2018-19 has been revised down from 3% in the May budget to 2.75%; consumption growth from 2.75% to 2.5%; dwelling investment from 1.5% to 1%; inflation from 2.25% to 2%; and exports of goods and services from 4% to 2%. But the terms of trade (the prices the world is paying for Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exports relative to the prices Australia has been paying to import goods) have received a huge boost thanks to surging commodity prices. In the May budget, the government was expecting the terms of trade for 2018-19 to decline by 5.25%, but now it expects the terms of trade will improve by 1.25% this year. That has seen nominal GDP (the money Australia receives for the goods it produces) improve by a full percentage point in the last six months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from 3.75% growth expected in May to 4.75% today. As a result of its improved budget position, and the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s projected larger surpluses, net debt as a share of GDP is projected to decline faster than expected over the next decade, from 18.2% ($351.9bn) in 2018-19 to 1.5% ($48.4bn) in 2028-29. In its May budget, the government had projected net debt would be 3.8% of GDP in 2028-29. But debt projections have repeatedly been missed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the Abbott government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first budget in 2014-15, then-treasurer Joe Hockey estimated net debt would decline from 13.9% of GDP in 2014-15 ($226.4bn) to just 0.7% of GDP by 2024-25. Net debt is roughly $177bn higher than it was when the Abbott government took office in 2013 (it was $174.5bn on 30 September 2013). The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s improved budget position had much to do with the improved international economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we have seen in this economic update today \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 is that growth is down, investment growth is down, wages growth is down, consumption growth is down,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And the only thing that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up is the terms of trade \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what the world is prepared to pay us for our commodities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the one thing which this government has absolutely no influence over is up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When it comes to wages growth and consumption, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing the fruits of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor economic policy and the chaos and confusion at its heart.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Frydenberg said the budget update was a demonstration that the Coalition government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic plan was working. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of the proudest achievements of the government has been the creation of over 1.1m new jobs since we were elected in 2013,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This has seen the unemployment rate fall to a six-year low of 5%.

                "bodyText":"Finally, after a very rocky day, ASOS shares have closed at \u00c2\u00a326.14, a slump of 37.5%. That wipes \u00c2\u00a31.3bn off its value, sending it slumping from \u00c2\u00a33.5bn to \u00c2\u00a32.2bn. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of why: Asos has issued an unexpected profit warning after a poor November, becoming the latest retailer to be hit by weak consumer confidence, increased discounting and unusually mild weather. The downturn suggests the high street malaise is spreading to online retailers, with consumers worried about what Brexit will mean for their finances. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Goodnight. GW David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning at 7am today has hurt the retail sector badly today: The UK retail sector took a knock today after well-known ASOS shares were battered on the back of an earnings warning. ASOS shares have slumped after the online fashion house announced a profit warning. The group said that sales from September to November jumped by 14%, but there was a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsignificant deterioration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in November. The company previously predicted full-year sales growth of 20-25%, and now it anticipates just 15%. Profit margins have been revised down to 2% from 4%. Nick Beighton, the CEO, warned that the sector is experiencing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunprecedented levels of discounting\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Online companies have a major cost advantage over high street retailers, and it is worrying when they are concerned about consumer spending. UK retailers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only people feeling gloomy -- America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders are also feeling a chill. Back in the City, UK retailers are being hit even harder. Next are down 6.5%, Marks &amp; Spencer have lost 5%, Dunelm (home furnishings) has slumped by 10%, and Games Workshop (small metal figurines) are down 5.7%. JD Sports has tumbled by 8.4%, despite putting out a statement confirming that its Christmas trading statement is scheduled for 14 January 2019 (ie: they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not expecting a profits warning...) This is dragging London stock market deeper into the read, with the FTSE 100 down 1.1% and the FTSE 250 shedding 1.4%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault, though. Investors are also being spooked by a bad start to trading on Wall Street. Steve Dresser is continuing to spot examples of retailers taking, er, liberties with their Christmas gift pricing... Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are still being thumped today; still down 40% at \u00c2\u00a325,47, a loss of over \u00c2\u00a316 today. That has wiped almost \u00c2\u00a31.4bn off its market value today, down from \u00c2\u00a33.5bn to \u00c2\u00a32.1bn. It has also helped pull the AIM index (where Asos is listed) down to its lowest level in almost two years. Spice Girl turned fashion designer/businesswoman Victoria Beckham is also suffering from the tough retail environment. Losses at Beckham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s luxury fashion label rose to \u00c2\u00a310.2m last year, new figures show, up from \u00c2\u00a38.2m in the previous 12 months. The bad news keeps coming.... home furnishings and womenswear chain Laura Ashley is closing 40 stores. Laura Ashley blames the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153challenging environment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the UK, and warned things could get worse... Retail analyst Steve Dresser has spotted that UK retailer Fat Face is now offering cash off sales in the 2019, if shoppers will only buy something today.... With discounting rampant this year, some stores are being forced to cut prices to more realistic levels... George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, reckons Asos is particularly vulnerable to Brexit gloom because it targets younger shoppers: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The uncertainty around Brexit will be playing a major role, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably no coincidence Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key demographic of 20-somethings generally harbour more concerns over the future of the economy post-Brexit than their parents.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Julie Palmer, partner at consultancy Begbies Traynor, points out that many smaller online shops have hit trouble this autumn. Asos is not alone, although this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock profits warning has obviously caused alarm... Palmer explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Seeing this goliath of the online retail world start to wobble shows that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just the physical high street that needs to take a look at its model and resilience. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In fact, our own Red Flag Alert revealed that there has been a creeping undercurrent of online retailers suffering in the challenging climate this year with more than 8,000 online retailers in significant financial distress during Q3 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an increase of 8% since the same time in 2017. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A retailer issuing a profit warning this close to Christmas is never a good thing, but seeing one as big as ASOS issuing a profit is quite a clubbing for an industry that has already taken a battering.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Retailers across Europe are reeling from Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning: Brexit uncertainty has left many people too frightened to spend, says Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a blow to high street shops, web retailers such as ASOS, and other customer-facing firms, she explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waste time stressing about what Brexit might mean for your finances, focus instead on getting on top of them so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the best possible place to enjoy whatever happens down the road. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as simple as keeping track of what cash you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got coming in and going out, looking for easy ways to pay big companies less \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like switching your mortgage - paying off expensive borrowing and squirrelling away any spare cash you can afford so you have an emergency fund to fall back on just in case times get tight.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ouch: If Asos is struggling, then many other retailers will be doing even worse, reckons Andrea Felsted of Bloomberg. She argues: To some extent, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a surprise that the first seasonal shocker has come from Asos. It specializes in fast fashion. The conventional wisdom goes that internet retailers should be in a better position that beleaguered bricks and mortar stores when a squeeze on shopping comes. But the clothing sector has been hit by the double whammy of warm weather and rocky consumer confidence. While Brexit looks like it might become the next convenient excuse for poor trading, senior retailers say the downturn since October has been real. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as if someone switched the lights off. Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems show that the UK retail sector is in a serious fix, says Russ Mould, investment director at stockbrokers AJ Bell. He writes: It is not just that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stopped shopping on the high street, it is that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re spending less overall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everyone knew bricks and mortar retail was in trouble; after all, why struggle out to the shops and battle the crowds when everything you want is available at the click of a button from the comfort of your own home? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The read-through from ASOS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results is that consumers are feeling sufficiently nervous to put off purchases no matter how they make them. This will strike fear into other internet-based retailers and more traditional rivals who were banking on their web-based portals to get them out of trouble. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The alternative, which seems unlikely but can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be ruled out entirely, is that this is more of an ASOS-specific issue. Fashion is fickle and perhaps ASOS was not quite as on top of what its shoppers want as it has been historically. Interestingly, BooHoo has put out a statement which says its own trading remains strong (see here). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With just a week left of crucial Christmas trading we should have our answer to whether this is a micro or macro issue as January trading updates trickle in from across the sector.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kate Heseltine, analyst at Edison Investment Research, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The significance of the warning by ASOS, one of the leading online retailers, could hardly be higher for the consumer sector. Coming at the end of its first quarter, it entails a substantial judgment call for the rest of the year to August 2019 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a call that management has made negatively. It seems that Mike Ashley is not the only retailer to have experienced an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunbelievably bad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 November with online giant, ASOS, issuing a major profit warning in its Q1 trading update this morning. Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO Nick Beighton has held a conference call with journalists, and explained that the company lost out during last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Black Friday sales. Beighton said Asos knocked 20% off everything on Black Friday, the same promotion as in previous years, but its rivals offered much bigger price cuts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this means Asos will need to think about its approach to Black Friday. But he insisted that Asos had not lost any market share, saying overall consumer spending was down. The online fashion retailer has been struggling to sell higher-priced clothing such as womens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 jackets along with men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s branded sneakers, with customers preferring to buy cheaper items. Beighton noted that the disposable incomes of Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 20-something customers were still below the levels they were at a decade ago. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than just the Brexit-related factors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Indeed, consumer confidence is also fragile in Germany and France, where Asos generates 60% of its EU sales, he added. In another blow to the UK economy, people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confidence in their finances has slumped to a six-month low -- one of the reasons behind Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems? Data firm IHS Markit says its Household Finance Index has dropped to 43.9 in December, its lowest since June, from 44.4 in November. Markit warned that households are particularly worried about financial prospects in 2019, as they face rising costs and the uncertainty over Brexit. Economist Joe Hayes says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153(The) data demonstrate the negative impact that political and economic uncertainty is having on households. If sentiment continues to decline, the effect on the real economy may become more apparent in hard data if households begin to alter consumption behaviour.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The survey also found that Londoners are particularly gloomy about house prices. Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning is a clear sign that this Christmas will be tough for many retailers, warns business journalist Declan Curry: Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are plumbing new depths. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re now down 42% at \u00c2\u00a324.24, from \u00c2\u00a341.86 on Friday night. Other retailers are also being hammered, with Next and Marks &amp; Spencer plunging to the bottom of the FTSE 100 index this morning: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a similar picture on the FTSE 250 index (which includes smaller companies than the FTSE 100). JD Sports, Sports Direct and Dixons Carphone are all among the top fallers Several commentators are blaming Brexit for at least some of Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes. Matthew Vincent of the Financial Times says: Asos did not mention Brexit, but when it notes that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consumer confidence is increasingly fragile\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it can only be talking about one factor. Why else would it have to resort to so much discounting and promotional activity that it expects to halve its operating margin? Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning comes after consultancy Springboard said that the number of people visiting British shops in November was the worst since the 2008 recession, with so-called footfall at retail parks and high streets down 3.2 per cent on the year before. But, clearly, it is not just bricks and mortar shops any more. Anyone trying to blame the web alone for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hollowing out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high streets needs to look further afield than the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153web boys\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd... the Westminster boys would be a place to start. Asset manager Trevor Greetham also blames the deadlock over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU: Overnight, retail analysts at Springboard predicted that consumer spending is unlikely to pick up this week. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, predicted that sales will be 3% lower than last year, warning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are not anticipating it will be a bumper week by any means,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumers are feeling nervous about what might happen in the new year, particularly around Brexit. So people are not prepared to splash out this Christmas and are reining back on spending. More here: As an online-only retailer, Asos should be protected from the well-known problems hitting Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high streets. But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning suggest that e-commerce is also struggling. Weak consumer confidence must be a factor, thanks to Brexit, the US-China trade war, and the slowing eurozone economy. The recent mild weather has also hurt retailers; a warm autumn cuts the need for a new winter coat. Neil Wilson of Markets.com explains: We do note softer consumer confidence in general \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is not just about the high street creaking under the weight of rising wage costs and legacy store portfolios. There has also been a weather factor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c every retailer that ever existed blames the weather but to a degree we must accept it has been a factor this year..... Online businesses have seemed immune but the warning from Asos today suggests they too are at risk from the cyclical slowdown. We must stress that the Asos warning is indicative of a cyclical slowdown rather than being suggestive of the structural problems facing the high street. Retail analyst Nick Bubb says analysts are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shell-shocked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning this morning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The share price of Asos has been under some pressure recently, as if the City sensed that something might be amiss, but we certainly weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting the online fashion giant to issue a huge profit warning today,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Boohoo has just issue a statement to the City, insisting that it is not suffering from Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes. The company says: Boohoo group plc, a leading online fashion group, is pleased to confirm that the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading performance remains strong, with record Black Friday sales across the group and continues to trade comfortably in line with market expectations. The group will provide an update for the four month trading period to December 31st on January 15th 2019. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only providing limited comfort - Boohoo shares are down 9% this morning, having crashed by almost 20% at the open. Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market capitalisation (the value of the company) has slumped from \u00c2\u00a33.5bn to \u00c2\u00a32.2bn Shares in Asos have plunged by 35% at the start of trading in London. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an absolute rout, and shows that its profits warning has really worried the City. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve fallen to \u00c2\u00a326.73, from \u00c2\u00a341.86 on Friday night. That looks to be their lowest level since February 2016. Shares in high street chain Next have slumped by 5%, as Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pessimism chills the retail sector The London stock market is open, and investors are racing to sell shares in clothing and retail companies. In early trading: JD Sports has lost 4.3% Marks &amp; Spencer shares are down 3% Associated British Foods, which owns Primark, are down 1.2%. Ted Baker has lost 3.6% We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re waiting for Asos shares to start trading.... Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t confined to the UK. It explains: Trading conditions across our two largest markets of Germany and France, which account for c.60% of EU sales, have become significantly more challenging. Financial analyst and journalist Louise Cooper points out that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy shrank in the last quarter: Asos isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pinning its hopes on a late surge in Christmas spending.... Men have been buying fewer sneakers, apparently.... Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive is speaking to City analysts now. Nick Beighton is blaming an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunprecedented\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 surge in price cuts this autumn, which has badly hurt profits. Beighton also says that trading in continental Europe has also weakened: Shares in Boohoo, a rival online fashion chain, are expected to fall by 5% this morning, as investors digest Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning. You can see Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning online, here. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the top line: Asos reckons it is still outperforming the wider UK retail sector, as weak consumer confidence hits shops hard. It says: In the UK, ASOS continues to materially outperform in its home market with sales growth in the year-to-date (1 September through 30 November) of +19% (cc: 19%), although this has been achieved at the cost of more promotional activity than initially planned and consumers buying into lower priced product. Consumer confidence is increasingly fragile as evidenced by the most recent BRC data. City traders are predicting that Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares will tumble by 15% to 20% when trading begins, in under half an hour. Asos has been one of the leading lights in the UK retail sector for years, so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning is a serious issue. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some early reaction: Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO Nick Beighton says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We achieved 14% sales growth in a difficult market, but in the light of a significant downturn in November, we think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prudent to recalibrate our expectations for the full year. We are taking all appropriate actions and our ambitions for ASOS have not changed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. ASOS has slashed its forecasts for sales growth and earnings, following weak trading in November. Gross profit margins will be narrower than last year, as the company is forced to discount its clothing. The company is also trimming its capital spending plans, as it hunkers down. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revised guidance: Sales growth: c.15% (previously +20-25%) Retail gross margin: c.-150bps (previously flat at 49.9%) EBIT margin: c.2% (previously c.4%) Capital expenditure re-phased down to c.\u00c2\u00a3200m Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Online fashion store Asos has rocked the UK retail sector by issuing a profits warning, and warning that trading has taken a nasty plunge in the run-up to Christmas. In an unscheduled announcement, Asos has told the City that it experienced a significant deterioration in November - a crucial trading month for the company (and the rest of the retail sector too!). The company also warns that current trading remains \u00e2\u20ac\u0153challenging\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - with just one week to go until Christmas Day. Asos says: Whilst trading in September and October was broadly in line with our expectations, November, a very material month for us from both a sales and cash margin perspective, was significantly behind expectations. The current backdrop of economic uncertainty across many of our major markets together with a weakening in consumer confidence has led to the weakest growth in online clothing sales in recent years. We have recalibrated our expectations for the current year accordingly. This comes just days after Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mike Ashley warned that last month was the worst November for the retail sector in living memory. It will fuel concerns that consumers are cutting back in the face of economic uncertainty, and anxiety over how Brexit is playing out. More to follow....",

A tricky task, with Wall Street suffering one of its worst December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever.... Goodnight! GW US treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin has a theory -- the market turmoil is due to two factors -- high-frequency trading, and regulations brought in after the last financial crisis. Mnuchin singled out the Volcker Rule, which prevents banks from banks from taking risky bets with their own money, or pumping it into hedge funds. This, Mnuchin claims, is removing liquidity and making market moves more abrupt. He told Bloomberg: In my opinion, market structure has led to a lot more volatility. Part of this is a combination of the market presence of high-frequency traders combined with the Volcker Rule.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a theory... however, HFT and the Volcker Rule have both been around for years, so they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the only cause. Plus, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no secret that the White House want to roll back the Dodd-Frank rules (of which Volcker is part), despite concerns it could lead to more reckless behaviour. Get caught up on the markets: The US stock market is clinging onto its gains, with the S&amp;P 500 still up almost 1% today. Oil, though, continues to wallow at 15-month lows as traders anticipate weak demand in 2019. Stock market analyst Ronnie Chopra suspects that some UK companies are now vulnerable to a takeover bid, following recent stock market losses.... Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip stock index has just hit its lowest closing level in over two years. Amid worries over the global economy, and Brexit, the FTSE 100 has closed 71 points lower at 6701. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest closing level since November 2016 (although it fell below 6700 earlier this month in intraday trading). National Grid is the biggest faller, down 9%, after energy regulator Ofgem announced a shake-up that could cut bills. Energy firms BP and Royal Dutch Shell are also among the big fallers, tracking the slump in the oil price today. Technology, healthcare, and telecoms firms also had a bad day, while consumer-focused stocks also lost ground. European stock markets also fell today; the Stoxx 600 lost 0.6% as investors worry that the global economy is weakening. The Brent crude oil price has also slumped to its lowest level in over a year. Brent, sourced from the North Sea, is down almost 4% at $57.28, the lowest since October 2018. Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small recovery, this month is turning into one of the worst December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history. Indeed, Reuters has calculated that it could be the worst December since the Great Depression.... Global growth fears are sending the oil price sliding again. US crude has dropped below $48 per barrel for the first time since mid-September, 2017, extending recent losses. That indicates traders believe excessive supply, and lacklustre growth, will keep crude prices down in 2019. Back in London, the FTSE 100 is falling close to a two-year low. The blue-chip index is now down 52 points, or 0.75%, at 6,721. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less than 20 points away from the 25-month low struck earlier this month. Although Wall Street is still up, a 1% rise isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything to shout about - given the Dow lost 2% on both Friday and Monday. David Madden of CMC Markets thinks the rally lacks conviction, despite the welcome pick-up in US house-building reported today. Equity markets have bounced back today, but the upward move hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been driven by anything, and that is a little worrying, as it might just be a mixture of short covering and bargain hunting. The severe sell-off that was endured yesterday is still fresh in traders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds, and there is a sense that dealers want to get tomorrows Fed announcement out of the way, before formulating their next move. For a change, there was some upbeat housing data from the US. Building permits ticked up to 1.32 million in November, which topped the forecast of 1.25 million. Keep in mind, the October reading was 1.26 million. The housing starts reading was 1.25 million, which was an improvement on the 1.21 million in October. Admittedly, these figure weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t amazing, but they are a bright spot on a largely bleak housing figures. The Wall Street rally is being led by consumer-focused companies including Nike (+2.4%), and Visa (+1%). Industrial firms such as Boeing (+3.75%) and General Electric (+3.6%) are also up, as are financial stocks such as JP Morgan (+1.8%). The dollar, meanwhile, is dipping as investors brace for the Federal Reserve meeting tomorrow night. Fawad Razaqzada of FXTM explains: The greenback has been undermined by growing speculation that, at best, the Federal Reserve will deliver a dovish rate hike, while there is a possibility \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a small possibility, but a possibility nonetheless \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that it could even hold off hiking altogether. Most sectors of the US stock market are up, as traders try to shake off the pessimism gripping the markets. Bank share are rallying, after several tough weeks. But still, the overall picture is gloomy: Ding Ding! Wall Street is open, and shares are trying to recover after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 197 points at the open, or 0.85%. The broader S&amp;P 500 has gained 0.75%, after hitting a 14-month low yesterday. The Nasdaq index, focused on tech stocks, has gained almost 1%. Economist Ian Shepherdson makes a good point about the US housing stats: Just in: Home construction in America accelerated last month, in a sign that the economy can handle higher interest rates (whatever Donald Trump tweets). New housing starts jumped by 3.2% last month to an annual rate of 1.256 million, the Commerce Department says. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a seven-month high. The number of permits handed out for future housing projects also rose, up 5% compared with October. However... construction of single-family homes dropped to an 18-month low; the rise in housing starts was mainly due to more multi-family housing projects. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some snap reaction: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Investors are fleeing stocks and buying bonds in record numbers amid the global sell-off in equities, according to a December survey of fund managers released on Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors are approaching extreme bearishness ... this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey [found] the biggest ever one-month rotation into the asset class\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of bonds, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in the survey. The research report is one of the most widely-followed surveys of investors on Wall Street. Phew! After two days of serious losses, Wall Street is expected to rally when trading begins in 80 minutes time. The Dow is predicted to rise by over 200 points, having shed more than 500 on Monday. The Financial Times (PAYWALL) is concerned by BAML\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey of investor confidence, showing they are the gloomiest since 2008. Their Adam Samson writes: Investors have made the largest-ever shift into bonds this month, according to a widely-watched survey that also showed bets on global equities falling to the lowest in two years as concern over the economic outlook increases. Global investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 net underweight position in bonds tumbled 23 percentage points in December to 35%, according to data released on Tuesday by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. It was the biggest change in the history of the survey and brings the underweight position to the lowest level since the Brexit vote in June 2016. BAML\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Hartnett is also anxious, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors are close to extreme bearishness.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: Donald Trump has launched another broadside at the Federal Reserve, as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank begins its two-day policy meeting. Once again, Trump is urging the Fed not to raise interest rates on Wednesday. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also unhappy about its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcquantitative tightening\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 programme, which is currently taking $50bn out of the economy each month as the Fed unwinds its stimulus. Aviva Investors are also gloomy. Michael Grady, their chief economist, has predict that risk assets will give weaker returns in 2019, as global growth moderates. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In a slowing growth environment, investors tend to focus more on downside risks. Although the economic backdrop continues to provide a basis for positive returns for risk assets, expectations of more moderate growth and tighter global liquidity, and the impact of those risks, justify more restrained positioning. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We prefer to be overweight in US and emerging market equities because of the expected relative growth outperformance. Valuations in Europe look more attractive in some areas, but downside risks such as Brexit and the Italian budget continue to weigh on the outlook. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are moderately underweight government bonds as yields will continue to move higher on expectations that central banks will tighten policy in 2019. With spreads relatively tight by historical standards, we have a bigger underweight with regard to credit, including duration. Our preference is for European over US high yield due to its lower leverage and reduced sensitivity to oil prices. We have a slight preference for being long US dollars, with the main underweight against Australia on domestic challenges and Chinese growth risks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sound the alarm bells! Global investors are their gloomiest since the financial crisis, according to a new survey from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. BAML\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly check on investor sentiment shows that 53% expect global growth to weaken over the next 12 months. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the worst outlook for the global economy since October 2008 (when the wheels were coming off the financial system). The survey shows that investors have been piling into the US dollar, and into bonds, rather than crowding into tech stocks. BAML also found that investors are shunning UK stocks. A net 39% of investors are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunderweight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the UK, as they try to protect themselves from Brexit. Given the recent selloff, are stocks now actually cheap? Or just low, and heading lower? The City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finest minds are wrestling with this question as 2019 approaches. On some measures, shares are offering plenty of value, as this charts shows: The FTSE 100, for example, has lost 12% in 2018, meaning that many stocks are yielding more than a year ago (unless they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve slashed their dividend, or are going to...) Major US companies like Amazon, Apple and Facebook are offering better value than three months ago, having fallen by around 20% since September. But... that sort of thinking is scrambled, if the world economy is really cooling -- and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IFO data doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do much for confidence. Back in January, investors were being criticised for holding onto cash..... but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look such a bad call now. Financial experts are concerned that German business morale has fallen again this month, according to the IFO thinktank. IFO president Clemens Fuest says Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy appears to be cooling, with most industries sending \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bad signals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about their prospects (sending its business expectations measure to a 25-month low). Fuest told Bloomberg TV that: We think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a permanent slowdown. Not a downturn, we still expect growth next year. Teis Knuthsen, CFI at Kirk Kapital (managing the wealth of descendants of the creator of Lego), fears that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rebound from its summer contraction. Joumanna Bercetche of CNBC is also concerned: Just in: German business morale has fallen, in another sign that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy is struggling. IFO, the Munich-based thinktank, says its business climate index has dropped to just 101.0 this month, down from 102 in November. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker than expected, and the fourth decline in a row. IFO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business expectations measure slumped to just 97.3, from 98.7. That may indicate that growth will be subdued in 2019. Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wall Street rout dragged even more US companies into \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbear market territory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - more than 20% off their all-time high. Companies suffering this grizzly fate include tech giants such as Apple, Amazon, IBM, Netflix and Facebook, as this chart from Marketwatch shows. More here. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale also blames president Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloom: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s snow on the ground and gluhwein everywhere but the Christmas spirit is absent in financial markets. After a miserable afternoon for US equities, this morning actually started in a bright mood on the other side of the world, before President Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lack of any encouragement for expectations of further reform gave markets the jitters. No white beard, no sleigh, not much bowing to external pressure\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no Christmas cheer in the markets today, says Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM: December 2018 has so far been one of the ugliest Decembers in U.S. stock market history. The S&amp;P 500 declined 7.8% in 10 trading days and experienced the worst two-day selloff since October. Cheaper valuations, the U.S.-China trade truce, and dovish Fed commentary were not enough to put an end to falling stock markets. Santa Clause seems to have lost his way this year, defying hopes that stocks will rally towards the year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s end. Instead, institutional investors appear to be pulling out, taking whatever profits they have accumulated throughout this year. Splat! European stock markets have fallen in unison at the start of trading. Traders are taking their cue from Wall Street; last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff continues to reverberate around the markets. The FTSE 100 is down 52 points, or 0.7%. David Madden of CMC Markets says growth concerns are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153festering\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. US stocks sold-off yesterday as dealers were concerned about the world economy, and there is also a fear the Federal Reserve are tightening their monetary policy too fast. The S&amp;P 500 fell to a new 2018 low, while the Russell 2000 entered a bear market. Asian equity markets sold-off overnight on the back of the negative move on Wall Street. Growth fears are also weighing on the oil price today. Brent crude has dropped by almost 2% this morning, to $58.51 per barrel. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 14-month low. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president has disappointed the markets today. Xi Jinging launched a robust attack on other nations who demand Chines policy changes (yes you, America), in a high-profile speech marking 40 years of economic reform. Xi declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No one is in a position to dictate to the Chinese people what should or should not be done. We must resolutely reform what should and can be changed, we must resolutely not reform what shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be changed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t match this tough talk with any firm details of new reforms to stimulate China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, or open it up to competition. My colleague Lily Yuo explains: Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech comes as the Chinese leadership is facing criticism over slowing growth and confrontation with the US. Observers hoped his speech would lay out new directions or reforms needed to help the Chinese economy, weighed down by debt and lagging consumption, and an overly dominant state sector. Instead, Xi stressed that the Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership and strategy up to now have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely correct.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He promised to support the state sector while continuing reforms in appropriate areas. His remarks lacked any detail about new policies and failed to inspire confidence in Asian markets. Hong Kong and Shanghai both dropped sharply during the speech. They are now off 1% for the day while losses have deepened to 1.8% in Tokyo and more than 1% in Sydney. More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTis the season to be jolly nervous! Global stock markets are being buffeted by worries over global growth and trade wars, while in the UK Brexit fears are causing serious angst in the retail sector. Last night, the US stock markets suffered yet another bruising selloff. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 507 points, or 2%, while the S&amp;P 500 lurched to a 14-month low. Wall Street has now suffered the worst start to a December since 1980. Markets in Asia-Pacific have followed suit, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei slumping by 1.8% and Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P/ASX 200 down 1.2%. Europe is also heading for a chilly bath at the open. The FTSE 100 is being called down 50 points, adding to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 70-points slide, taking the Footsie close to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-year low. Investors seem to be badly worried that the world economy is slowing, and that China and the US won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resolve their trade dispute. But the number 1 issue is whether America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve raises interest rates tomorrow night, and how hawkish or dovish it sounds about next year. US president Donald Trump piled even more pressure on the Fed on Monday, arguing it would be madness to raise interest rates. However, the Fed may feel that not hiking would cause more turmoil than hiking -- as the markets are expecting borrowing costs to go up again. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains: The market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overriding fear is that the Fed will press ahead with plans to raise interest rates, which could be too much for the US economy to handle. An indication from the Fed that they will slow their pace of hikes could calm these jittery markets. However, until the Fed have confirmed that as a course of action, investors will remain skittish. The volatility index, also known as the fear gauge lifted 2.27 points to a seven-week high. The markets remain anxious about China too, following data last week showing that Chinese retail sales growth has hit a 15-year low, as industrial output growth softens. UK retailers, meanwhile, will be desperately hoping that shoppers come out in force this week. The sector has been rocked by yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning from online clothing group Asos, after a slump in trading in November.

Trade has been making headlines, but I think a gradual tightening of monetary policy has been the driving force behind recent market volatility. With corporate borrowing and spending still high, and the Fed continuing to reduce its balance sheet, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect volatility to remain if this tightening continues.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I still think there is a disconnect between Main Street and Wall Street. A general consensus is that a market downturn signals an upcoming recession, but most underlying data points are still healthy and the economy is robust. Just the other day we saw data signalling strong consumer spending, which is one of a few points that tell me the real economy is doing well. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I also think the Fed missed the significance around the tightening of financial conditions beyond their activity. The stock market is down, credit spreads are way up, bank stocks are plunging and the dollar is stronger. I think markets would have applauded the Fed signalling a pause next year to see how markets have been adjusting to their previous rate decisions.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c1aa972e4b072dc52e606cb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-12-19T20:27:19.208Z\">8.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Michael McDonough of Bloomberg has pinpointed the moment when US stocks got a chill from Powell....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/M_McDonough/status/1075486271554895872\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">S&amp;P 500 Intraday &amp;

The Dow Jones may take a nose dive and the move could in the range of 300-500 points.

                "bodyText":"We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still waiting for Donald Trump to react to the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike, despite his repeated warnings. All is quiet on @realDonaldTrump though. If that changes, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back... Otherwise, goodnight! GW Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Geoffery Yu, Head of the UK Investment Office at UBS Wealth Management, on the sell-off: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial announcement to hike interest rates being broadly in line with market expectation, there was hope for it to be slightly more accommodative. Markets have subsequently struggled, following Chairman Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference. Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153policy does not currently need to be restrictive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has been interpreted that the Fed is not looking at an immediate pause. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an unwelcome record for Jay Powell - he just triggered the biggest sell-off after a rate hike in almost 25 years. Capital Economics agrees that the Federal Reserve could have been rather more dovish. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their take: The Fed hiked the fed funds target range by 25bp today, to between 2.25% and 2.50%, as most still expected, but tempered the move by slightly revising down Fed officials\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 projections for additional rate increases in 2019 and beyond. Still, with the vote unanimous and the median rate projection for end-2019 revised down by only 20bp, this was hardly the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dovish hike\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that some were anticipating. Key point: Shares aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t falling because the Fed raised interest rates. That was priced in. Instead, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re falling because chair Jerome Powell indicated that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep hiking if the data justifies it......despite signs of a global slowdown. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early days, but it looks like European stock markets are going to fall tomorrow. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is currently expected to fall around 85 points, according to the futures market at IG, near to a two-year low [reminder, it gained 64 points today] Newsflash: The US stock market has closed at its lowest level in over a year, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate hike. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 1.5%, or 351 points, to end at 23,323 points - the lowest point since November 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 650-point swing downward since the Fed announced its decision two hour ago. The S&amp;P 500 shed 1.4% to 2,510 points, the lowest since late September 2017, while the tech-focused Nasdaq has lost 2%. Clearly Wall Street is disappointed that the Fed expects two more rate hikes next year, on top of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise (which was generally expected). My colleague Dominic Rushe has covered the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike, and chair Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference, here: I said earlier that this was a dovish hike. Actually, it looks more like a dovish-ish one. Although the Fed has lowered its predicted path of rate increases, it has signalled that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be deterred by a bit of market volatility, and that it expects growth to continue next year. As Melanie Baker, senior economist, at Royal London Asset Management, puts it: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), as expected, raised rates 25bps, with their projections implying one fewer rate rise next year. However, the signals sent in the statement and forecasts weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as dovish as we had expected, e.g. only making a small adjustment to their language around \u00e2\u20ac\u0153further gradual\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hikes (by adding the word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). A more cautious signal from the Fed could have been justified (and would have been welcomed by equity markets) given the tightening in financial conditions and weaker global growth backdrop. However, the domestic economic data has looked strong enough to suggest that we aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t at the peak of the rate cycle quite yet. Bob Baur, chief global economist at Principal Global Investors, thinks the Fed is being too relaxed about recent market volatility: The Fed raised rates as expected, but I think the Fed may be underestimating other factors at play. Trade has been making headlines, but I think a gradual tightening of monetary policy has been the driving force behind recent market volatility. With corporate borrowing and spending still high, and the Fed continuing to reduce its balance sheet, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect volatility to remain if this tightening continues. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I still think there is a disconnect between Main Street and Wall Street. A general consensus is that a market downturn signals an upcoming recession, but most underlying data points are still healthy and the economy is robust. Just the other day we saw data signalling strong consumer spending, which is one of a few points that tell me the real economy is doing well. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I also think the Fed missed the significance around the tightening of financial conditions beyond their activity. The stock market is down, credit spreads are way up, bank stocks are plunging and the dollar is stronger. I think markets would have applauded the Fed signalling a pause next year to see how markets have been adjusting to their previous rate decisions. Michael McDonough of Bloomberg has pinpointed the moment when US stocks got a chill from Powell.... Finally, a question on Brexit. Jerome Powell thinks the US financial system is well-prepared for whatever happens, whether the UK leaves the US with a transition deal, or without one. But the Fed will be watching closely, as Brexit is a big issue and something that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not happened before. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the press conference. Jerome Powell reiterates that the Fed expects solid growth in 2019, with declining unemployment. That sounds like conditions that would justify further rate hikes next year, which is why shares are diving in New York. Chair Powell is having quite an impact.... The sell-off is gathering pace! Next year, the Federal Reserve will hold a press conference after every meeting (rather than every other meeting). That will be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big gain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for communication, Jerome Powell says. It also means that the Fed could raise rates more easily at any of its eight meetings (rather than resisting policy changes at non-press conference meetings) Q: Donald Trump wants you to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfeel the markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, so what feelings are you getting? Powell plays down the idea that he should be fixated on the stock exchange. What matters to the economy is changes in a range of markets. A little volatility doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave a mark, he adds. If you speak to American companies, you hear that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re worried about growth prospects, Jerome Powell says. Stocks are now falling sharply in New York. The Dow is now down 1%, or 256 points, having been UP 300 points before the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement. Q: Are you worried about Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statements, and tweets, about the Fed? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not worried, Powell replies; he knows everyone at the Fed will keep on doing their job. He explains that the Fed speaks to hundreds of people, and looks at masses of data, before setting monetary policy. Q: How can you tell if the Fed has become a drag on the economy? Powell says the Fed expects decent growth in the US economy next year, of between 2% and 2.5%. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be watching the data closely to see if that plays out. Q: How did the tightening in financial conditions, trade tensions, and criticism from Donald Trump affect today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision? Powell says the Fed took financial conditions into account, and will be watching the situation. On trade, there is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbroad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 concern among businesses over the strength of the global economy. And on the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of the Fed, Powell insists firmly that Trump has no impact at all! Political considerations play no role in our work, Powell insists. The Fed has a mandate from Congress, and it has the tools and the independence it needs to do the job. We at the Fed are absolutely committed to that mission, and nothing will deter us from doing what we think is the right thing to do, Powell declares. There is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fairly high degree of uncertainty over the path and destination of any further interest rate increases\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Powell reiterates. Translation: Those two hikes expected in 2019 are NOT set in concrete. Onto questions, starting with one about recent softening in US inflation data. Chair Powell says this gives the Fed the flexibility to be patient. Jay Powell is now explaining that the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future decisions aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pre-determined. Any future policy changes will depend on the data, he says. The US dollar is bouncing around as Powell speaks.... Powell says most of his colleagues expect the US economy to perform well in the coming year. But they have cut their inflation projections, due to recent \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctightening in financial conditions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and slower growth abroad (the eurozone, for example, only grew by 0.2% in the last quarter, with Germany contracting) Jay Powell says that the Fed has lowered its forecast for economic growth next year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why it now expects two more interest rate hikes in 2019, down from 3 before. The Fed chair has arrived, to explain why US interest rates are being raised for the fourth time this year - and the 9th time since the financial crisis ended. Jerome Powell says the US economy has been performing well over the last three months, with jobs being created, wages up, and inflation stable. But there are also signs of softening, as the US economy faces new challenges such as slower growth in some other countries, Powell continues.... You can watch the press conference live, here. A nice summary: The S&amp;P 500 index - a broader measure of US company values than the Dow - is now in the red, down 0.4% at 2,536 points. That underlines that the Fed has disappointed Wall Street by not being more dovish. You can read the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement online, here. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear from Jerome Powell shortly.... Reaction to the US interest rate hike is pouring in. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s misgivings the Fed was not going to be deterred from raising interest rates. In light of low unemployment and a robust economy, it was clear the central bank was led by the data in front of them. The US economy has seen some momentum slow as the positive impact of fiscal policy wanes, which will affect future policy. The Fed will be wary that upwards pressure on prices is growing from a tight labour market, higher wages and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war. As we move into 2019, the Fed will take a flexible pragmatic approach, dependent on the economic data.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kully Samra, Vice President of Charles Schwab: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It seems like the new year could equal new monetary policy for Mr Powell..... We expect that the Fed will likely continue to raise short-term interest rates in 2019, but at a slower pace than in the past with one to two hikes, and may pause or end rate hikes by mid-2019, if the yield curve flattens and inflation remains tame. We also expect the dollar to stay firm until there is evidence that the Fed is done tightening and global growth picks up. Market volatility is a theme that is likely to persist in 2019. After a decade of unprecedented liquidity provision, liquidity is draining out of the system as the Fed and other central banks move toward tighter monetary policy. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more reaction: The Federal Reserve has also added a line about monitoring \u00e2\u20ac\u0153global economic and financial conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to its statement. That suggests Fed governors are more worried about the state of the world economy, and the recent volatility in the markets. The US stock market is falling sharply, losing almost all of its earlier gains. The Dow, which was up almost 300 points, is now only 39 points higher. That suggests investors had expected the Fed to be more dovish. Some in the market will be disappointed that policymakers still expect two rate hikes next year. The Fed is justifying its rate hike, by pointing out that the US economy looks robust. It says: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year Significantly, the Fed has also change the language in its statement. It now only expects \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd further interest rate rises in future. The Fed has lowered its forecast for interest rate hikes in 2019. Policymakers now only expect two rate rises next year, down from three previously. NEWSFLASH: The US Federal Reserve has voted to raise interest rates, despite pressure from Donald Trump to leave them on hold today. The FOMC has decided to hike benchmark rates to 2.25%-2.5%, as most investors expected. More to follow! With just a few minutes to go, the Dow is up 1.2% or 285 points at 23,960..... Stocks, bonds and the dollar could all be volatile today, when the Fed decision hits the wires. John Hardy of Saxo Bank says the stakes are high for chairman Powell and colleagues... White-knuckle equity market declines, a hedge fund legend and President Trump are all begging Fed chair Jay Powell to cease and desist with further rate tightening ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pivotal FOMC. Will he pause or plough ahead? We find out in just 10 minutes.... The Fed may well deliver a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdovish hike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 today -- raising borrowing costs, while sounding less optimistic that rates will keep rising. Fiona Cincotta of City Index explains: We are expecting a dovish hike from the Fed, with the well-used phrase \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gradual further hikes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to be dropped from the statement. Furthermore, we expect the Fed to trim is forecast of further hikes. The Fed will have to strike a balance between addressing the current strength in the economy (GDP 3.5% yoy Q3) and taking onboard signs of a slowing global economy. Additionally, they will need to do this in such a way that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t alarm financial markets. The fact that US equity indices are moving convincingly higher again today shows that the traders are expecting the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message to soothe volatile markets. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly time for one of the final economic events of 2018 -- the conclusions of the December meeting of the US Federal Reserve. Despite recent market turbulence, most financial experts expect the Fed to raise US interest rates today, by a quarter of one percent. That would lift the headline cost of borrowing up to 2.25%-2.5%, the highest since early 2008. It would also be the 9th interest rate increase since the Fed started normalising policy in 2016. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the only thing to watch out for. The Fed will release new economic predictions, which may show less optimism about growth prospects. That will be accompanied by a new dot plot, showing where policymakers expect interest rate to be over the next couple of years. Those dots will be closely scrutinised, to see if the Fed is signalling a pause in its hiking cycle. If it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, we can expect Donald Trump to be vocal in his criticism of the Fed. The president has already urged chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues not to hike, meaning the pressure is on tonight... European stock markets have closed higher tonight. The FTSE 100 gained 64 points, or almost 1%, to 6,765, recovering from its lowest close in two years on Tuesday. GlaxoSmithKline led the rally, ending the session almost 4% higher after announcing its consumer healthcare tie-up with Pfizer. Tim Gamble, Global Head of Pharma Consulting at the Economist Intelligence Unit, says: What this deal means is a concerted pivot towards innovation and decoupling of the consumer healthcare business. The hook up with 23andMe, appointment of Hal Barron to R&amp;D gives insight into the innovation strategy pursued by Chief Executive Emma Walmsey. This places greater strain on the Pharma division - but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s external regulatory constraints that may yet place the drag on Walmsey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambitions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Italy was the stand-out performer today, gaining 1.6% after reaching a compromise with the European commission over its 2019 budget. The German DAX gained 0.4%, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC rose by 0.6%. With just over an hour to go until the US interest rate decision, stocks are up on Wall Street too. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 275 points at 23,950, a gain of 1.1%. But that could unravel if the Fed is more hawkish than expected tonight.... Back in London, cab hire company Uber has lost another legal attempt to prevent its UK drivers being classed as workers, rater than self-employed. The Court of Appeal has has upheld an earlier ruling, in 2016, that drivers were effectively employed by Uber, and thus entitled to holiday pay and the minimum wage. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important decision: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No company is above the law. Uber must play by the rules and treat its staff properly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling should be a warning to other gig economy employers. If you play fast and loose with workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights, unions will expose you and hold you to account. Jonathan Chamberlain, partner at law firm Gowling WLG, says other companies should take note: Yet another court confirms that the more a brand seeks to control the activities of the people that deliver that brand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services to the public, the less likely those people are to be self-employed. The law will probably always remain uncertain in this area, despite the governments promise of reform, but the direction of travel is clear. I expect the Supreme Court to uphold this judgement but we shall see.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wall Street is open, but traders are keeping their powder dry, ahead of the US interest rate decision.... A quick recap. UK inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 20 months. Consumer prices rose by 2.3% in the year to November, thanks to cheaper petrol and clothes. Economists believe that inflation will keep slowing in 2019, helping to keep real wages in positive territory. UK house price inflation has also slowed, to its lowest level in over five years. Price in London fell by 1.7%, as Brexit anxiety weighs on demand. The Italian stock market is surging after Rome and the EU reached agreement over its budget plans for next year. Investors are nervously awaiting the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision, at 7pm GMT. The Fed is likely to raise borrowing costs, but could also lower its forecasts for future rate hikes. Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says the Fed could surprise the markets by holding borrowing costs -- something which president Trump has been demanding for months. A dovish hike is widely expected today and increases next year reduced to one or two, although I wonder whether they may hold off and surprise the markets. I may not agree with Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constant Fed bashing but he may have a point on this occasion. With the global economy facing lower growth in 2019, including the US, inflation in check and US stocks in correction territory, it may not be the best time to be raising rates. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think anyone would blame the Fed for taking a break this month and lining up two or three next year, depending on how the economy performs. It may even provide comfort for investors and be the catalyst for a late Santa surge, bringing the year to an end on a more positive not. Of course, this will then naturally attract criticism that the central bank is bowing to pressure from the White House but being independent doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always mean going against the wishes of Trump. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official! The European Commission and Italy have reached an agreement over its 2019 budget. The peace deal avoids Rome being hauled an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexcessive deficit procedure\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that could have led to an EU fine -- and potentially fuelled euroscepticism in Italy. AFP has more details: European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said Wednesday that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153agreement is not ideal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but allows the Commission to avoid legal action against Italy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153provided that the measures are fully implemented.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The threat of action is not rare in EU terms but it came amid growing tension between the Commission and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s populist government, which had vowed to resist any pressure from Brussels. Dombrovskis said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Italian government has come a long way\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the heated rhetoric of a few weeks ago. The early rally in Italian stocks is continuing -- the FTSE MIB is now up 1.8%, while the yield (or interest rate) on Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year government debt has plunged to 2.77%, down from 2.94% yesterday. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the slowdown in UK house price growth, and the dip in consumer price inflation. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories have produced some Christmas cheer , reporting that orders have risen in December for the second month running. A pick-up in export demand helped to swell order books, according to the CBI. This kept its order book balance in positive territory (meaning more factories had higher orders rather than lower ones), although at +8 it was down on November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s +10 However, the sector is still anxious about Brexit. CBI economist Anna Leach explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector enters the Christmas period with a small upswing, with output growth gathering further pace. The firming in exports orders is also particularly welcome. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But uncertainty over Brexit still casts a long shadow over this sector and the rest of the economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Politicians must finally stop the endless infighting and come together to secure a workable solution, or we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in danger of edging closer to a no-deal Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dan Tomlinson from Resolution Foundation on the slowdown in UK house price growth: Alastair Neame, senior economist at the CEBR thinktank, also predicts that inflation will keep falling in the months ahead, as retailers fight for business. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lower inflation is another welcome sign that household finances will continue to improve over the coming months, but low confidence and consumer indebtedness look set to keeping spending in check.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report also shows that clothing prices have fallen by 0.8% in the last year -- the only thing that has actually got cheaper since November 2017. Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity International, reckons Brexit angst is pulling inflation down, as retailers are forced to slash prices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit uncertainty and flagging consumer confidence are showing up in increasingly soggy data, with inflation hitting lowered expectations this morning. Retailers are being forced into heavy discounting to persuade shoppers to open their wallets, offsetting the inflationary impact of the weaker pound. Clothing was a notable drag. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all bad news as last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ONS earnings data showed that UK wage growth has risen to a healthy 3.3%. UK households are getting progressively better off. UK inflation is clearly on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153downward trend,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Mike Jakeman, senior economist at PwC. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a boost to workers, as earnings are expected to keep rising this year (although a disorderly Brexit could change that!). Jakeman says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumer price inflation slowed in November, to 2.3% year on year, from 2.4% in October. This was the slowest pace of increase for 20 months and was driven by the effect of lower global oil prices, which reduced the cost of a tank of fuel for British motorists by an average of 2.6 pence a litre in the past month. But even setting the aside the effects of volatile components such as fuel, it is clear that inflation is on a downward trend. Both headline and core inflation measures have steadily slowed during 2018, as the effect of a weaker pound has diminished and economic growth has remained tepid. Good news for anyone looking to get onto the housing ladder: UK house price inflation has hit its lowest in over five years. The price of the average UK property rose by 2.7% in the year to October, down from 3% in September. Once again, London property prices dragged the national average down -- dropping by 1.7% in the last 12 months. Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent, fears that 2019 will be tough for the housing market too: Overall, prospects for the new year are not good as all the recent Brexit and general economic uncertainty are not reflected in these statistics. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOn the ground, December is proving to be fairly typical - generally quiet but still, thankfully, a fair number of buyers who need to move checking out what they consider are the best value options.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 At 2.3%, inflation is moving close to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target. Jeremy Thomson-Cook of foreign exchange firm World First says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation is moving back towards the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of 2% and allowing real wages gains to extend into the end of the year. The main pressure within the CPI basket is naturally fuel given the precipitous falls we have seen in the cost of a barrel of oil but food prices have also been kept in check ahead of the Christmas period. The BoE might be relieved to see inflation dropping. On the other hand, as Geoff Tily of the TUC points out, it might fear that last summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike was a mistake: This chart confirms that cheaper fuel helped to pull UK inflation down last month. The ONS says: Petrol prices fell by 2.6 pence per litre between October and November 2018, compared with a rise of 1.8 pence per litre between October and November 2017. This was partially offset by an upward contribution from sea fares, which rose this year but fell a year ago. But what about the drop in recreation costs? According to the ONS, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to a drop in the price of computer games, and concert tickets (both of which can be volatile, depending on which musical stars are touring the country, and when the latest gaming blockbuster is released). The drop in inflation means UK wages are outpacing the cost of living. Average earnings are currently rising 3.3%, meaning real wages are growing by around 1%. Newsflash: Inflation in the UK has fallen to its lowest level since March 2017, giving shoppers a much-needed boost ahead of Christmas. The Consumer Prices Index dropped to 2.3% per year in November, the Office for National Statistics says, down from 2.4% in October. The ONS says that lower petrol prices pulled inflation down; games, toys and hobbies, and cultural services also had a downward impact on the cost of living., However, tobacco prices rose at a faster pace (due to higher taxes). Accommodation services and passenger sea transport all had an upward impact on inflation. More to follow.... Newsflash: Banking group Santander has been fined \u00c2\u00a332.8m by the UK financial watchdog, for a frankly shocking failure to handle the accounts and investments of deceased customers properly. The Financial Conduct Authority has imposed the penalty, after concluding that Santander had often failed to do the right thing when a customer died. Failings in its probate and bereavement processes meant that Santander sometimes didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t transfer money to beneficiaries for several years. According to the FCA, there were weaknesses in Santander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s systems which: reduced its ability to effectively identify all the funds it held which formed part of a deceased customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s estate; resulted in it failing to effectively follow-up on communications with deceased customer representatives which increased the likelihood of probate and bereavement cases not being closed; and led to it ineffectively monitoring open probate and bereavement cases to allow it to determine whether cases had progressed to closure. The FCA is also unhappy that Santander didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come clean about the problems . In a stern rebuke, it says: Santander did not notify the FCA of the nature or extent of the issues it faced, including the numbers of potentially affected customers and assets, and was selective in the information it provided. Accordingly, Santander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conduct fell below the standards of openness and cooperation expected of an authorised firm. Italian bonds and stocks are rallying this morning, on relief that Rome has reached a peace deal with Brussels over its budget. Last night, the Italian Treasury announced it had reached a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a technical agreement with EU officials\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which could avoid an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excessive deficit procedure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd being launched against the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-largest member. Last week, Italy proposed cutting its planned budget deficit for 2019 to 2.04% from 2.4% of gross domestic product. That might keep it within EU rules -- and compares favourably with France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aims... Any deal still needs the approval of European commissioners, who meet later today. Plus, any budget changes would need to be passed by the Italian Senate. But the markets are already excited, sending the Italian FTSE MIB up 1.5% this morning. World stock markets have a decidedly edgy feel this morning, as investors wait for the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate decision. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite index has fallen by 1%, amid ongoing anxiety about trade relations with the US. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei has dipped by 0.6%. European shares are more positive; with the Stoxx 600 up around 0.2%. The FTSE 100 is bouncing back from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff, up around 0.35%. GSK are leading the way, as investors hail its break-up plan. Boom! Shares in pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline have soared by 5% at the start of trading, after it surprised the City with a break-up plan. GSK has agreed to spin off its consumer healthcare business in a \u00c2\u00a310bn joint venture with rival Pfizer. GSK, whose consumer brands include Sensodyne and Panadol, will have a controlling stake in the partnership of 68% and Pfizer will own 32%. The FTSE 100 drug maker said that within three years of closing the deal, it will demerge and float the consumer health business, splitting GSK into two distinct businesses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one focused on consumer and the other on pharmaceuticals and vaccines. Investors around the globe will be watching Fed chair Jerome Powell tonight, when he explains tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision. Shares could soar, or slide, depending on the guidance that Powell gives for future rate hikes in 2019. Ditto the dollar. Naeem Islam of Think Markets explains: Market participants widely expect the statement to be somewhat dovish and the markets believe that going into 2019, the Fed isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to be this aggressive because of the tighter financial conditions. Mr Powell is likely to indicate two or maximum three rates hikes in 2019. For investors, one to two rate hikes would be considered more dovish to neutral but two to three rate hikes would be aggressive because the economic indicators have started to flash warning light with respect to any aggressive monetary policy. In terms of trading the event, aggressive tone by the Fed would be negative for the equity market and the sell-off may become intense. The Dow Jones may take a nose dive and the move could in the range of 300-500 points. However, a dovish statement could support the equity markets and it would restore some confidence so investors expect about 150-250 points move for the Dow on the back of this. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. To hike or not to hike, that is the question facing America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bankers today. The Federal Reserve had been certain to raise interest rates at its final meeting of 2018 today, in line with its policy of normalising monetary policy and tackling inflation. But Donald Trump has thrown clouds of uncertainty over the Fed, by repeatedly urging the Fed to leave interest rates alone. After several stinging tweets, the markets now reckon there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 25% chance that the Fed won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hike at tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy meeting: But central bank independence is important. So despite Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best efforts, the Fed will probably push US borrowing costs up again tonight (while bracing for another Twitter blast), to 2.5%. But the Fed will also update the markets on its plans for 2019, and many investors predict it will slash its forecasts for future rate hikes. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains: The market is pricing in a 72.3% probability of the Fed hiking today. This would be the fourth-rate hike for 2018. However, the real concern for the market is what comes next. With growing fears over the health of the global economy, the markets simply don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the US economy can handle higher rates. Traders will be watching for dovish signs, such as the dropping of the phrase \u00e2\u20ac\u0153further gradual rate rises\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the statement and a softening of the dot plot from three hikes to at most two. In short, if the Fed must hike today, and they will struggle to justify not hiking on current US economic strength; then it will need to be a dovish hike to prevent the US equity markets dumping once more. The dollar has traded lower across the week in anticipation of a dovish hike. Such a dovish hike might calm market nerves, after a turbulent few months. Earlier this week the US stock market fell to a 14-month low, while Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 closed at a two-year low last night. Also coming up.... New UK inflation figures will also show how the cost of living changed last month in Britain. Economists predict that consumer prices rose by 2.3% last year, down from 2.4% in October. It could confirm that retailers have been slashing prices in recent months, in an attempt to persuade shoppers to part with some cash.

                "bodyText":"Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has shaken off its earlier losses to end the day slightly higher. The blue-chip Footsie has closed 9 points higher at 6,721. Those dovish comments from New York Fed chair John Williams seem to have provided a smidgen of festive cheer. The Dow is still up, a little, too. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The Dow Jones attempted to put a star on top of December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rotting Christmas tree on Friday afternoon. The thrust of the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sizeable gains came following a somewhat reassuring interview with Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams on CNBC. Williams claimed that the Fed is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclistening\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthere are risks to that outlook that maybe the economy will slow further\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Investors seemingly took this to mean that the central bank could hike rates less frequently than forecast in 2019, sending the Dow 300 points higher and back to 23150, having hit a 14 month nadir of 22600 at its lowest point on Thursday. That may be all for today. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday, when traders will hope to finally see a Santa Rally. GW Newsflash: Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams has said that the central bank could reassess its interest rate policy and balance sheet reduction in the new year if the economy slows. Williams told CNBC that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are listening, there are risks to that outlook that maybe the economy will slow further.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That could be a signal to the markets not to panic, after the Fed predicted two interest rate hikes in 2019 -- more than investors expected. William\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments are going down well on the New York stock exchange -- the Dow is now up 350 points, or 1.55%. at 23,210. European stock markets are ending the week on a low note. The Stoxx 600 is down 0.33%, on track for a new two-year closing low. Guy Foster, Head of Research at Brewin Dolphin, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market has been weak during the final quarter of 2018, as volatility has picked up. We see this as a symptom of monetary policy being tightened at an accelerating pace, which occurred simultaneously across the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major economies. That has drawn liquidity away from global equity markets, causing stocks to fluctuate further from their fundamental valuations than they had when monetary policy was loose. However, in our view, interest rates and bond yields still represent poor compensation for risk relative to equities. Oil is also suffering in the rout, with Brent crude down 2% at just $53.26 per barrel, That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest level since September 2017 -- a boost to consumers. Foster explains how a weak oil price can help the global economy: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Meanwhile, falls in energy costs will act as an effective tax cut to consumers and businesses around the world, as it did during the last bout of volatility in 2016. Lower cost inflation should therefore set the stage for a recovery in economic activity and further profit growth into 2019. Capital Economics also believe the US Federal Reserve blundered on Wednesday when it raised American interest rates to up to 2.5%. They say: The clear view in financial markets in the wake of the December FOMC meeting is that any further rate hikes over the coming months are likely to be reversed in 2020. Our long-held forecast is that a sharp slowdown in economic growth next year will prompt the Fed to cut rates by 75bp in the first half of 2020, more than markets are currently pricing in. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lisa Abramowicz explains why Wall Street is worried about Washington gridlock.... Ding ding! Wall Street is open for business, on the final day of a brutal week for stocks,. The Dow Jones industrial average has risen by around 0.5% in early trading, or 121 points to 22,981. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still more than a thousand points down for this week, though, or over 4%. The prospect of the US federal government shutting down tonight, if the Senate won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t approve funding for Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wall, is casting a shadow over the New York stock exchange. A trillion here, a trillion there, and eventually all these stock market losses add up.... New economic data just released has confirmed that the US economy grew pretty steadily in the third quarter of 2018. Q3 GDP growth has been revised down very slightly to an annualised rate of 3.4%, from 3.5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more rapid than the UK, whose quarterly growth of 0.6% equates to 2.4% on an annualised basis. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly three times as fast as France. Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM, says risk-taking is off the menu this Christmas, as investors digest Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to shut down the US government: The pain felt across global equity markets intensified today as growing fears of a U.S. government shutdown crippled risk sentiment. It has been a remarkably terrible trading week for financial markets amid concerns over rising U.S. interest rates, decelerating global growth, Brexit uncertainty and chaos in Washington. The absence of appetite for risk was clearly reflected in Asia this morning as stocks closed broadly lower. In Europe, shares are trading in a depressed fashion and this negative mood is likely to infect Wall Street this afternoon. With geopolitical risk factors weighing heavily on investor confidence, financial markets remain at threat of concluding 2018 on a risk-off tone. Two days after the Federal Reserve raised US interest rates, a growing band of investors reckon the Fed will be forced to CUT in 2020. That suggests pessimism over the outlook for the American economy, amid chatter of a slowdown, or even a recession. Wall Street is expected to suffer further losses when trading begins in a couple of hours. The S&amp;P 500 is being called down 0.5% in the futures market, as investors worry that the US government could face a partial shutdown. The US Senate is expected to reject a finance bill that includes $5.7bn funding for a wall on the Mexican border -- as long-demanded by Donald Trump. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the measure needs a 60 votes to pass, and the Republicans only have 51 seats at present. President Trump is awake and tweeting that he would refuse to sign the spending bill unless the Senate passes the bill (which was rapidly reworked yesterday) These tweets are from yesterday, but they largely sum up the mood in the markets today: Back in the financial markets, shares are deeper in the red as the sell-off gathers pace. All the European indices are now down today, hitting new two-year lows. Mihir Kapadia CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, says gloom is everywhere as a grim week draws to a close. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As Christmas approaches, market sentiment remains very negative. Global stocks have had a terrible December (S&amp;P 500 and Dow are down 10% and 12% in in the month) as issues such as the ongoing US-China trade dispute as well as the prospect of a US government shutdown have added to the pessimism. Following a slide on Wall Street in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session, Asian markets have traded lower, with European stocks following suit on opening. Economist Sam Tombs has spotted another warning sign in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data dump: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been quite a deluge of UK data this morning. The latest national accounts (the growth figures) and public finances (borrowing) were both being released, plus breakdowns of business spending and consumer trends. Our cup runneth over..... rather too messily for the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Giles: Still, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned: Real UK gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have increased by an unrevised 0.6% in Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2018, while real GDP growth in 2017 has been revised up from 1.7% to 1.8%. Households, corporations and government all continue to be net borrowers in Quarter 3 2018, borrowing or running down their savings to finance their spending and investment, financed by the rest of the world being a net lender to the UK. The current account deficit widened to 4.9% in the latest quarter, financed primarily by a net inflow of portfolio investment, mainly reflecting equity investment, while there has been a divestment of the net acquisition of financial assets and the net incurrence of financial liabilities in each of the last two quarters. Better news: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit (the gap between government spending and income) has narrowed. The UK borrowed \u00c2\u00a37.2bn to balance the books last month, \u00c2\u00a3900m less than in November 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the smallest deficit for any November since 2004. This means that the UK has borrowed \u00c2\u00a332.8bn so far this year, \u00c2\u00a313.6bn less than in the same period in 2017, and the lowest year-to-date for 16 years. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a brighter picture than the current account deficit..... Howard Archer of EY Item Club is concerned by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data: Another alarming development: UK real household disposable income stagnated in the last quarter, even though earnings rose. The ONS reports that inflation and increased payments of self-employment tax offset strong wage growth in July-September. This meant households didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually have any more money to spend This squeeze forced people to borrow more money to make ends meet. As a result, the UK households saving ratio fell to its joint third lowest on record to 3.8%, down from 4.1% in the previous quarter. The slump in business spending suggests bosses are unwilling to buy new warehouses, offices and machinery until they have clarity about Brexit. This chart, from the ONS, shows how UK business investment contracted last quarter -- by 1.1% to \u00c2\u00a346.9bn. Over the last 12 months, business investment has declined by 1.8%. It has contracted for three quarters in a row; the first time in a decade. Some early reaction to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing balance of payments: Ouch! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit has widened to its worst level in over two years. New figures show that the gap between what the UK trades with the rest of the world, plus investment flows, widened by \u00c2\u00a36.6bn to \u00c2\u00a326.5bn in July to September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the largest deficit recorded since Quarter 3 2016 in both value and percentage of GDP terms. This effectively measures the flow of money in and out of the UK. So what went wrong? According to the Office for National Statistics, there are two main causes: UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade balance worsened - a drop in the service sector surplus pushed the trade deficit up by \u00c2\u00a31.8bn to \u00c2\u00a38.8bn The primary income balance deficit worsened by \u00c2\u00a33.6bn to \u00c2\u00a311.1bn, as foreign investors received larger profits on their UK assets. Good news! Britain was one of the best-performing major economies in the last quarter. Bad news! That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as impressive as it sounds.... Not a good sign for 2019 growth... Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report also show that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector grew by 0.5% in the last quarter (revised up from 0.4%). Industrial production rose by 0.6% (revised down from 0.8%) and construction grew by 2.3% (revised up from 2.1%). Business investment fell, though, by 1.1%. The Office for National Statistics has confirmed that the UK economy grew by 0.6% in the third quarter of this year, matching earlier estimates. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a relief; there were concerns that growth could have been downgraded. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a tough year for stock pickers. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has shed around 13% of its value this year, taking a bite out of many portfolios. Russ Mould, AJ Bell Investment Director, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the year to date, just six of the 39 industrial groupings which make up the FTSE All-Share are showing a gain and the best performer, Technology Hardware, has a market cap of less than \u00c2\u00a31 billion, so it is so small as to be barely relevant. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the damage: Santa has better get his stakes on, if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to bring any cheer to the City. As Connor Campbell of SpreadEx puts it: Santa remained on holiday this Friday, the European markets opening in a Christmassy shade of red following yet another disastrous session for the Dow Jones. With the Dow now under 23000 for the first time in 14 months, Europe stood little chance of bucking the bah humbug trend as trading got underway. The biggest fallers in London this morning include utility company Severn Trent (-1.9%), communications group Vodafone (-1.8%) and consumer goods giant Reckitt Benckiser (-1.5%). Housebuilders are having a better morning, with Barratt Development, Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon all gaining at least 1%. At the risk of overdoing the gloom, UK consumer confidence has hit its lowest level in five years. Brexit uncertainty is being blamed after the GfK index of consumer morale fell to -14 in December, down from -13 in the previous month and -10 in October. People are particularly anxious about economic prospects - expectations for the economy over the next 12 months tumbled to its lowest since December 2011. European stock markets have opened in the red, as the sell-off continues. The Stoxx 600 index has lost another 0.35%, following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses on Wall Street. Only Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is defying gravity; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up by 6 measly points. Another blow: French business confidence has fallen to a two-year low this month, according to statistics body INSEE. INSEE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey of business morale dropped to 102 this month, down from 103 in November, which is the weakest reading since November 2016. It suggests that the protests that have gripped Paris in recent weeks have worried business leaders, coming on top of trade war worries. Disappointing news: French growth in the third quarter of 2018 has been revised down, from 0.4% to 0.3%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still faster than the eurozone average, of just 0.2% in July-September, but it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t please policymakers in Paris. It follows lacklustre growth of just 0.2% in both January-March, and April-June. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a rough year for the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest member, especially as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcyellow vest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 protests mean growth probably slowed in recent weeks. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153horrible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd quarter for the financial markets, says Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA. He points out that many markets have fallen from record highs into correction territory (-10%) or even a full-blown bear markets (-20%). We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gone from undeterred optimism to widespread pessimism in such a short period of time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as is often the case \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and there clearly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much appetite just yet to try and catch this particular falling knife. The Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continued hard-line approach with China isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helping matters and the prospect of a government shutdown isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t doing the situation much good either. Chinese investors have endured a rough December: They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not alone either... al the major indices have suffered this autumn: This is a worrying sign: the VIX volatility index, which measures how fearful investors are, has hit its highest level since February. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. They say the Christmas sales come earlier every year. This time, the bargains include shares in companies across the world. Global financial markets are ending 2018 with some heavy losses, as investors worry that growth is slowing... and that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank is pressing on with interest rate hikes regardless. Last night, the Dow shed another 2%, and the Nasdaq came to the brink of a bear market, after Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE had slumped to its lowest level in 28 months. This has rattled Asia-Pacific markets again; Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Topix has shed 1.9%, pushing it deeper into bear market territory, while China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite index has shed 0.8%. Associated Press explains: Stocks usually end the year with a flourish. But investors worry global economic growth is cooling and the U.S. could slip into a recession in the next few years. After \u00e2\u20ac\u0153years of outperformance,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd U.S. markets are working off \u00e2\u20ac\u0153overvaluation in some areas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd such as major tech companies, said Shane Oliver of AMP Capital in a report. China and other Asian markets \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fell much earlier and harder and so far are holding above their October lows,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Oliver. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much cheer in the City this morning either, with European markets expected to open lower. The ongoing chaos in American politics is also worrying the markets, given that the US government could actually shut down today... As my colleague Dominic Rushe explains, The latest fall in US markets comes as Donald Trump is threatening a government shutdown unless Congress agrees to fund his border wall with Mexico. Trump has appeared to back away from a shutdown but is now indicating he will not sign off on a stopgap budget unless there is funding for the wall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At this moment, the president does not want to go further without border security, which includes steel slats or a wall,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said. Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is continuing to weigh his options\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she added. Disappointing earnings reports added to the US sell-off. Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance dropped 3.55% as the drugstore chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s same-store sales missed estimates. Conagra Brands tumbled 11.33%, the most on the S&amp;P, after the packaged foods maker missed sales estimates on delayed shipments and weak demand. A flurry of new economic data will keep investors on their toes today, and away from last-minute Christmas shopping. We get updated growth figures for the UK, the US, Canada and France.

                "bodyText":"Government contractor Interserve has unveiled a plan to strengthen its finances and quell anxiety that it could become the next Carillion, a day after construction group Kier completed a fundraising with the same aim. The two companies have become the focus of concern about their debt levels after the high-profile collapse of Carillion led investors and analysts to look for potential weaknesses in other large firms in the construction and outsourcing sectors. A day after Kier raised \u00c2\u00a3250m in a share placing that met with little appetite from City investors although it will allow it to cut debts, Reading-based Interserve fleshed out details of its own deleveraging plan that will hand ownership to lenders. The proposals are designed to prop up the finances of a struggling company that employs 75,000 people, including 45,000 in the UK, and has thousands of government contracts such as cleaning hospitals and serving school meals. The company said it would convert some of its debt into new equity, if it can secure lenders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 consent, with some of the stock going to existing investors and the rest offered more widely. Interserve said it would also weigh up proposals from some of its lenders to hive off its profitable building materials business, RMD Kwiform, with the banks taking ownership. A final plan, subject to agreement from groups including lenders, shareholders and pension trustees, will be announced in early 2019, the company said. Chief executive, Debbie White, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This progress on the deleveraging plan is excellent news for all our employees, customers and suppliers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It will provide us with a strong balance sheet and enable us to move forward with confidence and the ability to improve our business and deliver our long-term strategy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares in Interserve lost almost half their value earlier this month after the company first revealed a deleveraging plan. The slump forced the government to address comparisons between Interserve and Carillion, insisting that the situation was not as perilous. The Cabinet Office said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We do not believe that any of our strategic suppliers are in a comparable position to Carillion. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We monitor the financial health of all of our strategic suppliers, including Interserve, and have regular discussions with the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The company successfully raised new debt facilities earlier this year and we fully support them in their long-term recovery plan.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

                "bodyText":"With City traders are now scrambling to the shops, the bar, or the pile of unfinished wrapping, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to, err, wrap up here too. So, to quickly recap. The UK stock market has slumped to a new two-year closing low, on the final trading day before Christmas. The FTSE 100 dropped 35 points, or 0.5%, to 6685, its weakest close since September 2016. The traditional Santa Rally is officially cancelled (we can only speculate about what traders did to deserve such losses). The selloff means that \u00c2\u00a376bn has been wiped off the FTSE 100 this month, as world markets have suffered one of their worst Decembers ever. As David Jones, Chief Market Strategist at Capital.com, put it: As stock markets wind down for Christmas there is only one thing that we can be sure of - there was no Santa Rally. It has been a terrible month for investors - so far the Dow Jones is on track for its worst December since 1932, having lost 12% for the month as of last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. Investors will be glad of some time off from the massive sides - but it does not bode well for 2019. The FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies also took a pre-Christmas bath, dropping 0.75% to its lowest level since November 2016. Investors continue to worry that the global economy is weakening, and anxious that Donald Trump could attempt to fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin has caused fresh jitters, by announcing that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been speaking to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top bankers to check they have enough liquidity. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worrying investors in America. The New York stock market has just opened in the red, with the Dow Jones industrial average has opened lower. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today from London. Hope you all have a lovely festive break. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back when the markets reopen on Thursday. Merry Christmas! GW Congratulations to anyone who finds a steak bake in their stocking tomorrow..... The French stock market is also lacking any pre-Christmas fizz. The CAC index, which tracks the biggest French companies, is down 1.5% today at its lowest level in over two years. Further confirmation that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a rough year for shares around the world, with US banks and emerging markets doing particularly badly. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Press Association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: The FTSE 100 index closed at its lowest level in two years on Christmas Eve as an attempt by the US treasury secretary to reassure investors mis-fired. In a half-day session, the blue-chip index closed down 35.18 points, or 0.52%, at 6,685.99, its lowest level since September 2016. US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin called the heads of the six largest American banks to check if they had enough cash to see them through any market downturn. The move was an effort to reassure investors about the US government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partial shutdown over budget spending for a border wall with Mexico and speculation that President Donald Trump is considering firing US Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell. Fiona Cincotta, a senior market analyst at City Index, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The stand-off between President Trump and Congress over the financing of the Mexican wall seems set to continue into January with the US government unable to pass any laws in the near future. All of the markets are slightly distorted today because of lower than usual volumes and a short trading day. With the London stock market closed, traders can make a late dash to the shops! And they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find them quite busy. Consultancy firm Springboard reports that there is a last-minute surge in Christmas shopping. Footfall this morning was +10.3% higher than yesterday, and 6.8% above last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christmas Eve. Financial experts are continuing to criticise US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, over his attempts to reassure the markets: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloombeg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tim O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Brien. Stephen Innes of OANDA is also unimpressed by Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public declarations not to panic: Honestly, this would be comic if it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so tragic as the name is ridiculous and depressing the same time, the ultimate markets tragicomedy unfolds. It is getting so bad out here that investors might be in the midst of giving up on the US administrations policies, voting with their feet and fleeing risk markets en masse. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip stock index has closed at its lowest level in over two years, as the stock market selloff refuses to end. The FTSE 100 has ended the shortened Christmas Eve trading session at 6685 points, down 35 points or 0.5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest closing price since 14 September 2016 [but 40 points above last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intraday lows] This means that the FTSE 100 has lost more than 4% in December alone, wiping out \u00c2\u00a376bn of shareholder value since the end of November. For 2018 as a whole, the Footsie is down 13% this year, in a grim 12 months for investors around the globe. The traditional Santa rally has clearly not come to the City this year. Since the 1980s, there have only been six Decembers in which the FTSE 100 didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise. 2018 is very likely to be another one. Economic growth worries, the US government shutdown, trade tensions, and Brexit have all taken their toll this month. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to calm the markets, by announcing that the top US banks have enough liquidity, may not be helping. As the Financial Times put it: The statement appeared to be an attempt by the administration to calm nerves after a volatile week for traders and media reports that President Donald Trump was contemplating firing Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell. Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, warned that among traders, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sentiment is so negative right now that markets will assume the worst\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about any suggestion that Mr Trump could seek to remove Mr Powell. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Until this weekend, markets were not that concerned about liquidity or clearance issues,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mr Thin said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At best, Mnuchin made a rookie policy mistake in trying to reassure markets; at worst, Mnuchin knows something that the markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares are coming under more pressure in London, with just a few minutes trading left today. The FTSE 100 is now down 0.75%, or 51 points, as traders hear that Wall Street may open lower.... Global slowdown worries are also hitting commodity prices. Aluminium has hit a 16-month low this morning, as traders worry that demand for metals will weaken in 2019. Aluminium prices have also weakened since the US said it would lift sanctions on Russian producer Rusal last week. More here. Newsflash: Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tireless City editor has a Christmas Eve scoop! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 250 index isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t getting any sprinkling of good cheer from Santa either. The index, which contains medium-sized, UK focused companies too small for the FTSE 100, has dropped 0.6% so far today - down 97 points at 17,345. Nearly every sector is in the red: Pharmaceuticals firm Indivior is the biggest faller, followed by gambling firms Playtech and 888 Holdings. Playtech warned shareholders this morning that a new Italian gambling law will hit its profits. More reaction to Steven Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to convene a crisis team to calm the markets: As it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly Christmas...... With an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading to go in London, the FTSE 100 is still in the red. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re currently off 23 points at 6689, a drop of 0.5%, meaning the Footsie could hit a new two-year closing low today.... 2018 is shaping up to be the worst year for the markets since the financial crisis of 2008. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of concern that 2019 will be tough too. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says there are several reasons to worry: One of many reasons why investors have got more than a little spooked is down to valuations, the outlook for global growth, as well as concern over the direction of Fed policy, which has seen US yields slide sharply after peaking at multi year highs earlier this year. Uncertainty over the future direction of Fed policy has seen US policymakers start to resile from expectations around multiple rate rises next year, though markets still appear to be clinging to the possibility of one rate rise next year. The US-China trade dispute is another factor, as is Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing economy and political tensions: There is also concern about the direction of travel in respect of the European growth story with Italy in danger of falling into recession in the last part of this year, while the young pretender to Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crown as the head of Europe, Emmanuel Macron appears to have fallen flat on his face by neglecting France domestic policies in his desire for a more closely integrated Europe. This \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gilets jaunes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd protests which have blighted Paris are a classic case of political deafness to an increasingly squeezed middle that is fed up with fuel tax rises and cost of living squeezes, while the more mobile tax base benefits from tax reductions. To take the sting out of this, President Macron has embarked on a massive spending giveaway which is likely to send the French budget deficit to 3.5% of GDP in 2019. World stock markets are suffering their seventh straight day of losses today, as rising pessimism pushes shares steadily down. Reuters has more details: MSCI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was 0.15 percent lower on the day and down almost 7 percent in the past seven sessions -- its worst stretch of daily losses since January 2016. The index is also just off its lowest level since March 2017. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are a whole number of factors that have triggered this latest risk off climate, including the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very modest deviation from its (rate hiking) plan and the government shutdown in the United States,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Investec economist Philip Shaw. The U.S. Senate has been unable to break an impasse over U.S. President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demand for more funds for a wall on the border with Mexico, and a senior official said the shutdown could continue until January 3. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We may get some clarity on several factors in early 2019 starting with a clearer line of sight on the prospect for a resolution in U.S.-China trade dispute, but until there are some nerves flying around,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Investec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shaw said. Anxiety over the economic and political outlook in 2019 is pushing the gold price higher. Gold has gained around six dollars per ounce today to $1,262, which would be its highest closing value since last June: Bad new for any Wise Men who left their Christmas shopping to the last minute... Gold is traditionally seen as a safe store of value in troubled times (assuming you can find someone who wants to buy it then!). So the prospect of the global economy slowing next year, and the risk that the US government shutdown rumbles on, is good for bullion. David Jones, Chief Market Strategist at Capital.com, explains: Gold has been the shining performer in recent weeks. As uncertainty ramps up in other assets, gold has been enjoying something of a bounce back from its summer lows. It has risen by $100 an ounce since then, and is up by more than 6% over the past four months. If the wider uncertainty continues into 2019, gold could well retain its popularity and be a market to watch. (Prices weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t available for the frankincense and myrrh markets) It really has been a bleak month for shares in London. The FTSE 100 index (packed this top multinational companies) has shed around 300 points in December. It ended November at 6980 points, but is now hovering around 6684 points after several big losses. By my maths, that means some \u00c2\u00a376bn has been wiped off the blue-chip index this month. European bank shares are dipping this morning, as markets react to the news that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market crisis team is being convened. Financial stocks across Europe are down 0.8% on average, led by Romania\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Raiffeisen Bank (-4.3%). Clearly investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overjoyed to learn that Treasury secretary Mnuchin has been on the phone to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bank bosses, checking they have enough money.... Some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest technology companies have been hit hard by this autumn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. As this chart from the FT shows, Amazon and Apple have both lost a quarter of their value since the summer. Amazon, which was worth a staggering one trillion dollars in September, is now only valued at $673bn. Apple, which hit the $1tn mark first, is now valued at $715bn. Tech firms have been hurt by the US-China trade war, which threatens to hurt global growth as well as driving up import costs. The prospect of tighter regulation, following data protection scandals, have also weight on the sector. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets fears that Wall Street will also continue its December losses (having already slumped by more than 10% this month): US futures are trading lower as investors focus on the US partial government shutdown. The disappointing fact is that there is no immediate end in sight for this resolution... The ongoing downtrend would continue to dominate today and markets are likely to close lower again. The big fallers in London this morning are water group United Utilities (-3.4%), advertising group WPP (-2.7%) and tobacco group Imperial Brands (-2.3%). Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lots worrying investors right now, particularly from the Trump White House..... Markets are still under pressure from last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more hawkish update from the US Federal Reserve, exacerbating fears about slowing growth and more expensive refinancing following years of stimulus. This is on top of pre-existing trade war fears with the US Trade Secretary saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All auto tariff options still on the table\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That said, China says it will remove some import and export tariffs on 1 Jan which has helped improve sentiment overnight. Countering this nugget of positivity, however, we have; 1) a US government shutdown (Senate Democrats refusing the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demands for border wall funds); 2) US Defence Chief leaving even earlier than expected, and; 3) Treasury Secretary awkwardly calling Bank executives about market stability after a) market sell-off, b) government shutdown, and c) rumours the President asked if he could fire Fed Chair Powell. Mixed signals a plenty into Christmas! This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses mean the FTSE 100 is only 40 points away from the 28-month low struck last week. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a strong risk that the Footsie will close at a new two-year low, as this chart shows: You can track Santa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s progress via Norad (the North American Aerospace Defense Command), who have been motoring his progress every year for decades. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty obvious that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not coming to trading floors in London, Paris, and Madrid. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main stock market indices are all in the red this morning, inflicting further losses on investor portfolios. In London, technology and telecoms firms, consumer groups, utilities and industrial firms are all down. Overnight, US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin revealed he has spoken with the heads of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s six largest banks. The move appears to be an attempt to reassure investors after the recent stock market losses, and anxiety over the government shutdown. Mnuchin tweeted that the CEOs told him they all have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ample liquidity available for lending to consumer, business markets, and all other market operations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a relief, except investors are now wondering WHY Mnuchin is so keen to reassure them.... Mnuchin is also planning to convene the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s working group on financial markets, later today. The group, created following the stock market crash of October 1987, is known more commonly as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plunge protection team\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and met in 2009 in the latter stages of the financial crisis. More here: Trading in Asia-Pacific stock markets has been weak, with the South Korean Kospi index and Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng both dipping. Tokyo was closed, though, to mark the Japanese Emperor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Despite its best efforts to be good all year, the City won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be getting a visit from Santa this year. After weeks of anxious trading, and occasional wild plunges, investors may be struggling to find a spare sixpence for the Christmas pudding. Slowdown worries, trade war fears, Brexit...the list of factors blamed for the rout are as familiar as Santa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s herd of reindeer. And even Rudolph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s famously colourful nose would be overshadowed by the sea of red that engulfed the markets this month. During December, the FTSE 100 has tumbled by 3.7%, and is down a painful 12.5% during 2018. Wall Street has been harder hit - the S&amp;P 500 has lost 12% this month alone! Unless there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a massive rebound soon, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be looking at the worst December since the Great Recession. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is only a half-day trading session, giving traders (and live-bloggers!) the opportunity for some last-minute gift-shopping. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no festive spirits in the City this morning; the Footsie is expected to fall by 45 points, back towards last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 28-month low. Donald Trump continues to worry the markets. Over the weekend, there were several reports that the president has discussed whether he could sack Federal Reserve governor Jerome Powell. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin has denied this, adding that Trump realises he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dismiss Powell anyway. But still, the attacks on Powell - on top of the US government shutdown - are a worry. As Steven Innes of trading firm OANDA says: Honestly, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe my eyes when I read the Bloomberg headline over the weekend that Trump was considering firing Powell. Markets rise on confidence as well as economic growth and coming off one of the worst weeks since GFC; one would have expected more reassuring comments from the Whitehouse Thankfully Mnuchin came to the rescue to squash any thought\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of this happening as I was about to crazy glue my \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sell button\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd down at Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing in the economic calendar today, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be watching for any pre-Christmas developments....",

                "bodyText":"Today was yet another rollercoaster day for global markets, in what has been a volatile month as 2018 draws to a close. After a huge rally on Wall Street on Boxing Day, when the Dow surged more than 1,000 points or nearly 5%, most European markets opened higher this morning. But the boost proved short-lived, and the sell-off in Europe gathered pace as the day went on. In the UK, the FTSE 100 is down 104 points or 1.6% at 6,581.78 - the lowest since July 2016, a month after the Brexit vote. Meanwhile Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB are both down more than 2%. Over in the US, lower-than-expected jobless claims last week failed to prop up markets after the big gains on Wednesday. The Dow is currently down 293 points or 1.3%, at 22,585. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for all the comments and please join us again tomorrow. US markets are down after the opening bell, as yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally runs out of steam: Dow Jones: -1.4% S&amp;P 500: -1.3% Nasdaq: -1.5% There were 216,000 initial jobless claims in the week ending 22 December according to the US Labor Department. It was a fall from the 217,000 claims filed a week earlier (revised up from a first estimate of 214,000), and lower than the 217,000 claims predicted by economists. The UK travel industry is another sector facing considerable pressure in 2019, according to David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets: The travel sector had a difficult 2018, and given the concerns about global growth, a slight decline in consumer appetites and uncertainty surrounding Brexit, the industry is likely to have a downbeat start to 2019. On the plus side, the oil price has dropped considerably, but that might be irrelevant if firms have locked in their exposure already. The drop in the oil market is also a reflection about worries of a slowing economy. The Brexit clock is ticking, and UK consumers are likely to be cautious in the first few months of next year. Figures out so far suggest many retailers have had a tough Christmas this year, as Brexit-cautious consumers cut back on spending. The struggle to win customers will intensify in 2019, according to a report by KPMG and Ipsos Retail Think Tank. The authors note: It is too easy to point the finger at Brexit as the singular cause of all the woes in the industry. There is in fact a much wider array of forces at play currently. These forces have been gathering momentum for a number of years and are by no means new. Changing consumer behaviour, the over-supply of physical stores, high levels of legacy debt, regulatory and compliance costs, macro-economic and geopolitical challenges, and a lack of talent at the top of retail businesses to help deliver much-needed change, were all highlighted as forces that would impact negatively on the industry in 2019 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c regardless of the outcome of Brexit. European markets are a sea of red as afternoon trading gets underway... the early boost from Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Boxing Day surge has well and truly worn off. Here are the latest scores: FTSE 100: -1.1% at 6,611 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -2% at 10,421 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.4% at 4,610 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -1.6% at 18,112 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.9% at 8,402 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX: -1.1% at 331 The outlook for oil prices is bleak, according to analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe. Ashley Kelty and Jack Allardyce write: Crude prices took a battering on Monday as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSanta rout\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 continued to hit the markets. With investors spooked by fears over weakening demand and the near term supply glut, prices fell sharply in thin volumes. The sharp drop even after the impending imposition of new quotas by OPEC+ continues to worry the cartel, with the UAE Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazroueei reportedly claiming that OPEC+ will hold an extraordinary meeting to discuss increasing the cuts and/or extending the period of the new quotas (beyond the four months currently in place). The latest attack by President Trump on the leadership of the Federal Reserve led to sharp falls across the board, as investors worry about the potential for a recession in 2019. This latest Twitter outburst (does Trump do anything else?) led to the president of Rosneft to directly blame Trump for the fall in oil prices, and warned that oil prices may remain in the $50-$53 range in 2019. Fundamentals in the oil market look bleak, with slowing economic growth and weaker than expected demand pushing the market firmly into bear territory. Lower oil prices are weighing on the FTSE, with Brent crude down 1.7% at $53.54 a barrel on renewed fears of a supply glut. The FTSE 100 is currently down 36 points or 0.5% at 6,650.44 - the lowest since early August 2016 in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Here are the biggest fallers as it stands: A quick update on the pound, which is roughly flat against the dollar this morning, at $1.2634. Against the euro, sterling is down 0.3% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1091. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, ponders what history might tell us about current market volatility: The FTSE 100 is treating a 5% surge in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P 500 benchmark with a good degree of caution and it is easy to see why, even if that was the eighteenth biggest single-day gain in the US index since 1970. Encouragingly, three of the seventeen other 5%-plus daily advances came immediately in the aftermath of the 1987 Crash, when buying did prove a good plan, and two more in March 2009 when the S&amp;P finally hit bottom as the Great Financial Crisis began to abate. But history also shows eight of the 5%-plus gains came during the bear market of 2007-2009 and three more during the market downturn of 2000-2003, to suggest there is still a risk that this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Boxing Day bonanza could be no more than a wicked bear trap set to lure investors into more trouble. That may explain why the FTSE 100 is hardly responding at all and investors and traders alike will be looking out for a couple of further definitive signals before they decide it really is time to buy on the dips following this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christmas sell-off. US futures are also down, after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major rally on Wall Street: Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Boxing Day surge has failed to materialise in Europe, where markets are now mixed: FTSE 100: -0.4% at 6,662 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.6% at 10,572 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.7% at 4,660 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -1% at 18,216 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.1% at 8,491 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.1% at 335 Gatwick Airport is back in the news today but thankfully it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not drone-related. US investment fund Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) is selling a majority stake (50.01%) in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second biggest airport for \u00c2\u00a32.9bn to France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vinci Airports. Gatwick adds to Vinci\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extensive network of airports, including Lisbon, Porto and Funchal in Portugal, and Lyon-Saint-Exup\u00c3\u00a9ry and Nantes Atlantique in France. Nicolas Notebaert, president of Vinci Airports, has his sights set on growth: As Gatwick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new industrial partner, Vinci Airports will support and encourage growth of traffic, operational efficiency and leverage its international expertise in the development of commercial activities to further improve passenger satisfaction and experience. One man who has tracked the ups and downs of Wall Street more than most is Peter Tuchman \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the most famous face on the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Headline-grabbing swings in US markets are often accompanied by photos of Tuchman, whose ability to capture the moment in a series of dramatic expressions and poses is second-to-none. Dominic Rushe, business editor for Guardian USA, has interviewed the man himself in the must-read piece below: The Boxing Day surge on Wall Street was not attributed to any one factor, but was probably helped by a Mastercard report which showed a jump in consumer spending over the holiday season. Stephen Innes, on the Singapore trading desk of currency specialist Oanda, gives his take: Thankfully for investors, the relentless selling on the back of risk-off sentiment which prevailed leading up to Xmas has mercifully halted as US stock markets recorded significant gains with the Dow surging over 1,000 points while adding the most significant points gain in history. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take much to persuade the bargain hunters into action as early retailer reports are all pointing to a strong holiday season while investors took comfort in Kevin Hassett\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, affirmation that Jerome Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153100 per cent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd safe.

There was a good buzz to buy the dip given the US underlying data suggested the latest rout was far too extreme and unwarranted. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off... Most major European markets opened higher but Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB are lacking in festive cheer: FTSE 100: +0.5% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.3% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.3% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.3% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.6% Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.5% Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European markets are reopening today after the Christmas break and investors will be hoping to see some of the festive cheer seen in the US on Boxing Day spreading to this side of the Atlantic. Wall Street had a major post-Christmas rebound on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones rising more than 1,000 points or nearly 5%, in the biggest ever one-day gain. Full story here: Asian markets followed Wall Street higher, with the Nikkei in Tokyo rising 3.9% on Thursday, taking it out of the bear market it entered on Christmas Day with a 5% drop. The post-Christmas rally in the US followed the worst-ever performance on Christmas Eve. When UK markets were last open on the 24th, the FTSE 100 hit its lowest close since September 2016, down 35 points or 0.5% at 6,685. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much data due today, but we do have US weekly jobless claims figures at 1.30pm UK time.",
