State governments also shed 13,000 employees.</p> <p>The unemployment rate was unchanged at only 3.7% last month, as a 233,000 gain in the household survey measure of employment more than offset a 133,000 increase in the labour force. That said, the broader U6 measure of unemployment did rebound to 7.6%, from 7.4%. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.2% m/m in November, with the annual growth rate unchanged at 3.1%.</p> <p>Overall, employment growth may be fading a little from the unsustainable pace in the first half of this year, but there is nothing here to unduly worry the Fed or prevent it from hiking interest rates at this month\u2019s FOMC meeting.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c0a80b3e4b01d1e859e6c5a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-12-07T14:21:37.353Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The European stock markets are all pushing higher, clawing back more of yesterday\u2019s losses.</strong></p> <p>Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is leading the way, up almost 2%, with solid gains on Germany\u2019s DAX (0.8%) and France\u2019s CAC (+1.5%).</p> <p>This seems to confirm that traders are relieved that the US economy is still creating jobs, but not so rapidly to force several interest rate hikes in 2019.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8fc6e7232a00edf5e971c01341be1e530134c6a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fc6e7232a00edf5e971c01341be1e530134c6a1/0_0_851_253/500.jpg\" alt=\"European stock markets\" width=\"500\" height=\"149\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">European stock markets</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MeetingRoom/Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c0a7d6ce4b01d1e859e6c39\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-12-07T14:04:45.730Z\">2.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Matt Weller of Faraday Investment Research says:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MWellerFX/status/1071041165087129600\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">See my Top 3 Takeaways from today&#39;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NFP</a> report: <a href=\"https://t.co/waPFOGJ2Cj\">pic.twitter.com/waPFOGJ2Cj</a></p>&mdash; Matt Weller CFA, CMT (@MWellerFX) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MWellerFX/status/1071041165087129600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 7, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c0a7cb7e4b0b950d12f8447\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-12-07T14:02:14.417Z\">2.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>America created tens of thousands more jobs in transportation and warehousing last month, as online shopping continued to expand.</strong></p> <p>Today\u2019s non-farm payroll report shows that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Employment in transportation and warehousing rose by 25,000 in November</p> <p>Job gains occurred in couriers and messengers (+10,000) and in warehousing and storage (+6,000).

                "bodyText":"And finally.... Wall Street can put a brutal week behind it, as the closing bell rings. The Dow Jones industrial average has ended the day down 559 points, a drop of 2.2%. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2.3% Technology stocks led the rout, with Microsoft down 4%, Intel losing 3.75%, Cisco off 3.7%, IBM losing 3.6% and Apple shedding 3.3% This knocked Nasdaq down by over 3%. All three indices have just suffered their worst week since March, down at least 4.5%. That\u2019s a good illustration of the worry that swept Wall Street this week, as investors fretted about a slowing economy and heightening trade war fears. Next week could be dramatic too, with the Huawei case overshadowing markets and Brexit heading towards a climax.... Until then, goodnight. GW CNBC have pinned the blame for today\u2019s losses on Peter Navarro, a trade advisor to president Trump. Navarro\u2019s told CNN earlier that Trump would \u201csimply raise\u201d tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods if no deal is reached during the cease-fire. Cue a sell-off.... It\u2019s hard to remember now, but this week began with optimism following Donald Trump\u2019s dinner date with Xi Jinping. On Monday, investors were talking about a \u2018trade truce\u2019. Now, they\u2019re looking at a 5% drop in US stocks over the week: Ernie Cecilia, chief investment officer at Bryn Mawr Trust Co, blames this week\u2019s market gyrations on a \u201crepricing of growth.\u201d Cecilia says (via Bloomberg): The bond market is essentially saying we don\u2019t see the kind of growth that we\u2019ve had. So what the market is doing is repricing stocks, particularly those that have performed extraordinarily well, to a lower growth rate. More details of Meng Wanzhou\u2019s bail hearing: The Nasdaq is now down 3%, as a late burst of selling hits the index. Over in Vancouver, Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou\u2019s extradition hearing is underway. Several journalists are tweeting about the case, which has spooked markets in recent days (and a major factor behind today\u2019s falls in New York) Here\u2019s Mi-Jung Lee of CTV Vancouver: Deirdre Bosa of CNBC is also covering the trial: Technology stocks are being hit hard tonight, as persistent worries about trade wars ripple through Wall Street again. Chip makers, and consumer electronics companies such as Apple, are leading the sell-off. With two hours of the trading week to go, Wall Street is heading deeper into the red. Here\u2019s the damage: Dow: down 527 points or 2.1% at 24,420 S&amp;P 500: down 57 points or 2.1% at 2,638 Nasdaq: down 187 points or 2.6% at 7,000 Fiona Cincotta of City Index says the New York market is getting rather nervous... Apart from the China trade factor the US markets have been more nervous than usual over the last few sessions as investors are getting increasingly concerned that the long-term bull run in the stock markets may be nearing its end. During the week the yields in the bond markets inverted \u2013 that is, some of the yields on longer term papers declined below the shorter term yields, a reversal of a normal situation and a signal that has in the past preceded economic downturn. Today\u2019s losses risk dragging the Dow Jones industrial average into a bear market: Shares in US Steel are down 1.45% today, reflecting concerns over trade relations between America and China. That\u2019s not too bad a fall...but look at the picture since Donald Trump started imposing tariffs: Although today\u2019s US jobs report showed fewer new jobs than expected, and less wage growth, it wasn\u2019t a shocker. Here\u2019s Marketwatch\u2019s take: The jobs report threaded the needle really well,\u201d J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist with TD Ameritrade told MarketWatch, arguing that 155,000 new jobs is neither too high nor too low for investors. \u201cHad the this come in really hot, the market would have interpreted it as a number that would force the Fed to raise rates not just in December, but in March too,\u201d he said. \u201cYou also didn\u2019t want to miss in a huge way on the down side, as it would have shaken faith in the economy,\u201d he said. Here\u2019s a neat chart showing where jobs were created, and lost, in the US last month: David Madden of CMC Markets blames conflicting noises from White House advisors for the losses in New York today. Markets have had a volatile few days and today is no different. The Major US indices rallied on the open, but turned lower yet again. The sharp move on Wall Street is partially driven by conflicting announcements from Washington DC. Larry Kudlow, director of the US national economic council, claimed the Federal Reserve responds to data, not President Trump. Mr Kudlow also said the US might extend the 90-day truce with China if talks don\u2019t go well. On the other hand, Peter Navarro ,advisor to Trump ,claims the US will press ahead with new tariffs if a deal hasn\u2019t been reached after the 90 day period. The non-farm payrolls report was \u201cmediocre\u201d, Madden adds. In November, 155,000 jobs were added, which was well below the 200,000 that economists were expecting. The October report was revised down to 237,000 from 250,000. The jobless rate remained unchanged at 3.7% - meeting forecasts. On a monthly basis, average earnings was 0.2%, but traders were expecting 0.3%, and the October reading was revised down to 0.1% from 0.2% The yearly average earnings reading held steady at 3.1%. There were positive aspects to the report, but the negatives made traders less fearful about potential rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. Back on Wall Street, the Dow is over 400 points down, or 1.6%. The rally weakened in the final hour, but London\u2019s stock market has still recovered some of Thursday\u2019s big fall. The FTSE 100 has closed 1.1% higher tonight at 6,778, a gain of 74 points. That\u2019s just over a third of yesterday\u2019s rout, which cut the value of the Footsie by \u00a356bn, in its worst fall since June 2016. Here\u2019s Investing.com senior analyst Barani Krishnan on the Opec deal: \u201dOil traders will react positively to the OPEC deal to cut 1.2 million barrels per day... However, the market will also be watching for any signs of cheating by OPEC and punish the cartel accordingly. \u201dThe bigger takeaway is what the Saudi Energy Minister would possibly have on his mind as he leaves Vienna today; a Russia that has become as powerful to OPEC as Riyadh and a U.S. that is now a net exporter of oil. \u201cFurthermore, we\u2019ve not even gotten to the Khashoggi fallout and likely Trump dismay over these cuts. One can only speculate at this point to how this will play out for the Saudis and their oil business going forward.\u201d European markets are holding onto their gains. With 30 minutes to go, the FTSE 100 is up 1.9% at 6831, a 127-point swing upwards. Here\u2019s our US business editor Dominic Rushe on today\u2019s US jobs report: America\u2019s record breaking streak of job creation appears to be slowing. The Labor Department announced the US had added 155,000 in November, well below last month\u2019s figures and economists\u2019 forecasts. November was the 98th consecutive month of growth in hiring, the longest streak of jobs growth since records began. But the pace of hiring slowed dramatically last month. The US added 250,000 jobs in October and economists had expected 198,000 new jobs to be added this month. The unemployment rate remained at 3.7%, a low unseen since 1969, and the US is still adding around 200,000 jobs a month. But some market watchers believe the recovery is running out of steam. More here.... Uh oh.... Wall Street is turning south. The Dow is now down 203 points, or around 0.8%, at 24,743 points. The Nasdaq is also in the red, down 1%, while the S&amp;P 500 has lost 0.6%. Technology stocks are leading the sell-off, with IBM and Intel both down 2.2%, Apple losing 1.6% and Microsoft down 1%. Caterpillar, maker of construction equipment, is down 1.5% while Nike has lost 1.2%. Over in Vienna, Opec has finally agreed a deal to cut oil production. After long, tense wrangling, the oil cartel has agreed to cut its production by 800,000 barrels per day. Non-member states (such as Russia) will cut their production by an extra 400,000, taking the total reduction to 1.2 million barrels per day. News of the cut has sent crude prices rallying; Brent crude is up 5% to $63.15 per barrel, up three dollars. Iran, Libya and Venezuela reportedly exempt from the decision. Iranian oil minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh told the IRNA news agency: \u201cNegotiations were tough; thank God, we are pleased with this level of reduction in oil supply.\u201d Larry Kudlow, the head of Donald Trump\u2019s national economic council, has declared that America\u2019s economy is in a good spot. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Kudlow cited supply side growth, productivity improvements, tax cuts and deregulation, saying they could help the US economy keep growing solidly next year. Kudlow also suggested that the Federal Reserve had dialled down its interest rate hike plans (after plenty of pressure from the president). Kudlow was also asked about the Huawei case -- is there any reason for US tech executives to worry about visiting China? All businesses operating in China need to keep eyes open, Kudlow replied. He added that there is now widespread agreement that China must \u201cchange its ways and take a big reform position on the WTO\u201d, thanks what he called a \u201ctrading coalition of the willing\u201d. Marina Mensah-Afoakwah, senior economist at the CEBR, suspects that the US Federal Reserve will vote to raise interest rates later this month. While today\u2019s figures in isolation may not give a reason for concern, the context in which they have arisen could cause some anxiety. If the weak global outlook persists amid current trade tensions, future job growth in the US may continue to disappoint.\u201d She also sent over this chart, showing how the US unemployment rate has fallen steadily to just 3.7%, the lowest since 1969. The Dow is pushing higher.... now up 120 points, as New York investors recover their nerve. But will it last?... So far, so calm..... This time yesterday, Wall Street was falling heavily as global markets were riled by the arrest of Huawei\u2019s CFO. Today things are calmer, thanks to the jobs report. The Dow has crept up by 18 points, or 0.07% to 24,966. That\u2019s a teensy tiny move, but the significant point is that the New York stock exchange hasn\u2019t fallen back towards yesterday\u2019s lows (the Dow fell 780 points, but only closed 79 points lower). Today\u2019s jobs report shows that the US economy is slowing, but not drastically, says Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics. He\u2019s written a thorough note on November\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll....and here it is: The slightly more modest 155,000 gain in payroll employment in November may not go down well in markets given the heightened nervousness in recent months, but this is still a solid gain that suggests economic growth is gradually slowing back towards its potential pace. There is nothing here to suggest the economy is suffering a more sudden downturn. Admittedly, 155,000 was below the consensus forecast at 200,000 and the six-month average, which was slightly above 200,000. But gains of that magnitude should still be enough to keep the unemployment rate grinding lower. Looking at the employment breakdown, manufacturing increased by a healthy 27,000, retail added 18,000 and transportation added 25,000 (including 10,000 couriers ahead of the Holiday season). Leisure &amp; hospitality added only 15,000, however, and education &amp; health added only 34,000. Both below normal. State governments also shed 13,000 employees. The unemployment rate was unchanged at only 3.7% last month, as a 233,000 gain in the household survey measure of employment more than offset a 133,000 increase in the labour force. That said, the broader U6 measure of unemployment did rebound to 7.6%, from 7.4%. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.2% m/m in November, with the annual growth rate unchanged at 3.1%. Overall, employment growth may be fading a little from the unsustainable pace in the first half of this year, but there is nothing here to unduly worry the Fed or prevent it from hiking interest rates at this month\u2019s FOMC meeting. The European stock markets are all pushing higher, clawing back more of yesterday\u2019s losses. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is leading the way, up almost 2%, with solid gains on Germany\u2019s DAX (0.8%) and France\u2019s CAC (+1.5%). This seems to confirm that traders are relieved that the US economy is still creating jobs, but not so rapidly to force several interest rate hikes in 2019. Matt Weller of Faraday Investment Research says: America created tens of thousands more jobs in transportation and warehousing last month, as online shopping continued to expand. Today\u2019s non-farm payroll report shows that: Employment in transportation and warehousing rose by 25,000 in November Job gains occurred in couriers and messengers (+10,000) and in warehousing and storage (+6,000). Over the year, transportation and warehousing has added 192,000 jobs. America\u2019s service sector created the bulk of the new jobs last month, hiring around 132,000 new workers. Factories also expanded their workforces, with 27,000 new hires. Economics professor Justin Wolfers reckons today\u2019s jobs report will reassure the Federal Reserve that they have the situation under control. With jobs still being created, and wages rising modestly, there\u2019s little sign that the economy is over-heating. This jobs report doesn\u2019t have much cheer for US workers, although the unemployment rate remained at just 3.7%. Bad news IS good news for the markets! The UK\u2019s FTSE is now up by 112 points, or 1.7%, close to its highest point of the day. Wall Street future, which has been down earlier, are recovering too. More disappointment! US wages only grew by 0.2% month-on-month in November, dashing hopes of a 0.3% rise. That\u2019s a blow to US families in the run-up to the festive season. Annual wage growth was 3.1%, the same as in October. BREAKING: The US economy created 155,000 new jobs last month, fewer than the 200,000 which Wall Street had expected. And in another blow, October\u2019s figures was revised down to 237,000, from a first estimate of 250,000. That suggests the labor market isn\u2019t as strong as hoped - which will lower the pressure to raise US interest rates. More to follow..... Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies, predicts that shares will fall if the US jobs report beats forecasts....and rise if it misses. As he puts it on Bloomberg TV: Good equals bad, and bad equals good. That\u2019s because the markets will assume that the US Federal Reserve will step in to support the economy, if required. We\u2019ll find out if he\u2019s right very soon! Word from the White House.... As City traders grab a quick sandwich before the US jobs report (oh the glamour!), here\u2019s a look at the markets. FTSE 100: Up 80 points at 6784, a gain of 1.2% German DAX: Up 49 points at 10,860, a gain of 0.4% French CAC: Up 61 points at 4,842, a gain of 1.3% Definitely a recovery, but a relatively muted one given European markets shed more than 3% on Thurday. A reminder of how the US monthly job-creation figures have bounced around in recent months: The London stock exchange is holding onto most of its early gains, as City traders turn their attention across the Atlantic. Huawei\u2019s CFO, Meng Wanzhou, is expected at a bail hearing in Canada later today. That might yield more information about why she was arrested, and whether she\u2019ll be extradited to the US. Mihir Kapadia of Sun Global Investments says investors are worried that Meng\u2019s arrest will destabilise US-China relations. China and the US continue to have frosty relations and this has seen investors prefer to stay away than get involved in what has proven to be a volatile market for quite some time now. This reversed the hope felt earlier in the week after it was announced the US would delay tariffs on China in the aim of making progress but it is now clear that this negativity will last until the new year.\u201d Traders will also be watching for the US jobs report, in 30 minutes. Wall Street expects that around 200,000 new jobs were created last month, with wages rising by 0.3% month-on-month, or 3.1% year-on-year. A strong report might rock markets, as it would put pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in 2019. But weak job creation, and paltry earnings growth, could force the Fed to leave borrowing costs alone - which is good for equities. The Bank of England is already under fire over its warning about a no-deal Brexit. But it now faces another storm. Top officials from Venezuela have flown to London, to ask for 14 tonnes of their gold back. The Press Association has the details: The Bank is reportedly due to meet Calixto Ortega Sanchez, president of the Venezuelan Central Bank, and Simon Zerpa, the Venezuelan minister of finance, over the repatriation of 550 million US dollars (431 million) of gold. The Bank is the second largest depository of gold and has been holding Venezuela\u2019s gold deposits since the 1980s. Andrew Lewer MP wrote to the Bank and the Treasury, criticising the move, saying a meeting \u201cwould pose significant reputational risk to the Bank and may be in violation of US Treasury imposed sanctions\u201d. Mr Lewer said Mr Zerpa has been sanctioned by the US Treasury Department and that Mr Ortega Sanchez \u201cis not a legitimate president\u201d of the Venezuelan Central Bank as his appointment \u201cwas not ratified by the National Assembly\u201d. \u201cIt is entirely inappropriate for senior officials of the Bank of England to meet with an individual who has been placed on the US sanctions list for reasons of corruption. To treat with such an individual would threaten the reputation of both the Bank of England and the Government as a whole,\u201d Mr Lewer said. Although the markets are up today, fears over the global economy haven\u2019t gone away. Royal Bank of Canada have cautioned that Chinese trade data due out on Saturday should be watched very closely, for signs that export growth have dropped. RBC\u2019s Sue Trinh says: There is compelling evidence that exports, which have surprised significantly to the upside in the last three months, have been boosted by front-loading ahead of successive tranches of tariffs. Export growth (in yuan terms) is expected to slow to 14% year-on-year from 20% previously (or from 16% to 9% in US dollar terms). But as the chart shows, there is potential for a much sharper weakening, this month or in the coming one to three months. Exports in the sectors first affected by tariffs (steel and aluminium) are already falling from their June peak. The FTSE 250 index, which contains smaller UK-focused companies, is also recovering today. It\u2019s gained 193 points, or over 1%. Games Workshop, the miniature wargaming firm, is among the top risers, up over 5%. It told shareholders this morning that sales and profits are in line with expectations, and that its Warhammer business is in \u201cgreat shape in our core markets.\u201d But while demand for GW\u2019s intricately-designed Cataphractii Terminators, Taurox armoured personnel carriers and chainsword-toting missionaries is holding up now, an economic shock could change that. Last week, company founder Ian Livingstone warned that Brexit could destabilise the UK\u2019s gaming sector, which contributes around \u00a32bn to the UK economy per year. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management believes the threat of new US tariffs on Chinese goods caused Thursday\u2019s sell-off. But on the upside, he reckons today\u2019s non-farm payroll jobs report will show American workers are in demand. Equity markets had a bad day on Thursday. The fear of additional US trade taxes is really not being well received, and investors seem to see the risk as rising. Otherwise, economic data was generally pretty good. Today\u2019s US employment report is more likely to show firms struggling to find people to hire, than a lack of jobs available. Speaking of slowing economies...new data have confirmed that the eurozone only grew by 0.2% in the last quarter. The single currency bloc was dragged down by Germany, which contracted by 0.2%, and Italy which shrank by 0.1%. The UK outperformed the average, though, expanding by 0.6% thanks to strong growth in July. Ralf Preusser, head of rates research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says recent market instability is mainly due to concerns about the underlying global economy. That includes the impact of the US-China trade dispute, and worries that we are approaching the end of the economic cycle (ie, heading towards a recession) Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Preusser explains that the markets are paying \u201cparticular attention\u201d to the Federal Reserve, to see how US central bankers handle the situation. Will the Fed recognise these fears, and try to engineer a soft landing (by being more cautious about rate hikes)? Or will they press on, given that economic data suggests the US economy isn\u2019t really slowing at all, he explains. Consumer-facing firms, telecoms, tech and industrial companies are leading the rally in London: Good news! \u00a327bn has been wiped back onto the value of Britain\u2019s biggest companies this morning. Britain\u2019s stock markets has now clawed back half of yesterday\u2019s slump -- while European markets are also holding onto their moderate gains. But after such a choppy few weeks in the markets, further swings must be likely. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says next year could be volatile too. \u201cA 1.6% rally in the FTSE 100 is welcome relief after yesterday\u2019s horrible session, although this only claws back some of the losses. The important point to note is the large swings in the market on a daily basis in recent weeks, which may suggest volatility could become one of the key themes in 2019. \u201cIt would be possible to draw the conclusion that investors are overreacting to every little bit of information related to politics, economics and the markets. Ultimately it does tell you that investors are extremely nervous and confidence cannot be very high as we approach the end of the year. But right now, the FTSE 100 is holding onto a triple-digit gain (just): Several property experts are blaming Brexit uncertainty for the slowdown in UK property prices. Here\u2019s Mike Scott, chief property analyst at estate agent Yopa, \u2018This suggests that the usual Christmas slowdown in the housing market has started early this year, as people wait for the outcome of the current political turmoil before making long-term commitments, such as buying a new home. \u2018However, the economic fundamentals of low unemployment, low interest rates, growing wages and limited supply are all positive for house prices, and we therefore expect the market to pick up again in the new year.\u2019 Jonathan Samuels, CEO of the property lender, Octane Capital,agrees: \u201cThe lowest rate of growth for six years is a reflection of how Brexit uncertainty has hit the property market for six. \u201cWithout wanting to appear overly pessimistic, there\u2019s every chance 2019 could be 2009 all over again.\u201cPeople need to be preparing for that eventuality and the low level of transactions suggests they are. \u201cAll the ingredients for extreme uncertainty, both political and economic, are in the mix. \u201cMortgages are still cheap and the employment market strong, but the great unknown of Brexit is causing prospective buyers and sellers alike to err on the side of caution. OUCH! UK house prices growth has slowed to a six year low. The Halifax has reported that the average house price declined by 1.4% in November, a substantial fall. On a quarterly basis, prices in September-November were 1.1% lower than in June-August. And annually, prices were only 0.3% higher than a year ago - that\u2019s the weakest growth rate in six years. Russell Galley, managing director, Halifax, says the lack of properties is holding prices up: \u201cHouse price growth has slowed as we approach the end of the year, falling from 1.5% in October to 0.3% in November, with the average cost of a home now \u00a3224,578. While this is the lowest rate of growth in six years, it remains within our forecast range of 0% to 3% for 2018. High employment, wage growth and historically low mortgage rates continue to make home ownership more affordable for many, though the need to raise a significant deposit still acts as something of a restraint on the market. This is largely offset by relatively limited supply of new and existing properties for sale, which continues to sustain house prices nationally.\u201d Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says the markets are recovering today thanks to the last minute recovery on Wall Street last night. The European markets were granted a reprieve on Friday, the Dow Jones\u2019 last minute retreat from the cliff edge on Thursday night paving the way for a greener end to the week. Though Beijing are very much displeased with the arrest of Huawei exec Meng Wanzhou \u2013 China\u2019s media labelled her detention as \u2018despicable\u2019 \u2013 the fact the country nevertheless announced it was \u2018immediately\u2019 applying the trade truce measures agreed with the US appears to have helped reassure the markets that the relationship between the two superpowers hasn\u2019t yet reverted back to its warmongering worst. Shares continue to climb in London, pushing the FTSE 100 index up by 80 points. All but three members of the Footsie have jumped this morning - quite a contrast with yesterday when all but three fell. Scottish Mortgage, the investment trust, is leading the rally - up 4%. Supermarket chain is next, up 3.6%, followed by takeaway delivery group Just Eat (+3.3%). Associated British Food is dragging the index down, though. It has shed 2.5% after warning of difficult trading at its Primark fashion chain. Neil Wilson of Markets.com thinks the Brexit crisis has also hurt UK shares. The FTSE suffered a bruising session on Thursday, declining more than three per cent to close at 6,704.05. There is still lots of pressure on the UK. For the FTSE this is about more than trade wars and the Fed, there is a real political risk premium being factored into shares now as we approach the Brexit crunch. European stock markets have bounced back from their lowest levels in two years, as trading gets underway across the region. In the City, the FTSE 100 index has risen by 0.8%, or 55 points, to 6,758. That claws back some of yesterday\u2019s 217-point rout...but certainly not all of it! But still, investors will be relieved that the sell-off seems to have abated. The French CAC and German DAX has gained 0.7%, while Spain\u2019s IBEX has picked up 0.6%. All good stuff, until you remember that they fell by around 3% on Thursday..... China\u2019s media are usually a good indication of how leaders in Beijing see an issue. And today, they\u2019ve savaged the US over the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, calling it a \u2018despicable\u2019 attempt to undermine Chinese enterprise. My colleague Lily Kuo explains: State-run China Daily said the arrest of Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer appeared to be part of US efforts to contain the company, which is the world\u2019s largest telecoms equipment provider, as well as its second-largest mobile phone maker. \u201cOne thing that is undoubtedly true and proven is the US is trying to do whatever it can to contain Huawei\u2019s expansion in the world simply because the company is the point man for China\u2019s competitive technology companies,\u201d the editorial said. State-run tabloid Global Times said: \u201cObviously Washington is resorting to a despicable rogue\u2019s approach as it cannot stop Huawei\u2019s 5G advance in the market.\u201d Asia-Pacific stock markets recovered after the Chinese government announced it would \u2018immediately\u2019 enforce measures agreed with the US under their trade war truce. But there\u2019s still anxiety on the trading floors, as Associated Press explains: Asian shares are moderately higher as worries over U.S.-China trade friction were calmed by conciliatory comments from Beijing. Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 added 0.8 percent to 21,678.68, and Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 gained 0.4 percent to 5,681.50. South Korea\u2019s Kospi rose 0.3 percent to 2,075.76. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng edged 0.1 percent lower to 26,133.53, while the Shanghai Composite was flat at 2,605.89. Shares also rose in India, Indonesia and Taiwan. \u201cClouded with much uncertainty, markets will likely remain jittery and may struggle to hold on to the gains,\u201d said Jayden Loh, a trader at IG in Singapore. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors around the globe must be desperately counting down the days to the New Year, after enduring another volatile session on Thursday. More than \u00a355bn was wiped off Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 yesterday, in the worst sell-off since the day after the UK voted to leave the EU. The blue-chip index sank by 217 points, or 0ver 3.15%, to a two-year low of 6,704. Traders blamed the shock arrest of Huawei\u2019s CFO, Meng Wanzhou, who is due in court in Canada for a bail hearing. She faces possible extradition to the United States on charges of cyber-espionage and sanctions-busting, which the company firmly deny. Meng\u2019s arrest could intensify the US-China trade war, at a time when the global economy already appears to be slowing - thus the sell-off yesterday (at least, that\u2019s the theory in the City). But don\u2019t rush to liquidate your portfolio yet. Wall Street managed a late recovery last night. After lurching almost 800 points into the red, the Dow ended down just 79 points (0.3%). That has triggered a rebound in Asia overnight, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei up 0.8% and Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 gaining 0.4%. Europe is expected to open higher too. The FTSE is called up around 0.6% points, meaning it would recover a portion of Thursday\u2019s losses. Stephen Innes of trading firms OANDA says these markets are not for the faint of heart, adding: The wall of worry to hurdle for flipping to bullish sentiment is about as big as the Great Wall of China. We\u2019ll be tracking the markets through the day. Also coming up today: The latest US jobs report is eagerly awaited, for signs that America\u2019s strong growth may be fading. Traders will also scrutinise new earnings figures, for clues as to whether the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates in 2019. Opec ministers will be meeting again in Vienna, after failing to agree a deal to cut production yesterday. The cartel hope that Russia (not an Opec member) will agree to curb its own output too - but the uncertainty sent crude prices sliding yesterday. The agenda 8.30am GMT: UK house price figures for November, from Halifax 10am GMT: Updated eurozone growth figures for Q3 2018 1.30pm GMT: US non-farm payroll jobs report for November",
