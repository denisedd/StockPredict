Others think it sounds nice but don\u2019t know all the implications. But WTO was a major victory for us in that formal movement on this wasn\u2019t agreed \u2013 and that\u2019s because some developing countries, especially in Africa, fought it tooth and nail.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the most advanced African countries are the most serious about protecting their domestic industries from foreign competition. Only last week, <a href=\"http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/business/Kenya-rejects-China-EAC-free-trade-agreement/2560-4562142-x5dhrgz/index.html\">Kenya pulled out of a free trade pact with China</a> after it decided the deal was too one-sided.</p> <p>Technology is seen as solving huge problems for developing countries, from corruption to poor standards of education and healthcare, but the issue of democratic control is unlikely to go away \u2013 and is likely to prevent international agreement being reached any time soon.</p> <h2>An Apple a day \u2026 the race for hi-tech healthcare</h2> <p>The tech industry\u2019s appetite for markets to conquer is insatiable<a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/03/how-mobile-technology-could-change-healthcare-in-developing-countries/\"> and healthcare is a priority</a>. Last year Tim Cook, the boss of Apple, revealed that his near-trillion-dollar company was putting healthcare at the centre of all its phone developments.</p> <p>Apple wanted to save lives, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2017/05/03/jim-cramer-talks-with-tim-cook-the-full-interview.html\">he said.</a> A smartphone can be your personal doctor, monitoring your health minute by minute, accessing test results and providing medical information.</p> <p>But this could become a serious issue if the big tech companies don\u2019t just provide the phone, but also hold the health information gathered by it \u2013 information that is in high demand from, for instance, financial services companies looking to sell products to the country\u2019s healthiest people \u2013 or to cancer patients.</p> <p>In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/09/giving-google-private-nhs-data-is-simply-illegal\">consultants working at the Royal Free Hospital trust in London</a> were told last year that it had been illegal for them to approach DeepMind, an artificial intelligence firm owned by Google\u2019s parent, about developing software based on patient data from the trust.</p> <p>DeepMind walked away. But it has stressed to its investors that structured health data and artificial intelligence are the next phase in the company\u2019s business plan. It wants to move into disease detection, constructing a new data infrastructure around health data, and potentially sell insurance off the back of this information. <a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/google-strategy-healthcare/\">The main target is the $3tn (\u00a32.2tn) US market</a>, but the big populations of the developing world will be in its sights.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc05be0a237601bcbdaadd93fd3e9db702d864bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc05be0a237601bcbdaadd93fd3e9db702d864bb/0_233_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Cook: wants Apple to save lives.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Cook: wants Apple to save lives.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apple is in the process of setting up a network of medical clinics in the US through a subsidiary, AC Wellness. Some believe it could be a blueprint for countries unable to invest in anything more than rudimentary health systems. Nick Dearden, head of the charity Global Justice Now, says: \u201cBig tech companies see vast new markets in providing tech-based versions of healthcare and education, particularly in Africa. The problem is that such private \u2018solutions\u2019 are already failing the majority, because they sideline and crowd out investment in decent, high quality, universal education and healthcare, which many lower-income countries desperately need.\u201d</p> <p>Education is an area of interest to Google that brings with it similar issues. Dearden says, especially when the technology literacy rate is under 30% in rural Kenya (according to an IBM Digital Villages study), and the Kenyan government is one of the most advanced users of technology in Africa.</p> <p>Dearden adds: \u201cPatented, tech-based education can easily be tailored to suit different income categories, with the poorest being totally shut out or given a much lower level of service than richer people. What\u2019s more, countries will be locked into services which can only be provided by specific hi-tech companies for years or decades \u2026 This should worry all of us \u2013 because Africa is a guinea pig for a world totally controlled by a handful of mega corporations.\u201d</p> <p>Tech industry lobbyists argue that developing-world governments will benefit from billions of pounds of research and development carried out by US firms over the past decade. This will help countries put in a modern digital infrastructure, they say, and save huge sums on education and healthcare budgets. But Silicon Valley\u2019s aspirations to make the world smaller and bring people together, no matter how sincere, are being met with more cynicism than ever.</p>",

It said these multinationals had \u201cbenefited from digital industrial policies such as subsidies, R&amp;D subsidies, development of, and access to, and ownership of technologies, economies of scale, government-sponsored infrastructure, tax benefits, etc\u201d. Dearden admits developing countries are split, with some wanting to take whatever the tech firms have to offer to spur growth. \u201cSome on the pro side have been talked to by the developed countries. Others think it sounds nice but don\u2019t know all the implications. But WTO was a major victory for us in that formal movement on this wasn\u2019t agreed \u2013 and that\u2019s because some developing countries, especially in Africa, fought it tooth and nail.\u201d Some of the most advanced African countries are the most serious about protecting their domestic industries from foreign competition. Only last week, Kenya pulled out of a free trade pact with China after it decided the deal was too one-sided. Technology is seen as solving huge problems for developing countries, from corruption to poor standards of education and healthcare, but the issue of democratic control is unlikely to go away \u2013 and is likely to prevent international agreement being reached any time soon. An Apple a day \u2026 the race for hi-tech healthcare The tech industry\u2019s appetite for markets to conquer is insatiable and healthcare is a priority. Last year Tim Cook, the boss of Apple, revealed that his near-trillion-dollar company was putting healthcare at the centre of all its phone developments. Apple wanted to save lives, he said. A smartphone can be your personal doctor, monitoring your health minute by minute, accessing test results and providing medical information. But this could become a serious issue if the big tech companies don\u2019t just provide the phone, but also hold the health information gathered by it \u2013 information that is in high demand from, for instance, financial services companies looking to sell products to the country\u2019s healthiest people \u2013 or to cancer patients. In the UK, consultants working at the Royal Free Hospital trust in London were told last year that it had been illegal for them to approach DeepMind, an artificial intelligence firm owned by Google\u2019s parent, about developing software based on patient data from the trust. DeepMind walked away. But it has stressed to its investors that structured health data and artificial intelligence are the next phase in the company\u2019s business plan. It wants to move into disease detection, constructing a new data infrastructure around health data, and potentially sell insurance off the back of this information. The main target is the $3tn (\u00a32.2tn) US market, but the big populations of the developing world will be in its sights. Apple is in the process of setting up a network of medical clinics in the US through a subsidiary, AC Wellness. Some believe it could be a blueprint for countries unable to invest in anything more than rudimentary health systems. Nick Dearden, head of the charity Global Justice Now, says: \u201cBig tech companies see vast new markets in providing tech-based versions of healthcare and education, particularly in Africa. The problem is that such private \u2018solutions\u2019 are already failing the majority, because they sideline and crowd out investment in decent, high quality, universal education and healthcare, which many lower-income countries desperately need.\u201d Education is an area of interest to Google that brings with it similar issues. Dearden says, especially when the technology literacy rate is under 30% in rural Kenya (according to an IBM Digital Villages study), and the Kenyan government is one of the most advanced users of technology in Africa. Dearden adds: \u201cPatented, tech-based education can easily be tailored to suit different income categories, with the poorest being totally shut out or given a much lower level of service than richer people. What\u2019s more, countries will be locked into services which can only be provided by specific hi-tech companies for years or decades \u2026 This should worry all of us \u2013 because Africa is a guinea pig for a world totally controlled by a handful of mega corporations.\u201d Tech industry lobbyists argue that developing-world governments will benefit from billions of pounds of research and development carried out by US firms over the past decade. This will help countries put in a modern digital infrastructure, they say, and save huge sums on education and healthcare budgets. But Silicon Valley\u2019s aspirations to make the world smaller and bring people together, no matter how sincere, are being met with more cynicism than ever.",
