                "bodyText":"And finally.... RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to shut 162 branches across the country has caused a stir in Westminster Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow City Minister, is concerned that customer will be left without a local branch - an issue brought into the spotlight by TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tech breakdown. Reynolds says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremely disappointing to see RBS closing yet more branches and putting more jobs at risk. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Under a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Conservative MP Nicky Morgan is also concerned that some customers will lose access to banking services. Morgan, who chairs the Treasury committee (which will grill TSB tomorrow), says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a result of RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important for the Government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the Government may be required to intervene.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Time for a recap: The pound has fallen sharply to its lowest level since mid-January, as fresh signs of economic weakness undermine the case for raising UK interest rates. Sterling has shed almost one and a half cents to $1.3633, a fall of 1%. The selloff came after output in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector slumped to a 17-month low in April. A new survey of business chiefs found that production, new business and employment growth across the industry slowed. The Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index (PMI) fell to 53.9, from 54.9, and closer to the 50-point mar recorded in March. Economists were expecting a figure of 54.8. A reading above 50 indicates growth. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said the UK manufacturing sector lost further steam last month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing performance.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Duncan Johnston, UK manufacturing industry leader at Deloitte, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK Manufacturing PMI fell further than expected in April 2018. Having been resilient in the first quarter of 2018 this turning point shows a marked decline in manufacturing confidence. Output increased more slowly and new orders arrived at a slower rate than in Q1. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Falling order backlogs mean that optimism is likely to remain lower for some months. However, on the positive side growth remained above the long-term average of 51.7 and represents almost two years of continuous growth in manufacturing output. Production rose due to strong customer confidence, new products and increased capacity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the coming months, manufacturers need to measure their decisions on increased investment and hiring of staff against these signs of a slowing in output growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In another sign of weakness, consumer credit slowed sharply in March, adding to speculation that the Bank of England will leave interest rates on hold this month. Influencial investor Mohamed El-Erian of Allianz said weak data is dragging the pound down. The threat of a trade war was also blamed for hurting business confidence. On that front.... European politicians are unhappy that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve only been given a one-month extension to avoid new US tariffs on steel and aluminium. France, Germany, the UK and the European Commission are both pushing for a permanent extension, after president Trump decided to delay tariffs until June - while negotiations continue.

McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff have held a walkout to demand better pay and labour rights, with the backing of shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Environmental campaigners have challenged Barclays to clean up its act, at its AGM in London. The slump in the pound has only given the London stock market a small lift. The FTSE 100 had gained 0.2%, while other European markets are closed for May Day. Wall Street has fallen in early trading, as investors brace for Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings after the closing bell Just in: Growth in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector slowed a little last month, but remained robust, according to the latest data from the Institute for Supply Management. A rival survey from Markit is equally upbeat: Workers at fast food chain McDonalds have received the backing of Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chancellor as they protest against working conditions. McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff at five restaurants walked out today, as part of their ongoing campain for union recognition and a minimum wage of \u00c2\u00a310 per hour. The workers, as Manchester, Cambridge, Crayford in south-east London, and two branches in Watford, formed picket lines outside branches. They chose May Day - or International Workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Day - as an ideal time to fight their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exploitative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd contracts. John McDonnell, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chancellor, says he backs the protests. He has written to McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, Steve Easterbrook, to say that the striking workers are behaving in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fair and reasonable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd way. McDonnell says: I believe that every worker deserves what these workers are calling for: 1. A real living wage of at least \u00c2\u00a310 an hour, 2. Security in work and a choice of fixed hours, 3. The right not to be discriminated against on the basis of Age, 4. And the right to form a trade union and for that union to be recognised by your company. The BFAWU, which supports workers organizing in McDonalds, have informed me that there are allegations that McDonalds is pursuing what could be described as union busting policies and possibly acting illegally in its treatment of workers joining its union. I am writing to request that you investigate these claims seriously in order to ensure any anti union practices are not being undertaken. Labour MP Chris Ruane is alarmed that Royal Bank of Scotland are planning to close 162 branches: Banking expert Ian Fraser isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced by RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that its branches overlap too much: Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Adam Parsons has a good theory about what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on: Newsflash: Royal Bank of Scotland has announced it is shutting 162 branches, with the loss of almost 800 jobs. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all because RBS is no longer spinning off its Williams &amp; Glyn business as a separate entity with 300 branches. An RBS spokesperson said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are no longer launching Williams &amp; Glyn as a challenger bank, and we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other; NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland, in England &amp; Wales. As a result we have had to review our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made the difficult decision to close a number of Royal Bank of Scotland branches. Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England &amp; Wales will be able to use NatWest branches instead for their everyday banking needs. RBS is also hoping that customers will move towards using online and mobile banking, although the ongoing crisis at TSB may have deterred some late adopters from making the switch. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the slowdown in factory growth...and what it means for UK interest rates. A group of environmental activists have just disrupted Barclay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual general meeting in London. A group of climate change protesters stormed the meeting, and were forcibly removed after urging Barclays to stop financing environmentally damaging fossil fuel projects. They chanted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153keep it in the ground\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no more fossil fuel finance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd , and then: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Barclays bank, we said no! Fossil fuels have got to go! A student network called People &amp; Planet have said they were behind the protest. Separately, a 22-year old activist called Ocean Hyland spoke at the AGM - and asked Barclays to reconsider financing a pipeline carrying oil from the tar sands in Alberta through British Columbia to the coast. Hyland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nation, Tsleil Waututh, believe the Kinder Morgan pipeline will cause environmental damage. She explained: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If built, Kinder Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s project will increase tanker traffic in the inlet 7 fold, bringing with it increased risks of oil spills and pollution. It will also enable the expansion of the Alberta Oil Sands which, in turn will accelerate climate change. And that is why The Tsleil Waututh Nation will do whatever it takes to stop the Kinder Morgan project. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a bruising AGM for Barclays, with shareholders accusing CEO Jes Staley of being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153irrevocably tarnished\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and ask why he hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resigned over the whistleblowing scandal for which he was fined last year. A final decision on whether to allow Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21 Century Fox to buy Sky is close..... In another worrying sign, UK consumer credit growth slowed sharply in March. Phillip Inman, economics writer, explains that it could show that people are less confident about economic prospects: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumers cut back sharply on their unsecured borrowing in March. The total borrowed on credit cards dropped from \u00c2\u00a3700m in February to \u00c2\u00a3100m in March, while the total borrowed for other forms of unsecured debt, primarily car loans and overdrafts, fell from \u00c2\u00a31bn to \u00c2\u00a3100m The dramatic decline in consumer borrowing follows a clampdown by the chief financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, on bank lending to consumers, which grew by 10% or more on average between 2014 and 2017. But uncertainty surrounding the Brexit talks is also understood to have played a large role in consumer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning away from extra borrowing to fund big ticket purchases like cars and furniture. The average growth rate in total unsecured lending fell to 0.1% month on month in March, which dragged down the year on year figure to 8.6% from 9.4% in February. Peter Tutton, head of policy at the debt charity StepChange, fears the accumulation of debt in recent years, especially by poorer households, remained a problem despite the recent slowdown. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A decade on from the financial crisis, we must not lose sight of the impact of sustained pressure on already stretched household budgets in coping with the rising daily cost of living. We estimate that severe problem debt currently affects some 3.4 million people in the UK, so tackling and preventing vulnerable households from falling into problem debt should be high on the policymakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 agenda. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the financial system may not be at risk of history repeating itself in terms of systemic failure, at household finances level the risks are all too real. He said regulators and lenders needed to reduce the number of people inadvertently \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trapped in a vicious cycle persistent problem debt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by reviewing who is offered a loan, while the government must support affordable alternatives to affordable credit. The CBI, which represents British business leaders, says Donald Trump has kicked the (steel) can down the road. Ben Digby, international director at the CBI, says there is some relief that Europe was given a one-month exemption on steel tariffs - but a permanent deal is still needed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Businesses urgently need to know what would have to happen for the exemption to become permanent, to properly reflect the close trading relationship between the USA and the UK - the UK is the largest foreign investor in America, and British companies support over 1 million jobs in the USA, from Alaska to New York. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Prolonging the uncertainty around these tariffs is a lose-lose for all concerned \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it damages prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. Firms cannot continue making investment decisions based on short-term uncertain deadlines, and we will continue to work closely with the U.S. Administration to protect British trade, jobs and growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Getting back to the US tariffs.... and the French government have issued a statement reiterating the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s displeasure at Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. Paris warns that they will not open talks over wider trade terms unless he gives the bloc a permanent dispensation from tariffs on steel and aluminium. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, and Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister said in a joint statement: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The French Government takes note of the decision announced by the US authorities regarding the new temporary exemption of one month given to the EU on prices of aluminium and steel. We support the positions expressed by the European Commission. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153France will continue to advocate that the EU has a full exemption permanent and unconditioned. There is no reason that the EU is subject to unilateral increases in tariffs on steel and aluminum. France and the European Union are US allies. They are not the cause of global overcapacity in aluminum and steel and fully respect all the rules of the WTO. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The EU must remain united and solid as it has done in recent weeks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We agree that there is an overcapacity problem in the steel industry and aluminum. We are ready to work with the United States and our other partners to make quick and appropriate solutions. But we can do it calmly until we are certain to be exempted permanently from the threat of unilateral tariff increases.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories has suffered from the threat of a global trade war, says Stephen Cooper, head of industrial manufacturing at KPMG. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing PMI: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The implications of the postponed US steel tariffs will also be in the back of manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds. Trade wars are never welcome and whilst it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s helpful that the decision has been delayed, this is another example of uncertainty, with other geopolitical risks such as Brexit, which is not good for business confidence. Sterling has slumped to a three-month low against the US dollar following April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing manufacturing data. The pound has shed a whole cent, and is languishing around $1.367, its weakest level since mid-January. City investors are concluding that the Bank of England is rather unlikely to raise interest rates this month, with so many signs that growth is slowing. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation, is also concerned by the slowdown at UK factories. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The further slowdown in the rate of expansion in manufacturing activity suggests that the weaker official data seen last week wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a temporary aberration. A weaker start to the second quarter with a more subdued pace of growth in new overseas business perhaps reflects concerns about the erection of new barriers to trade, the recent pick up in Sterling and a softer growth patch at the start of the year in European markets. Some snap reaction to the slowdown at Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories last month: Business optimism among UK factory bosses has dipped to a five-month low, according to Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey. It blames \u00e2\u20ac\u0153concerns about Brexit, trade barriers and the overall economic climate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer goods industry had a particularly unimpressive April, says Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any hopes for an improvement to last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steady if unremarkable pace were dashed in April as new order growth was the slowest for ten months and the consumer goods sector was particularly hit reporting the first job losses since February 2017 and the fastest drop in hiring for six and a half years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was left to stronger levels of export orders from Europe and the US to provide some succour to manufacturers as concerns over potential rate rises resulted in less client spending overall. This meant manufacturers were adrift with the highest growth of stock levels for ten months on the one hand but struggling to get key raw materials on the other. Higher demand and competition from other firms meant shortages returned to beset companies trying to cope with challenging delivery times as suppliers failed to complete. The slowdown in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has gathered pace, with growth in the manufacturing sector hitting its lowest rate since autumn 2016. Data firm Markit reports that factory output, new orders and job creation all rose at a slower pace in April - partly due to an easing in demand from overseas. This pulled Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK manufacturing PMI down to 53.9, from 54.9 in March (any reading over 50 shows growth). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a blow, especially after overall economic growth slowed to near stagnation in January-March this year. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a disappointing result which can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be blamed on bad weather. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing performance, making the chances of a near term hike in interest rates by the Bank of England look increasingly remote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On this footing, the sector is unlikely to see any improvement on the near-stagnant performance signalled by the opening quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP numbers. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull together more reaction now. Newsflash: UK factory growth has hit a 17-month low. More to follow..... Back in the UK, Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chastened CEO won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be breaking into song when he sees the latest supermarket sales figures. Data firm Kantar reports that Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only grew its sales by 0.2% in the last 12 weeks. Tesco managed 2.1% growth, Morrisons achieved 2.2%, while Asda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales were up by 1.4%. Such a weak performance by Sainsbury highlights why Coupe has decided to merge with Asda, in the hope of cutting costs and boosting profits. Media news: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government has called for European countries should receive a permanent exemption from America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on aluminium and steel. Echoing the comments from the EU, Berlin argues a deal needs to be reached when Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new extension expires in a month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. Deputy government spokeswoman Martina Fietz says. Neither the European Union nor the United States can have an interest in an escalation (in tensions) in trade relation. Rather, both the U.S. and the EU would benefit from further deepening trade relations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has hit a two-month high, driven by relief that Canberra has reached an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153agreement-in-principle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with Washington to avoid steel and aluminium tariffs. The ASX 200 rose 0.5% to its highest level since the end of February, as Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, hailed the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unbreakable friendship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with America. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement has reassured investors. Trump deciding to extend the deadline for his steel and aluminium tariffs helped lift Australian shares to a 7-week high overnight. This is encouraging news and supports the notion that the tariffs are just a negotiating stance by Trump, who in fact has no intention of implementing them. That said, there is still plenty of uncertainty over the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c China trading relations and the US - Iran nuclear deal to keep investors on edge. Labour MP Bill Esterson is also unimpressed: Over in Brussels, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real disappointment that Europe hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been given a full exemption from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel and aluminium tariffs. The European Commission feels that the EU should have been given the same treatment as Australia, Argentina and Brazil. Instead, this new 30-day extension just creates more uncertainty, it feels An EU spokesperson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US decision prolongs market uncertainty, which is already affecting business decisions. The EU should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overcapacity in the steel and aluminium sectors does not originate in the EU. On the contrary, the EU has over the past months engaged at all possible levels with the US and other partners to find a solution to this issue. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The EU has also consistently indicated its willingness to discuss current market access issues of interest to both sides, but has also made clear that, as a longstanding partner and friend of the US, we will not negotiate under threat. Any future transatlantic work programme has to be balanced and mutually beneficial. The UK Government has welcomed the news that Europe has been given an extra month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exemption on steel tariffs -- and said it hopes to make the relief permanent. A Department for International Trade spokesman warned that the tariffs could hurt global growth, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We remain concerned about the impact of these tariffs on global trade and will continue to work with the EU on a multilateral solution to the global problem of overcapacity, as well as to manage the impact on domestic markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. In a dramatic twist, Donald Trump has stepped back from launching a trade war that could have destabilised the global economy and hurt growth. Overnight, the US president reached \u00e2\u20ac\u0153agreements in principle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil to exempt them from the steel and aluminium tariffs announced earlier this year. And it what could be a narrow escape for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel industry, the US administration has postponed the decision on whether to slap tariffs on EU imports for another month. In a last-minute twist worthy of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time on The Apprentice, the White House announced it had: ....reached agreements in principle with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil with respect to steel and aluminium, the details of which will be finalized shortly. The Administration is also extending negotiations with Canada, Mexico, and the European Union for a final 30 days.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The decision came just hours before 25% penalty on steel imports into America, and 15% on aluminium, would have come into force. Our Washington correspondent David Smith explains that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision delays a trade war with Europe -- at least for another few weeks. Trump, who ran on a nationalist \u00e2\u20ac\u0153America first\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd agenda, claims the tariffs are needed to protect American metal producers from unfair competition and enhance national security amid a worldwide oversupply of steel and aluminum largely blamed on excess production in China. At a joint press conference with Merkel at the White House last week, the president said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need a reciprocal relationship, which we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have ... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working on it and we want to make it more fair and the chancellor wants to make it more fair.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the move threatens to spark a trade war that could cause turmoil in financial markets. The EU \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is the biggest US trading partner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has warned that, if it is subject to tariffs on the 6.4bn euros\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ($7.7bn) worth of the metals it exports annually to the US, it will retaliate with its own tariffs on 2.8bn euros\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ($3.4bn) worth of US goods imported into Europe including Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Levi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jeans and Kentucky bourbon. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking reaction to the move today. Also coming up... Data firm Markit is releasing its healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector. April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing PMI may show that growth weakened last month. In the City, oil giant BP has just posted a 71% jump in profits, thanks to rising crude prices. Takeaway ordering chain Just Eat is also reporting results - with revenues up 49% in the first three months of 2018. There could be drama at Barclays annual general meeting; corporate raider Ed Bramson may show up and call for the bank to be shaken up. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be tracking any developments the Sainsbury-Asda merger, which took an unusual twist last night when Sainsbury CEO Mike Coupe was caught singing on camera. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a remarkable gaffe, especially given concerns that the deal will hurt suppliers and cost jobs. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI for April 10am BST: Treasury committee holds hearing on digital currencies",

                "bodyText":"With Wall Street still suffering on concerns about the prospect of a trade war between the US and China, European markets have ended the day lower. Talks between Chinese and US representatives began in the first of two days of meetings, but both sides have been lowering expectations that there will be a positive outcome. So investors have been shying away from shares, with the final scores in Europe showing: The FTSE 100 finished down 40.51 points or 0.54% at 7502.69 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.88% to 12,690.15 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.5% lower at 5501.66 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.83% to 24,064.46 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.5% lower at 10,038.8 In Greece, the Athens market lost 2.18% to 839.34 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 280 points or 1.17%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. On the market fall, Joshua Mahony at IG says: Global stocks are on the slide in the wake of a weak US open today, with trade fears and a strengthening dollar weighing on sentiment. ...Continued fears over the pathway of trade negotiations with China are sure to be playing into investor fears, and it is certainly a worry that we are seeing such unconvincing trade in the US despite a largely encouraging earnings season. [President] Trump will be boosted by the new of a massive narrowing of the US trade deficit, with the President likely to go reinvigorated into negotiations with the likes of China. With the head of the Brazilian steel association admitting that the industry will simply have to go along with US quotas, the bigger hurdles of China and the EU represent significantly bigger hurdles to overcome for Mr Trump. With US exports now standing at the highest level since records began, there is no doubt that the US economic picture is improving and that is being reflected in a stronger dollar. The latest US monthly jobs figures are out on Friday, and there could be a recovery from the weak (103,000) number seen in March: Markets continue to suffer on worries about the potential for a trade war between the US and China. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says: Despite a lack of news surrounding the ongoing takes between the US and China, the various aggressions reported last night \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including news that China has stopped by soybeans from the US, with the latter potentially set to impose restrictions on certain Chinese telecommunication companies selling equipment in America \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have reignited fears of a trade war. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t confident about the outcome of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delegation get-together. The Dow Jones plunged more than 250 points after the bell, diving below 23700 for the first time in a month. Granted the Dow is also dealing with a fairly hawkish Fed statement from Wednesday night, one that kept up the dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hopes of 3 (or even 4) more rate hikes in 2018. With little else to go on, the European indices took their cue from the US losses. The CAC slipped 0.3%, while the DAX dropped 0.6%, the latter abandoning the 12800, 3 month highs struck on Wednesday. As for the FTSE, the UK index shed 50 points, shying away from 7550 to return to 7500 for the umpteenth time this week. Two surveys of the US service sector have come to different conclusions about the state of this part of the economy. The ISM non-manufacturing PMI dropped from 58.8 in March to 56.8 in April, below expectations of a level of 58.1. The employment index dropped from 56.6 to 53.6, the lowest since April last year. But earlier the Markit service sector PMI rose from 54 in March to 54.6 in April, slightly better than the initial reading of 54.4. Even so, any reading over 50 shows expansion so these figures are unlikely to alter the future course of US interest rates. China can withstand a trade war longer than the US, says Wendy Cutler, Asia Society Policy Institute vice president and former acting deputy U.S. trade representative. She was speaking to CNBC: Worries about trade tensions as the US and Chinese delegations meet in the wake of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs have seen US markets open lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 170 points or 0.7% while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.29% and the Nasdaq Composite off 0.51%. Among the fallers is Tesla, down 7.5% after the bizarre post-results analysts call held by Elon Musk. Could Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions on trade and tariffs see a repeat of the 1930s slump? A group of experts certainty think it could happen: Over a thousand economists have written to Donald Trump warning his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic protectionism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and tough rhetoric on trade threatens to repeat the mistakes the US made in the 1930s, mistakes that plunged the world into the Great Depression. The 1,414 economists, including 14 Nobel prize winners, sent the letter on Thursday amid an escalating row over trade between the US and the European Union. Trump has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports but has granted temporary reprieves to the EU, Australia and other countries. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In 1930, 1,028 economists urged Congress to reject the protectionist Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the authors write, citing a trade act that many economists argue was one of the triggers for the Great Depression. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today, Americans face a host of new protectionist activity, including threats to withdraw from trade agreements, misguided calls for new tariffs in response to trade imbalances, and the imposition of tariffs on washing machines, solar components, and even steel and aluminum used by US manufacturers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Congress did not take economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 advice in 1930, and Americans across the country paid the price. The undersigned economists and teachers of economics strongly urge you not to repeat that mistake. Much has changed since 1930 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for example, trade is now significantly more important to our economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the fundamental economic principles as explained at the time have not.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The full story is here: With immaculate timing, as the US and Chinese delegations meet, the Commerce Department has released the latest international trade figures. Overall the trade gap narrowed in March from $57.7bn in the previous month to $48.9bn. This was better than the expected deficit of $50bn, helped by exports increasing to a record high following a surge in deliveries of commercial aircraft and, yes, soybeans. As for the deficit with China, the March figure fell from $29.26bn to $25.88bn. BUT: the year to date figure for the trade gap with China is up sharply, from $78.8bn to $91bn. By sending so many senior officials to China, the Trump administration may actually have lowered the chances of a breakthrough. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the delegation don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really agree with each other about trade, making it harder to reach an agreement with Beijing. For example, commerce secretary Wilbur Ross has blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcevil practices\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by China for the trade gap with America, and vocally backed Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs. But Larry Kudlow, the newish head of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic council, has previously warned that tariffs are effectively tax rises and will hurt US companies (this was before he joined the White House). Such differences of opinion won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make negotiations with China run any smooth. As Maggie Gage, head of Washington Research at Credit Suisse, put it on Bloomberg TV: One of the key hurdles that will determine success versus non-success at these talks is whether the US team can all stay on message together. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade talks come a month after the US and China both ratcheted up the tensions, by imposing tariffs on $50bn of each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goods. The White House announced a list of 1,333 Chinese imports to be subject to punitive tariffs of 25%; China retaliated with a list of 100+ American products, including soya beans, cars and aircraft. So what is America looking to achieve at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talks? On the trade gap, the Trump administration want China to reduce its trade surplus with the US by around $100bn (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $375bn today). Unless US consumers start consuming less, that means opening up more Chinese markets to American imports. On intellectual property, the US Trade Representative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office claims that American firms are forced to hand over key technology secrets in return for access to Chinese markets -- something Beijing denies. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the currency issue - Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bugbear that Beijing has been unfairly weakening the yuan to help Chinese firm sell goods abroad. So far, America has resisted labelling China a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccurrency manipulator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (something which would trigger fresh measures). But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the table, if negotiations get nowhere.... The EC has predicted that Britain and Italy will share the wooden spoon in the 2018 growth race, while Ireland will power ahead: Bonus mark to anyone who spots the mistake with the Irish flag..... Rather awkwardly for our purposes, there appears to be a news blackout on the US-China trade talks! Bloomberg says: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest news outlets have been ordered to refrain from reporting any material beyond official press releases related to trade talks in Beijing with the U.S., according to people familiar with the matter. The Communist Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s propaganda department has told news websites to strictly use statements released by the official Xinhua News Agency, without any extra interpretation, according to the people, who asked not to be named as they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not authorized to speak on the matter. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswomen Hua Chunying says Beijing hopes to make progress with America - but only if there is mutual respect. Hua told reporters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The outcome should be mutually beneficial and win-win.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The official Xinhua news agency, usually a good gauge of the Chinese government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views, has also taken a firm line by warning that China could cope with a trade war. In an editorial, it says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China will inevitably suffer losses, but China has the political advantage of a centralised and unified leadership and support of a massive domestic market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A former trade advisor to president Obama has warned that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delegation probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come back from Beijing with a big deal. Michael Camunez, CEO of consultancy Monarch Global Strategies, says (via CNN): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect any grand bargains being struck....There is no clear strategy that can be discerned.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The European Commission has fired a warning towards the US government not to plunge the world into a trade war. In its latest economic assessment, just released, the EC warns that there are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153increased risks on the horizon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It singles out the threat of trade protectionism, calling it an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unambiguously negative risk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the global economic outlook Pierre Moscovici, commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, warns that a trade war could derail Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery: Europe continues to enjoy robust growth, which has helped drive unemployment to a ten-year low. Investment is rising and public finances are improving, with the deficit in the euro area set to drop to just 0.7% of GDP this year. The biggest risk to this rosy outlook is protectionism, which must not become the new normal: that would only hurt those of our citizens we most need to protect.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: inflation across the eurozone has fallen unexpectedly. The consumer prices index rose by just 1.2% in the year to April, down from 1.3% a month earlier. Core inflation, which strips out volatile items, slid to just 0.7% from 1%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s welcome news for households, but a real headache for the European Central Bank as it ponders whether to extend its bond-buying stimulus programme beyond September. Back in the UK, we have fresh evidence that the economy has lost momentum. Data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly measure of service sector activity has risen, to 52.8 in April from March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 51.7. Although that shows faster growth, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still one of the weakest readings in the last two years. It appears that sales, investment and hiring have all been hit by economic uncertainty (Brexit and trade war fears could both be blamed). Global stock markets are subdued as investors watch for developments in Beijing. The main European indices are almost all in the red, after a cautious session in Asia which saw Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng shed 1.3%. Traders are concerned that a breakdown in negotiations between the US and China could further inflame the situation, potentially leading to further retaliatory action. Jameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy &amp; Market Research at FXTM, explains: The trade talks carry the potential to negatively impact global stocks as a result of reduced risk appetite, and could also result in reduced purchasing momentum for emerging market currencies. China appears to have raised the stakes ahead of these trade talks, by stopping buying US soybeans. That news could send a shiver through America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agriculture industry, as it has been the biggest supplier of soybeans to the Chinese market. Bloomberg has the details: The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest oilseed processor just confirmed one of the soybean market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest fears: China has essentially stopped buying U.S. supplies amid the brewing trade war. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whatever they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re buying is non-U.S.,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bunge Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Soren Schroder said in a telephone interview Wednesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re buying beans in Canada, in Brazil, mostly Brazil, but very deliberately not buying anything from the U.S.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In a move that caught many in U.S. agriculture by surprise, China last month announced planned tariffs on American shipments of soybeans. As the market waited for the measure to take effect, there was some hope among traders and shippers alike that relations between the nations could ease in the meantime and the trade flow would continue. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be the case, at least for now, according to Bunge. China is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153braced for surprises\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade talks, says the Financial Times, especially as Donald Trump has sent seven top officials along. The FT has also picked up on Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refusal to be forced into concessions: For senior Chinese officials and their policy advisers, the arrival of what they see as a large and unwieldy US delegation is just the latest twist in three months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of diplomatic exchanges that they have found to be both confusing and insulting. They are also bracing themselves for surprises from Mr Trump, who has previously issued threatening tweets and statements in the midst of delicate Sino-US negotiations. Last month, after the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies threatened to impose punitive tariffs on $50bn worth of each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exports, Mr Trump said he would consider targeting an additional $100bn worth of Chinese exports to the US. The Chinese then closed ranks, saying they would not negotiate in the face of such threats. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bottom line is that the US will not get anything through blackmail,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said L\u00c3\u00bc Xiang, an American affairs expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China is waiting to see what [requests] the US will put on the table. But if they pull out a gun and point it at us, then they can finish their tea and leave.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd America is likely to air a series of complaints over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade practices today, including allegations of intellectual property theft and unfair state subsidies Reuters explains: A breakthrough deal to fundamentally change China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policies is viewed as highly unlikely during the two-day visit, though a package of short-term Chinese measures could delay a U.S. decision to impose tariffs on around $50 billion worth of Chinese exports. The discussions, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, are expected to cover a wide range of U.S. complaints about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade practices, from allegations of forced technology transfers to state subsidies for technology development. Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin was in a cheerful mood, telling Reuters he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Thrilled to be here. Thank you,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as he arrived at his hotel in Beijing. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off.... Financial markets around the globe will be watching the trade talks in Beijing closely, says Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade rather than interest rates or valuations that are troubling markets right now. US officials have flown into Beijing to try and deescalate a trade spat with China, but these talks won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be easy. This is the issue that markets are super sensitive about currently, and which was responsible in part for the first-quarter crash, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unsurprising to see investors take some money off the table.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After months of threats and tit-for-tat tariffs, America and China are actually going to sit down and talk about trade. A delegation of top US officials has landed in Beijing today for two days of negotiations. The group includes Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, economic advisor Larry Kudlow and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll face off against senior Chinese officials, led by vice-premier Liu He. The hope is that the two sides can calm the recent tensions that have already seen steep tariffs slapped on each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exports, in what could prove to be the opening shots in a damaging trade war. President Donald Trump has already raised the stakes, by tweeting that America is pushing for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclevel playing field\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. However, a breakthrough is far from guaranteed, with China already hinting that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be bullied by America. Our correspondent in Beijing, Lily Kuo, explains: The China Daily said China will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stand up to the US\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if necessary while Global Times says it hopes the two sides can begin resolving trade disputes. So, it could be a lively couple of days. Also coming up today: On the economics front, a new healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector may show that activity accelerated in April after a weak March. A weak reading, though, would put the final nail in the coffin of an interest rate rise next week. New inflation data from the eurozone will feed into the debate on whether the European Central Bank should rein in its stimulus programme. Plus, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new jobs, trade and service sector data from America. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK service sector PMI report for April 10am BST: Eurozone CPI inflation figures for April 1.30pm BST: US trade gap figures for March 1.30pm BST: US weekly jobless claims figures 3pm: US service sector PMI, and factory orders",

                "bodyText":"A recovery on Wall Street in the wake of the US jobs figures - and despite the uncertain end to two days of trade talks between the US and China - gave a late lift to European markets. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 64.45 points or 0.86% higher at 7567.14, making its sixth weekly gain in a row Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax jumped 1.02% to 12,819.60 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.26% to 5516.05 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 1.12% to 24,335.02 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.65% better at 10,104.1 But in Greece, the Athens market fell 1.84% to 823.89 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 270 points or 1.13%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the week. Thanks for all your comments and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Tuesday after the May day Bank Holiday. US markets have recovered from a wobby start, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now up more than 200 points. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Equities are advancing on a broad front as the week moves to its close, and while non-farm payrolls didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deliver anything of a particularly spectacular nature, the overall impression is of a US economy moving in the right direction. Fans of symbolic moves will be pleased to see the unemployment rate move below 4%, and even though the wage figure failed to beat expectations, the year-on-year number has continued to recover from its late-2017 weakness, with the upward trend from the 2013 lows there for all to see. Reports that Warren Buffett had been a steady buyer of stocks in the first quarter thanks to the volatility will have stiffened a few wavering souls, helping to cancel out some of the trade war worries we saw overnight. A mixed US jobs and wages report has led, appropriately enough, to a mixed opening for US markets. After an early dip the Dow Jones Industrial Average has edged up just 3 points while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are both marginally lower. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the US jobs figures: The rebound in the dollar following the US jobs data has seen the pound lose 0.58% to $1.3495, meaning sterling has lost all the gains it made against the US currency this year. However much the Fed hikes, it will not be to 40% one sincerely hopes. But the Argentinian central bank has hoisted its rates to that level in the second rise in 24 hours. On Thursday it raised them from 30.25% to 33.25% and now has lifted them to 40%. The move comes in an attempt to defend the peso, which has fallen more than 16% so far this year against the dollar. The US Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move to raise its own interest rates has seen outflows of capital from emerging market currencies and into the dollar. The dollar dipped in the immediate aftermath of the US data, with analysts concerned about the weaker than expected wage growth and the chance it might limit the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to raise interest rates by as much as expected. But the US currency soon rebounded on the basis that the figures were not really likely to sway the Fed one way or the other. Economist James Knightley at ING Bank said: The April US jobs report is a bit mixed. Employment rose 164,000, but when you add in 30,000 upward revisions to the past 2 months then it is pretty much in line with the market expectation for a 193,000 rise. Unemployment fell to 3.9%, the lowest level since December 2000, but the fall from 4.1% was amplified by a sizeable chunk of unemployed people leaving the labour force \u00e2\u20ac\u201c note the participation rate fell from 62.9% to 62.8%. Rounding out the report was a softer wage number. There were some downward revisions and a weaker month on month reading for April of 0.1%, which mean the annual wage growth rate remained at 2.6%, rather than coming in at 2.7% as predicted. It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a particularly exciting report and certainly shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t alter market expectations for monetary policy in any meaningful way, but it just feels a bit soft given the state of the economy. Other surveys paint a stronger picture and we still believe that the wage story will turn higher and be the catalyst for the Fed to take a more aggressive stance on the inflation threat...we continue to look for 3 further interest rates rises this year, starting with June 13. Revisions to the payroll number for February and March paint a slightly better picture overall: The 164,000 increase in US payrolls in April was well below the average monthly gain of 191,000 over the previous 12 months, the Labor Department said. In terms of sectors, there were job gains in professional and business services, manufacturing, health care, and mining over the month of April. There was little change in other major industries, including construction, retail, transport and warehousing, leisure and hospitality, and government. Breaking: The US economy added 164,000 jobs in April, weaker than the 192,000 forecast by economists. On the flip side, the number for March was revised up by the Labor Department, to 135,000 from an initial estimate of 103,000. Average wage growth was weaker than expected, at 2.6%. Economists had predicted March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.7% growth would be unchanged. Meanwhile the unemployment rate fell more than expected to 3.9% in April from 4.1% in March. It was expected to edge down to 4%. Almost time for the US non farm payrolls report for April. Economists are predicting a rebound in job creation after a particularly weak March. Headline expectations according to a Reuters poll (March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures in brackets, which could be revised): Non-farm payrolls: 192,000 (103,000) Unemployment rate: 4% (4.1%) Average annual earnings growth: 2.7% (2.7%) Growth in eurozone retail sales slowed in March, according to figures published earlier by the statistics agency Eurostat. The volume of goods sold dipped 0.1% compared with February, as consumers spent less on non-food items. Sales had risen by 0.3% in February. It dragged the annual rate of growth down to 0.8% from 1.8%. Monthly sales growth was strongest in Latvia, up 2.3% in March, while sales fell 1.7% in Ireland. The US and Chinese delegations have reached agreement on some aspects of the trade row but there are still relatively big differences on other issues, according to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Xinhua news agency. Reuters reports: The two sides, though, committed to resolving their trade disputes through dialogue, state-run Xinhua reported. And the U.S. negotiators agreed to bring up with U.S. President Donald Trump the question of a ban on U.S. companies selling goods and software to Chinese telecommunication equipment maker ZTE Corp after representations from the Chinese side, the report said. ZTE faced the seven-year ban after the U.S. said it failed to keep to an agreement it made after breaching U.S. sanctions. The talks over the past two days have involved a high-level U.S. trade delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and top Chinese officials, including Vice Premier Liu He, following months of threats and counter threats from both sides in a series of disputes over trade practices. The U.S. team has already left Beijing and is heading back to the U.S., a U.S. official told Reuters early on Friday evening. The Americans have yet to give their account of the talks. The trade discussions had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153candid, efficient and constructive,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Xinhua said, but gave almost no details on what the officials had agreed. The officials exchanged opinions on resolving tariffs and non-tariffs measures, on expanding two-way investment and the protection of intellectual property, and on expanding U.S. exports to China and bilateral services trade, Xinhua reported. It gave no indication of what actions might be taken based on those exchanges. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My impression was that (the talks) didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go well given the rhetoric,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Kevin Lai, senior economist at Daiwa Capital markets in Hong Kong. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the divide is still very big.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back with the trade talks, and Reuters is reporting some Chinese proposals to the US: The latest business surveys from the eurozone suggest the weaker growth achieved in the first quarter of 2018 could be spilling over to the second. The headline index on the IHS Markit services sector PMI fell to an eight-month low of 54.7 in April, from 54.9 in March. It nudged the composite index, which combines manufacturing and services, down to 55.1 last month, from 55.2 in March. However, the figures still indicated fairly robust growth across the single currency bloc, with any number above 5o signalling expansion. Ireland was the top performer in April on the composite measure: Ireland: 57.6 France: 56.9 Spain: 55.4 Germany: 54.6 Italy: 52.9 Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, provides some context: The final PMI numbers confirm the marked, broad-based fading of the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth spurt so far this year. The headline index has fallen from an 11-and-a-half year peak in January to a 15-month low in April. Despite the drop, the PMI is not yet at a worryingly low level, but the survey details hint at further easing in the coming months. Here is our full story on the job losses planned at BT: Reports are coming from China of a leaked list of demands/wishes from the US trade delegation in Beijing. On the list is the request that China cuts its trade surplus to $200bn by 2020, from more than $300bn in 2017. The Wall Street Journal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lingling Wei has details from the list: New car sales in the month of April from 2002-2018: The rise in new car sales in April should be treated with caution, says Ian Gilmartin, head of retail at Barclays corporate banking: The uptick in new car sales will be welcome news for many sellers, but we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have it both ways \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just as we partly attributed last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor result to an unfair comparison to an unusually strong March 2017 ahead of the tax changes, similarly April 2017 was relatively weaker after the VED increase came into force, which flatters today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers. With the exception of last year, it is still the weakest April since 2013 but after a full year of declines, the industry will cheer a sales increase in whatever way it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s achieved. Sales of new cars rose in April for the first time in a year, but the sharp decline in diesel sales continued. New car registrations rose 10.4% compared with the same month last year, to 167,911 according to the latest figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. However, the trade body cautioned that last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures were flattered by a particularly week April last year, after buyers had brought forward purchases to avoid the new vehicle excise duty (VED) rules coming into force in the same month. Diesels sales plunged 25% to 51,377, while petrol sales were up 38% to 107,169. Alternative fuel sales rose 49% to 9,365. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT commented on the latest figures: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important not to look at one month in isolation and, given the major disruption to last April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market caused by sweeping VED changes, this increase is not unexpected. While the continuing growth in demand for plug-in and hybrid cars is positive news, the market share of these vehicles remains low and will do little to offset damaging declines elsewhere. Consumers need certainty about future policies towards different fuel types, including diesel, and a compelling package of incentives to deliver long-term confidence in the newest technologies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bad news for BT workers this morning as the British telecoms giant prepares to announce more than 6,000 job cuts next week, according to the Financial Times. BT is expected to announce the cuts alongside its full-year results next week, when chief executive Gavin Patterson will update investors on strategy. Shares have nearly halved over the past two years, and Patterson will be hoping that a major new programme of job/cost cuts will go some way to appease shareholders. The latest job cuts will be in addition to the 4,000 redundancies announced a year ago, the FT reports. With the exception of the CAC in France, major markets across Europe are higher this morning. The latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,526 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.4% at 12,742 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.1% at 5,495 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.8% at 24,245 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.1% at 10,050 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.3% at 386 While investors are likely to welcome Steven Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upbeat tone over in Beijing, expectations of a major breakthrough today remain low. Lukman Otunuga, analyst at currency trading firm FXTM, explains: The chances of a breakthrough trade deal from the two-day meeting are seen as highly unlikely. However, the talks could be a positive step for the two nations to avoid a potential trade war. Although it is difficult to predict the outcome of the trade meetings, continual talks and negotiations between the Trump administration officials and Chinese officials may ease tensions. Any signs of a possible breakdown in negotiations between the US and China have the ability to weigh on risk sentiment, consequently punishing global stocks. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A second day of trade talks between America and China is underway as the two sides negotiate policy in a meeting that could potentially avert a full-blown trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters in Beijing this morning that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we are having very good conversations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with Chinese counterparts. The comments are likely to boost hopes that a full-scale trade war can be avoided. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also non-farm payrolls day in the US, which is always a favourite with investors looking for clues on the state of the wider economy and the likely timing of the next interest rate rise. The agenda: 9am BST: eurozone service sector and composite PMI report for April 10am BST: eurozone retail sales for March 1.30pm BST: US non-farm payrolls report for April 1.30pm BST: US wage growth for April",

The merger also risks driving down standards and wages for farmers, and further reducing other workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 salaries. The CMA should reject this bid, and the government should urgently investigate measures to reduce the power of supermarkets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said.</p> <p>Asda and Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also dominate in Asda. Cat Smith, the MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there is such a monopoly for Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s limited choice and smaller players like Booths will struggle against that.

For the largest stores it looks for similar competitors within a 10-minute drive in urban areas or a 15-minute drive in rural communities.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>If the combined business has too big a share of the market it can force the sale of stores to a restricted list of strong competitors, but with sales at many large supermarkets falling back there are concerns that strong bidders may be few and far between.</p> <p>Until very recently the regulator had not considered discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, which typically stock fewer than 3,000 different products, as sufficient competition for a full-scale supermarket, which usually stocks more than 30,000 items. But in its assessment of Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent merger with Booker, the regulator hinted that it had now changed its view.</p> <p>Foster said the matter should be considered carefully. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I accept the market has changed, particularly with growth of online retail, but it has not changed fundamentally,.

The merger also risks driving down standards and wages for farmers, and further reducing other workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 salaries. The CMA should reject this bid, and the government should urgently investigate measures to reduce the power of supermarkets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. Asda and Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also dominate in Asda. Cat Smith, the MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there is such a monopoly for Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s limited choice and smaller players like Booths will struggle against that. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a worry, given that Booths is a Lancashire company founded in Blackpool with a headquarters in Preston. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m worried about the impact further down the supply chain, especially as so many in my constituency are in the business of producing food.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When the regulator considered the merger of Morrisons and Safeway in 2003, it divided grocery competition into three categories; one-stop supermarkets with a sales area of more than 1,400 sq metres [15,000 sq ft], mid-sized stores with an area of 1,400 to 2,800 sq metres, and local convenience stores. For the largest stores it looks for similar competitors within a 10-minute drive in urban areas or a 15-minute drive in rural communities. If the combined business has too big a share of the market it can force the sale of stores to a restricted list of strong competitors, but with sales at many large supermarkets falling back there are concerns that strong bidders may be few and far between. Until very recently the regulator had not considered discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, which typically stock fewer than 3,000 different products, as sufficient competition for a full-scale supermarket, which usually stocks more than 30,000 items. But in its assessment of Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent merger with Booker, the regulator hinted that it had now changed its view. Foster said the matter should be considered carefully. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I accept the market has changed, particularly with growth of online retail, but it has not changed fundamentally,. A large number of people still go every week and do a large shop,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. The MPs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 comments come after members of two influential parliamentary committees called on the competition regulator to examine how the merger of Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda would affect suppliers.",

                "bodyText":"And finally..... our Money editor Patrick Collinson explains how Sir Richard Branson could make a large profit, if CYBG succeed in taking over Virgin Money: Virgin Money traces its origins back to the 1995 launch of Virgin Direct, an investment business, but it was the takeover of Northern Rock in 2011 that propelled it into a large-scale operation. As chancellor, George Osborne nearly four years after nationalising the bank at the height of the financial crisis. The price paid by a consortium of investors, led by Branson, was the UK taxpayer had injected into bank. Osborne said at the time that the deal represented value for money for UK taxpayers. Branson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consortium included the US billionaire, Wilbur Ross, now Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commerce secretary. It bought the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd half of the bank, including its branch network, funded by retail deposits. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bad\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd part of Northern Rock \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which included its fabled 125% mortgages \u00e2\u20ac\u201c remained in public hands, although defaults and losses have been much lower than anticipated. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. My colleagues in the US will be covering Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision on Iran here: Despite Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best efforts, the FTSE 100 has ended the day down 1 point at 7565, a most underwhelming result. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news stories on the main business events of the day so far: Nick Field, Director at corporate finance adviser Livingstone, reckons that merging Virgin Money into Yorkshire Bank and Clydesdale would make sense: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCreating a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchallenger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bank of real scale with total assets in excess of \u00c2\u00a380 billion clearly has attractions. As both parties have relatively strong retail deposit franchises, the realisation of synergies on the asset side of the balance sheet and in operational costs will be key to drive value for shareholders in the merged group.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Virgin Money team have a great track record of execution having turned a legacy mortgage portfolio into a strong, growing consumer brand covering a range of financial products. The value of that strong brand and management is tangibly expressed by the price reaction to the offer, with Virgin Money enjoying a considerable premium whilst CYBG has slightly declined.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Wall Street has opened cautiously, with the main indices dipping ahead of president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement tonight.... The oil price is likely to move sharply at 7pm UK time, when Donald Trump reveals his decision on Iran. Ole Hansen, Saxo Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Head of Commodity Strategy, says: There are multiple options available to President Trump which makes this such a binary event where the price could move sharply in either direction. The three most likely options currently being mentioned are: 1) Waiver the sanctions again while allowing time to renegotiate the deal 2) A soft exit being the refusal to waive sanctions on Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil export. It would give companies 180 days to wind down their deals before sanctions are implemented. Furthermore it would provide the US and Europe more time to find a common ground. 3) A hard exit which could see Trump remove the waiver with immediate effect The financial markets are becalmed today, with very little action to report. In London, the FTSE 100 is up a mere 9 points at 7576 this lunchtime, as City traders abandon their terminals to sunbath. The oil price is down a little, with Brent crude off 0.6% at $75.66 per barrel. Yesterday it reached its highest level since 2014, ahead of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision on whether to allow sanctions on Iran. This would be the first step towards ending the nuclear deal agreed by Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration (in which sanctions were lifted, in return for Iran halting its nuclear weapons programme). Analysts fear that ending the deal could spark new tensions in the Middle East, and also destabilise the Iranian economy. Trump, though, has long argued it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bad deal, and may now act..... If Takeda can win shareholder support, then it will acquire Shire for 64.4% more than its value back in March. Such a whopping premium shows that the Japanese firm is desperate for Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pipeline of rare drugs, and its established sales in America. Associated Press explains: Shire gives Takeda a larger presence in the U.S. and expertise in rare diseases, an increasingly important area for pharmaceutical companies as patents on established drugs expire. Even though Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters are in Dublin, it earns more than two thirds of its revenue in the U.S. on drugs like Adderall, which is used for ADHD. Takeda, meanwhile, has like many Japanese companies been expanding overseas to compensate for slowing growth at home. Last year it bought Ariad Pharmaceuticals of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Takeda is valued at about $34 billion and makes almost half of its sales in Asia, and about a third in the U.S. Among its top sellers are Entyvio, used to treat ulcerative colitis, and cancer drug Leuprorelin. In other banking news, Royal Bank of Scotland is refusing to abandon plans to close 50 branches in Scoland. C EO Ross McEwan told MPs on the Scottish Affairs Committee that the decision was the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153best way of going forward\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, despite public anger over the plan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I do recognise that customers are very disappointed that their local branch is closing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done here with a package of different ways of operating with this bank is, I think, the best way of going forward, that we can keep those services to our customers as well as moving away from physical distribution when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just not being used.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not going to please RBS customers who find that their nearest branch has closed. In theory, new technology means less need for banks to maintain a physical presence on the high street; in practice, TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tech meltdown has shown the problems with that approach. Back in the City, Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has dipped below the \u00c2\u00a340 mark. At \u00c2\u00a339.90 (up 3.5% today), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s further away from the \u00c2\u00a348 per share which Takeda has agreed to pay. That underlines the fact that shareholders may not back Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer, even though Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board have accepted it. The Japanese firm will hope to change the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind in the months ahead, and points out that the deal isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t meant to complete until next year. But Takeda certainly has work to do to pull off the biggest pharmaceuticals deal since 2000, as David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Shares in Shire have been given a nice boost in recent weeks after Takeda made two unsuccessful bids for the company. On the other side of the coin, Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has dropped over 30% since the January high, and given the negative market reaction to their pursuit of Shire, there may be some investors who are sceptical about the offer. Another 35 workers have lost their jobs following the collapse of construction and outsourcing group Carillion. The Official Receiver, which took control of Carillion after its liquidation in January, announced the bad news this morning. It means that almost 2,300 of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 20,000 workers have been laid off, while 11,489 have been saved. The news comes as MPs hold an investigation into the lessons that can be learned from Carillion. Phil Bentley, the CEO of outsourcing group Mitie, told the Public Accounts Committee it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very sad\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to see more than two thousand people losing their jobs. He argued that Carillion was brought down by problems at its construction arm - where cost overruns at several contracts created a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perfect storm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, claiming: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a failure of the outsourcing model. Bentley also pointed to Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s used of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoff balance sheet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 instruments, which made it harder to tell the strength (or weakness) of its balance sheet. Rupert Soames, CEO of outsourcer Serco, argued that the government should get some credit for its handling of the crisis. Because ministers did their homework early, they were ready for the moment that Carillion \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tried to put a gun to their head\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and demanded support, explained Soames. The government didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cave in, as it knew what would happen if Carillion went into receivership. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know about a single hospital floor that been left uncleaned or a school meal that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been delivered, because the government did its contingency planning. Soames defended the outsourcing model used in Britain today, saying there is close scrutiny of the private sector companies who help to run public services. But other experts are more critical of outsourcers. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s David Walker, for example, told the committee that the cost savings have tailed off, the innovation promised by outsourcing firms hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been delivered, and the promised transfer of risk from public to private sector hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happened either. With the UK housing market looking weak, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s every reason for the Bank of England to resist raising interest rates at its monetary policy meeting on Thursday. A few weeks ago, the BoE was widely expected to hike borrowing costs this month -- having dropped heavy hints that a rise was coming. However, investors have rapidly changed their minds, following a flurry of disappointing economic data of late. Sajiv Vaid, portfolio manager at Fidelity MoneyBuilder Income Fund, says the Bank of England is now in a fix. If it raises Bank rate, it could panic the City. If it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, then governor Mark Carney will face fresh criticism for having hinted that rates were going up soon. As Vaid puts it: So, having raised expectations (not for the first time either!), the BoE now find themselves in an unenviable dilemma of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153damned if they do and damned if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t...\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a horrible predicament for any central bank to find themselves in. The situation in the UK precisely highlights the difficulty global central banks face with signalling rate hikes in the post-GFC era. Remember, it took twelve months before the US implemented its second rate hike in December 2016. Patience is key for the BoE at this stage and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d argue there are lessons to be learned from the US, where the Fed, despite the long pause, has subsequently raised interest rates a further four times with their credibility remaining intact. We think a pause from the BoE is appropriate, given the domestic backdrop and signs that the frothiness in global GDP may well have stalled, which should provide a supportive backdrop for UK fixed income assets. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on the UK hosing market: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market has been cooling for the past two years, with London seeing the sharpest slowdown. Monthly mortgage approvals have slipped and reports point to waning interest from potential buyers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Housing demand has softened in the early months of 2018, with both mortgage approvals and completed home sales edging down,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Russell Galley at Halifax. The news that UK house prices fell last month has sent a shiver through the sector: Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent, says Halifax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures are a blow - the housing market should be enjoying a spring revival, not subsiding. Although a little historic, these figures are disappointing as there is a market of sluggish growth and transactions, despite still showing modest price rises. And yet we are entering what is supposed to be the busy spring buying season, which tends to set the tone for the rest of the year. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMore recently, activity and listings have picked up but we are finding the market still quite sensitive and only those prepared to negotiate hard are moving on. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNow that interest rates are unlikely to go up this month, hopefully there will be more interest, and particularly from first-time buyers, to take advantage of competitive mortgage deals and realistic prices.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jonathan Samuels, CEO of property lender Octane Capital, reckons Brexit is hurting the market: The property market is a mirror of the economy, lacking any real momentum and simply idling along. While inflation has fallen and wages have been edging up, this will take time to filter through so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise transaction levels remain low. In recent years many households have taken on a lot of cheap debt and, despite the weak Q1 GDP data, remain wary of rising interest rates and the fast-approaching reality of Brexit. Howard Archer of EY Item Club says the UK housing market is struggling to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gain traction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We expect house price gains over 2018 will be limited to a modest 2%. At this stage, we expect prices to rise by 3% in 2019 The fundamentals for house buyers are likely to remain challenging. Consumers have faced an extended serious squeeze on purchasing power, which is only gradually easing. Additionally, housing market activity remains hampered by relatively fragile consumer confidence and limited willingness to engage in major transactions. House buyers will also likely be concerned about further interest rate hikes over the coming months. While a rate hike in May now seems improbable, we suspect the Bank of England is still more likely than not to increase interest rates later this year and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney still indicated that the UK should prepare for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a few interest rate rises over the next few years\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But....Neal Hudson of Residential Analysts says we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get carried away by the monthly house price data: Newsflash: UK house prices took a nasty tumble last month, fuelling concerns that consumer confidence is weakening. Prices fell by 3.1% during April, according to the latest Halifax house price survey -- the biggest monthly decline since September 2010. That monthly data can be volatile so should be treated cautiously. But Halifax also reports that prices fell by 0.1% during the last quarter, and are only 2.2% higher than a year ago. Economist Simon French of Panmure Gordon says house prices seem to be in a downward trend: If Virgin Money does fall to CYBG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover bid, it will lower the number of smaller banks trying to shake up British finance. Sir Richard Branson created Virgin Money more than two decades ago. In 2011, the bank strengthened its position by buying the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 portion of Northern Rock for \u00c2\u00a3747m. Such challenger banks have had a bad press recently, with TSB bungling its move to a new IT platform. As the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Matthew Vincent puts it: If the deal goes through, it would mean Virgin Money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s challenge to the UK high street banks comes to an end after just six years - having bought the old Northern Rock business after it was bailed out by the government during the financial crisis. But, merging Virgin with Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank could create a more powerful competitor, he adds.... CYBG would certainly gain scale from Virgin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presence in the mortgage market and expand into credit cards. Virgin Money would gain access to current accounts and small business lending, which it has struggled to develop on its own organically Boom! Shares in Virgin Money have jumped by almost 10% in early trading. Virgin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are trading at 338p, valuing the company at \u00c2\u00a31.5bn -- close to CYBG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover offer. Rumours have been swirling for weeks that Virgin could receive a takeover offer. This may explain why its shares rose last week, as Garry White of investment manager Charles Stanley points out: City analyst Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets has also spotted the gap between Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price and the Takeda offer... Shares in Shire have jumped by 5% in early trading, following the news that Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover offer has been accepted. That takes them to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. However, shares are only trading around \u00c2\u00a340.50, while Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer values Shire at a juicier \u00c2\u00a349 each. That suggests the City isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced that this deal will actually get the green light from shareholders. There are concerns that Takeda will be forced to borrow heavily to finance the acquisition, which could undermine its credit rating. Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Flemming Ornskov, says Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a346bn deal is in the best interests of shareholders. Ornskov also claims it could help create better drugs for patients too. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would like to thank the entire Shire team for all that we have accomplished over the last five years to transform Shire into the leading rare disease biotech company and a tenacious champion for patients in need. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am confident that this relentless focus will enable us to continue delivering against our priorities throughout this process. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With a truly innovative portfolio and pipeline, I believe that the combination of the two companies is in the best interests of shareholders and offers an opportunity to improve the lives of even more patients globally with rare and highly specialised conditions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The City has got back to work after the long weekend with a bang, thanks to two takeover bids. The big news is that Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Takeda has just reached an agreement to buy pharmaceuticals group Shire, listed on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100. Takeda has agreed to pay \u00c2\u00a346bn (or $62.42bn) for Dublin-headquartered Shire, which produces the ADHD hyperactivity drug Adderall and also has a strong pipeline of treatments for rare diseases. Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board backed the deal, after Takeda agreed to boost the amount of cash in its offer. According to Bloomberg, it will be the biggest overseas acquisition ever by a Japanese company -- assuming shareholders back the plan. The offer is a 59.6% premium on Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value on March 27, just before Takeda revealed its interest. Christophe Weber, CEO of Takeda, says that acquiring Shire will help create \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a stronger Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Together, we will be a leader in providing targeted treatments in gastroenterology, neuroscience, oncology, rare diseases and plasma-derived therapies. We are looking forward to the benefits this combination will bring to patients worldwide, the opportunities it will bring for our employees and the returns it will deliver for our shareholders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But as one deal reaches its conclusion, another is beginning... Virgin Money, the UK challenger bank, has just received a takeover offer from the parent company behind Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank. In a statement to the City, Virgin says: Virgin Money Holdings (UK) plc (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Virgin Money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) notes the press speculation, and confirms that on the evening of 7 May 2018, it received a preliminary and conditional proposal from CYBG to acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Virgin Money. Under the terms of the proposal, Virgin Money shareholders would receive 1.1297 new CYBG shares for each Virgin Money share. The Board of Virgin Money is in the process of reviewing this proposal. There can be no certainty either that an offer will be made nor as to the terms of any offer, if made. Accordingly, shareholders are advised to take no action in relation to this proposal. More on that shortly...... Also coming up today Oil has hit a four-year high, as traders brace for Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision on whether to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal decision. UK foreign secretary Boris Johnson has flown to New York in a last-ditch attempt to sway the president. An announcement could come at 2pm New York time. The UK stock market is expected to gain 13 points at the open, but European indices might dip: Investors will also have one ear on Zurich, where the head of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank is speaking this morning.

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Debbie Carson on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil price spike: Crude oil prices rose to three-and-a-half-year highs following the news that the Trump administration revoked the nuclear deal with Iran. Brent crude oil prices, the global benchmark, and US West Texas Intermediate rallied above $77 and $71 per barrel, respectively, in the aftermath of the announcement. The rise came after the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, told reporters he did not expect a major oil price hikes because other countries would increase output to offset such losses. Although Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was not a surprise, reinstating all US nuclear-related sanctions was more than expected, said Barclays analysts in a research note. Bart Melek, global head of commodity strategy at TD Securities, said this announcement comes at a time where there are increased geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and global crude oil inventories are normalizing after being in a supply glut for the past few years. In the US inventory levels are now below the five-year average. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a broad consensus that [supplies are] going to rebalance and tighten up, but you throw the possibility of disruptions of flows from Iran, and the markets started to worry,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Goodnight! GW My colleague Phillip Inman has written a Q&amp;A about the rising oil price. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: What does the nuclear deal have to do with the oil price? When Iran pledged to limit its nuclear ambitions to civil energy production under the deal with the P5+1 group of world powers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sanctions were lifted on its oil exports, giving a significant boost to global oil supplies. How big is Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contribution to global supplies? Iran is the third largest producer in the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), which makes it a heavy hitter in the production of oil. It produces 2.5m barrels a day, equal to about 3% of global demand. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to reimpose sanctions and effectively keep up to half of Iranian oil in the ground has hit the oil price since he was elected in November 2016. The price of Brent crude is now up 50% year on year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full piece: The rally in oil stocks has driven Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip stock index up almost 100 points today. The FTSE 100 closed 96 points higher at 7,662 tonight, a gain of 1.3%, and its highest level in over three months. David Madden of CMC Markets says: The FTSE 100 is the best performing major European index today thanks to the rally in oil stocks. The British equity benchmark has a disproportionally large exposure to the energy sector, and the pickup from BP and Royal Dutch Shell has made it the standout market in Europe. The US withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal has sent the oil market to new multi-year highs, and the major oil titans are reaping the rewards. Over in New York shares are also rising, with the Dow up almost 200 points. Not much sign of panic over Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement..... Newsflash: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reserves of crude and refined oil have fallen sharply, sending the oil price even higher. US crude stocks fell by 2.2 million barrels last week, according to new figures from the Energy Information Administration. Economists had only expected a decline of 719,000, so this is a sign that demand for energy is stronger than expected. Oil traders have responded quickly, driving the price of a barrel of Brent crude up t0 $77.43 - a new 3.5 year high. The EIA also reported that gasoline stocks dropped by more than expected, by 2.17m barrels per day. City Index point out that French oil giant Total could lose out on a valuable contract in Iran. The slump in the Iranian rial today is a reminder of the damage that new sanctions will cause to Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Associated Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Many Iranians are worried about what Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision could mean for their country. The Iranian rial is already trading on the black market at 66,000 to the dollar, despite a government-set rate of 42,000 rials. Many say they have not seen any benefits from the nuclear deal. Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor economy and unemployment sparked nationwide protests in December and January that saw at least 25 people killed and, reportedly, nearly 5,000 arrested. Ding Ding! US oil company stocks are rallying in early trading, as Wall Street opens for business. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 107 points at the open, as New York traders shrug off Iranian worries. Oil giants such as Exxon and Chevron are both benefitting from the pick-up in crude prices, and the prospect that Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supplies will be squeezed out of the market. Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says: Oil has been rallying for days in response to rumours that Trump would announce the withdrawal, which clearly suggests that traders believe the sanctions will further tighten global supply at a time when some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest producers have already significantly reduced inventories. There is clearly the potential for these countries to fill the void left by the sanctions but if it aids their cause then they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll likely opt against it. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our round-up of the companies who could be hurt by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to rip up the Iranian nuclear deal, from oil firms to car producers and airline manufacturers: The Iranian clampdown could also affect oil giant BP. BP recently agreed to sell a North Sea gas field which it co-owns with Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state owned oil company. New sanctions could potentially cause that deal to unravel. My colleague Rob Davies explains: Late last year BP agreed to sell three North Sea gas fields to Serica Energy for $400m. One of the fields, Rhum, is co-owned by a subsidiary of Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national oil company. That means a licence is required from the US Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) to allow US nationals or companies to work on it. If Serica cannot obtain that licence because of new sanctions it faces the risk of being unable to call on US-owned companies, in the event, for instance, of a fire or oil spill, severely restricting its emergency options. The sale is not yet complete and it is unclear whether it will go ahead now. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We take care to ensure we always comply with applicable sanctions,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd BP said. The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Simon Jack agrees that the deal could be in doubt. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has responded to the threat of geopolitical upheaval, by hitting its highest level in over three months. The FTSE 100 has gained 35 points to reach 7601, for the first time since the end of January. Oil companies are leading the rally, with Royal Dutch Shell up 2% and BP gaining 2.2%, as Brent crude bobs just below the $77 mark. Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx explains: Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Iranian nuclear deal pull-out and subsequent sanctions, via its impact on Brent Crude, remained the core driver of trading on Wednesday. Though Brent couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite hold above $77 per barrel, the black stuff is still trading at its best price since 2014. This propelled BP and Shell more than 2% higher apiece, gains that provided the bedrock of the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own growth. Other European indices are calm today, with the pan-Europe Stoxx 600 up 0.2%. Wall Street is also expected to open higher, as investors take the Iranian nuclear issue in their stride. Over in parliament, foreign secretary Boris Johnson is updating MPs about Iran. He says that Britain has no intention of walking away from the nuclear deal (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action). America must now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spell out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd their view of the way ahead, Johnson continues. He also urges Iran to show restraint, adding that a nuclear-armed Iran would never be acceptable to Britain.

Reuters has the details: The dollar was being offered for as much as 75,000 rials, compared to around 65,000 just before Trump announced his decision on Tuesday night, according to foreign exchange website Bonbast.com, which tracks the free market. Dealers in Tehran quoted similar levels on Wednesday, according to an Iranian economist outside the country who is in touch with them. One dealer said the rial had hit 78,000, while another said he had made two sales of dollars at 80,000. Amir Paivar of the BBC Persian TV points out that there is confusion in the market, after several days of heavy losses. Brent crude is heading towards $80 per barrel, says Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index. Uncertainty over the Iranian situation, combined with speculation in the markets, are capable of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taking prices even higher in the near-term\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he explains. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to abandon the Iranian nuclear deal will have a major impact on the oil market, says City investor Richard Robinson. Robinson, who manages the Ashburton Global Energy Fund, says it will probably remove hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil from the market each day. The worst-case scenario, involving strict adherence and policing of sanctions, could see as much as 700kbbld removed from the market. A less disciplined approach, with ambiguous US guidance, could remove less than 200k barrels per day. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rhetoric sounded fairly unambiguous. Although Trump would have ideally liked Europe to join him in re-imposing sanctions, the eventual effect is likely to be similar. Europe currently imports between 500-600kbbld of Iranian crude and it is expected this number will drop by approximately 60%. Iranian barrels can be easily substituted for Iraqi crudes. European companies are present in both Iran and the US. Companies such as Total and Eni may choose to stop lifting Iranian crudes altogether, for fear of being precluded from the US market. It is expected Asian refiners, with exposure to both regions, may also choose to follow the ban. China, on the other hand, may choose to take advantage of the widening discounts and purchase more Iranian crude \u00e2\u20ac\u201c through various shell companies. Companies who have been dealing with Iran now risk violating US sanctions, and need to plan accordingly, says Michael Harris, director of financial crime compliance at LexisNexis Risk Solutions. Any organisation conducting business with Iranian individuals, companies or related entities could actually find themselves subject to sanctions due to the United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and subsequent re-implementation of secondary sanctions. With such a significant change in position from the US, it is vital that firms re-evaluate their dealings with censured entities and regularly screen their customers against the latest and most relevant sanctions lists. If not, they risk breaching sanctions, facing unprecedented fines and reputational damage, as well as repercussions for future business with the United States.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US planemaker Boeing may also be unhappy with Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. Like Airbus, Boeing has signed billions of dollars worth of deals with Iranian airlines in the last couple of years. Last night, treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin warned that Boeing and Airbus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s licences to trade with Iran \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will be revoked.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran is already hurting companies with ties to Tehran. Shares in French carmakers Renault and Peugeot have fallen by over 1.2% this morning. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve both built links with Iran to build and sell cars, so now face being locked out again. Airbus is another possible casualty, having recently sold 100 planes to IranAir. Airbus shares are down almost 1% this morning; it will be caught by the sanctions, as its aircraft use many US-build parts. Carl Bildt, former prime minister of Sweden, says European companies will suffer more from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions than US ones. Politico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nahal Toosi agrees: China, India and Korea could all be hit by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. As this chart shows, they are the biggest customers for the oil which Iran has been pumping vigorously since sanctions were lifted in 2016. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision has gone down predictably badly in Iran. MPs symbolically burned a US flag in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parliament this morning and chanted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153death to America\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Iranian parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speaker, Ali Larijani, accused the US president of conducting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153diplomatic show\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and claimed that president Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153does not have the mental capacity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the job. Geopolitical anxiety is driving investors into the safety of the US dollar today, sending it to its highest level since December 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad for emerging market currencies, such as the Turkish lira, which has lurched to a fresh all-time low of 4.3736 liras to the dollar. That might force Istanbul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank to intervene to prop up the lira Brent crude is continuing to rise, and just hit $77.20 per barrel for the first time since November 2014. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very aggressive rhetoric\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd against Iran last night has jolted the oil market, says Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM While it was widely anticipated that Trump would pull out of the Iran agreement, what is likely to leave a lasting impact on the markets is the threat that he would also penalize those who help Iran. These overall risks are encouraging traders to price in some new geopolitical risk premium, and his threat can potentially be seen as a blow for U.S allies. There is a threat of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stark tone questioning U.S relations with its European allies, especially given that the likes of France and the United Kingdom had appealed for Trump not to withdraw. Some major European companies will be very disappointed by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision, having signed some large deals with Tehran since sanctions were lifted under Barack Omaba. Quartz explains: Energy giants like Total and Royal Dutch Shell have lucrative agreements to work with Iran, while Renault has a joint venture to make 150,000 cars a year, and Franco-German plane maker Airbus has reportedly delivered just three out of 100 jets promised to Iran, in a deal worth billions.... Any European companies with a US arm that agreed a deal with Iran would now be violating US law, says Adam Smith, a lawyer at Gibson Dunn who is a former Treasury sanctions official. Those not active in the US could be hit with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with-us or-against-us sanction,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in which Washington would tell the company that if it wants to keep trading with Iran they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trade with America, Smith said. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The oil price has been driven to its highest level in three and a half years after Donald Trump ignored the pleas of European allies and pulled America out of the Iran nuclear deal. Brent crude - sourced from the North Sea - was swept up to $76.85 this morning, as traders digest the prospect of a new crisis in the Gulf. The oil price jumped following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to impose \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the highest level of economic sanctions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on Iran, and to reimpose sanctions on any foreign company that continues to do business with it. In a hardline move, Trump damned the Iran agreement as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a horrible one-sided deal that should never, ever have been made\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This has disappointed those who had urged him not to unilaterally pull out, and risk encouraging Iran to develop nuclear weapons. Trump, though, insisted the deal wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working. The decision means that Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil production, which picked up after sanctions were lifted in 2016, will surely now decline. That could lead to a tighter market and new upward pressure on prices. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a danger that geopolitical tensions in the Middle East will rise, leading to supply disruptions. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada told clients: The U.S. will reimpose all sanctions waived under the 2015 landmark agreement, he said, calling it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153defective at its core.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As a counter, Iranian President Rouhani warned his country is ready to resume enriching uranium within weeks. In a strongly worded joint statement, the UK, France and Germany rejected Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. Oil rose more than 3% following the announcement while the dollar index strengthened further. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets reckons we should brace for higher oil prices, which will drive up fuel and energy costs for consumers. He explains: With Venezuela still firmly in crisis and now Iran potentially facing sanctions, we could easily find that plus $70 per barrel becomes the new norm in a market which has already been tightened by OPEC. Also coming up today Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sector has suffered its worst monthly sales fall in more than two decades, in the latest sign that consumers are struggling. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be watching Argentina, which has begun talking the International Monetary Fund about a new credit line, in an attempt to prop up its currency and stem market panic. Also, pub chain J Wetherspoon and bakers Greggs are reporting results to the City. Greggs has warned that recent bad weather hit sales (as people didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t brave the icy streets for a sausage roll), while Wetherspoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s used most of its statement to argue against Britain remaining in an EU customs union (it also said sales growth slowed a little)....",

                "bodyText":"Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor Larry Elliott on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news from the Bank of England. The Bank of England has put back plans for an increase in interest rates after the weaker-than-expected performance of the economy in early 2018. Although the Bank believes the soft patch in growth will prove temporary, seven of the nine members of its monetary policy committee adopted a wait-and-see approach to raising official borrowing costs and voted to keep them at 0.5%. Two members of the committee \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty \u00e2\u20ac\u201c said rising pay caused by falling unemployment required an immediate increase in interest rates. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which was outlined in its quarterly inflation report \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will come as no surprise to the City, which expected Threadneedle Street to ditch plans for tighter policy this month in the light of first quarter growth of 0.1%, a faster-than-expected fall in inflation and evidence that consumers were cutting back on spending. The minutes of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee meeting show that rate rises are still being planned in order to meet the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% inflation target, but the language was notably softer than in February when the Bank said policy would probably need to be tightened earlier and to a greater extent than the markets were expecting. Three months ago, the Bank had been pencilling in growth of 0.4% in the first quarter and 1.8% for 2018 as a whole. The near-stalling of the economy has led the MPC to cut its annual growth forecast to 1.4% for this year.... That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today; thanks for reading and commenting. GW Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, believes UK interest rates may not rise until 2019! He blames the return of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 today: Not for the first time, Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy of guiding the markets as to what to expect has backfired. A month or so ago it looked like a May rate rise was a near-certainty. The Bank of England had upgraded its growth forecasts and in March two members of the MPC broke ranks and voted for an immediate rate rise. Markets were then pricing in a 90% chance of a rate rise at this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy meeting. But since then things have changed. First-quarter economic growth was a disappointing 0.1%, and the ONS said the bad weather wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t to blame. Add in an (un)healthy dose of Brexit uncertainty, and the chance of a rate hike had dwindled to just 8% at the start of this week. As such today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no change decision wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a surprise, and barely caused a ripple in the markets Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, says Mark Carney has once again disappointed those hoping for an interest rate rise - and the pound is paying the price: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Once again, Mark Carney and the MPC have backed away from hiking interest rates mere months after hinting that a move was imminent. The MPC holding fire on hikes is not an issue in itself \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the committee is data dependent, and recent UK data has been poor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the dangers of making overly explicit statements on future policy moves have been made clear. Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warnings from February about rates rising earlier and to a greater extent now once again look like the promises of an unreliable boyfriend \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and sterling is again suffering from being jilted at the rate hike altar. Craig Inches, Head of Rates &amp; Cash at Royal London Asset Management, thinks the Bank of England has fumbled the opportunity to raise interest rates today. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In our view, the Bank has missed another opportunity to raise rates. Despite a run of soft data, the economy may turn out to be more robust than recent evidence, and the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newly lowered forecasts, suggest.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Interestingly two members of the MPC also agree with us, while the press conference by Mark Carney and colleagues was in fact more hawkish than the headlines suggest. Newsflash: Sterling is now at a four-month low against the US dollar: Peter Dixon of German bank Commerzbank believes the Bank of England sounded rather more dovish about interest rate policy today. He writes: The forecast is conditioned on three rate hikes of 25 bps over the next three years and markets have slashed the probability assigned to a rate move in 2018. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the pound has fallen against the US dollar today; currently down 0.5% at $1.348. Anthony Gillham of wealth manager Quilter thinks the media\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s questions about Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unreliability hit a nerve today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s snap at the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tag reveals the tension between the City clamour over interest rate changes and the real impact on households. Unsurprisingly, the Bank is probably feeling a little defensive that its own \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcforward guidance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 seems to have misled the City. As a result he was keen to distinguish between the City and his other key stakeholder, UK households. He is right to do so, but the truth is that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re inextricably linked. The market expected a rise largely because it predicted the economy would be carrying more momentum and inflation would be running higher. Those predictions have proved overly optimistic, which is definitely a concern for households, and that is why rates are staying flat today. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool thinks that Brexit uncertainty is helping to push Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next interest rate rise further and further into the future. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plotted the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP growth forecasts alongside economic policy uncertainty (based on the number of articles about economic worries in The Times and the FT). It shows a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clear negative correlation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he says (sagging growth and media angst about the economy go hand in hand). Professor Milas adds: Notice, also, that - unfortunately - current uncertainty has started picking up again. If this persists, August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Inflation Report will trim further the growth forecast which will of course delay even further a possible hike. Nice snap summary from Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jill Ward: After years of playing the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Mark Carney is turning into the tetchy husband who keeps promising to take the bins out, but never quite gets round to it. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excuse for not raising interest rates is that the UK economy has slowed in recent months, as the Beast From The East hit construction activity and kept shoppers off the high street. A fair point. In the same breath, Carney sounds confident that the economy will rebound in the months ahead - even though the Bank has cut its 2018 growth forecast from a moderate 1.8% to a modest 1.4%. Faced with repeated questioning about his failure to raise borrowing costs, the governor declared: What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the sensible thing to do? Do you act now or do you wait to see evidence that that momentum is re-asserting? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The judgement of the majority of the committee is you wait to see for some evidence of that reasserting.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So, we can all expect the bins to finally be dragged out at the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next meeting, in June? Or perhaps August (when the BoE will hold its next \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSuper Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 press conference)?.... Not necessarily. Mark Carney is refusing to make any sweeping commitments. He even argues that the British public isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too fixated on the timing of rate rises, and understands they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll happen at the appropriate time. He said: The expectations of those individuals - more than three-quarters of those, whether they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re individuals or businesses - is that interest rates are going to go up, are likely to go up at some point over the course of the next years,probably a couple of times over the next year, year and a half.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So they are in a position that they can plan accordingly for that possibility, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a guarantee, they think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a likelihood.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Andrew Sentance, a former member of the MPC, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed: Carney could, rightly, point out that the Bank should hold off raising interest rates until we have more clarity on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trading relationship with the EU. But that might be too political for the governor, Instead, he cautioned: While the storms of February and March have given way to sunnier skies, the economic outlook for the UK remains clouded by Brexit uncertainties. Despite the welcome agreement on a transition period, the terms on which the UK will trade with the EU beyond that period remain to be determined.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mark Carney also tried to rise above the fray, arguing that families aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t busy trading the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshort-sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rates in an attempt to predict interest rate moves. True, but those financial instruments still really matter (as Carney understands all too well, of course). So when might UK interest rates actually go up? Yael Selfin, Chief Economist at KPMG in the UK, thinks it might not happen until November - which would be a year after the last hike. She writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Faced with weaker economic data in the first quarter of 2018, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee decided to opt for caution and to leave interest rates unchanged at 0.5% today. While the decision had been largely anticipated, it marks a significant shift from expectations only a few weeks ago for a rate rise in May. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The strong labour market, together with a range of business surveys as well as what we see on the ground talking to our clients, do not point to a material shift in the economic environment, and support the view that the weakness at the start of the year is likely to be at least partially reversed further on this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While on paper there are a number of opportunities for the MPC to raise rates this year, the next rise may now only take place in November. It is likely to coincide with a new Inflation Report and the MPC may wish to avoid a rate rise in August when markets are thinner and businesses and households could be caught off-guard while on holiday. That would make a relatively long delay in policy action due to a potential short blip in data.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Oh, and what about *that* nickname? Well, governor Carney looked rather tired of being labeled an unreliable suitor (a moniker that dates back to 2014). He told the press: The only people who throw that term at me are in this room. So now everyone else can throw it at me when I go out of this room.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And finally... Q: The Office for National Statistics has just lowered its estimate of the UK trade deficit by a quarter - so how reliable is Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, and does it mean that the UK is still \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreliant on the kindness of strangers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 [an old Carney quote] Great question, says Mark Carney, who bats it across to deputy Ben Broadbent. Broadbent explains that economic data can always be revised and updated as new information comes in, and economists update and refine their models. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mistake to treat it as God-given and fixed. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the press conference. Q: What impact would a hard Brexit have on the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic forecasts? Mark Carney replies that a hard Brexit would prompt a change the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts. But such a scenario it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not currently included in its economic projections, which are based on a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctransition deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 being agreed and implemented. Handily for the Bank, the likely end of that transition deal comes beyond its current forecast horizon, so it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to map the implications (yet....). The Bank has, though, been ensuring that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks are well capitalised to handle a Brexit shock. Q: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarterly inflation report suggests that some business surveys are painting a better (and more optimistic) picture of the UK economy than the official GDP data. So which \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data do you take seriously? Deputy governor Ben Broadbent argues that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no contradiction between strong business surveys (which often track sentiment) and weaker GDP data (which measures actual output). Those business surveys have dropped to lower levels, but they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t point to anything as weak as 0.1% growth (the official first estimate of UK GDP). Good points from Duncan Weldon of the Resolution Group: Q: What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest challenge for your successor, governor? Brexit, perhaps? The biggest challenge, and opportunity, for the country is the Brexit negotiations, Mark Carney replies. He won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be drawn about his replacement, though (Carney is due to leave the Bank in June 2019). Q: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report seems to suggest that interest rates will rise three times in the next three years - should households expect that? Carney repeats his line that UK households and businesses broadly expect a rate rise this year, and two increases in the next 18 months. But it all depends on how the economy develops. Q: Hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t your message on interest rates been diluted since February (when the Bank said rates would probably rise faster than markets expected)? Our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccore message\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed, Carney insists. Q: Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there also a danger that wage pressure will also be more muted than the Bank expects? Regular pay has been inline with the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations, Carney replies. Some snap reaction to Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference: Q: Are you failing to communicate to the UK public? Carney says that the UK public have understood the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message in recent years, that interest rates will rise gradually as economic conditions merit it. And he takes a wider view, saying that Britain is in a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdifferent place\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 than Europe (which has more spare capacity, and has only just fixed its financial system), but also a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdifferent place\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 than America (which doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t face the same scale of uncertainty over its future trading relationship). People across the UK understand that, Carney adds. Q: Are you worried that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tag will stick, as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve once hinted that a rate rise was coming, but not delivered? The households and businesses we speak to don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trade short sterling**, Carney shoots back. They want to know the general orientation of the economy, that the economy is healthy, and the likely path of interest rates. (** - short sterling is a way of betting on the future path of interest rates). The only people who throw the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tag at me are in this room, Carney tells the press conference. Now everyone else can use it too. Q: The money markets have priced out an interest rate rise this year. Are you happy with that? Carney repeats that the Bank is primarily concerned with households and businesses (suggesting that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focused on higher things than mere City traders and scribblers). But the Bank is also watching the financial markets, of course. The Bank believes that the underlying momentum in the UK economy will reassert itself, but others can take a different view. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent chips in too, saying the markets now suggest there is an 85% chance of a rate rise by November 2018. Onto questions. Q: In the past you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve told us to watch the data, but today you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re saying that the economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as weak as the data suggests. So how should people judge what the Bank is going to do? Carney doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept that the Bank is confusing people. He says that the Bank of England speaks to businesses and individuals across the country. And they expect that interest rates will probably go up a couple of times over the next two couple of years. The Bank can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t judge exactly how fast the economy will grow - that depends on a range of factors. But if the economy is growing faster than its speed limit, then domestic inflationary pressures will probably intensify, so some tightening of monetary policy is probably needed. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee believes that the recent slowdown is temporary, Carney adds. But the sensible thing to do is to wait to see if this is born out by data in the months ahead, rather than hike today. The weather may have improved, but Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is still \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clouded by Brexit uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says governor Carney. The position should become clearer later this year as key decisions about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future relationship with the EU are made, he adds. The key points from Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement thus far: The overall economic climate in the UK looks \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclittle changed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Mark Carney says - perhaps a hint that we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too worried about the lower 2018 growth forecast. The drag from Brexit on business investment has continued, but has not intensified, says Mark Carney. On the consumer side, the bank believes that consumption will pick up as the real income squeeze comes to an end. But the Bank believes that consumption will only grow half as fast as before the EU referendum, and just a third as fast as before the financial crisis. Overall, the climate is one of modest demand growth, with solid growth in net trade and moderate growth in business investment offsetting more modest growth in household spending, Carney says. Mark Carney says the UK economy has not met the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations over the last three months. Growth and inflation have both been lower than the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts in February, the governor explains. Carey says the Bank believes this softening is a temporary problem, due to the snowy and icy weather which hit Britain earlier this year. Adverse weather hit construction particularly badly, he says, and meant people struggled to get to work or the shops. But the labour market has remained robust, he adds (unemployment is at its lowest rate in four decades, with employment at a record high). The Bank of England is holding a press conference now to explain today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. Governor Mark Carney is in the chair, accompanied by deputies Ben Broadbent and SIr David Ramsden. You can watch it live here: Reaction to the Bank of England decision is flooding in. Tom Stevenson, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International, points out that the BoE has pulled another u-turn - having hinted in February that rates would rise today: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mark Carney really is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Leaving the base rate at 0.5% - what was once thought of as an emergency rate - is another big U-turn for the Bank of England governor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Until a few weeks ago, a further quarter point rate hike to 0.75% looked almost guaranteed. But very weak UK GDP growth figures and fast-retreating inflation has seen a rapid reversal of the Old Lady\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasingly unhelpful forward guidance. The Bank of England has marched investors up to the top of the hill only to march them back down again. Mark Nash, head of fixed income at Old Mutual Global Investors, says weak economic data prevented the Bank raising borrowing costs today. The Bank of England (BoE) chose to keep rates on hold at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting in light of recent weakness in GDP, falling house prices, lower-than-expected inflation and, no doubt, Brexit uncertainty. There has been broad based weakness in economic data across the globe, ex-US, after a strong Q4 2017 that has led central banks to back away from rate hikes in the near term. Nick Dixon, Investment Director at Aegon, predicts that the Bank will remain cautious in the coming months: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The last quarter has seen muted economic activity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with growth of only 0.1% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c aligned with more modest forecasts of future growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The reasons for caution shown today by the Bank of England are clear. The pound appears to have stabilised reducing future inflation risk, UK growth expectations are lower, and the global picture is less certain. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We see these forces, reinforced by Brexit uncertainty, persisting into the second half of 2018 and reducing the likely pace of future rate increases.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Bank is sticking to its promise that interest rates will probably rise in the months ahead. The minutes say: The Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best collective judgement therefore remains that, were the economy to develop broadly in line with the May Inflation Report projections, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to its target at a conventional horizon. As previously, however, that judgement relies on the economic data evolving broadly in line with the Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s projections. For the majority of members, an increase in Bank Rate was not required at this meeting. All members agree that any future increases in Bank Rate are likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. But until the Bank actually raises interest rates, that reputation of being an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will linger. The pound has fallen, as City traders digest the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to cut its growth forecasts and left UK interest rates unchanged. Having put its nose over the $1.36 mark in late-morning trading, sterling has now turned tail and fallen to $1.351. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to a four-month low. The Bank of England says uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union is weighing on the economy. The minutes of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting say: Although business investment is still restrained by Brexit-related uncertainties, it is being supported, like exports, by strong global demand and accommodative financial conditions. Household consumption growth remains subdued, in line with the modest growth in real income over the forecast period. A majority of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers wanted to leave interest rates alone until they know if last quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak growth was just a blip, or something more serious. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minutes say: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The recent weakness in data for the first quarter had been consistent with a temporary soft patch, with few implications for ... the outlook for the UK economy,.... There was value in seeing how the data unfolded over the coming months, to discern whether the softness in Q1 might persist.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ouch! The Bank of England has taken an axe to its growth forecasts. It now expects the UK economy to only grow by 1.4% this year, down from 1.8% expected just three months ago. This follows the disappointing GDP figures at the start of this year, which showed growth almost flat-lining at just 0.1%. Growth in 2019 and 2020 has been cut too, from 1.8% to 1.7%. Seven Bank of England policymakers voted to leave borrowing costs on hold. But two members of the Monetary Policy Committee voted to hike. The hawks, Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders argued that borrowing costs should go up. BREAKING: The Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rates unchanged. The headline cost of borrowing remains at 0.5%. The Bank has also left its asset-purchase scheme (QE) unchanged. The move suggests the BoE doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the UK economy is strong enough to handle higher interest rates, following the slowdown in growth at the start of this year. More to follow.... The pound has crept back up over $1.36 against the US dollar, up 0.5% today, as traders brace for the Bank of England decision to hit the wires at noon precisely. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision is being taken by the nine members of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee - a mixture of top Bank officials and independent experts. Two external members, Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders, are on the hawkish end of the committee table - they voted to raise rates in March, and may do so again. On the opposite side sit two dovish deputy governors, Sirs Jon Cunliffe and Dave Ramsden. They both opposed last November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise (from 0.25% to 0.5%), and may need plenty of persuading to vote for a hike. That leaves the five \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcswing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 voters - governor Mark Carney, deputy Ben Broadband, the maverick chief economist Andy Haldane, and external members Gertjan Vlieghe and Silvana Tenreyro. They could surprise the markets by voting to raise borrowing costs today.... Excitement is mounting in the City, with just 30 minutes until the Bank of England announces its interest rate decision. Most experts expect borrowing costs to remain unchanged. But you never know....central bankers have pulled a few surprises over the years (and a shock move always has more impact than a widely-trailed one). Gambling site Betway is offering 6/1 on a rate rise today, and 10/1 on a cut! Spokesman Alan Alger says: We know that another rate hike should come at some point before the end of the year, and May looked very likely just a few weeks ago, though the combination of flagging inflation and underwhelming growth means we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re now just 1/5 for rates to remain at 0.5%. Some commentators even believe that a cut to interest rates would serve the economy better than a rise, though Mark Carney and Co look unlikely to take such a daring decision at 10/1.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chancellor has welcomed the news that Royal Bank of Scotland is paying a $4.9bn penalty to US authorities. The fine for misselling financial instruments that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis has been hanging over RBS for years. Philip Hammond hopes that last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s settlement will make it easier to sell the taxpayer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stake in the bank. Hammond says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I welcome the agreement in principle to resolve this long-standing issue which will, when finalised, remove a major uncertainty for the UK taxpayer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It marks another significant milestone in RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work to resolve its legacy issues, and will help pave the way to a sale of taxpayer-owned shares.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shareholders may also be relieved, as RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payment is smaller than expected. Shares in the Bank have jumped this morning, towards the top of the FTSE leaderboard. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama in Italy today, as two populist parties suddenly move closer to the levers of power. Late last night, former PM Silvio Berlusconi dropped his opposition to an alliance between the right-wing, anti-immigrant League party, and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement. Berlusconi dramatically declared that his Forza Italia party would not block a League-M5S coalition, seemingly clearing the way for the two parties to team up. The move came after two months of deadlock following the last Italian general election, which failed to deliver a clear winner. Unless a government can be agreed today, a technocratic government could be imposed. An alliance between M5S and the League has been seen as the worst scenario for Brussels, as both parties are inclined to unravel the painful austerity experienced by Italy in recent years. Italian bond price have fallen this morning... however, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still looking healthier than before March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election, suggesting investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that worried. As Paul Donovan of UBS puts it: The Italian president has suggested parties have until this afternoon to come up with a workable government before a technocrat government is imposed. Former Prime Minister Berlusconi has suggested that Forza Italia may back a government led by the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anti-party\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Five Star movement. That would not be viewed as market friendly, but Italian investors have a certain amount of experience with political uncertainty. Over in the City, shares in BT has slumped by 8% to a five-year low. Investors are unhappy that BT expects revenues to fall by 2% this year, while earnings will also fall year-on year. The telecoms group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff have also been shaken by the news that 13,000 jobs are being axed, as the company plans to quit its London HQ after 150 years. This will be partly offset by 6,000 new engineering hires. Our media correspondent, Mark Sweney, says the shake-up comes after a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctorrid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 18 months for BT: The telecoms company said the job losses would come mainly from back office and middle-management roles. About two-thirds of the job cuts will fall on its UK workforce of about 80,000, with the remainder coming from the 18,000 staff it employs internationally. BT is also moving out of its central London headquarters in St Paul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, where it has been headquartered since 1874 when the group was known as the General Post Office, as part of a wide-ranging restructuring. BT has also announced a new plan to tackle its pensions deficit, including a payment of \u00c2\u00a34.5bn. Ian Forrest, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, says BT has provided clarity, but questions and doubts over its future remain: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While some parts of the consumer-facing businesses are seeing good growth and investors should be interested in the plans to restructure, the group is still under pressure on a number of fronts and therefore the shares are no better than a hold.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Several commentators are pointing out that BT has lavished cash on buying sports broadcasting rights, only to now turn around and axe thousands of staff: We also have fresh evidence that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers and construction firms both struggled in March. The Office for National Statistics has reported that manufacturing output fell by 0.1% in March, and has been unimpressive since the start of this year. Builders had an even rougher time! Construction output fell by 2.3% in March, and has fallen by 2.7% since the start of the year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the worst quarterly fall in five years. The Bank of England may feel that this is a good reason not to raise interest rates yet. The ONS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of national accounts, Rob Kent-Smith says the data show that the UK economy was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very sluggish in the first quarter of 2018, with little impact overall from the bad weather\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Manufacturing was broadly flat throughout the first quarter following several months of strong growth, with no evidence that the bad weather hampered UK factories as both domestic and international sales stalled. Machinery, transport and computer manufacturers all saw their output grow. This was largely offset by falling production of electrical equipment and oil refining. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The whole construction sector performed poorly in the first quarter with housing, repair work and public works seeing particularly large falls. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit has narrowed, thanks to a drop in imports from non-EU countries. The Office for National Statistics has reported that Britain bought fewer ships and aircraft from the rest of the world in the first quarter of 2018. This helped to cut the UK total trade deficit (in goods and services) by \u00c2\u00a3700m to \u00c2\u00a36.9 billion in the three months to March 2018. But, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures also show that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit with the rest of the European Union has widened this year - as the debate over Brexit, customs unions and tariffs has raged. The ONS explains: The UK trade in goods deficit with non-EU countries narrowed \u00c2\u00a31.5 billion to \u00c2\u00a39.9 billion in the three months to March 2018, while the deficit with the EU widened \u00c2\u00a30.4 billion to \u00c2\u00a324.7 billion over the same period. Today is dubbed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSuper Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 because the Bank of England will release its interest rate decision, publish the minutes of the meeting, and also give us a fresh assessment of the UK economy (the Quarterly Inflation Report). So there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be lots to watch out for at noon. Including: 1) The actual policy decision: Will the Bank leave borrowing costs at 0.5%, or surprise us with a quarter-point hike? 2) The split. In March, two policymakers voted to raise interest rates but were outvoted by the other seven members of the Monetary Policy Committee. Will we get a 7-2 split again today, or will more MPC members vote to hike? 3) The language: We could get a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchawkish hold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, in which the Bank leaves rates on hold but hints that a rise is coming. But would investors believe them, after so many similar promises before? 4) The growth forecasts. The latest GDP figures show the economy only expanded by 0.1% in the first three months of 2018, weaker than the Bank expected. This may force its forecasters to cut their growth expectations for 2018. The pound could surge, or slump, depending on what the Bank of England does today. Viraj Patel, a currency strategist at ING, has predicted that sterling could slump by two cents to $1.3350 if the Bank votes unanimously to leave interest rates on hold. But if we get a surprise rate hike, the pound could surge by three cents to $1.3850, Patel estimates. This chart of City expectations for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision shows why the old \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 line is doing the rounds again. The upward spike in early February was prompted by the Bank of England; it said that monetary policy needed to be tightened \u00e2\u20ac\u0153somewhat earlier and faster\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than previously thought. A clear hint that a rate rise was coming, in other words. Stephanie Flanders, head of Bloomberg Economics, says the Bank of England has created a communications problem for itself. She predicts the BoE will probably execute a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreverse-ferret\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (an old journalistic phrase for a bare-faced u-turn) today. Expectations of a UK interest rate rise today have faded fast in recent weeks, says Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly thanks to Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning in April that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic data was looking \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmixed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Only one month ago, the markets were predicting a more than 90% probability of a UK interest rate increase this month. Today, this probability has evaporated to less than 15%. A crippling combination of negative economic data, disappointing growth figures and another reversal in tone from BoE Governor Mark Carney has been the driver behind these minimal expectations of a UK interest rate rise today. Mark Carney was originally dubbed an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 nearly four years ago. Labour MP Pat McFadden coined the tag during a select committee hearing, when he teased the governor for promising interest rate hikes, and then changing his mind. As McFadden put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a lot of different signals. I mean it strikes me that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behaving a bit like a sort of unreliable boyfriend. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One day hot, one day cold, and the people on the other side of the message are left not really knowing where they stand.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Governor Carney must feel such criticism is unfair. His \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcforward guidance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was based on the promise that the Bank would only raise borrowing costs when the economic data justified it. But the tag has stuck - mainly because the BoE held rates through 2014 and 2015, actually ended up cutting rates after the Brexit vote in 2016. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. All eyes are on the Bank of England this morning as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank meets to set interest rates, and releases its latest assessment of the UK economy. And what a difference three weeks makes. For months, City investors have had today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting circled in their diaries, as the moment when the BoE would raise borrowing costs for only the second time in a decade (the first was last November). After all, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has dropped plenty of hints that a rate rise was coming. However, Carney seems to have got cold feet (not for the first time either!). Last month, he pulled a screeching u-turn, telling the media that expectations of a rate rise had been overblown. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because recent economic data from the UK has been rather disappointing, with growth almost stalling in the first three months of 2018. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardly ideal conditions to be raising borrowing costs. So, the likelihood is that the BoE will sit on its hands at noon today - although some policymakers may well agitate for a hike from 0.5% to 0.75%. As this chart shows, in March investors thought a hike today was a near-certainty. Now, it would be a serious shock. Carney should prepare himself for a bruising interrogation from the economics press when he explains today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision, at 12.30pm. Bart Hordijk, market analyst at Monex Europe, says some might argue that Carney has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made a mess of things\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by preparing us all for higher interest rates. \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdSome might say Bank of England Governor Mark Carney made a mess of things again. As late as February he was still very positive on monetary policy. But dismal retail sales, disappointing GDP growth and the accelerating softening of inflation have burst Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bubble. Since Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credibility is obviously at stake again the question for the BoE rate decision then becomes: will Mark Carney pull off a Houdini worthy escape act, or will markets once again call him out as an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a rate hike tomorrow and we even envision the economic growth expectations to be lowered for the rest of the year. Also coming up... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a busy day for corporate news. Overnight, Royal Bank of Scotland finally reached a settlement with the US Department of Justice over the misselling of mortgages in the run-up to the financial crisis. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s paying a $4.9bn fine - in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153milestone moment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long, slow recovery. The other big shock is that BT is cutting 13,000 jobs, and planning to exit its London headquarters, as part of a strategic shake-up. More on that shortly Next, the retailer, has better news; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s raised its profit forecast after reporting better than expected sales in recent weeks, as the warmer weather lured shoppers into buying new outfits. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9.30am BST: UK trade balance for March Noon BST: Bank of England interest rate decision 12.30m: Press conference on the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarterly inflation report",

The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index is up just 0.3%, perhaps because of the dip in the oil price. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A dominant dollar helped lead to a seriously down in the dumps Dow Jones this Tuesday, while the FTSE lost its lunchtime momentum.</p> <p>Though not quite as strong as analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 were expecting, the latest US retail sales figures were solid enough to give the dollar a hefty hawkish boost. The greenback was propelled 0.7% higher against the pound, with cable nearing sub-$1.348 2018 lows, while against the euro it was up 0.8%, forcing the single currency under $1.185.</p> <p>This, combined with the USA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambassador to China Terry Branstad stating that the two countries were still \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery far apart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the issue of trade, caused the Dow Jones to have an absolutely miserable time of it after the bell. The index plunged nearly 200 points as the session got underway, trudging back towards 24700 having almost grazed a 2 month high of 25000 on Monday.</p> <p>Normally the sight of a cable-collapse would be like catnip for the FTSE. And yes, the UK index did manage to climb 25 or so points as the day went on. However, that the FTSE can perhaps feel aggrieved that it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wring more juice from sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide.</p> <p>Beyond the bearishness plaguing the Dow Jones, the fact Brent Crude has pulled back from its $79 per barrel is potentially responsible for the index not fully taking flight; but even then, BP and Shell are still up around 1.5% apiece, showing investors are still willing to drink down the oil colossi even if the black stuff is off its 3 and a half year peak. Investors may simply have slight reservations about sending the FTSE much higher than it currently is, given that it the index didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last long at its 7800-teasing peak back in mid-January. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5afaea22e4b03387f9ceea0d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-15T14:15:30.247Z\">3.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The strengthening dollar after the retail sales figures has taken some of the shine off the oil price, with Brent crude now in negative territory for the day, down 0.17% at $78.10 a barrel.</p> <p>At its peak during the day, Brent hit $79.47, which analysts saying $80 or even $100 could be on the horizon.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5afae474e4b03387f9cee9b8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-15T13:48:29.606Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the UK employment figures and the fall in EU workers, and the Press Association has more details:</p> <blockquote> <p>Labour market data released by the Office for National Statistics showed the fall [in the number of EU nationals] was driven by a steep drop in the number of workers from the eight eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004.</p> <p>In the latest period, there were an estimated 917,000 nationals of the so-called EUA8 countries - Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia - in work in the UK.</p> <p>This was down by 91,000 compared to January-March in 2017, the largest annual decrease since comparable records started in 1997.</p> <p>Jonathan Portes, professor of Economics at King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s College London, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market statistics show a year-on-year fall in the number of European nationals working here, for the first time since the aftermath of the recession. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153A combination of factors - a slowing economy here combined with recovery on the continent, but also the political and psychological impact of the Brexit vote - have made the UK a significantly less attractive place to live and work.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> <p>Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, pointed to figures for EU-born workers, which he said were 155,000 higher than in the same quarter before the referendum.

Despite that, the number of A8 migrants working in the UK has declined.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153These figures are consistent with the possibility that there has been net emigration of A8 citizens but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show it conclusively - we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need a few more months of data to see whether this is a short-term blip or a real trend.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We do know from other migration figures that over the last couple of years, net migration from A8 countries has fallen proportionally more than it has from the other parts of the EU....\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> <p>The year-on-year dip in EUA8 workers was not mirrored across other groups of member states. There were 355,000 Romanians and Bulgarians employed in the UK between January and March, up from an estimated 297,000 in the first three months of last year. </p> <p>It is the second highest figure recorded since restrictions on citizens of the two countries working in Britain were lifted in January 2014.</p> <p>The number of nationals of 14 long-term EU member states including Germany, Italy, Spain and France also showed a slight increase - but remained at just over one million. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5afae174e4b0a1ff4199deaf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-15T13:37:17.868Z\">2.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street slips on new trade worries</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/13/trump-xi-jinping-jobs-chinese-company-zte-us-ban\">surprise move to support Chinese group ZTE</a> over the weekend prompted hopes of progress in trade talks between the US and China.

Importantly, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153control\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd group, which excludes very volatile items such as food, autos, building materials and gasoline and supposedly better matches consumer spending within GDP, was up 0.4% after a 0.5% gain in March. February was revised up a tenth of a percentage point too.</p> <p>Retail sales have been difficult to interpret for much of the past year. In particular, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma caused extensive damage that triggered a wave of spending as households replaced lost items in Sep-Nov 2017. In fact retail sales soared a cumulative 3.5% during the period only to fall back in Dec, Jan and Feb (although Feb has now been revised up to being flat).</p> <p>Now that these distortions are out the way we expect upcoming data to show households continuing to spend strongly. Employment is rising, wages are growing and tax cuts means there is more cash in people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pockets. With consumer confidence at strong levels, consumer spending growth is a key factor behind our above consensus 3% GDP growth forecast for the US this year. In turn, this leads us to look for a further three Federal Reserve rate rises in 2018.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-05-15T13:22:44.972Z\">at 2.22pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5afad46be4b02d1f3350fcb6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-15T13:01:39.051Z\">2.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Brent crude hits $79 per barrel</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec7e4f26e50ac11ff08989af43f7ce3b7eccffba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec7e4f26e50ac11ff08989af43f7ce3b7eccffba/0_196_3002_1802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oil platforms under maintenance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oil platforms under maintenance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marius Dobilas/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Over in the financial markets, the oil price has hit a new three and a half-year high.</strong></p> <p>Brent crude is changing hands at $79.30 per barrel, the highest since late 2014.</p> <p>Prices have been rising since America pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal last week - a move likely to take some Iranian oil production off the market.</p> <p>Crude prices have jumped by 75% since June 2017, which has led to higher transport costs and petrol price at the pumps.

                "bodyText":"Markets were struggling for direction for most of the day, with the exception of Wall Street which moved sharply lower on renewed worries about the US/China trade talks, a rising dollar and falling bond yields. Several European markets suffered from a spate of profit taking, while the volatility of Brent crude - surging to new three and a half year highs, falling back then moving up once more - did little to help the FTSE 100. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up just 12 points or 0.16% at 7722.98 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.06% to 12,970.04 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.23% at 5553.16 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB edged up 0.31% to 24,297.17 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.49% at 10,207.6 In Greece, the Athens market fell 2.04% to 799.37 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 210 points or 0.84%. As for Brent crude, it is up 0.63% at $78.72 a barrel, having earlier touched $79.47. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 246 points. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Equity benchmarks are in the red as traders become more hawkish. The jump in US government bond yields is prompting traders to switch out of stocks and into bonds. US indices have reached multi-week highs recently on optimism about the US and China coming to a trade deal, and today investors are banking their profits. With Wall Street down as the dollar rises, the FTSE 100 is not benefiting as much as might be expected from the weak pound. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index is up just 0.3%, perhaps because of the dip in the oil price. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: A dominant dollar helped lead to a seriously down in the dumps Dow Jones this Tuesday, while the FTSE lost its lunchtime momentum. Though not quite as strong as analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 were expecting, the latest US retail sales figures were solid enough to give the dollar a hefty hawkish boost. The greenback was propelled 0.7% higher against the pound, with cable nearing sub-$1.348 2018 lows, while against the euro it was up 0.8%, forcing the single currency under $1.185. This, combined with the USA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambassador to China Terry Branstad stating that the two countries were still \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery far apart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the issue of trade, caused the Dow Jones to have an absolutely miserable time of it after the bell. The index plunged nearly 200 points as the session got underway, trudging back towards 24700 having almost grazed a 2 month high of 25000 on Monday. Normally the sight of a cable-collapse would be like catnip for the FTSE. And yes, the UK index did manage to climb 25 or so points as the day went on. However, that the FTSE can perhaps feel aggrieved that it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wring more juice from sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide. Beyond the bearishness plaguing the Dow Jones, the fact Brent Crude has pulled back from its $79 per barrel is potentially responsible for the index not fully taking flight; but even then, BP and Shell are still up around 1.5% apiece, showing investors are still willing to drink down the oil colossi even if the black stuff is off its 3 and a half year peak. Investors may simply have slight reservations about sending the FTSE much higher than it currently is, given that it the index didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last long at its 7800-teasing peak back in mid-January. The strengthening dollar after the retail sales figures has taken some of the shine off the oil price, with Brent crude now in negative territory for the day, down 0.17% at $78.10 a barrel. At its peak during the day, Brent hit $79.47, which analysts saying $80 or even $100 could be on the horizon. Back with the UK employment figures and the fall in EU workers, and the Press Association has more details: Labour market data released by the Office for National Statistics showed the fall [in the number of EU nationals] was driven by a steep drop in the number of workers from the eight eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004. In the latest period, there were an estimated 917,000 nationals of the so-called EUA8 countries - Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia - in work in the UK. This was down by 91,000 compared to January-March in 2017, the largest annual decrease since comparable records started in 1997. Jonathan Portes, professor of Economics at King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s College London, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market statistics show a year-on-year fall in the number of European nationals working here, for the first time since the aftermath of the recession. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A combination of factors - a slowing economy here combined with recovery on the continent, but also the political and psychological impact of the Brexit vote - have made the UK a significantly less attractive place to live and work.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, pointed to figures for EU-born workers, which he said were 155,000 higher than in the same quarter before the referendum. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These new labour force figures dispose of any claim of a Brexodus.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The employment rate of A8 migrants in the UK is close to record highs, at more than 85%. Despite that, the number of A8 migrants working in the UK has declined. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These figures are consistent with the possibility that there has been net emigration of A8 citizens but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show it conclusively - we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need a few more months of data to see whether this is a short-term blip or a real trend. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We do know from other migration figures that over the last couple of years, net migration from A8 countries has fallen proportionally more than it has from the other parts of the EU....\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The year-on-year dip in EUA8 workers was not mirrored across other groups of member states. There were 355,000 Romanians and Bulgarians employed in the UK between January and March, up from an estimated 297,000 in the first three months of last year. It is the second highest figure recorded since restrictions on citizens of the two countries working in Britain were lifted in January 2014. The number of nationals of 14 long-term EU member states including Germany, Italy, Spain and France also showed a slight increase - but remained at just over one million. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise move to support Chinese group ZTE over the weekend prompted hopes of progress in trade talks between the US and China. But ahead of new meetings in Washington, US ambassador to China Terry Branstad has said the two sides were still \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very far apart,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd prompting an opening fall on US stock markets. So despite the reasonable US retail sales figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 151 points or 0.59% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.42% lower and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.67%. The retail sales figures have lifted expectations of a series of US rate rises this year, and helped push the dollar higher. Sterling has slipped to a new low for the year of $1.3457, down 0.7%. A US spending boom could be getting underway, says Nordsea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief analyst: US retail sales edged up in April with signs of wage growth and the recent tax cuts helping to offset some of the pressure on consumer spending from higher petrol prices. Sales grew by 0.3% last month, in line with expectations, but the March figure was revised up to show a 0.8% surge compared to the initial estimate of a 0.6% rise. Core retail sales, excluding cars, petrol, building materials and food services, climbed by 0.4% in April. Year on year, sales rose 4.7%. Economist James Knightley at ING Bank said: US retail sales have been heavily distorted over the past 6-9 month, but we are finally getting some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cleaner\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd data that suggests households are in good spirits and are spending in the new season. US retail sales rose 0.3%MoM in April, which was in line with expectations, but there were some nice upward revisions to March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data from 0.6% growth to 0.8% growth. Importantly, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153control\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd group, which excludes very volatile items such as food, autos, building materials and gasoline and supposedly better matches consumer spending within GDP, was up 0.4% after a 0.5% gain in March. February was revised up a tenth of a percentage point too. Retail sales have been difficult to interpret for much of the past year. In particular, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma caused extensive damage that triggered a wave of spending as households replaced lost items in Sep-Nov 2017. In fact retail sales soared a cumulative 3.5% during the period only to fall back in Dec, Jan and Feb (although Feb has now been revised up to being flat). Now that these distortions are out the way we expect upcoming data to show households continuing to spend strongly. Employment is rising, wages are growing and tax cuts means there is more cash in people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pockets. With consumer confidence at strong levels, consumer spending growth is a key factor behind our above consensus 3% GDP growth forecast for the US this year. In turn, this leads us to look for a further three Federal Reserve rate rises in 2018. Over in the financial markets, the oil price has hit a new three and a half-year high. Brent crude is changing hands at $79.30 per barrel, the highest since late 2014. Prices have been rising since America pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal last week - a move likely to take some Iranian oil production off the market. Crude prices have jumped by 75% since June 2017, which has led to higher transport costs and petrol price at the pumps. That in turn pushed up inflation, and is one reason why real wages in the UK had been shrinking (although not any more) The drop in the number of EU workers in Britain could also be a warning sign for UK firms. The UK labour market certainly looks tight, with inactivity and employment both at record highs - and employers facing 806,000 vacancies in the last quarter. Gerwyn Davies of CIPD, the professional body for HR and people development, says bosses may find it harder to recruit staff: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Employers need to be better prepared for a changing and tighter labour market. Labour supply looks set to fall further in the coming months, partly due to an abrupt plateauing in the number of EU citizens in employment in the UK, as this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures show. Greater investment in skills is needed to offset recruitment difficulties and increase productivity growth alongside more workforce planning activity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hospitals and social services could be hurt by the 28,000 decline in EU workers in Britain over the last 12 months. So warns Dr Heather Rolfe of The National Institute Of Economic and Social Research. She explains: This represents a reduction in arrivals and increase in departures of EU citizens, which employers explain by uncertain futures and hostility. The reverse trend is shown by non-EU nationals in employment who increased in number by 20,000. This may be explained in part by employers making more use of the visa system when faced with skills shortages.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These trends, in particular the fall in EU nationals working in the UK, are likely to affect the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic performance and also services, with the NHS and social care under particular pressure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. According to FullFact, EU immigrants make up about 5% of English NHS staff, and 10% of all doctors. The Resolution Foundation have sent over some useful charts, showing the state of the labour market: Stephen Clarke, Senior Economic Analyst at the Resolution Foundation, sums up the picture: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Britain started 2018 as it has spent much of the last decade, with more impressive jobs growth but little prospect of recovering from its disastrous record on pay. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Employment has hit a record high, driven by male employment breaking the 80 per cent barrier for the first time in nearly three decades. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the return to pay growth is very welcome it remains anemic and wages are still over \u00c2\u00a3700 a year lower than they were a decade ago. The stark fall in productivity in recent months suggests that a strong pay recovery remain some way off.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister has welcomed the news that wages are outpacing inflation. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Growth in real wages means that people are starting to feel the benefit of more money in their pockets; another turning point as we build a stronger, fairer economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can be proud of our record on jobs. The unemployment rate is at its lowest in over 40 years and with our National Living Wage we are making sure that the lowest-paid feel the benefit with an extra \u00c2\u00a32,000 a year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now the focus has to be on ensuring that wages keep rising faster than inflation, so that living standards increase.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I suspect that final sentence could be a coded warning about Brexit. Hammond will attend a crunch meeting of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit sub committee this afternoon to discuss customs arrangements, where there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of agreement. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ministers are split over two options -- a customs partnership, where the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU, or a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153max fac\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd model, which would use technology to police the border. My colleague Andy Sparrow will be tracking all the action in his Politics Live blog: Panmure Gordon analyst Simon French suspects Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market may be peaking - chiming with the IoD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning earlier. Nearly two years after the Brexit vote, we can now see that the number of citizens from other European Union countries working in Britain has fallen. The ONS reports that the total EU workforce in Britain fell by 28,000 over the last year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first annual decrease since January to March 2010, when the UK has fallen into recession after the financial crisis. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report: There were 28.73 million UK nationals working in the UK, 417,000 more than for a year earlier. There were 2.29 million EU nationals working in the UK, 28,000 fewer than for a year earlier. There were 1.25 million non-EU nationals working in the UK, 20,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 years who were in work) was 81.9% for EU nationals, higher than that for UK nationals (75.6%) and higher than that for non-EU nationals (63.0%) There was a sharp fall in the number of workers from Eastern European countries who joined the EU in 2004. The Press Association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ian Jones has the details: The proportion of UK men in work has hit 80% for the first time since 1991 - despite fears that robots will eliminate millions of jobs: The Institute of Directors fears that companies are now struggling to find properly skilled and qualified workers. Seamus Nevin, the IoD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of policy research says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yet again we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen great employment figures as the number of people in work increased and the number of people without work decreased. All of this suggests, however, that access to staff may be peaking as the labour market tightens. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Employers are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit the people they need. Given access to skills is currently one of the highest concerns for IoD members, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures also highlight the imperative for government to reform the Tier 2 visa cap to allow employers to recruit the overseas workers they need to grow in the short term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Disappointingly, UK productivity is falling again. Productivity (broadly, how much we each produced) shrank by 0.5% in the first three months of 2018, the ONS says. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate slowed in the last quarter (to a measly 0.1%), even though companies created more jobs - meaning the amount of hours worked in the economy rose by 0.6%. Ergo, we were less productive: John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says the UK economy is a mixed picture -- job creation remains strong, but productivity is a mess. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The great British job-creating machine kicked back into life in the first quarter of 2018, taking the employment rate to a new record high. Unemployment edged down further and regular pay growth continued to edge up as the labour market has tightened. Real pay growth, excluding bonuses, is now firmly back into positive territory. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All of this good news stands in marked contrast to the subdued GDP growth of just 0.1% estimated for the first quarter. This estimate could be revised up later but, taken at face value, it suggests that productivity growth turned significantly negative again after a couple of quarters when it seemed to be perking up. Geraint Johnes, professor of economics at Lancaster University Management School, is disappointed that total pay growth (including bonuses) slowed to 2.6% from 2.8% a month ago. Professor Johnes, who is also research director at the Work Foundation, says this shows some weakness in the labour market: This is a disappointing result, in that it represents a fall from the 2.8% figure achieved in February, and it means that we have to wait still longer for real wages to recover. The single month measure shows a year-on-year growth of just 2.3%. This continued flatness in wages provides justification for the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision not to raise interest rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite the buoyancy of the employment figures, the recovery in the labour market is quite simply not there, and rising wages clearly present no threat in terms of inflation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This chart, from Fidelity International, shows how Britain is emerging from its second pay squeeze in a decade: Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity, say: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153British workers are feeling marginally better off after wages grew in real terms for the second month on a trot.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Economists are welcoming the news that basic pay in Britain is accelerating. It could even spur the Bank of England into raising interest rates by August - although, after policymakers left rates on hold last week, who knows for sure? The percentage of people in Britain classed as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceconomically inactive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has fallen to just 21%, its lowest level since records began 45 years ago. That means that more people are either in work, or looking for a job. The ONS says: There were 8.66 million people aged from 16 to 64 years who were economically inactive (not working and not seeking or available to work), 115,000 fewer than for October to December 2017 and 171,000 fewer than for a year earlier. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report also shows that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living squeeze is easing. Basic pay (excluding bonuses) rose by 2.9% in the first quarter of 2018, up from 2.8% a month ago. That means that wages are rising faster than inflation (which fell to 2.5% in March). So real basic pay (adjusted for inflation) is now growing at around 0.4%, after shrinking over recent months. However, total pay (including bonuses) only grew by 2.6% during the quarter (again, down from 2.8%). But before anyone celebrates, lets not forget that Britons are basically poorer than before the financial crisis. The Office for National Statistics says: average regular pay (excluding bonuses) for employees in Great Britain was \u00c2\u00a3460 per week before tax and other deductions from pay, \u00c2\u00a313 lower than the pre-downturn peak of \u00c2\u00a3473 per week recorded for March 2008 average total pay (including bonuses) for employees in Great Britain was \u00c2\u00a3489 per week before tax and other deductions from pay, \u00c2\u00a333 lower than the pre-downturn peak of \u00c2\u00a3522 per week recorded for February 2008 Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate remained at 4.2% in the first three months of 2018. The latest Labour Force statistics, just released, show that unemployment is at its joint lowest level since 1975. The report also shows that the employment rate is at a record high (the data goes back to Ted Heath\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reign as prime minister): The Office for National Statistics says: There were 32.34 million people in work, 197,000 more than for October to December 2017 and 396,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 years who were in work) was 75.6%, higher than for a year earlier (74.8%) and the highest since comparable records began in 1971. There were 1.42 million unemployed people (people not in work but seeking and available to work), 46,000 fewer than for October to December 2017 and 116,000 fewer than for a year earlier. More to follow! Bulgaria and Poland have both posted solid growth figures: The German Federal Ministry for Economics Affairs says the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy remains strong, despite growth slowing in recent months. In a statement, it says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Private consumption remains strong. Companies are upbeat on their trade prospects in the light of overall favourable conditions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ministry also suggests that the drop in government spending may be due to the five-month hiatus of negotiations to form Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new coalition. Just: The Netherlands economy has slowed, but not as sharply as Germany. Dutch GDP rose by 0.5% in the first three months of this year, down from 0.7% in October-December 2017. Finland has outperformed Germany, by posting 1.1% growth in the last quarter. This suggests the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most northerly neighbour is shaking off its recent stagnation, despite the slowdown in other countries. Shares in some of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest companies have dipped in early trading. The DAX index has dropped by 0.3%, or 38 points, to 12,939 in Frankfurt, following this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing growth figures. Pharmaceutical giant Merck is the biggest faller (-2.8%), followed by industrial conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (-2.4%, despite reporting higher profits this morning). At just 0.3%, this is Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakest quarterly growth since the third quarter of 2016. ING economist Carsten Brzeski says Germany had a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstumbling start\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 into 2018, for a variety of reasons: Trade and government consumption were a drag on growth. Also, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget that a couple of one-off factors like the cold winter weather, early Easter vacation and strikes probably distorted first quarter data. Brzeski says we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic - he thinks that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy still has underlying strength, including its manufacturing base: Despite some minor leveling off, capacity utilisation is still close to record highs, assured production in the industry is close to all-time highs and the high stock of orders and historically low inventories all bode extremely well for industrial production in the coming months. So this growth slowdown is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no more than a black eye\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Brzeski concludes. The news that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate halved in the last quarter is causing a stir. Economist Ulrik Bie blames the drop in exports by German firms: Tom Barfield of the AFP newswire says it will raise fears about the health of the European economy: Pantheon Macroeconomics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Claus Vistesen believes the eurozone will tick along at a more steady rate this year: Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics warns that Germany has lost momentum, and may struggle to bounce back in the coming months. Newsflash: Germany has suffered a growth slowdown after being hit by weak trade. The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy expanded by just 0.3% in the first three months of this year, official figures show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sharp slowdown compared to Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.6% in the final quarter of 2017. It is also below the 0.4% which economists had expected. The Federal Statistics Office says: The German economy continued to grow at the beginning of the year, though at a slower pace. The slowdown was triggered by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153less dynamic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd foreign trade, as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153both exports and imports decreased compared with the previous quarter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Government spending also fell, for the firs time in five years, dragging growth back. But capital investment did rise during the quarter, suggesting companies are still investing in equipment and factories. Domestic consumption also made a positive contribution. Although Germany is obviously still growing, these figures do indicate that the eurozone economy has lost some steam in recent months. They also suggests that fears of a trade war, triggered by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on steel and aluminium, are causing worrying ripples in the global economy. Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we get a new healthcheck on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, with a fresh estimate of eurozone GDP for the first three months of this year, plus growth figures from Germany and the Netherlands. Last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data showed the eurozone economy grew by 0.4% - investors will be concerned if this is revised downwards today. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market is also in focus. The latest unemployment figures are expected to show the jobless rate remains at just 4.2%, its lowest level in over 40 years. But will there be any progress on wages? Economists predict that basic pay growth rose to 2.9% in the first three months of this year - up from 2.8%. A strong reading might give the pound a lift, and reignite speculation that interest rates might rise in August. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Given that inflation in March was 2.5%, wages growth of 2.9% or higher would be an encouraging sign that domestic inflation will slowly start to pick up, potentially reviving the possibility of a Bank of England rate rise later in the year and pushing sterling back towards $1.37. Traders will also be tracking events in Italy, where talks to form a new government are still continuing.

Maintaining stated contract margins in the face of evidence that showed they were optimistic, and accounting for revenue for work that not even been agreed, enabled it to maintain apparently healthy revenue flows.</p> <p>It used its early payment facility for suppliers as a credit card, but did not account for it as borrowing. The only cash supporting its profits was that banked by denying money to suppliers. Whether or not all this was within the letter of accountancy law, it was intended to deceive lenders and investors. It was also entirely unsustainable: eventually, Carillion would need to get the cash in.</p> </blockquote> <p>The report sweeps aside Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that it was a victim of bad luck, and delays to some major contracts.

                "bodyText":"A number of European markets managed to edge higher by the close, but a notable exception was Italy. The FTSE MIB fell sharply after reports the planned coalition government wanted the ECB to write off \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250bn worth of debt, a move which in the unlikely event it happened, would send ructions through the eurozone. Elsewhere Wall Street benefited from a positive update from retailer Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, despite concerns about the renewed war of words between the US and North Korea. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 closed up 11.22 points or 0.15% at 7734.20 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.2% to 12,996.33 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.26% at 5567.54 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 2.32% to 23,734.22 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.95% at 10,111.0 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.43% to 787.90 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 60 points or 0.25%. Brent crude has managed to shake off its losses and is now up 0.05% at $78.47 a barrel. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. More on Carillion from Rachel Reeves MP, chair of the business committee: Back with Ben Broadbent and his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153poor choice of language\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd earlier, and here is a Guardian Pass notes for him to enjoy: Italy could cast a dark cloud over markets, says Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG: Italy should give investors pause for breath, although at present it is not quite having any real impact, since the likely coalition government seems set on upending the existing eurozone order. How far they plan to go remains a question that is yet to be solved, but it brings back uncomfortable memories of the eurozone crises of years past. Then, it was always said that the single currency union could survive the departure of Greece or Portugal, but that Italy would be the proverbial straw that broke the camel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back. Italian assets are diverging from their eurozone brethren today, but if things get worse and these plans move closer to reality then we can expect the contagion to spread. Oil prices have recovered from their worst levels of the day after a bigger than expected fall in US crude stocks. They dropped by 1.4m barrels last week compared to a forecast of a 0.8m barrel dip. Petrol demand over the past four weeks was up 0.7% compared to a year ago. Oil prices had fallen back before the news, with some profit-taking after their recent rises following Donald Trump pulling the US out of the nuclear deal with Iran, which potentially curtails supplies from that country. But the bigger than expected demand for crude last week has seen Brent, which hit a low of $77.61 a barrel today, recover to be virtually flat at $78.42. More on Italy, and it seems there may not be a move to ask the ECB to cancel \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250bn in Italian bonds: But, the Economist Intelligence Unit says: US markets have managed to open marginally higher as a rise in retail shares (including Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s after a forecast beating update) was offset by falls in energy shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 16 points or 0.07% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite opened around the same amount higher. Earlier came news that US industrial output rose by 0.7% in April, while the March figure was revised upwards. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank, said: Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales figures showed a strong consumer sector and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IP numbers further boost hopes of a strong bounce in 2Q economic activity. US industrial production rose 0.7%MoM in April, a touch above the 0.6% market prediction while growth in March was revised up from 0.5%MoM to 0.7%. There was good news in all the components with manufacturing seeing output rise 0.5% while utilities rose 1.9% and mining was up 1.1% The growth in mining reflects the rapid rise in oil and gas rig counts in response to higher prices. With oil not far from $80/bbl and US production efficiency continuing to improve this component will continue making positive contributions to overall US economic activity. Meanwhile manufacturing looks in great shape with the ISM and durable goods reports suggesting order books are very healthy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c note output would have been up 0.6% were it not for auto weakness. Utilities is a bit of a surprise given output had already been really strong because of a particularly wintery start to the year, driving heating demand. We suspect this component will weaken in coming months. Overall the report suggests the industrial sector is buoyant shape. Nonetheless, if it hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been for the oil and gas revolution the story wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be quite as rosy. Manufacturing output is still more than 5 percent down on the peak of November 2007, which means President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is unlikely to reverse course on his claims of unfair foreign competition anytime soon. The UK Treasury is pumping an extra \u00c2\u00a34m into the Office for National Statistics - which has been under fire in recent years for the quality of its data - to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153capture what is happening in the modern economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It brings investment in the ONS to \u00c2\u00a316m so far, and will allow it to improve its measurement of inflation, the labour market and the service sector, as well as setting up new PhDs and apprenticeships. After a series of errors and criticisms of the standard of statistics, the government asked Sir Charles Bean to review the quality of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic data. The new funding is part of the response to Bean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s review, although errors continue to be made including a miscalculation towards the end of last year of the growth in unit labour costs. Meanwhile the continuing political uncertainty in Italy has sent the euro lower and the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market down 2%. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said: Reports that the Five Star Movement and the League, which are in talks to form a coalition government, are considering a debt relief from ECB to the tune of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250 billion has stoked fears over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditworthiness. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB has fallen sharply as a result, as too has the euro, and despite an otherwise bullish day for European stocks. Back to the news that the East Coast mainline will be temporarily nationalised after co-owners Virgin and Stagecoach could no longer meet promised payments. Analyst Joe Spooner at Jefferies says: Reversion of East Coast to government operation will no doubt spark a cycle of press commentary about rail nationalisation and the political climate will no doubt fuel a public debate. The more sober reality, we think, is that East Coast was a contract that commercially failed (it was [with hindsight] overbid for - but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s different to operational failure), Stagecoach has paid the price for that (funded its c.\u00c2\u00a3180m share of the contingent liabilities) and failure has to be an accepted risk if contracts are to be bid for. The template of allowing the financial consequences of failing franchises to unfold has been reaffirmed for any other that gets into trouble (we retain concerns for the strong growth assumptions with which both TPE and SWR were won at FirstGroup). The political conversation that follows may once again also shape the profile of future franchises put out to tender. Here is our full report on the move: The CBI have accused the MPs who drew up the Carillion report of going over the top. Josh Hardie, CBI deputy director-general, claims the language in the report creates the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wholly inaccurate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd impression that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s businesses are all greedy and reckless. Hardie argues that the other apples in the outsourcing barrel aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rotten too. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Carillion was a painful lesson for business and government on the dangers of short-termism in public service contracts. This failure should act as a catalyst for a level-headed discussion about how the public and private sectors work together to deliver value to society, as they so often do. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153200,000 organisations play a vital role in delivering public services, providing much-needed innovation and investment - whether through building new classrooms or transforming frontline public services - often in very challenging circumstances. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Knee-jerk soundbites on Carillon risk locking out innovation and investment at a time when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needed most.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that the report doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pull any punches, with Frank Field MP accusing Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s directors of stuffing their mouths with gold rather than running the company properly. Getting back to Carillion...... smaller construction firms are welcoming today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parliamentary report into the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse. The Specialist Engineering Contractors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (SEC) group, which represents engineering groups, says Carillion was not along in abusing its suppliers. The SEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, professor Rudi Klein, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unfortunately Carillion is not alone. Payment and contractual abuse is rife in the construction industry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd SEC Group have drawn up a four-point plan to protect small suppliers, and prevent another Carillion: All public sector projects should use project bank accounts so that everybody is paid within short timescales from the same \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Public Contracts Regulations 2015 should be amended to mandate 30 day payments on all public sector contracts and sub-contracts. Suppliers failing to pay within these timescales must be excluded from public sector works. Retention monies should be ring-fenced in a protected scheme. The Small Business Commissioner should have the power to fine large companies for poor treatment of their supply chains. Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, agrees that Ben Broadbent has blown his chance of succeeding Mark Carney: The chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job of choosing the next governor of the Bank of England just got slightly easier. A basic requirement of being the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior central banker is an ability to avoid making crassly sexist remarks. Ben Broadbent, one of four deputy governors and thus an internal candidate for the big job, has just failed the test after describing the UK economy as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153menopausal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More here: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to the news that the Conservative government is bucking its traditional opposition to nationalisation..... Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s East Coast main line, which run between London and Edinburgh, is being nationalised again. The government has decided to terminate the existing East Coast rail franchise operated by Stagecoach and Virgin Trains, and take it back into public control. The government is announcing it now, but Stagecoach have already jumped the gun by issuing a statement to the City. Ben Broadbent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments may cloud his future at the Bank of England, says Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jill Ward. She writes: Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent was forced to apologize after describing the U.K. economy as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153menopausal,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd putting the central bank in a new communications controversy. The remarks in an interview with the Daily Telegraph sparked complaints about sexism and ageism. The timing was particularly unfortunate for the BOE, coming two days after Governor Mark Carney hosted a conference on diversity in central banking. They follow a slew of criticism over the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s messaging on monetary policy, which dominated Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest-rate press conference last week. Lauren Chiren, a menopausal coach, has written to Ben Broadbent - explaining why describing the UK economy as menopausal is a problem. Chiren says: This is another example of gender power and ignorance, and placing blame on women for something that they have no control over. It is appalling, that in 2018, women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s issues are still being used as metaphors, and scapegoats, to avoid actually addressing the underlying issues that are really causing slumps in the economy. She has also invited Broadbent to a coaching session, to learn more about menopause, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the power and wisdom\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that menopausal women provide in the workplace and beyond. Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the CEO of Virgin Money who led a government review into gender equality in the financial sector, offer some personal insight into the issue: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When I read this I thought about my own menopause and was sure he meant that the future is hard work, challenging, renewing, worth fighting for, 100% positive and constantly HOT!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Several politicians have also tweeted their criticism of deputy governor Ben Broadbent, which rather confirms that he may have sunk his chances of rising to the governorship. Clare Perry, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minister for Energy and Clean Growth, says the menopausal comment was out of order: [andropausal is associated with a drop in testosterone] Hear hear, say fellow Conservative MP Rachel Maclean, and Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Diana Johnson. A former Bank of England policymaker, Dame Kate Barker, also believes Ben Broadbent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments are out of line. Barker served on the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee from 2001 to 2010. Although Broadbent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apology was swift, it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stopped the backlash. Fran Boait of the Positive Money campaign group isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s classics professor Barbara Graziosi: The head of the CBI, Carolyn Fairbairn, has also criticised Ben Broadbent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments. Fairbairn says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This poor choice of words is very disappointing and distracts from the real issue at hand. Productivity has been the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Achilles heel for far too long. Our priority should be tackling the low productivity that can lead to higher regional inequality. Solving this will help build a stronger economy that raises living standards and wages for everyone.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Broadbent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gaffe has reduced his chances of succeeding Mark Carney at the top of the Bank of England, says the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Giles: Carney is due to leave the BoE next summer, so the formal search for his successor will begin soon. Describing the UK economy as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmenopausal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will be a black mark on Broadbent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CV. Giles says: Ben Broadbent undermined his chances of becoming governor of the Bank of England on Wednesday after having to apologise for describing the UK economy as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 menopausal \u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... The embarrassment felt in Threadneedle Street for using gender-loaded language is all the more acute because the bank has been trying to extinguish such terms from daily use within the institution. NEWSFLASH: Ben Broadbent has issued an apology. The deputy governor says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sorry for his \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpoor choice of language\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and regrets the offence caused by describing the UK economy as menopausal. He also insists that he was referring to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclimacteric\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - a biological term that does apply to men and women, and which has been used by economists. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady has criticised Ben Broadbent for comparing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic slowdown to the menopause. She tells us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This kind of language is totally inappropriate. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no need to resort to lazy, sexist comments to describe problems in the economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ben Broadbent, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, is facing heavy criticism this morning after declaring that the UK economy is entering a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153menopausal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd era. Broadbent used the term in an interview with the Daily Telegraph, as he tried to explain how Britain could be experiencing a trough between the digital era and the next big technological breakthrough. Broadbent, who had been seen as a candidate to become governor (before today, anyway...), was trying to compare today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity problems to the Victorian-era lull between the ages of steam and electricity. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: Broadbent said the term applied by economic historians to describe such a slump was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153climacteric\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which he said essentially means \u00e2\u20ac\u0153menopausal, but can apply to both genders. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve passed your productive peak.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd His comments drew criticism on Twitter. Robert Peston, political editor of ITV, tweeted that Broadbent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s language was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sloppy and potentially offensive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Peston isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only one to feel that Broadbent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments are insulting.....particularly as the Bank itself only has one women on its nine-strong monetary policy committee. For example, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Se\u00c3\u00a1n Hand, the deputy pro-vice-chancellor at the University of Warwick Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more critical reaction: The body which governs Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auditors has announced that it is making \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood progress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in its probe into Carillion. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Reporting Council is examining Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial statements and audits over several years, to decide whether any disciplinary action is needed. The FRC say: Given the clear public interest in this matter, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) is providing an update on its investigation into Carillion. The main areas of focus for the investigations of KPMG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s audit of Carillion (2014 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 2017) and of two finance directors Richard Adam and Zafar Khan are: contract accounting; reverse factoring; pensions; goodwill and going concern. Good progress with the investigation is being made by the FRC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team of lawyers and forensic accountants. That will be cold comfort for the 2,000 Carillion workers who have lost their jobs, and the tens of thousands whose pensions will be hit by its collapse. And let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not forget that the FRC is criticised in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parliamentary report, for being too supine. As the MPs put it: Chronically passive, they do not seek to influence corporate decision-making with the realistic threat of intervention. Action is part of their brief. They require cultural change as well. Labour MP Rachel Reeves, who chairs the BEIS committee, is calling for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Big Four accountancy firms to be broken up in the light of the Carillion crisis. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report concludes that the auditors failed to spot Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crippling financial problems because they were too focused on their own fees. KPMG gets special treatment: KMPG was paid \u00c2\u00a329 million to act as Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auditor for 19 years. It did not once qualify its audit opinion, complacently signing off the directors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 increasingly fantastical figures. In failing to exercise professional scepticism towards Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accounting judgements over the course of its tenure as Carilion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auditor, KPMG was complicit in them. More competition would help to clean up the sector, argues Reeves. She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The auditors should also be in the dock for this catastrophic crash. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sorry saga of Carillion is further evidence that the Big Four accountancy firms are prioritising their own profits ahead of good governance at the companies they are supposed to be putting under the microscope. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153KMPG, PwC, Deloitte and EY pocket millions of pounds for their lucrative audit work - even when they fail to warn about corporate disasters like Carillion. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a parasitical relationship which sees the auditors prosper, regardless of what happens to the companies, employees and investors who rely on their scrutiny.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gathered some of the best quotes from the report: Former Carillion finance director Richard Adam isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t best pleased with the MPs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 report. Adam, who was FD between 2007 and 2016, says: Despite retiring over a year before Carillion went into insolvency, I am deeply saddened by the events that have since overtaken the company. The reasons for the collapse are clearly complex, however, I reject the unwarranted conclusions the Committees have reached concerning my role at the company. I have objected to the Committees about quotes that they have misattributed to me. I look forward to contributing to the due process and conclusion of the various investigations that are still ongoing.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Adam is referring to board minutes showing that Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension trustees thought that he saw pension payments as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153waste of money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd . Adam says there is no evidence he actually thought this. You can read the full report here. The MPs are especially critical of three top directors who steered Carillion towards its demise. As the report puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The problems that caused the collapse of Carillion were long in the making, as too was the rotten corporate culture that allowed them to occur\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Former chairman Philip Green, CEO Richard Howson and finance director Richard Adam get particular treatment. Richard Adam was Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Finance Director for 10 years. He was the architect of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aggressive accounting policies and resolutely refused to make adequate contributions to the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension schemes, which he considered a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153waste of money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. His voluntary departure at the end of 2016 and subsequent sale of all his shares were the actions of a man who knew where the company was heading. Richard Howson, Chief Executive from 2012 to 2017, was the figurehead for a business that careered progressively out of control under his misguidedly self-assured leadership. Philip Green joined the board in 2011 and became Chairman in 2014. He was an unquestioning optimist when his role was to challenge. Remarkably, to the end he thought he was the man to head a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new leadership team\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Four months after UK outsourcing group Carillion spectacularly collapsed, the people behind its demise are being held to account. A truly damning parliamentary report released today has concluded that recklessness, hubris, greed and incompetence contributed to the demise of the company, which ran major construction projects and operated public services including school meals and cleaning. It shows that accounting tricks and a relentless squeeze on contractors also helped Carillion to disguise its financial position - until it blew up in January with a \u00c2\u00a32.6bn pension black hole, and \u00c2\u00a32bn of debts. The report says: Carillion used aggressive accounting policies to present a rosy picture to the markets. Maintaining stated contract margins in the face of evidence that showed they were optimistic, and accounting for revenue for work that not even been agreed, enabled it to maintain apparently healthy revenue flows. It used its early payment facility for suppliers as a credit card, but did not account for it as borrowing. The only cash supporting its profits was that banked by denying money to suppliers. Whether or not all this was within the letter of accountancy law, it was intended to deceive lenders and investors. It was also entirely unsustainable: eventually, Carillion would need to get the cash in. The report sweeps aside Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that it was a victim of bad luck, and delays to some major contracts. Instead, it labels the company as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a giant and unsustainable corporate time bomb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: My colleague Rob Davies explains: A damning 100-page report compiled by two select committees, published today, found that directors prioritised senior executive bonus payouts and dividends for shareholders even as the firm neared collapse, while treating pension payments as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153waste of money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Frank Field, who chairs the work and pension committee, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Same old story. Same old greed. A board of directors too busy stuffing their mouths with gold to show any concern for the welfare of their workforce or their pensioners.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Almost nobody emerges from this report with any credit. The directors come out of it particularly badly. The report is pockmarked with heavy criticism - they are accused of being \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnegligent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc delusional\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and reckless in their running of the company. The MPs say Carillion unacceptably used its own suppliers to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prop up their failing business model\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while top bosses banked large salaries which will cushion them from the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse. Unlike the rest of the company, who face reduced pensions thanks to the \u00c2\u00a32.6bn pension black hole left behind. MPs want the Insolvency Service to give serious consideration to disqualifying them. Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board are blamed for allowing a rotten corporate culture to develop, and for not challenging management as debts rose. Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auditors, KPMG, are also in the dock for a string of failures. They failed spotting the problems at Carillion, and have an unheathily close relationship with their customers, the MPs say. The regulators are accused of timidity, and a passive mindset that means they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get involved until too late. MPs also point the finger at themselves - well, successive governments, anyway, who have demanded cheap services from outsourcers, not quality. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one exception: finance director Emma Mercer is credited with speaking the truth and challenging the status quo as she uncovered Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s practices in 2017. They say: Emma Mercer is the only Carillion director to emerge from the collapse with any credit. She demonstrated a willingness to speak the truth and challenge the status quo, fundamental qualities in a director that were not evident in any of her colleagues. Her individual actions should be taken into account by official investigations of the collapse of the company. We hope that her association with Carillion does not unfairly colour her future career. The MP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conclusion is that serious changes are needed, to avoid another UK company - and its customers and staff - suffering Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fate. They say: Carillion was the most spectacular corporate collapse for some time. The price will be high, in jobs, businesses, trust and reputation. Most companies are not run with Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reckless short-termism, and most company directors are far more concerned by the wider consequences of their actions than the Carillion board. But that should not obscure the fact that Carillion became a giant and unsustainable corporate time bomb in a regulatory and legal environment still in existence today. The individuals who failed in their responsibilities, in running Carillion and in challenging, advising or regulating it, were often acting entirely in line with their personal incentives. Carillion could happen again, and soon. Rather than a source of despair, that can be an opportunity. The Government can grasp the initiative with an ambitious and wide-ranging set of reforms that reset our systems of corporate accountability in the long-term public interest. It would have our support in doing so. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be mopping up reaction to the report through the day. Also coming up today: Worries about the global economy are building after Japan suffered its first economic contraction in two years. Japanese GDP shrank at an annualised rate of 0.6% in the last quarter, new figures show, with consumer spending and business investment both down. It ends Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longest expansion since the 1980s. More on that shortly... Investors are getting edgy about the prospect of several more US interest rate rises this year. Last night the Dow Jones industrial average shed almost 200 points, as traders worry that the era of easy money is over. In the eurozone, new inflation figures will probably confirm that prices only rose by 1.2% in the last year - below the target. Plus, new US housing and oil inventory statistics might move the markets Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 10am BST: Eurozone consumer price inflation figures for April 1.30pm BST: US housing statistics 3.30pm BST: US weekly oil inventory figures",

                "bodyText":"As the FTSE 100 hit a record closing high amid the oil price rise, other European markets were also in positive territory. On the UK, Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: A stronger dollar, a rising oil price and the postponement of an interest rate rise can all claim some credit for the recent strong showing from the stock market. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 53.77 points or 0.7% at 7787.97 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.91% to 13,114.61 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.98% to 5621.92 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 0.29% to 23,801.99 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 1.04% at 10,216.4 But on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 16 points or 0.07%. And Brent crude continues to hold onto much of its gains, thanks to the threat of reduced supplies from Iran after the US withdrew from the nuclear deal. It is up 1.27% at $80.29 a barrel. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The rise in the oil price has helped push the FTSE 100 to a new closing high. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index has been in fairly positive mood recently, along with other markets, after hopes that the US and China could resolve their trade differences. The continuing strength of the dollar against the pound has also been supporting the market, given the FTSE 100 is packed full of overseas earners which benefit when sterling is weaker. Brent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surge to $80 has given the index its final push to a new record close of 7787.97, up 0.7%. However it is still just below the intra-day record of 7792.56 set on 12 January this year. Meanwhile the FTSE 250 did hit a new peak, helped by the extraordinary jump in Ocado shares. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, also thinks Brent could hit $100 a barrel: Fundamentally the price looks well supported here, OPEC are showing they are in no rush to end production cuts, Venezuela\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil industry is collapsing under its economic and political crisis and US sanctions aimed at Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil industry are kicking in. Whilst US production is a constraint on the price, right now this is overshadowed by the Iran Venezuela shortfall. Could oil go higher? Venezuela\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems are unlikely to be resolved anytime soon and could be exasperated if the Trump aims sanctions at the troubled country following rigged and unfair elections; also if the US can get China to loosen energy ties with Iran, then regardless of increased US shale production, the price could close in on $100. Brent crude is currently up 0.86% at $79.96 a barrel, having earlier risen as high as $80.18. And the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy companies are benefiting from the rise and helping to lift the leading index close to its record high. It is up 0.4% at 7767, around 25 points below its peak. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: It took a while, but the FTSE finally become receptive to Brent Crude\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest rise, lifting the UK index that bit closer to a fresh all-time high.....Though not much has changed with Brent Crude \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is still dancing about the $80 per barrel mark \u00e2\u20ac\u201c comments from Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne that the black stuff could hit $100 in the coming months if oil companies aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given waivers by the US to work in Iran helped boost BP and Shell, in turn lifting the FTSE higher. My colleague Adam Vaughan has been looking at the reasons behind the surge in oil prices: Another voice adding to those suggesting oil has much further to climb. Following news that Total will quit Iran unless it gets a waiver from the US, the boss of the French energy giant has predicted crude at $100 a barrel: Worries about the trade talks between the US and China, along with President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal, continue to unsettle US equity investors. Add to that US bond yields hitting a new seven year high and a disappointing update from Cisco, and Wall Street has opened in negative territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 26 points or 0.1% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slipped by similar amounts at the open. Back with Iran and the US sanctions which have driven up the oil price to above $80 a barrel, and Europe is prepared to defend its businesses from the fallout. Reuters reports: The European Union will stick to the Iran deal and the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaders have mandated their Brussels-based executive to defend the interests of European companies dealing with Tehran from U.S. sanctions if needed, a top EU official said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On the Iran nuclear deal, we agreed unanimously that the EU will stay in the agreement as long as Iran remains fully committed to it. Additionally the Commission was given a green light to be ready to act whenever European interests are affected,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the chairman of a two-day EU leaders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 summit in the Bulgarian capital, Donald Tusk, told a news conference. The head of the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, told the same conference that the EU was ready to start trade liberalisation talks with the United States in some areas if Washington gives permanent exemptions from aluminum and steel tariffs. Over in the US, weekly jobless claims have risen by more than expected. The number of Americans claiming unemployment benefit increased to 222,000 from 211,000 the previous week, higher than the forecast 215,000. But the four week average fell to 213,250 from 216,000, according to the Labor Department, the lowest level for this average since December 13, 1969 when it was 210,750. Elsewhere in the markets, shares in online supermarket retailer Ocado have shot through the roof after it finally landed a major international deal. Ocado has been promising a big overseas tie-up for literally years, and today it delivered thanks to an alliance with US grocer giant Kroger. Kroger will used Ocado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology to upgrade its warehouse operations, automation, logistics and delivery route planning in the US. This should strengthen its hand in the battle against Amazon, as grocers look to automate their systems and use robots to speed up processes and cut costs. Ocado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have rocketed by up to 75% today, as traders bet that this deal is as transformation as Kroger claims. That drove its value up from around \u00c2\u00a33.7bn to \u00c2\u00a36bn, enough to get into the FTSE 100. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a disaster for the hedge funds who have been short-selling Ocado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares, betting that it would fail to achieve international expansion. As Neil Wilson of Markets.com explains, Ocado now seems to have real momentum. Bagging a giant US retailer is a major coup for [Ocado CEO] Tim Steiner and as previously noted, we should see many more deals. Shares are priced for these deals to be coming thick and fast. Peter Kiernan of the Economist Intelligence Unit say\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Total\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (likely) withdrawal from Iran shows that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sanctions could have a serious impact on the Iranian economy. Kiernan explains: The announcement by Total that that it will leave South Pars 11, unless it is granted a waiver from US secondary sanctions, reflects the likelihood that European energy companies with exposure to the American market or financial system will be unwilling to risk US penalties by deciding to participate in Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil and gas sector. Iran will seek alternative sources of investment, such as Chinese companies, to get the funds it requires to develop its energy sector instead, but Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely inability to attract major European companies going forward will be a setback. The Total announcement also gives notice to the difficulties that European policymakers could face in the longer term as they try to keep Iran itself in the nuclear agreement. If investment in Iran does dry up and Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil exports are significantly cut, both due to US pressures, it will make Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in keeping the nuclear deal alive more problematic. China is poised to step in if France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Total does indeed pull out of the Iranian South Pars 11 gas field project (as seems likely). Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, has revealed that state-owned Chinese oil firm CNPC is waiting in the wings, if needed. Zanganeh said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Total has said that if it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get an exemption from the United States to continue its work, it will begin to pull out of the deal. If that happens, the Chinese firm CNPC will replace Total.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Given its strong rally over the last year, analysts are wondering how much higher oil could go. Morgan Stanley have predicted that Brent will trade at $90 per barrel in 2020, thanks to increased demand for diesel (due to new anti-pollution rules on shipping) and jet fuel. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is even more bullish. It estimates that oil could hit $100 per barrel next year, due to supply constrains from Iran (due to sanctions) and Venezuela (where political instability could hit supplies). Francisco Blanch, head of commodities research at BAML, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking into the next 18 months, we expect global oil supply and demand balances to tighten.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US crude oil has also hit its highest level since 2014. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up nearly 1% at over $72 per barrel, mirroring today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise in Brent crude (which is sourced from the North Sea) Rising oil prices are a boost to the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crude producers, but a blow to those countries who are net importers of energy. For them, $80 per barrel oil means higher inflation, and could be bad for growth if consumers have less disposable income to spend once they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve covered their fuel and energy costs. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction: Newsflash: Brent crude has hit $80 per barrel for the first time since November 2014. The news that Total is planning to withdaw from its large Iran gas field deal has pushed prices steadily higher this morning. The price of a barrel of Brent crude has now gained more than 16% since early April, as traders anticipate supply shortages if geopolitical tensions in the Middle East continue to rise. Norbert Ruecker, head of macro and commodity research at Julius Baer, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Supply concerns are top of mind after the U.S. left the Iran nuclear deal. The geopolitical noise and escalation fears are here to stay.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Now this is interesting.... Iranian state TV is reporting that a British consortium called Pergas has signed a deal to develop an oil field in the south of Iran. Associated Press have the details: The agreement is the first between Iran and a key Western ally of the United States since Washington last week announced it will pull out of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and Western powers. Managing Director of Pergas International Consortium Colin Rowley, and Bijan Alipour, managing director of National Iranian South Oil Co., signed a preliminary deed on the partnership in the presence of British Ambassador Rob Macaire in Tehran on Wednesday night. The project, if the agreement turns into a contract, will require more than $1 billion to produce 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day during the next decade in the 55-year old Karanj oil filed. But what about the prospect of US sanctions? Well....Pergas is clear that its focus is on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Eastern Hemisphere\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with projects in the Middle East, South East Asia and Africa. It must feel safe from Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to ban foreign firms from accessing the entire US banking and financial system if they deal with Iran. Total isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t alone! Moller-Maersk, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest shipping firm is also planning to pull out of Iran. Moller-Maersk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, Soren Skou, says it will withdraw because of the threat of sanctions from America on any company which maintains links with the Iranians. Skou told Reuters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the sanctions the Americans are to impose, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do business in Iran if you also have business in the U.S., and we have that on a large scale. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the exact timing details, but I am certain that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also going to shut down (in Iran)\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Skou was speaking after Moller-Maersk reported an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unsatisfactory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd underlying loss of $239m in the last three months. It blamed the rising \u00e2\u20ac\u0153geopolitical risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the threat of a trade war for driving down shipping rates. French president Emmanuel Macron has weighed in, calling on the European Union to protect companies who want to keep trading with Iran. Speaking at an EU summit in Sofia, Bulgaria, Macron said that France backed a proposal for the EC to protect and compensate European companies hit by US sanctions. Called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcblocking sanctions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, they could provide a way for Europe to keep the Iran deal alive. Asked about Total\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to quit Iran, Macron told reporters that multinational companies must make their own decisions - but smaller companies needed protection to keep operating in Iran if they want to. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153International companies with interests in many countries make their own choices according to their own interests. They should continue to have this freedom.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But what is important is that companies and especially medium-sized companies which are perhaps less exposed to other markets, American or others, can make this choice freely.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brent is creeping higher, and has touched $76.62 per barrel. Oil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s push to a new three and a half-year high threatens to keep inflation up, hitting households and eroding real wages: Oil is also getting a lift from new data showing that US inventories fell by 1.4 million barrels last week. That suggests stronger demand for crude stocks - which should push prices higher. Total\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to quit its Iran gas project is significant because it shows that the whole Iranian nuclear deal could unravel. As well as withdrawing from the agreement this month, president Trump declared that companies worldwide must stop doing business with Iran or risk US fines or other punishment. If Total pulls out, other companies will be more reluctant to invest in Iran - a blow to President Hassan Rouhani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hopes of attracting new investment. Rouhani travelled to Davos in 2014 in an attempt to encourage international firms to invest in Iran; he had hope to attract $200bn of energy infrastructure investments by 2021. Sanam Vakil, associate fellow at Chatham House, said Total\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bad sign, adding: The EU can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t compel or really protect the private sector. Bjarne Schieldrop, an oil analyst at SEB, told the Financial Times that it undermines Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to keep the Iran nuclear deal alive: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Total\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s action . . . backs up the idea that no one sees an easy solution here and that there is little expectation of US leniency,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whatever the politicians in Europe are saying, the private companies are just pulling out and folding the cards.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The oil price is heading towards $80 per barrel for the first time since 2014, as Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to impose sanctions on Iran continues to reverberate through the financial markets. French energy giant Total announced it would withdraw from a Iranian gas deal before the end of the year, unless it gets a waiver. In a statement last night, Total explained: Total will not continue the SP11 (South Pars 11) project and will have to unwind all related operations before 4 November 2018, unless Total is granted a specific project waiver by US authorities with the support of the French and European authorities. This looks like a blow to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hopes of keeping its current economic ties with Iran intact, following America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal earlier this month. The SP11 agreement was signed last July, making Total the first major Western energy company to invest in the Islamic Republic since sanctions were lifted in 2016. Now, though, Total is worried that it would be sanctioned by the US authorities if it kept dealing with Iran. The potential penalties from Washington simply look unpalatable. The news sent Brent crude jumping to $79.47, a three and a half-year high. This puts $80 in traders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sights - and leaving motorists facing higher prices at the pumps. Mihir Kapadia, CEO and founder of Sun Global Investments, agrees that geopolitical tensions are driving energy prices higher, with unrest is building in Venezuela ahead of this weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential elections. Kapadia explains: Venezuela\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s situation grows increasingly worrying and the expected drop in production from Iran means that prices are expected to reach four-year highs once again. There are still concerns as to how increasing oil prices will affect the U.S. and global economy, and with tensions in the Middle East also growing, the next few months is likely to see the market become highly volatile.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Also coming up today: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bookmakers are reeling from the news that the maximum stake on their fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) must be cut from \u00c2\u00a3100 to \u00c2\u00a32, in an attempt to tackle the social damage caused by gambling. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a busy morning in the City, with estate agent Foxtons warning that the London property market remains \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very challenging\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Ocado landing a partnership with US retailer Kroger, and Mothercare announcing the return of once-sacked CEO Mark Newton-Jones.

                "bodyText":"Strong oil prices and the falling value of sterling pushed Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main share index to its highest ever closing level on Thursday. The FTSE 100 climbed 0.7% to close at 7,787.97 points, just short of its record intraday high of 7,792.56 points hit in mid-January. The oil firms BP and Shell were among the strongest risers, along with firms that generate much of their income abroad, including Unilever and HSBC, and have benefited from the recent fall in the pound. Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro to $1.35 and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.144, respectively. Only a month ago the pound was eight cents higher against the dollar at $1.43. However, some analysts warned against exuberance after the FTSE 100 tumbled in the spring to below 7,000 before rising again to its current record level. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at the stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The death of the bull market has been greatly exaggerated, not for the first time in recent history. The FTSE did endure a shaky start to the year but after two months of steady climbing has now regained and surpassed its previous high.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said a stronger dollar, the rising cost of oil and the postponement of an interest-rate rise by the Bank of England last week can all claim credit for the recent strong showing from the stock market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There will come a time when the stock market will tumble again, at which point investors should take it in their stride and look beyond the immediate situation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Investors also appeared to be more relaxed about the outcome of Brexit negotiations after the prime minister indicated she had secured cabinet approval for a compromise over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trading relationship with the European Union. Theresa May said the UK would leave the customs union but with a fallback option, as yet lacking any detail, that would allay fears of a hard border with the Irish republic. The move, which looks to effectively tie the UK to EU rules for several years after an interim period up to 2020, is expected to meet stiff opposition within the Tory party and could yet be scuppered in a final vote in the Commons. FTSE 100 companies Royal Dutch Shell and BP were up 2.1% and 1.4% respectively as Brent crude broke the $80 a barrel barrier. Gambling stocks initially came under pressure following the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to cut the top stake on betting terminals to \u00c2\u00a32. However, they rallied later in the day higher as investors expressed relief that the regulatory uncertainty was over and focused instead on the potential opportunities in the US following a supreme court decision that allows states to set their own rules for sports gambling. FTSE 100 member Paddy Power Betfair rose 1.9%. Ladbrokes Coral parent GVC and William Hill, which operate many of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 182,000 gaming machines, recovered to rise 5% and 4.2% respectively. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whilst \u00c2\u00a32 max stakes is a negative for the sector, if the implementation date is pushed back past 2020, online taxes come in later and the impact to EBITDA is less bad than feared, then there may be a sense of relief today,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Barclays analysts said. The highest riser on the index of top 100 companies was Experian, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest credit data company, which added 5.6% after its revenues for its full financial year grew more strongly than expected. Royal Mail was one of the few to slump, tumbling 7.2% after it warned that the decline in letter volumes may come in at the higher end of its forecast range. The mid-cap FTSE 250 index also hit a new record high, surpassing its previous mid-January record, up 0.9 per cent on the day.

                "bodyText":"The US-China trade truce has given a lift to stock markets at the start of the new trading week. Helped by a weaker pound, the FTSE 100 has hit a new peak, while most European markets managed to move higher. A notable exception was Italy, where investors are growing increasingly concerned about the new coalition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for borrowing and its attitude to the rest of the European Union. Italian bond yields rose sharply and the stock market fell back. Dan Smith, investment analyst at Thomas Miller Investment, said: The Five Star Movement (5SM) and Lega progression in forming a coalition government has increased the level of political risk in Italy, particularly as both parties are interested in relaxing fiscal policy (government spending and taxes) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a result which will raise tensions between Italy and European institutions and raise question marks over the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to the European Union. Overall the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 rose 1.03% to a new closing high of 7859.17 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax was closed for the Whit Monday holiday France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.41% to 5637.51 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.52% to 23,092.38 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 1.2% or more than 300 points. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The FTSE 100 has finished at 7859.17, up 1.03% and a new record closing high. Earlier in the day it touched a new all time intra-day peak of 7868, on relief that the chances of a trade war between the US and China seemed to have receded. A weaker pound also helped, of course. Companies dealing with China are among the gainers in the FTSE 100, not surprisingly. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The US-China news has been excellent for the stock of Burberry and AstraZeneca, both firms with key operations in China. The fear stalking such companies has been that any wider spat between Beijing and Washington will take a chunk out of economic growth in the former. Now, fears of a hit to middle-class incomes and GDP growth have been reduced, and we have seen six-month highs in the former and an eleven-month peak in the latter. Throw in further declines for the pound and further upside looks likely. Corn prices have hit a two year high following the cooling of the trade dispute. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: The prospect of more US agricultural exports to China if the communist country agrees to open up its markets helped corn prices hit a two-year high. Corn is already in a price-supportive environment of supply shortages in China, Brazil and Argentina, which make up a third of global production. The FTSE 100 could breach the 8000 barrier soon after its boost from the US-China trade news, depending on this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic news. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Investors seemingly haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been put off by the general lack of specifics surrounding what was actually agreed between the US and China, crucial details like the extent to which America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit with its rival will be reduced by and how this new trading \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcframework\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will be implemented. It helps that there has been little in the way of data or other economic news to challenge these developments for headline-dominance, allowing the markets to indulge in a bit of bullishness. That bullishness arguably most benefited the FTSE, which piggybacked on this wave of market-relief, alongside the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politically fragile Brexit problems, all the way to a fresh record peak. Crossing 7850 for the first time in its history following a 1% surge, the FTSE now has 8000 in its sights \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and with a pair of much-anticipated inflation and GDP readings on Wednesday and Friday respectively, the index could just get the boost it needs if sterling is dealt another dovish blow. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the AP report on the latest trade developments: President Donald Trump on Monday hailed his administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s temporary truce with China on trade, even as his Treasury secretary and China struck a note of caution on the latest agreement. After high-level talks in Washington last week, Beijing has agreed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantially reduce\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit with China. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On China, Barriers and Tariffs to come down for first time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump tweeted. Farmers, he promises, will come out on top. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Under our potential deal with China, they will purchase from our Great American Farmers practically as much as our Farmers can produce,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he tweeted. Both sides, however, have said there are no guarantees trade tensions are over. China hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t said how much it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s willing to reduce the U.S. trade gap. The Trump administration had sought to slash the deficit by $200 billion. Also left unclear is the issue of intellectual property. The U.S. has long accused Beijing of secretly stealing U.S. technology from American businesses. Treasury Security Steven Mnuchin said Monday those issues \u00e2\u20ac\u0153are part of our framework. These things cannot be fixed overnight.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who has been part of the U.S. negotiating team, is expected to go to China soon to follow up on last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s discussions. A day after declaring the trade war \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on hold,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mnuchin told CNBC Monday that Trump is reserving the right to reimpose tariffs against Chinese goods if the two countries can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree on specifics to bring down the massive trade deficit with Beijing. Likewise, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign ministry said details still have to be worked out. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given the increasing interaction between the two countries, we cannot assure you they will not encounter more frictions or disputes in the future,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said spokesman Lu Kang. The trade talks truce has given a lift to US markets, along with a spate of acquisition activity. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has added more than 1% to 25,016, while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.59% higher and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7%. Among technology shares, chipmakers which supply to Chinese companies were in demand after the trade news. Apart from relief that a trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two biggest economies had been averted, at least for the moment, US investors welcomed news that General Electric planned to merge its transportation business with rail equipment maker Wabtec. Financial shares gained ground after Fifth Third Bancorp said it would buy MB Financial for $4.7bn. Time for a summary, before the opening of Wall Street... Relief that the US and China have backed away from a trade war has sent Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market up to a record high. The FTSE is currently up 51 points at 7830, on track for a record close. Earlier it reached an intraday high of 7851, as the City welcomed the news that Washington and Beijing have reached an agreement on trade. US secretary Steven Mnuchin has told reporters that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153meaningful progress\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has been made, with China promising to help close the US trade gap. However, details for the deal are yet to he ironed out. Both sides have agreed to abandon plans to raise tariffs on each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exports; however, tariffs could yet be imposed if the deal falls apart. Donald Trump has tweeted that China will bring down barriers preventing American firms from exporting more goods. Grain and soybean prices have risen, in a boost for US farmers. The Chinese government has also welcomed the easing in tensions. There is also quiet satisfaction in Beijing that China did not bow to pressure to cut the US trade deficit by $200bn, as Trump demanded. The US dollar has strengthened against most other currencies, including the pound, which has slumped to a new 2018 low. Sterling is bobbing around $1.34, as traders worry about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and the slow progress around Brexit. Steven Mnuchin has also predicted there will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a 35 to 40% increase\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in exports of US farm products to China in the near future. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clip of the Treasury secretary speaking to reporters: US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin on CNBC now. Mnuchin says the US and China made \u00e2\u20ac\u0153meaningful progress\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd during this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade talks. Both sides have agreed to suspend tariffs, he confirms, and US exports to China will increased \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significantly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd going forwards. Mnuchin agrees that these talks now need to be turned into a proper framework - US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross will travel to China soon to help achieve this. But what about Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to help Chinese telecoms firm ZTE overcome sanctions imposed by America? Mnuchin denies that there was any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quid pro quo\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd here. The Treasury secretary also warns China that Trump can put tariffs back onto exports, if the US doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get what it wants. Despite Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s optimism, we really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much detail about exactly how China will help to cut the US trade deficit. The agreement reached last weekend states that China will buy more US goods to achieve a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153meaningful increases in United States agriculture and energy exports\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But with no firm target, judging whether China is delivering (and accepting enough deliveries from America) could be tricky. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why some experts predict that the dispute will flare up again. Vincent Chan, head of China equity research for Credit Suisse, predicts that US-China trade spats could become an annual event. He told clients: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any expectation of a fundamental settlement of the disputes between the both sides would be unrealistic. The political and economic relationship between China and the U.S. has changed dramatically in the last few years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd President Trump is also welcoming the agreement with China - saying it will help US exporters such as farmers. President Trump has just tweeted: Chuck Schumer, a senior Democrat, warned Donald Trump last weekend not to let Chinese President Xi Jinping \u00e2\u20ac\u0153play\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd him in trade talks. Schumer challenged Trump not to stop pushing China over the theft of American intellectual property - something the president says has been a problem for too long. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally means the FTSE 100 has now gained over 900 points, or 13%, since late March. Good news for anyone who had the foresight to buy equities then, in the face of worries over a trade war. However, this rally is partly driven by the weakness in the pound over the last month. Sterling has dropped by almost 10 cents, or 0.6%, from $1.43 to $1.34 as the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to make progress on Brexit has worried the City. American farmers are waking up to some good news - soybean and grain prices are up, thanks to the trade war truce. A bushel of soybeans is trading at $10.15 this morning, up 1.7%. Corn is up 0.8% and wheat has risen by 0.5%. Soybeans featured highly on the list of US products which China proposed imposing tariffs on. It followed up this threat by actually cancelling purchases of US soybeans, which are an important source of protein for both humans and animals. Trade tariffs are a blunt weapon that can cause self-inflicted pain, as Paul Donovan of Swiss bank UBS explains: China and the US have agreed not to increase taxes on their own consumers by avoiding tariffs for now. The agreement at the conclusion of trade talks was suspiciously light on details. The overall US trade deficit is likely to grow this year. The Chinese government has welcomed America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to row back from a trade war. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters in Beijing that a consensus was good for all parties. Lu said (via Reuters): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China has never hoped for any tensions between China and the United States, in the trade or other arenas.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Chinese media are also pointing out that this consensus was reached without any major concessions on their side. For example, the China Daily newspaper says that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite all the pressure, China didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Instead it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stood firm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and negotiated with the Trump administration - without accepting demands for a $200bn cut in the US trade deficit with China. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Neil Wilson of Markets.com on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market rally: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The FTSE 100 notched up a fresh record high, rising clear of 7800 for the first time as the feel-good factor from the trade war truce bolstered risk sentiment and a weaker pound delivered the usual shot of adrenalin for the blue chips. It looks like progress on talks between China and the US means we are not about to descend into a punitive trade war. Whilst there is still long way to go and nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, there has undoubtedly been solid progress and the sense of relief in equity markets is palpable. But we must note that the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains of late are probably more attributable to a weaker pound as the dollar rallies across the board. The strengthening dollar is also causing pain in some emerging markets, where currencies are falling fast this morning: The weaker pound is driving shares in London to fresh record peaks. The FTSE 100 has now climbed 60 points to 7838 for the first time ever, a gain of 0.78%. Firms with large overseas earnings, such as chemicals group Johnson Matthey and advertising giant WPP, are benefiting from the fall in sterling. The truce between Washington and Beijing is also fuelling the rally, of course, even though they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reached a detailed agreement. Mihir Kapadia of Sun Global Investment explains: The general positive sentiment reflects the decline of worries of a possible trade war between the U.S. and China, following weekend developments. Packaging firm Smurfit Kappa, who would have suffered from a trade war, are up 1.5%. Mining giant Anglo American is up 1.8%; it would have been hit by weaker commodity prices if new tariffs had been imposed between the US and China. Bloomberg says the British pound is suffering from Brexit angst and signs that UK growth has slowed. The main thing investors are waiting for is to see whether the latest economic figures show any upturn, after a sluggish first three months of the year when the Beast from the East snowstorm swept across the country. That could push higher the odds of an interest-rate increase as early as August by the Bank of England..... Aside from the date, the U.K. will go into the next round of Brexit talks this week against a backdrop of euro-zone turmoil as Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s populist coalition pushes ahead with an agenda that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at odds with the European Union establishment. At home, backbench members of parliament are said to be preparing for an Autumn election as they anticipate defeats on Prime Minister Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key piece of Brexit legislation. The pound has hit its lowest level since the start of the year. While traders aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worrying about trade wars, they are getting jittery about Brexit again. Sterling has just fallen back to $1.3397, down 0.77 of a cent, the lowest level since 28 December 2017. Foreign secretary Boris Johnson can take some credit, or rather blame. On a trip to Argentina yesterday, he issued a new challenge to prime minister Theresa May not to allow Britain to remain tied to the customs union after 2020 through a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbackstop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 agreement. Our political editor Heather Stewart is in Buenos Aires, and explains: This backstop has been one of the sticking points in talks with the EU27 and some in Westminster believe it could become the post-Brexit norm if Brussels accepts the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal. But Johnson insisted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexiters fearing betrayal over the customs backstop must understand that the PM has been very clear that it is not an outcome we desire; we want a deal with the EU and she will deliver it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yesterday, the Sunday Times claimed that Conservative MPs are preparing themselves for a snap general election over fears Theresa May will not be able to break the Brexit deadlock. That would create even more political tension and uncertainty, just months before Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. Metal prices are also getting a small lift this morning. Reuters has the details: Copper edged higher on Monday after China and the United States put their trade row \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on hold\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, easing concerns that the dispute could escalate, although headwinds from a stronger dollar capped further gains. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It appears that America and China have moved towards a trade deal, which will mean the expansion of U.S. goods purchased by China, and thus, avoiding the prospect of an out-and-out trade war,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Kingdom Futures in a report. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was up 0.1 percent at $6,860 a tonne by 07:27 GMT, reversing small losses from the previous session. Prices have been caught in a tight $6,765-$6,900 range for the past week. The FTSE is continuing to climb to fresh record levels, putting 8,000 points in its sights (I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get there today, though!). Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx says: After intermittently fretting over signs that hostile relations were heating back up between the US and China last week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim on Sunday that a trade war was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcon hold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has sent a \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cautious \u00e2\u20ac\u201c wave of relief through the market. Italy, though, is bucking the trend with a sharp fall. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to nervousness over the prospect of two populist parties taking power. But....several big Italian companies have just gone \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcex-dividend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, meaning the deadline to buy them to receive the next payout to shareholders has passed. That has knocked their shares lower. The US dollar has hit its highest level in five months, against a basket of other currencies. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another sign that traders are comforted that the US and China have frozen tariffs on a swathe of exports - something that could have hurt the American economy. This truce may also make it easier for the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, to raise American interest rates in the months ahead - another reason to buy the dollar now. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, reminds us that America and China haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually hammered out a full agreement on trade yet. Sayed points out that details of the truce remain vague. This was the second round of trade negotiations without clearly defined targets, suggesting that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a long way to go. Today, a trade war may have been averted, but according to the joint statement from both countries, nothing is being guaranteed apart from China promising to increase American imports Boom! The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index has burst to a new-alltime high this morning. The Footsie gained 35 points, or 0.45%, to 7814 points for the first time ever. European markets are also benefiting from the easing of trade war fears. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC has gained 0.24%, while the Spanish IBEX is up 0.33%. Shares in London are also getting a currency boost - the pound has dropped half a cent against the US dollar this morning to $1.3414. Although there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relief that the US and China have stepped back from a trade war, analysts are also cautious. Tai Hui, chief market strategist for Asia Pacific at JP Morgan, predicts further clashes between the two sides: Historical precedents suggest the U.S. could re-engage with China on trade issues if it sees China dragging its feet on fulfilling its pledges. Moreover, the last three months have further exposed Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advancement in technology and its threat as a competitor, both commercially and strategically. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like a back pain that never goes away. It was a shock in the first instance it happened, but then life goes on as the most acute symptoms are addressed. The good news is that markets should learn to live with it and consider its impact more rationally.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Eswar Prasad, trade policy professor at Cornell University, says we are looking at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153little more than a brief de-escalation of tensions,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fundamental differences on trade and other economic issues remain unresolved.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Konstantinos Anthis, Head of Research at ADS Securities, believes last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breakthrough will boost stock markets: The undeclared \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trade war\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between US and China has been put on hold according to US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin as the two superpowers agree on a economic truce. This development puts the planned tariffs on hold while the two countries work on a plan to re-balance their trade relations and dampens the geopolitical risk. An easing of risks on a global scale will be a positive catalyst for the dollar and global equities while demand for safe haven assets like gold and the Japanese yen will remain subdued. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip share index of top shares is likely to smash through 7,800 points for the first time ever today. City traders are predicting a rally in London, thanks to the new spirit of detente between the US and China over trade. The FTSE 100 is forecast to gain around 30 points to 7815, breaching the previous intraday high. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group points out that the two sides haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resolved all their issues. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a start, at least. US and China stepping back from the brink of a trade war has lifted sentiment, boosting equity indices, putting the FTSE on track for a fresh record high. Asian equities have bounced and Europe points to a higher start, as Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration halts plans to impose trade tariffs on China, whilst China promises to significantly increase its purchase of US farm exports and energy. This is by no means the end of the matter, especially given the huge gap that remains between the two sides, as highlighted by the lack of any real detail in the announcement. However, this was the encouraging start to talks that traders were after. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Relief is coursing through the markets today after America and China stepped back from the brink of a trade war. Following tense negotiations, the two sides have reached an agreement that means tariffs will not be slapped on tens of billions of dollars of imports. The news has sent markets rallying in Asia, and could push Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index to a fresh all-time high today. Stocks on Wall Street are all expected to gain, with the Dow Jones industrial average being called up 200 points (0.8%). US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin announced the ceasefire last night. He told Fox News that Beijing had agreed to a framework to help reduce the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge trade deficit with China. This includes China buying more US products. Mnuchin said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re putting the trade war on hold, right now, we have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to execute the framework.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He, who took part in trade talks in Washington, has also told the media that the two sides had agreed not to launch a trade war. The breakthrough means that tit-for-tat tariffs will not now be imposed on good flowing between the two countries, such as robots, machinery, chemicals and soybeans But, significantly, China hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agreed to cut the deficit by a fixed amount - and certainly not the $200bn which the Trump administration were pushing for, But still, the deescalation has been welcomed by investors. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has posted gains; the SSE Composite index of leading shares is up 0.8% today. Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng index has gained 1%. European markets are expected to follow suit when trading begins. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: Concerns about an escalation in tensions between China and the US appear to have been deferred in the short term after progress in trade talks at the weekend. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the reaction through the day...",

Now just 100 points away, with momentum on its side and the pound looking more fragile than it has for a while, 8000 is a very reasonable target.</p> <p>The inverse relationship that exists between the pound and the FTSE thanks to a large percentage of FTSE firms earning revenue outside of the UK, is expected to help the FTSE break higher into unchartered territory towards 8000, sooner rather than later. After weeks of softer than forecast UK economic data, most recently a fall in factory output to the lowest level in two years, plus Brexit uncertainties and a BoE that is happy to sit on the side-lines, key factors are aligned for a soft pound and another push higher by the FTSE.</p> <p>With the harsh weather conditions well behind us, the outlook for the economy is looking up, according to the BoE, making an August rate hike once again a possibility. Should investors start to believe that the August hike is well and truly back on the table, the pound could start to pick up off year to date lows, making it harder for the FTSE to reach 8000. With this in mind, the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final move higher to 8000 needs to be in the bag sooner rather than later to guarantee a hit, otherwise a stronger pound is likely to prevent that psychological level being struck this summer. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b043ae8e4b0738b88745de0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T15:46:29.439Z\">4.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FTSE 100 hits new closing high</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading share index has closed at a new record, but it is off the intra-day highs it recorded earlier in the afternoon.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 finished up 0.23% at 7877.45 having early climbed to a new all time peak of 7903.50. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b0435a3e4b05aef3eee8748\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T15:23:07.796Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Chinese plans to cut import tariffs on US cars has helped support markets. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> European markets are pushing upwards amid improving US-Chinese trade talks, and a weakening pound. The pound has been suffering in late trade, coming off the back of a CBI report that showed UK manufacturing output to be growing at the slowest rate in two-years. With manufacturing failing to gather momentum, there is a fear that we will see the focus of UK economic weakness shift from construction in Q1 to manufacturing in Q2....</p> <p>Improving US-Chinese relations continue to help improve risk sentiment as the week progresses, with news that China has pledged to reduce levies on automakers and car parts helping the likes of General Electric gain ground. While car makers welcomed news that China will cut tariffs on both imported cars (15% from 25%) and car parts (6% from average of 10%), these still remain comparatively high and are unlikely to alter the status quo of firms basing production in China to avoid such levies. China remains the largest car producing nation in the world, and this token gesture is unlikely to really make any dent in that dynamic.</p> <p> While the benefits from this reduction in Chinese levies are questionable, the decision to let ZTE off the hook for brazenly defying US sanctions on Iran and North Korea is a big boost for China given they employed 80,000 workers. While on face value the Chinese seem to be getting more from this deal, todays deal at least helps reinstate demand for US listed firms Qualcomm and Dolby, from whom ZTE buy many of their processing chips.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T15:24:07.784Z\">at 4.24pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b0433d4e4b0a1f834770c9c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T15:15:07.168Z\">4.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The FTSE 100 continues to set new records, briefly breaking through the 7900 barrier for the first time as the close of the trading day approaches.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b042c24e4b0a1f834770c1c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/zoewood\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T14:42:44.486Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More bad news for retail workers:</p> <blockquote> <p>Tesco is shutting its clothing and homewares website <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco\">Tesco</a> Direct in a surprise move that puts 500 jobs at risk.</p> <p>Staff were briefed on Tuesday afternoon about the decision to close the loss-making website which was the supermarket giant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to take on Amazon.</p> <p>Tesco said it had conducted a detailed review of the operation but could not come up with a plan that would make the business, which sells thousands of products ranging from toys, to clothing and electrical appliances, profitable.

That sent it above 7890 for the first time in its history, in the process making the mythic 8000 mark closer to becoming a reality.</p> <p>Whether or not the FTSE can actually reach that landmark level this week may be down to a couple of factors. One: the performance of Brent Crude. The black stuff re-crossed $80 per barrel on Tuesday as supply concerns relating to Venezuela and Iran continued to heighten. However, BP and Shell were resistant to this rise, instead falling 1.2% and 0.6% respectively. If the FTSE is to keep rising, then its oil colossi need to get on board. </p> <p>Two: how sterling reacts to the week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data. The inflation reading on Wednesday and the 2<sup>nd</sup> estimate Q1 GDP figure on Friday are both potential lightning rods for a pound-rebound, dependant on whether or not they beat the expected stagnation.

Mihir Kapadia, chief executive of Sun Global Investments, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prospect of further Iran sanctions coupled with the disputed election results in Venezuela have helped to firm oil prices. President Trump and the White House have made clear that any new Iran deal would require the country to stop enriching all uranium and halt support for militant groups in the region. Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government has rejected these demands, increasing the chance that the US could impose severe economic sanctions on the country. Sanctions would reduce oil supply. The possibility of a drastic fall in Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output has helped to support oil prices in recent months. </p> <p>Oil prices were also pushed higher by the disputed election in Venezuela. The US has promptly responded with sanctions that seek to greatly restrict investment in debts issued by the Venezuelan government or Venezuelan agencies, although the US did not ban the purchase of oil itself.

That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s despite the world economy, and particularly the eurozone, growing faster than forecast since then.</p> <p>According to Carney, if you adjust for the stronger global economy and the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal easing, the UK is actually around 1.75% smaller, <strong>perhaps even 2%</strong>, than you might expected today.</p> <p>That has a real impact on families and individuals across the country.</p> <p>As Carney puts it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you map it onto household incomes, real household incomes are about \u00c2\u00a3900 lower than we forecast, which is a lot of money.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some of this loss can clearly be ascribed to Brexit. Business investment has been up to 4% weaker than forecast -- as firms have been hit by uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trading relationships.</p> <p>Households have suffered by the drop in real incomes (which turned negative last year), due to the plunge in sterling after the referendum. The weaker pound drove up inflation, meaning salaries and pensions didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go as far in the shops.</p> <p>As Carney puts it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are Brexit effects that come through\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <p>But, the governor did also cite Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing productivity problems - partly due to weak investment, but also due to a series of wider issues that can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be pinned on the Brexit vote.</p> <p>In conclusion, Carney warned:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the short term, over the last year and a half, there has been an impact relative to what we would have expected, even with some pretty good tailwinds on the back of this economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T11:20:24.795Z\">at 12.20pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b03ed98e4b0738b887458ed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T10:35:27.730Z\">11.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>John Mann MP asks Mark Carney a series of mischievous and piercing questions.</strong></p> <p>Mann gets Carney to confirm that he is still planning to leave the Bank of England in June 2019.

So within a few months (if Labour wins power), the Bank of England could be given a new remit to target unemployment as well as inflation.</p> <p><em>Q: Is the Bank of England prepared for a change in your remit?</em></p> <p>Carney says he believes the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remit should indeed be reviewed every five to eight years. Whatever remit parliament give us, we will implement.</p> <p>The current remit is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcabsolutely fit for purpose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Carney insists.</p> <p>Mann suggests that it might be better to make any remit changed before, rather than after, a new governor is appointed. That could be an argument for Carney staying on longer at the Bank.</p> <p>Mann then swerves to a different issue:</p> <p><em>Q: What impact has Simon Cowell had on the UK economy?</em><br></p> <p>Mann explains that Cowell (of the X-Factor and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Got Talent) has driven a change in behaviour - more people are staying in on Saturday nights rather than going out.</p> <p>Carney says the Bank has beefed up its expertise in behavioural economics in recent years, to track these trends.

                "bodyText":"Further optimism that a trade war between the US and China could be averted has helped lift European markets, despite a drag from Wall Street. Apart from the FTSE 100 reaching a new peak, other major markets also ended higher, even in Italy despite continuing concerns about the plans of its new coalition. As for the US, there were more signs of strength in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy with a new manufacturing survey. Dave Madden of CMC Markets said: The US Richmond manufacturing index soared to 16 in May from -3 in April. Economists were expecting a reading of 9. The solid manufacturing report underlines the strength of the US economy. Some traders predict the Federal Reserve will raise rates three more times in 2018, and economic announcements like this reinforce their beliefs. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.23% or 18.28 points at 7877.45 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.71% to13,169.92 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.05% to 5640.10 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 0.54% to 23,216.57 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.72% at 10,138.8 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 37 points or 0.15%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. More on a possible UK interest rate rise this year, following the select committee appearance of Bank of England policymakers this morning. Andrew Wilson at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said: Comments concerning monetary policy largely echo this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Meeting. We still see scope for one rate hike this year, most likely in the fourth quarter and we think the pace of UK monetary tightening thereafter will be gradual given uncertainties around determinants of recent activity softness. We also suspect policymakers will await further clarity from macro data before providing further guidance on the timing of any future rate hikes. Inconclusive Brexit negotiations, and uncertainty around when the inflation impact from referendum-related currency depreciation will fade, create additional challenges for the BoE. If the FTSE 100 is to reach 8000 for the first time, it might need to be soon, says Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, before the Bank of England decides to raise interest rates: A weaker pound, a further easing of tensions between US and China and stronger commodity prices encouraged the FTSE to continue its steady rise towards its 8000 target. Now just 100 points away, with momentum on its side and the pound looking more fragile than it has for a while, 8000 is a very reasonable target. The inverse relationship that exists between the pound and the FTSE thanks to a large percentage of FTSE firms earning revenue outside of the UK, is expected to help the FTSE break higher into unchartered territory towards 8000, sooner rather than later. After weeks of softer than forecast UK economic data, most recently a fall in factory output to the lowest level in two years, plus Brexit uncertainties and a BoE that is happy to sit on the side-lines, key factors are aligned for a soft pound and another push higher by the FTSE. With the harsh weather conditions well behind us, the outlook for the economy is looking up, according to the BoE, making an August rate hike once again a possibility. Should investors start to believe that the August hike is well and truly back on the table, the pound could start to pick up off year to date lows, making it harder for the FTSE to reach 8000. With this in mind, the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final move higher to 8000 needs to be in the bag sooner rather than later to guarantee a hit, otherwise a stronger pound is likely to prevent that psychological level being struck this summer. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading share index has closed at a new record, but it is off the intra-day highs it recorded earlier in the afternoon. The FTSE 100 finished up 0.23% at 7877.45 having early climbed to a new all time peak of 7903.50. Chinese plans to cut import tariffs on US cars has helped support markets. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: European markets are pushing upwards amid improving US-Chinese trade talks, and a weakening pound. The pound has been suffering in late trade, coming off the back of a CBI report that showed UK manufacturing output to be growing at the slowest rate in two-years. With manufacturing failing to gather momentum, there is a fear that we will see the focus of UK economic weakness shift from construction in Q1 to manufacturing in Q2.... Improving US-Chinese relations continue to help improve risk sentiment as the week progresses, with news that China has pledged to reduce levies on automakers and car parts helping the likes of General Electric gain ground. While car makers welcomed news that China will cut tariffs on both imported cars (15% from 25%) and car parts (6% from average of 10%), these still remain comparatively high and are unlikely to alter the status quo of firms basing production in China to avoid such levies. China remains the largest car producing nation in the world, and this token gesture is unlikely to really make any dent in that dynamic. While the benefits from this reduction in Chinese levies are questionable, the decision to let ZTE off the hook for brazenly defying US sanctions on Iran and North Korea is a big boost for China given they employed 80,000 workers. While on face value the Chinese seem to be getting more from this deal, todays deal at least helps reinstate demand for US listed firms Qualcomm and Dolby, from whom ZTE buy many of their processing chips. The FTSE 100 continues to set new records, briefly breaking through the 7900 barrier for the first time as the close of the trading day approaches. More bad news for retail workers: Tesco is shutting its clothing and homewares website Tesco Direct in a surprise move that puts 500 jobs at risk. Staff were briefed on Tuesday afternoon about the decision to close the loss-making website which was the supermarket giant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to take on Amazon. Tesco said it had conducted a detailed review of the operation but could not come up with a plan that would make the business, which sells thousands of products ranging from toys, to clothing and electrical appliances, profitable. As a result the retailer said approximately 500 staff were at risk of redundancy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This decision has been a very difficult one to make, but it is an essential step towards establishing a more sustainable non-food offer and growing our business for the future,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Charles Wilson who is the new boss of Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK chain. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to offer our customers the ability to buy groceries and non-food products in one place and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we are focusing our investment into one online platform.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Our full report is here: Wall Street has now slipped into negative territory but that has not stopped the FTSE 100 from hitting new heights. The UK index is now up 0.45% at a new intra-day peak of 7896, helped by the pound losing most of its earlier gains. Against the dollar sterling is now up just 0.08% at $1.3435. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The fact cable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains more than halved as the day went on freed the UK index up to shake off its early reticence, the FTSE adding around 25 points in value. That sent it above 7890 for the first time in its history, in the process making the mythic 8000 mark closer to becoming a reality. Whether or not the FTSE can actually reach that landmark level this week may be down to a couple of factors. One: the performance of Brent Crude. The black stuff re-crossed $80 per barrel on Tuesday as supply concerns relating to Venezuela and Iran continued to heighten. However, BP and Shell were resistant to this rise, instead falling 1.2% and 0.6% respectively. If the FTSE is to keep rising, then its oil colossi need to get on board. Two: how sterling reacts to the week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data. The inflation reading on Wednesday and the 2nd estimate Q1 GDP figure on Friday are both potential lightning rods for a pound-rebound, dependant on whether or not they beat the expected stagnation. If they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, and cable hits a fresh 2018 low, then the FTSE may be in for a boost. Oil is on the rise again with Brent crude back above the $80 a barrel level it breached last week. It is currently up 1.17% at $80.15 on renewed concerns about falling supplies from struggling Venezuela, as well as Iran after Donald Trump pulled out of the nuclear agreement. Mihir Kapadia, chief executive of Sun Global Investments, said: The prospect of further Iran sanctions coupled with the disputed election results in Venezuela have helped to firm oil prices. President Trump and the White House have made clear that any new Iran deal would require the country to stop enriching all uranium and halt support for militant groups in the region. Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government has rejected these demands, increasing the chance that the US could impose severe economic sanctions on the country. Sanctions would reduce oil supply. The possibility of a drastic fall in Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output has helped to support oil prices in recent months. Oil prices were also pushed higher by the disputed election in Venezuela. The US has promptly responded with sanctions that seek to greatly restrict investment in debts issued by the Venezuelan government or Venezuelan agencies, although the US did not ban the purchase of oil itself. Analysts will be watching closely to see how the situation develops. Hopes for a positive outcome from the US-China trade talks, US markets have edged higher in early trading. With technology stocks benefiting from the prospect that the two countries can avoid a damaging trade war, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 11 points or 0.04% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.2% higher and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.36% better. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the Bank of England committee hearing: British households are more than \u00c2\u00a3900 worse off following the vote to leave the European Union, according to the governor of the Bank of England. Comparing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street before the referendum, prepared on the basis of a remain vote, Mark Carney told MPs that household incomes were now significantly lower than expected. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Real household incomes are about \u00c2\u00a3900 per household lower than we forecast in May of 2016, which is a lot of money,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Speaking in front of the Treasury select committee of MPs, Carney also said the economy was 2% smaller than forecast before the EU referendum, despite the strength of the global economy and an emergency rate cut from the Bank after the Brexit vote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reasonable difference\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to forecasts for the economy made in May 2016, he added. Although admitting it was difficult to say with certainty that Brexit was the sole reason for lower household incomes, the Bank governor suggested the referendum outcome played a significant role. Previous analysis by economists has put the potential cost for each British household of voting to leave the EU at \u00c2\u00a3600 a year. The full report is here: The recent poor performance of shares in Marks &amp; Spencer mean the venerable retailer is in danger of falling out of the FTSE 100 when the latest index changes are announced next week. It looks just about safe at the moment, despite a near 3% decline in its shares today, but the reaction to this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results could be crucial. Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said: Whilst investors will be hoping that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full year results, due to be released to the market tomorrow, will provide a similar boost to that rival Next received recently, the harsh reality is that the retail environment continues to hugely weigh on this well-known and respected retailer. M&amp;S is likely to find itself amongst the relegation places as a result of weak figures in its all-important food business released to the market earlier this year. Whilst there have been some encouraging signs that the new management team on the clothing side is having some impact, competitive pressure from rivals and relatively weak consumer sentiment has left sales growth uninspiring. Its full year results could ultimately decide its fate, at least in regards to its future in the FTSE 100. Ironically one of the candidates to replace M&amp;S if it did drop out is Ocado following the recent surge in its shares after its big US contract win. G4S and Severn Trent are among the others who could lose their place in the top flight index, while FTSE 250 constituents Weir and GVC are knocking on the door. Sterling moved higher during the Bank of England testimony, helped by what was seen as a hawkish tone from MPC policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe and a softening of the dollar ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve minutes. But the rally did not last long amid renewed signs of a weak UK economy which casts some doubt on the pace of further interest rate rises. So the FTSE 100, whose overseas earners benefit from a slide in sterling, is heading for new heights. It has already hit a new all time peak of 7887 and even though it has fallen back to 7879, up 0.26%, that would still mark a new record close if it holds on to its gains. While Mark Carney was speaking to MPs, the UK economy received two pieces of bad news. Marks &amp; Spencer, the high street chain, has announced it is closing more than 100 stores by 2022, It has identified 14 stores that will close in the next year, affecting more than 600 staff, as the company tries to tackle falling profits and growing competition from online retailers. Secondly, UK factory orders have weakened this month to their lowest level since November 2016. The CBI reported that weak domestic demand hurt British manufacturers, while export orders held up better. The campaign for a second Brexit vote have seized on Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments: Ruth Lea, economic adviser at Arbuthnot Banking Group (who is optimistic about Brexit), isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s calculation: The Evening Standard is splashing on Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments: Perhaps the editor, a prominent Remain campaigner two years ago, feels his warnings of economic pain if people voted for Brexit are coming true.... Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake tweets: The Bank of England governor gave MPs a clear reminder of the cost of the 2016 EU referendum today, by warning that households are \u00c2\u00a3900 worse off today than expected. During his testimony to the Treasury Committee, Mark Carney explained that the UK economy is currently 1% smaller than expected two years ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s despite the world economy, and particularly the eurozone, growing faster than forecast since then. According to Carney, if you adjust for the stronger global economy and the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal easing, the UK is actually around 1.75% smaller, perhaps even 2%, than you might expected today. That has a real impact on families and individuals across the country. As Carney puts it: If you map it onto household incomes, real household incomes are about \u00c2\u00a3900 lower than we forecast, which is a lot of money. Some of this loss can clearly be ascribed to Brexit. Business investment has been up to 4% weaker than forecast -- as firms have been hit by uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trading relationships. Households have suffered by the drop in real incomes (which turned negative last year), due to the plunge in sterling after the referendum. The weaker pound drove up inflation, meaning salaries and pensions didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go as far in the shops. As Carney puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are Brexit effects that come through\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But, the governor did also cite Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing productivity problems - partly due to weak investment, but also due to a series of wider issues that can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be pinned on the Brexit vote. In conclusion, Carney warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the short term, over the last year and a half, there has been an impact relative to what we would have expected, even with some pretty good tailwinds on the back of this economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd John Mann MP asks Mark Carney a series of mischievous and piercing questions. Mann gets Carney to confirm that he is still planning to leave the Bank of England in June 2019. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confident that the government can \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmultitask\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and choose a successor despite the pressure of Brexit. But Mann points out that there are rumours of a general election this autumn. So within a few months (if Labour wins power), the Bank of England could be given a new remit to target unemployment as well as inflation. Q: Is the Bank of England prepared for a change in your remit? Carney says he believes the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remit should indeed be reviewed every five to eight years. Whatever remit parliament give us, we will implement. The current remit is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcabsolutely fit for purpose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Carney insists. Mann suggests that it might be better to make any remit changed before, rather than after, a new governor is appointed. That could be an argument for Carney staying on longer at the Bank. Mann then swerves to a different issue: Q: What impact has Simon Cowell had on the UK economy? Mann explains that Cowell (of the X-Factor and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Got Talent) has driven a change in behaviour - more people are staying in on Saturday nights rather than going out. Carney says the Bank has beefed up its expertise in behavioural economics in recent years, to track these trends. He suggests social media and the internet is probably a bigger factor, though: Q: Britain has become a world leader in wind power. So given the importance of green energy, shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the Bank be taking a bigger role in driving the economic case? Carney agrees that this is a hugely important issue - citing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworld leadership\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in, for example, using artificial intelligence to drive new power grids. This is too long-term to influence the Monetary Policy Committee...but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly an important issue for the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee, who are looking at whether firms are well-prepared for changes. Carney says the UK has taken a global lead in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better climate disclosure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - encouraging companies to report how climate change will affect them. He says the top six banks, asset managers, major insurers have signed up - there are now $90 trillion of assets behind the initiative. The backdrop to this question, though, is that activist investor Christopher Hohn has written to the BoE, demanding stricter rules on how banks deal with the risks of climate change. Hohn argues that UK banks are exposed to a wide range of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious climate-related risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd through their loan books, but investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being given enough information. More here. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the session. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden confirms Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier estimate that UK households are \u00c2\u00a3900 worse off today than forecast in May 2016, before the Brexit vote. Q: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of debate about whether the Brexit transition period should be extended. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your view, governor? I watch the debate with interest, Mark Carney blocks smartly with a smile. Q: Is the current transition period long enough? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been agreed by the political leaders, Carney replies smoothly. Q: You wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any objection to the transition period being extended? I think some could have an objection to me answering that question, the governor grins. Q: Surveys show that Brexit uncertainty among businesses has fallen recently. Do you think it remains high, and is it really falling? Carney agrees that there has been a small improvement in business confidence about Brexit since Britain and Europe agreed a transition deal in March, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as you would hope\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The decisive issue, though, will be whether a final agreement is reached later this year. Gertjan Vlieghe also denies that QE has fuelled Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market. He points out that many countries have used quantitative easing to stimulate their economies since the financial crisis - but Britain is the only one to have seen such as house price boom. [Bank policymakers recently published a paper on the consequence of QE - arguing that it had actually reduced wealth inequality.] Q: Hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t QE solidified intergenerational inequality, and made it even harder for Generation Rent to buy a home? How can we unwind that problem? Deputy governor Dave Ramsden says it is an important issue...but not one that is particularly within the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remit to solve. Ramsden (previously chief economic adviser to HM Treasury) points out that supply-side constraints have driven house prices up for decades. Tackling housing affordability is ultimately an issue for the government, Ramsden, insists, as they can change land use and the tax system. Q: Has the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quantitative easing programme failed, by driving up asset prices when the Bank is meant to be targeting consumer price inflation? QE is the process by which the Bank buys government debt from commercial banks, to encourage them to buy other assets. Those assets (commercial bonds, shares, commodities) tend to be owned by wealthier people. Carney, though, denies that QE was a blunder. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The policy has worked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he says, pointing out that unemployment (arguably the biggest cause of inequality) has fallen steadily in recent years. The Brexit dividend? Q: Do you accept that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremely low interest rates mean there is no incentive for businesses to invest capital? No, Carney replies firmly. He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept that swathes of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dczombie firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 are being propped up across the UK by extra-low interest rates, making it hard for better firms to compete. The number of such companies has fallen in recent years, he insists, as poor performing companies are driven out of the economy. Instead, Brexit uncertainty has been hurting business investment - as firms decide to sit on the sidelines until the future becomes clearer. Back in parliament, Michael Saunders has been reminded that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been outvoted no fewer than five times at the Bank of England when he has pushed, in vain, for interest rates. Q: Why were you outvoted so many times? Well, mathematically, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because there were more votes to leave interest rates unchanged, says Saunders patiently. Saunders thinks borrowing costs should have risen faster, to reflect the strong UK labour market. With unemployment at its lowest rate since the early 1970s, wages should be rising (not that we can see much sign of it yet!), so the Bank should be alert for inflationary pressures building. The Treasury has welcome the news that UK borrowing fell last month. A Treasury spokesperson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Borrowing is at the lowest level for a decade, which shows our balanced approach is working. We are backing public services, keeping taxes low, and investing \u00c2\u00a331 billion more in infrastructure and skills as we build an economy that is fit for the future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Breaking away from parliament.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances were stronger than expected last month. The UK borrowed \u00c2\u00a36.2bn in April, down from \u00c2\u00a37.3bn a year ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a better start to the new financial year than expected. In another boost, the total deficit for the last financial year was \u00c2\u00a32bn lower than expected. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was more good news for the Chancellor on the public finances today, with estimated public borrowing in 2017/18 revised down by just over \u00c2\u00a32 billion relative to initial estimates published last month. This reflects a combination of stronger tax receipts and lower government spending. Carney adds that the economic activity lost under the snow last winter won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be clawed back - which is why the Bank was cautious about raising interest rates this month. Q: Why does the Bank of England think the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBeast from the East\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hurt growth in the last quarter, while the Office for National Statistics says snow didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have an effect? Mark Carney says the ONS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data was based on a questionnaire sent to businesses - \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery few\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 people answered the question, he claims. The Bank, though, sent its regional agents out to actually talk to firms around the country. They reported that the snow had a negative effect. Q: Do you believe the Bank should give more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexplicit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 guidance for the future path of interest rates, as Gertjan Vlieghe argued this morning? Deputy governor Dave Ramsden is sceptical that this is a good idea. He thinks it could be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclost in translation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and mistaken for a promise for how interest rates would change. MPC member Michael Saunders agrees - he tells MPs there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no way\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Bank could give an unconditional forecast for the path of interest rates. But, Saunders thinks there is value in giving an estimate for the neutral rate of interest (R*, for economists in the room) - the rate at which the economy is growing at its long-term trend rate, while inflation remains stable. Governor Carney says the MPC have discussed the issue, and a majority of members were opposed to giving more explicit guidance. Vlieghe has now been joined by the boss, governor Mark Carney, along with deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden and fellow external policymaker Michael Saunders. As predicted, Carney is being asked to justify the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave interest rate on hold in May, despite hinting at a rise in February. Governor Carney says that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s households and businesses understand the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position, that interest rates will rise at a limited and gradual rate. They have got that message. On the May decision, Carney says he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that the UK economy is as weak as suggested by the GDP figures for the first quarter of this year (growth of just 0.1%). There were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153temporary, idiosyncratic factors that hit growth in the first quarter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the governor explains. So he felt it was best to leave interest rates on hold until more data comes in. NEWSFLASH: Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe has predicted that interest rates could rise up to six times in the next three years, sending the pound jumping. Vlieghe makes the forecast in his written evidence to the Treasury committee, which has just been released. He predicts there will be one or two 0.25% increases per year, over the next 36 months. His forecast is a little more hawkish than the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own central forecast. Vlieghe says: My current forecast for growth and inflation is consistent with a gradually rising path of interest rates. My own central projection will require one or two quarter point rate increases per year over the three-year forecast period. That path would bring us closer to the neutral policy rate, which I continue to think is likely to be well below the neutral rate that prevailed before the recession. Six quarter-point increases would take UK interest rates up to 2% by 2021, from 0.5% today. This has sent the pound up almost half a cent. Vlieghe adde that there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in this forecast, partly because he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how the UK economy will evolve in the years ahead (especially given the uncertainty created by Brexit). He adds: My central forecast for policy rates is slightly above the conditioning path of rates derived from market yields in the May Inflation Report forecast, which assumes just under three quarter point rate increases over the three-year forecast period. Gertjan Vlieghe has also suggested that the Bank of England could give clearer guidance on interest rate policy. He tells MPs that he has suggested that policymakers give more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexplicit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts for how they think borrowing costs will change in the future. He concedes, though, that this could create a risk - investors could \u00e2\u20ac\u0153underestimate the degree of uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if central banks become too precise in their communication of the projected future path of interest rates. The US Federal Reserve has a similar policy already - its policymakers create a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdot chart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 each quarter suggesting how many interest rate changes they expect. The Treasury committee is now asking about the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s communications. Why did the Bank hint in February that interest rates would rise faster than previously expected, only to leave them on hold in May?. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a difference between knowing that the future is uncertain, and not knowing what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on, Vlieghe insists. As data comes in, the Bank adjusts its view for the future path of interest rates. Asked about Brexit, Gertjan Vlieghe says that there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153much less of a response than we thought\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the immediate aftermath of the referendum in 2016. But there is now a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clear effect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he adds, citing the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdampening effect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of Brexit on investment. The Treasury Committee is underway, starting with Gertjan Vlieghe - who is taking up a second three-year term on the Monetary Policy Committee. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being streamed live here. Vlieghe cites the pick-up in the global economy, and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdampening effect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the Brexit vote on UK growth, as the two big themes of his first three years Vleighe says he is broadly in line with the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central forecast - and predicts that UK interest rates will rise very gradually over the next few years. Financial newswire RANsquawk point out that things could be worse for Carney - at least one critic won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be there today (JRM has moved to parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Exiting the EU Committee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). I suspect that Mark Carney would happily forego today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inquisition at parliament. He won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t welcome being quizzed about his \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcforward guidance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 -- the hints about an interest rate rise that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t materialise this week. He could do without another debate on Brexit risks too. And he would certainly rather avoid being asked whether he agrees with Ben Broadbent that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is entering a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclimacteric\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmenopausal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, phase. Communication is a key weapon for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bankers. But perhaps Carney should ponder whether \u00e2\u20ac\u0153less is more\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when he speaks to financial markets. As Bloomberg puts it: After a bruising month that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seen his own signals on interest rates questioned and one of his deputies forced to apologize for calling the economy menopausal, communication is once again a hot topic for the Bank of England governor. Carney, who arrived at the BOE in 2013 with forward guidance as his signature policy, will come under more scrutiny this week when he faces a grilling from U.K. lawmakers. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also give speeches in London and Stockholm. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some people would say the safest thing for the Bank of England to do right now is to go back to being mystical,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Clea Bourne, a senior lecturer and financial communications specialist at Goldsmiths, University of London. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Mark Carney is in the spotlight this morning as MPs quiz the Bank of England governor about the state of the UK economy, and his latest u-turn on interest rates. The Treasury Committee will question Carney, deputy governor Dave Ramsden, and policymakers Michael Saunders and Gertjan Vlieghe, about this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarterly inflation report. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be asked to explain why the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee left UK borrowing costs unchanged this month at just 0.5%, having previously dropped hints that a rate rise was coming. That decision saw Carney labelled, again, as an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for making promises and never sticking to them. But the governor has a defence. He can point to the sharp slowdown in UK growth this year - GDP rose by just 0.1% in January-March. But with unemployment at a 43-year low, and employment at a record high, is the economy really that weak? The quartet can also expect some questions about Brexit, as concern builds about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely trading relationships with the EU after 2019. Sterling is looking edgy ahead of the hearing, having dropped below $1.34 yesterday to its lowest level this year. The pound could rally if Carney and colleagues sound confident that rates will rise in the next few months. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains what investors will be looking for: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury Select Committee testimony of Messrs Carney, Ramsden, Saunders and Vlieghe are also likely to be important benchmarks as to policymakers thinking with respect to the timing of such a move and in particular David Ramsden and Gertjan Vlieghe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking on it. There won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be any surprises around Michael Saunders view giving he voted to raise rates last month, and Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view tends to change as often as the weather forecast, but Ramsden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views are likely to be key given that he suggested in a February interview that rates would have to rise more quickly given recent increases in wages. Against that backdrop it was a bit of a surprise that the Bank of England then proceeded to revise their assessment for wages lower for the rest of this year, so his views on why the central bank has become less bullish on wages are likely to be important, as are Vlieghe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Unfortunately, deputy governor Ben Broadbent is not on the panel, so he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be called to account for last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gaffe (using the word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmenopause\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 when explaining how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy was past its peak). The Treasury Committee will kick off with a session with Gertjan Vlieghe, who is being reappointed for a second term at the MPC. Also coming up today..... We get public finance figures for April, which will probably show that Britain borrowed around \u00c2\u00a37bn to balance the books last month. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a healthcheck on UK manufacturing from the CBI. European markets are expected to be subdued, after Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 hit a record high yesterday. In the City, bike and car parts chain Halfords, publisher Bloomsbury and building society Nationwide are releasing results (more on that shortly). Plus, oil giant Shell is holding its AGM. Shareholders will be pushing the company to set tougher carbon reduction targets to help tackle global warming.

                "bodyText":"The Dow Jones stock index dropped 200 points on Tuesday after Donald Trump said he was not satisfied with US-China trade talks and cast doubt on whether a summit with North Korea, scheduled for 12 Jun in Singapore, will in fact take place. The losses, which came after a 300-point gain a day earlier on optimism that a trade war had been at least temporarily averted, came amid growing signs of discord within the US negotiating team. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 178.88 points to close at 24,834.41. The S&amp;P 500 declined 0.3% to 2,724.44. The Nasdaq composite lost 0.2% to close at 7,378.46. At a White House meeting with South Korean president Moon Jae-in, Trump was asked if he was pleased with the China trade talks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No, not really,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he remarked.

The divisions are now publicly surfacing as outright contradictions in official statements and well-informed leaks, sometimes made almost contemporaneously. On Monday, the president denied that US trade negotiators had made a deal with China over ZTE Corp, the controversial Chinese telecoms maker that has admitted to violating American sanctions on Iran and North Korea. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no deal,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump told reporters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see what happens.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments are only the latest sign of poor coordination, if not outright discord, within the US negotiating positions in the Chinese trade dispute. On Tuesday, Mnuchin told a Senate panel that US tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum imports will stay in place while negotiators put a potential trade war \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on hold\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those were not part of our discussions,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mnuchin said, in apparent contradiction of earlier administration indications that the US was prepared to discuss all the trade issues tabled during the escalating dispute. Inconsistencies in the US position were also evident over the weekend, as US trade representative Robert Lighthizer warned China that the Trump administration might yet impose tariffs, just hours after Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement that the US would hold off on tariffs while negotiations continued. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The president can always put tariffs back on,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mnuchin chimed in again on Monday.

On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that discord over a China strategy was behind the administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to put the imposition of tariffs on hold. That prompted former chief strategist and China hawk Steven Bannon to complain in a Bloomberg interview that the president had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153changed the dynamic regarding China but in one weekend Secretary Mnuchin has given it away\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

Signs of d\u00c3\u00a9tente between the US and China have decreased, reviving the great trade war fear, while the deterioration in Japanese and eurozone PMIs have sent chills down the spines of those hoping that the synchronised global expansion had further to run.

The strong increase in oil prices in the course of this month might have been one of the factors weighing on confidence. That said, the current confidence reading remains close to historical highs and based on long-run correlations, it is compatible with consumption growth between 2-2.5%. However, that is not what we have seen, as the current growth rate in consumption expenditure is closer to 1.5%.</p> <p>The disappointing performance of consumption in this recovery is not new. Since 2010, only three out of 32 quarters have seen year-on-year growth in consumer expenditure above overall GDP growth in the Eurozone. Although unemployment has now been falling five years in a row, it is still above pre-crisis levels. At the same time wage growth has remained very subdued. All of this means that consumption as a driving force in the growth story now comes even later in the cycle than usual. But for that to happen both employment and wage growth should have to pick up in the coming quarters and a further slide in sentiment should be avoided. A lot of conditions at this juncture. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we continue to see consumption as a growth support, but not strong enough to foster a genuine growth acceleration in the remainder of this year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b057cbce4b0a1f8347716e9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-23T14:41:53.762Z\">3.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Brent slips after surprise rise in US oil stocks</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After hitting $80 a share in recent days, oil prices have been slipping back and lost more ground after US stockpiles unexpectedly rose last week.</p> <p>US crude stocks rose by 5.8m barrels compared with forecasts of a decrease of 1.6m, showing demand was less than expected.

                "bodyText":"After a positive couple of days, European markets fell sharply as investors cashed in come of their gains amid renewed political concerns. President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negative comments on the US-China trade talks prompted renewed fears of a trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two biggest economies, while he also suggested the much hyped meeting with North Korea might not now take place. There were also some disappointing eurozone growth and consumer confidence figures, while Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new coalition government continued to unsettle investors. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 89.01 points or 1.13% lower at 7788.44 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.47% to 12,976.84 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.32% at 5565.85 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.31% to 22,911.71 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 1.12% at 10,025.0 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 124 points or 0.5%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Over in Turkey, the central bank has acted to stem a slide in the lira by raising one of its key lending rates to 16.5%. The bank lifted its late liquidity window rate by 300 basis points to 16.5%, in the wake of a more than 5% fall against the dollar earlier in the day, making a near 20% drop for the year. Investors have been nervous about President Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to tighten his grip on monetary policy. News of the rate increase saw the lira recover some ground to trade flat against the dollar. The FTSE 100 has closed below 7800 after reaching new peaks in recent days. Miners are among the leading fallers following President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negative comments about the progress of US-China trade talks. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said: Renewed fears over a potential trade war with China, in addition to concerns that OPEC could ease the self-imposed production cut in oil, sent the FTSE tumbling on Wednesday. Whilst the FTSE shed 1.3%, it was faring slightly better than its European peers thanks to the support of a significantly weaker pound. Commodity stocks dominated the lower reaches of the FTSE; miners, which are particularly sensitive to the health of the Chinese economy, were hit by concerns that a trade deal between the US and China may not ever be achieved, meaning trade tariffs and a potential trade war were suddenly, once again, very probable outcomes. Heading into the close of European trading, and markets have dropped sharply after the recent boom. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The atmosphere on equities this afternoon is gloomy, to say the least. The certainties of earlier in the week have ebbed away, and what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worse is that new worries have arrived to concern investors. Signs of d\u00c3\u00a9tente between the US and China have decreased, reviving the great trade war fear, while the deterioration in Japanese and eurozone PMIs have sent chills down the spines of those hoping that the synchronised global expansion had further to run. Eurozone data in particular keeps getting worse, and the longer this goes on the more fears will rise that this \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctransitory weakness\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is not so transitory after all. All is not yet lost, particular for European markets, which have risen so dramatically in recent weeks, but the lack of progress in US stocks is beginning to prompt the spread of fear to other parts of the equity space as well. Back with the flagging eurozone consumer confidence figures, and ING Bank economist Peter Vanden Houte says it is hard to see stronger growth in the region in the coming months: Eurozone consumer confidence fell in May to 0.2 from a downward revised 0.3 in April. The strong increase in oil prices in the course of this month might have been one of the factors weighing on confidence. That said, the current confidence reading remains close to historical highs and based on long-run correlations, it is compatible with consumption growth between 2-2.5%. However, that is not what we have seen, as the current growth rate in consumption expenditure is closer to 1.5%. The disappointing performance of consumption in this recovery is not new. Since 2010, only three out of 32 quarters have seen year-on-year growth in consumer expenditure above overall GDP growth in the Eurozone. Although unemployment has now been falling five years in a row, it is still above pre-crisis levels. At the same time wage growth has remained very subdued. All of this means that consumption as a driving force in the growth story now comes even later in the cycle than usual. But for that to happen both employment and wage growth should have to pick up in the coming quarters and a further slide in sentiment should be avoided. A lot of conditions at this juncture. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we continue to see consumption as a growth support, but not strong enough to foster a genuine growth acceleration in the remainder of this year. After hitting $80 a share in recent days, oil prices have been slipping back and lost more ground after US stockpiles unexpectedly rose last week. US crude stocks rose by 5.8m barrels compared with forecasts of a decrease of 1.6m, showing demand was less than expected. Gasoline stocks climbed by 1.9m barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration, rather than the anticipated 1.4m barrel drop. So Brent crude has dipped 0.73% to $78.99 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, is down 0.9% at $71.54. Eurozone consumer confidence was slightly worse than expected in May, according to the latest figures from the European Commission. Its eurozone consumer confidence index dipped from 0.3 points in April to 0.2 points, compared to forecasts of an unchanged figure. In the wider European Union, sentiment rose by 0.4 points to -0.1 in May. Some positive US economic data, with higher manufacturing and service sector figures. IHS Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preliminary manufacturing PMI for May rose from 56.5 in April to 56.6, a 44 month high. Its services business activity index climbed from 54.6 to a three month high of 55.7, while the composite index went from 54.9 in April to 55.7. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: The flash May PMI surveys point to an encouragingly solid pace of economic growth of 2.5- 3% with monthly job gains running at just over 200,000, though the interesting action is coming on the prices front. Input costs measured across both manufacturing and services are rising at the fastest rate for nearly five years, with the goods-producing sector seeing the steepest cost increases for seven years in recent months. Furthermore, supplier delivery delays, a key forward-indicator of inflationary pressures, have risen to the highest seen in the 11 year survey history. Rising demand has stretched supply chains to the extent that suppliers are increasingly able to demand higher prices. At the same time, higher oil and energy prices are pushing up firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 costs. Business optimism meanwhile remains at a three- year high, with companies commonly expecting rising demand to help drive business growth, setting the scene for further strong survey results in coming months. US markets have followed their European counterparts into negative territory, as optimism over the US-China trade talks faded after comments from President Trump, who also suggested the planned summit with North Korea may not go ahead after all. Ahead of the latest minutes from the Federal Reserve, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 125 points or 0.49% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.38% lower and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.59%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for some more outpourings from President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twitter account, and this time it appears to be a jobs promise: The pound continues to come under pressure, down 0.9% against the dollar at $1.3316 and losing more than 2% against the Japanese yen, the second biggest daily drop this year. The unexpected fall in inflation in April has made an interest rate rise in August less likely, according to many commentators. But not everyone agrees: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics correspondent Richard Partington on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures: UK inflation unexpectedly fell further last month to the lowest level in more than a year, as lower airfares provided some relief for cash-strapped Britons. The consumer price index dropped from 2.5% in March to 2.4%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Economists had expected the annual rate of growth in prices to remain unchanged. This decline will be welcomed by consumers under sharp pressure from rising prices since the Brexit vote, when a sudden drop in the value of the pound pushed up the cost of imported goods. While the impact from sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall has started to fade, economists reckoned higher fuel prices would force inflation to remain above the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of 2%. The latest fall raises fresh questions for Threadneedle Street, after the bank delayed raising interest rates earlier this month as a consequence of weak economic growth and inflation falling further than expected in March. The pound dropped by two-thirds of a cent against the dollar on foreign exchanges, reaching a five-month low of $1.3370. The ONS said airfares provided the biggest downward contribution, due to the timing of Easter. Airlines typically raise their prices around the holiday, although the ONS said it had found no impact this year because Easter fell between its March and April price collection periods. Soft drink prices had their biggest increase for this time of year, rising sharply in March and April following the introduction of the sugar tax. However, Mike Hardie of the ONS said many retailers had yet to pass on the impact of the levy to shoppers. More here: Back in the UK, new data has confirmed that London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market has come firmly off the boil. Property prices in the capital have fallen by 0.7% in the last year - making London the only part of the UK with negative house price inflation. Our personal finance editor Patrick Collinson explains: Property experts in London said buyers are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sensing blood in the water\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with sellers forced to cut prices steeply to ensure a sale. Jonathan Hopper of Garrington Property Finders said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153London is paying a painfully high price for its stellar run of price rises, and a correction is now under way in several parts of the capital. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sellers are being forced to trim their expectations, and astute buyers are increasingly sensing blood in the water.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: Breaking away from UK inflation, US media conglomerate Comcast has just announced it is preparing an all-cash offer for most of Twenty-First Century Fox - Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s media empire. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fascinating development, because Murdoch has agreed to sell 21CF to Disney for $52.4bn. Comcast has already tried to gatecrash the 21CF-Disney deal by bidding for UK broadcaster Sky, challenging Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own bid for Sky (it already owns a 39% stake). It is now upping the stakes and trying to thwart Disney by acquiring 21CF for itself. Comcast, which owns NBC Universal and Universal Pictures, says it will beat Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer, telling investors. Any offer for Fox would be all-cash and at a premium to the value of the current all-share offer from Disney. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide means the pound has now lost 10 whole cents against the US dollar since 16 April, when it was worth $1.43. This slide was triggered by Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who warned that weak economic data and Brexit uncertainty might hold back interest rate increases. The ongoing cabinet infighting over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future customs relationships with the EU has also weakened sterling, as it raises the chances of a hard Brexit. A weak pound drives up inflation, by making imports pricier., and several experts are predicting that inflation will rise again later this year. Joel Dungate, investment analyst at investment management and stockbroking firm Redmayne Bentley, explains: There are reasons why future inflation may move back up. In recent weeks, the price of oil has risen sharply and the value of the Pound has fallen again, both of which could drive up the costs of goods. In addition, recent data showed that wage growth had overtaken inflation, putting more money into the pockets of consumers. In theory this could increase demand and push prices higher.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brent crude oil hit its highest levels since 2014 last week, at over $80 per barrel. Rob Scammell, senior portfolio manager at Kempen Capital Management, believes this will hit consumers in the pocket. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oil price rises have not yet fed through to the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but this could be just a matter of time. With a further 10% rise in oil in sterling terms over the last month, it seems unlikely that this restraint can last for long. Could someone hand the pound a sponge and a towel? Sterling has now shed a whole cent against the US dollar to $1.3328 (still a 5-month low). Although the inflation rate dropped last month, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to note that the cost of living is still higher than a year ago. Each of the main areas - food, transport, housing costs - cost more in April 2018 than April 2017, as this chart shows: The report shows that food prices have risen 2.4% in the last year (including a 5.8% jump in fish prices). Soft drinks cost 6.2% more than in April 2017 (thanks to the sugar tax), while tobacco is 6.1% pricier. Clothing costs are up by 1.7%, while furniture is up 2.4%. Although air fares were 7.9% cheaper year-on-year (due to the early Easter), this was balanced out by a 4.2% increase in the cost of new cars. The pound has dropped to fresh five-month lows against the US dollar, as the chances of an early UK interest rate rise drop sharply. Sterling is now down almost a cent at $1.335, following the news that UK inflation dropped to 2.4% last month. However, Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG in the UK, predicts that the recent jump in the oil price could drop inflation up in the coming months. She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Prices of goods, including furnishing, household appliances, clothing and footwear, moderated in April. At the same time, the cost of services, including hotels and communication packages, were on the rise. This is partially a reflection of the diminishing impact on import prices from the sharp depreciation of the pound following the EU referendum, and increasing domestic inflationary pressures as the labour market tightens further and spare capacity wanes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With oil prices on the up and domestic price pressures unabated, we may not see further falls in inflation this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool agrees that the case for the Bank of England raising interest rates in August is fading. He explains: The 2.4% CPI inflation reading for April is already (slightly) lower than the most likely outcome (the so called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmode\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) of 2.43% predicted for the second quarter of 2018 by the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Inflation Report only a few weeks earlier. If CPI inflation falls further in May, they will most likely have to revise their inflation forecasts downwards which will obviously make the case for an August interest rate hike even weaker. Newsflash: Investors have slashed the chances of a UK interest rate hike in August to just a third: That underlines why the pound has fallen -- lower interest rates mean there is less incentive to hold sterling. David Lamb, head of dealing at Fexco Corporate Payments, says the City is right: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next interest rate rise hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just been kicked into the long grass, it has been sent sailing right out of the park. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With consumer inflation continuing to fall \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even in the face of rising fuel prices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Bank of England is running out of reasons to raise rates. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By contrast it has every reason to keep rates on hold. With CPI now falling to within touching distance of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target of its own accord, the last thing Mark Carney and Co will want to do is upset the faltering economy with a rate hike. Predictably, the government has welcomed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline in in inflation, while the opposition points out that real wages are still too low. For the government, financial secretary to the Treasury Mel Stride says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation falling and real wages on the rise means more money in people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pockets. We are helping families earn more and keep more of what they earn by cutting taxes for 31 million people and increasing the National Living Wage, worth an extra \u00c2\u00a32,000. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We must continue to ensure people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay outstrips inflation and build an economy that truly works for everyone. But Peter Dowd MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, says workers need more help: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation remains higher than the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target, while working people are struggling with real earnings still lower than in 2010, following eight years of Tory economic failure. The next Labour government will introduce a \u00c2\u00a310 per hour Real Living Wage to tackle the squeeze on wages, and build a high wage, high skill economy for the many, not the few.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also shows the impact of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new sugar tax. Prices for mineral waters, soft drinks and juices jumped by 2.8% in April, as some retailers passed on a new levy on beverages packed with sugar. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chunky increase, but not enough to prevent the wider inflation rate falling. Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the Office for National Statistics, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation continued to slow in April, with air fares making the biggest downward contribution, due to the timing of Easter. This was partially offset by the rise in petrol prices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Soft drink prices saw their biggest ever rise for this time of year, due to the introduction of the sugar tax. However, many retailers still haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t passed the impact of the tax onto shoppers. Martin Lane, managing editor of money.co.uk, has welcomed the drop in UK inflation to a 13-month low: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The nation can breathe a small sigh of relief. Inflation has fallen, so the pounds in our pockets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being stretched quite as far. The pressure on our wages is easing and the gap between inflation and wage growth has disappeared, easing the strain on our wallets. Something else consumers will be grateful for in the run up to holiday season, is the cost of items like food and airfares are slowing. But consumes should still be cautious, Lane adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With inflation at a one year low of 2.4% and no interest rises yet it may seem like a great time to spend spend spend. However, there are still interest rate rises looming on the horizon, so it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the time for you to splash your cash just yet. Use the good times to prepare your finances for when they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so great. Create a budget and spend 30 minutes looking at where you could make savings, from switching where you do your weekly shop to changing your energy supplier. Half an hour of research and admin could save you hundreds, if not thousands a year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kevin Doran, chief investment officer at stockbroker AJ Bell, warns that the drop in inflation may not last. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK consumers will be glad to see average wage increases starting to outstrip inflation and for the spending power of the pound in their pocket pick up further. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, the recent weakness in the pound and the rising oil price are a concern and could quickly reverse the drop in inflation. The jump in the oil price has started to hit petrol pumps, pushing up costs for UK consumers and businesses alike. In addition, the weak pound will be driving up input costs for many UK companies which will ultimately filter through to UK consumers in the coming months. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If inflation does increase, UK consumers will once again start to feel the pinch. Wage growth is currently only marginally ahead of inflation at 2.6% and interest rates on cash savings remain rock bottom so rising prices will weaken the spending power of both earnings and savings.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The drop in inflation in April suggests that real wages in the UK are still growing, at a modest pace. The latest data shows that average basic pay in Britain (excluding bonuses) rose by 2.9% per year in the first quarter of 2018. Total pay (including bonuses) rose by 2.6%, or barely ahead of the cost of living. Why did the unusually early Easter helped to pull inflation down last month? Easter Sunday fell on 1 April, two weeks earlier than in 2017. Airlines usually put prices up as people either jet off for holidays, or travel home - but this year, that rush began in March. The ONS explains: The timing of Easter in the middle of April 2017 contributed to air fares rising by 18.6% on the month whereas this year, Easter fell at the beginning of April before the price collection period and there was no price rise. Instead, fares fell slightly, by 0.2%, between March and April. Core inflation, which strips out volatile items, has fallen to just 2.1% from 2.3% in March. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another sign of cooling inflationary pressures. The pound has fallen to a new five-month low, as the City reacts to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpectedly weak inflation report. Sterling has shed three quarters of a cent against the US dollar to $1.3348, its lowest point since the end of December. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mandate is to keep CPI near to 2%; traders are calculating that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop in inflation reduces the chances of an interest rate rise in August. Food and men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothing prices helped to pull inflation down last month, alongside the impact of cheaper air fares. The Office for National Statistics says: Clothing and footwear also had a downward effect, with prices rising by 0.4% between March and April 2018 compared with a larger rise of 1.1% between the same two months a year earlier. The effect came mainly from men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothing. A smaller downward contribution came from food and non-alcoholic beverages. This was from a range of food products with the largest single effect from meat, where prices fell this year but rose a year ago, particularly for cooked ham. The downward contribution from food was partially offset by an upward effect from mineral waters, soft drinks and juices, where prices rose by 2.8% between March and April this year compared with a rise of 0.3% a year ago. Cheaper air fares helped to pull inflation down last month, and make up for higher petrol prices at the pumps. The ONS says: The largest downward contribution to the change in the rate came from air fares, which were influenced by the timing of Easter. Rising prices for motor fuels produced the largest, partially offsetting, upward effect. Newsflash: Uk inflation has fallen to a new one-year. The consumer prices index - the headline measure of inflation - rose by 2.4% in April, down from 2.5% in March. More to follow! Newsflash: Growth across the eurozone has fallen to its lowest level in 18 months. Data firm Markit reports that activity and new orders at eurozone companies is expanding at a slower rate this month, with a knock-on effect on confidence and job creation. German and France suffered the sharpest slowdown, Markit says. This pulled Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flash PMI index down to 54.1 in May, from 55.1 in April (the data is based on interviews with purchasing managers at eurozone companies) . Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says the eurozone economy is losing momentum after a strong 2017 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The May PMI brought yet another set of disappointing survey results, though once again a note of caution is required when interpreting the findings. While prior months have seen various factors such as extreme weather, strikes, illness and the timing of Easter dampen growth, May saw reports of business being adversely affected by an unusually high number of public holidays. Furthermore, despite the headline PMI dropping to an 18-month low, the survey remains at a level consistent with the eurozone economy growing at a reasonably solid rate of just over 0.4% in the second quarter. Piet Christiansen of Danske Bank says this weakness will deter the European Central Bank from tightening its monetary policy next month. Those trade worries have dragged Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 away from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record high. The blue-chip index is down almost 50 points at 7829, a drop of 0.6%. European stock markets are in the red this morning, as anxiety over a potential trade war between America and China ripples through trading floors again. Yesterday, president Trump declared that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnot satisfied\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with the progress of trade talks with China. This has fuelled worries that negotiations with Beijing could falter, just few days after the two sides stepped back from imposing tariffs on each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goods. Trump is also facing a backlash back home, over his efforts to protect Chinese telecoms firm ZTE from US sanctions. Republicans in Congress are drawing up legislation that would block the White House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to save ZTE - which could undermine Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to improve relations with Beijing: Economist Rupert Seggins predicts that the rising oil price has pushed transport inflation up, while food price inflation has slowed: BS Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we discover if Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living squeeze is getting any easier, when the latest UK inflation figures are released. Economists predict that consumer prices rose by 2.5% in the year to April, matching March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpectedly low inflation reading. That would mean wages are, thankfully, outpacing inflation - average basic pay grew by 2.9% in the year to March. Any drop in inflation would clearly be welcomed by UK consumer, who have suffered from falling real wages last year. As the Bank of England pointed out yesterday, households are \u00c2\u00a3900 poorer than expected two years ago. But, falling inflation would take pressure off the Bank of England to raise interest rates. Traders are split over whether the BoE will take the plunge in August, so they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be scrutinising the data closely. The pound has already weakened this morning to a five-month low. Sterling has shed half a cent against the US dollar to $1.3376, its lowest level since the end of December 2017. Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADS Securities, says a weak inflation report could sent sterling lower: Sterling rallied higher yesterday on the back of somewhat bullish remarks from BoE economist Gertjan Vlieghe that mentioned that he sees more rate hikes ahead but as we highlighted in our previous note the market doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to agree. The rally to $1.35 was treated as an opportunity to go short on the pound and if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report prints soft as expected sterling could break below $1.34 en route to the $1.33 floor. Royal Bank of Canada predict that CPI will be unchanged at 2.5%: Falling fuel prices helped inflation fall more than expected in recent months but that effect looks to have reversed in April with pump prices rising 1.6% m/m. There is some offset from the timing of Easter. We also get a new healthcheck on the eurozone economy this morning. Data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest survey of purchasing managers is expected to show steady growth this month. Plus, the latest oil inventory figures from America could move energy prices; last week they helped to push Brent crude over $80 per barrel.

But given the scale of the problems at Deutsche, you could imagine that this might be his last AGM - especially if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost-cutting plan doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deliver profitability. Umpteen thousands of Deutsche Bank workers will be more concerned about their own future, of course, following the news that more than 7,000 jobs are going. Fingers crossed for them. And on that note, goodnight. GW It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been quite a marathon AGM in Frankfurt today, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now coming to a head. Out of the mouths of babes and young shareholders.... The cancellation of the US-North Korea summit has sent a new bout of geopolitical jitters through the markets. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has closed 71 points lower at 7716, a drop of nearly 1%. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision has unnerved the City: With trade war fears with China still circulating, Trump aggravating the global community with potential tariffs on the automobile industry and now a cancellation of the Summit with North Korea the geopolitical climate is looking extremely fragile and this is clearly unnerving the markets. Traders are taking risk off the table, selling out of global equites whilst flows into safe havens such as the Japanese Yen and gold are on the up. Whilst the Japanese yen is over 1% higher, gold has pushed back above $1300 for the first time in over a week. Newsflash: Shares are dropping across the globe, after Donald Trump dramatically cancelled next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s summit meeting with North Korea. In a letter just released, the US president said he was cancelling the meeting with Kim Jong Un \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for the good of both parties, but to the detriment of the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Trump blames the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tremendous anger and open hostility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd shown by North Korea -- who called vice-president Mike Pence a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpolitical dummy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 earlier today. The president also warns North Korea that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear weapons arsenal is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153massive and powerful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; ratcheting up the tensions between the countries again. Wall Street traders have responded by driving shares down; the Dow Jones industrial average has shed over 130 points, or 0.5% Shares are also falling in London, with the FTSE 100 now down 42 points or 0.5% at 7746. Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM may drag on for some time yet, as there are scores of shareholders keen to have their say.... So in the meantime, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Associated Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest dispatch: Deutsche Bank is slashing thousands of jobs as Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest lender refocuses its global investment banking business on Europe and seeks to return to steady profitability. The bank said Thursday it would cut its workforce from 97,000 to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153well below\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 90,000 in order to achieve cost reduction targets. It said the reductions were already \u00e2\u20ac\u0153underway.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A chief target of the cutbacks is its stocks trading business, mostly based in New York and London. Head count at the equities business is to be reduced by about 25 percent. Those cuts will cost the bank some 800 million euros ($935 million) this year. The announcement came just hours before Board Chairman Paul Achleitner had to face disgruntled investors at the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual shareholder meeting. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has sagged and it paid only a small dividend of 11 euro cents per share last year. Achleitner drew rueful laughs from the assembled shareholders when he misspoke and said the dividend was 11 euros per share, a mistake he quickly corrected. Deutsche Bank has struggled with high costs, subpar earnings and troubles with regulators. The bank replaced its CEO in April after three years of annual losses and lagging progress in streamlining its operations. New CEO Christian Sewing has said the investment banking business would refocus on its European and German customer base and cut back on costlier and riskier operations where it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hold a leading position. Sewing said the bank was committed to international investment banking but must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153concentrate on what we truly do well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The new strategy means stepping back from several decades of global expansion in which the bank sought to compete with Wall Street rivals such as Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan Chase. Sewing replaced John Cryan in April with a mandate to accelerate the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrenching restructuring. It has suffered billions in losses from fines and penalties related to past misconduct. But progress in cutting costs has remained elusive. Sewing on Thursday affirmed the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal to hold costs to 23 billion euros this year and 22 billion euros next year. Deutsche Bank lost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac735m last year after U.S. tax changes cost it \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.4bn. Earnings in the first quarter of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac120m were sharply down from the year-earlier quarter. Addressing an audience of several thousands in Frankfurt, Achleitner said Cryan had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153set the ball rolling for fundamental change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but later displayed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shortcomings in decision-making and implementation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dear shareholders, you are right to expect the bank and its management to hit the targets it has set itself,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there are signs those targets are in jeopardy... then we on the supervisory board have to act swiftly and decisively.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubles and the turmoil surrounding Cryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure have put pressure on Achleitner as well. Cryan was forced to publicly push back against a media report that Achleitner was looking for a replacement, then left to twist in the wind for days before being shown the door. Achleitner brought Cryan to the bank in 2015 and thus in principle shares responsibility for the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy and performance since then. The selloff is gathering pace, as investors fret about the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac800m cost of the job cuts plan (which will hit profits this year). The WSJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul J Davies isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restructuring plan. He writes: Deutsche Bank is caught in a vicious spiral. It is losing profit-making staff, clients and investors and it desperately needs to restore confidence among all three Christian Sewing, the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new chief executive, didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mention anything at Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual investor meeting that will stem these losses. More radical ideas are needed. Deutsche Bank are threatening legal action against anyone who has leaks details of its board meetings. That follows media stories in March about boardroom unrest, ahead of John Cryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ousting as CEO. Meanwhile, the AGM cranks on.... Back in Frankfurt, Deutsche Bank shareholders voted to allow chairman Paul Achleitner to chair today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM, with 99% approval. Achleitner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reward? Facing more criticism from shareholders, who say he should step down. The Wall Street Journal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jenny Strasburg has the details: Newsflash: The number of Americans signing on for unemployment benefits has hit a seven-week high. The initial claims total jumped to 234,000 last week, more than the 220,000 which economists had expected. The previous week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure has been revised up too, from 220,000 to 223,000. These are still low figures in historical terms, reflecting the long-running improvement in the US labor market in recent years. Klaus Nieding of shareholder lobby group DSW has urged Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management to speed up its recovery plan. Nieding told today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM (via Reuters): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is high-time to ... end the years-long and still-popular \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDeutsche Bank bashing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and get to work finally getting our bank back on its feet after six long years of restructuring.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wowzers. Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are now down almost 4% -- quite a thumbs-down to Christian Sewing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost-cutting restructuring plan. Professor Brian Scott-Quinn, director of Banking Programmes at Henley Business School, suggests Deutsche Bank is trapped in a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspiral of decline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Scott-Quinn says that Deutsche should accept that the game is up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We really no longer need Deutsche Bank. There are already plenty of retail banks in Germany to provide competition and a good service to consumers. In investment banking it is the same as there are still good European investment banks which can provide a good service to German industry. It is almost impossible now to recover from years of mismanagement. At the same time, to attract the people they still need, they have to pay more than others where bonus prospects are much better. It is a spiral of decline and it started perhaps 20 years ago, even before the financial crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Barclays, along with other European banks, are perfectly capable of meeting the needs of German industry for corporate and investment banking services. Deutsche might be better acknowledging that its days as a global champion and as a German regional champion are over and that sometimes banks reach the end of their lives.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be easy to send Deutsche Bank shuffling off into retirement, of course. Apart from anything else, it has a famously huge exposure to derivative contracts -- estimated at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac46 trillion in 2016 (the potential losses on the portfolio would be rather lower). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a photo of Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new CEO, Christian Sewing, outlining his cost-cutting plans to shareholders: Oops indeed... Deutsche Bank shareholders are voting on whether to allow Paul Achleitner to actually chair today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM (a fairly crucial part of a chairman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s duties).... Deutsche Bank still haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t revealed exactly how many jobs are being cut under the restructuring announced today. All we know is that the headcount is being reduced from 97,0000 to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153well below\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 90,000. So that must be more than 7,000 jobs -- and could even be the 10,000 figure that was rumoured last night. Deutsche Bank would rather tell us that it will be serving 9,000 Frankfurter sausages to shareholders today, along with pretzels and slices of cake: Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price is continuing to slide, and is now down 2.5% in Frankfurt trading. Job cut announcements usually trigger a share price rally (investors usually ignore the grim implications for staff and celebrate the cost savings). Christian Sewing must be disappointed not to get a better reaction to his plan. One theory is that shareholders aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy that the restructuring will cost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac800m, making a dent in Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profitability this year. Wild scenes at the AGM.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really kicking off at the Deutsche Bank AGM: Shame the bank won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let us watch it remotely -- so much for CEO Sewing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to offer more clarity.... Deutsche Bank shareholders are now having their say at the AGM -- giving them the chance to demand chairman Paul Achleitner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation. Unfortunately, Deutsche Bank have suspended their live feed from the annual meeting - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s playing some lift muzak, not the sound of angry investors letting rip. Not a good look at all. Fortunately, some journalists are tweeting from the event, such as the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Patrick McGee: Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have now dropped into the red, down 0.7% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.80. That suggests investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced that Sewing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to slash jobs and reduce its investment banking operations will resolve all the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems - even though he insists the cost-cutting will help boost profitability. Six hundred investment bankers have left Deutsche Bank in the last seven weeks, according to CEO Christian Sewing. He has told today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM that the huge job cuts announced this morning are already being implemented: He says: This reduction is already fully underway, and so far, due to the considered way we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve handled this, we have not seen any meaningful revenue attrition.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sewing says that Deutsche will also consider hiring freezes, and cutting the use of contractors. He also says that staff want \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclarity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 -- so the bank is going to stop endlessly debating plans and actually \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexecute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 them. In conclusion, Sewing says he wants to make people proud to work for Deutsche, or invest in it, again -- a tacit admission of how the bank has fallen from grace in recent years. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job cuts mean that Deutsche Bank is abandoning its goal of competing directly with America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment banking giants, says Associated Press: New CEO Christian Sewing has said the bank would refocus on its European and German customer base and cut back on costlier and riskier operations where it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hold a leading position. Sewing said the bank was committed to its international investment banking operations but must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153concentrate on what we truly do well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The new strategy means stepping back from several decades of global expansion in which the bank sought to compete with Wall Street rivals such as Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan Chase. Sewing also warns shareholders that trading conditions remain tough, as it starts to cull workers. The Axeman Cometh, as CEO Christian Sewing starts to address Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM in Frankfurt. On today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge job cuts, Sewing says it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a difficult situation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current financial position leaves him with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no choice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We need to lay the basis for long-term profitability. Our long-term goal is to put Deutsche Bank back at the centre of society, adds Sewing, a little enigmatically. Oddly, Sewing also says it is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood idea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to write yourself a letter when you begin a new task - only to reveal that he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother when he became CEO! Newsflash: Back in the UK, retail sales have surged as shoppers returned to the high street last month. Retail sales volumes (the amount of stuff bought) jumped by 1.6% in April compared to March, when the Beast from the East dumped snow and ice on Britain. Encouraging news for the economy, and has sent the pound jumping by half a cent to $1.34 (away from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s five-month low). However, sales have barely risen over the last three months, suggesting British consumers remain cautious and cash-strapped. Rob Kent-Smith, Head of National Accounts says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Increases were seen across all sectors in April, except department stores. Department stores declined following relatively strong sales last month, when their online sales were boosted during the adverse weather. Over the longer-term, retail sales growth has slowed considerably, with increases in food, household goods and internet retailers being largely offset by declines across all other types of retailing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job cuts: Deutsche Bank, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest lender, is to cut more than 7,000 jobs globally, with its investment banking business in London likely to be hit. Deutsche said one in four jobs in its equities sales and trading business would be axed. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global headcount is expected to fall from just over 97,000 to well below 90,000. The firm said it would not provide a breakdown at this stage but that all regions will be affected. Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest investment banking operation is based in the City of London. It employs about 8,500 people in the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c mostly in London, with smaller operations in Birmingham and Bournemouth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and is one of the largest employers in the City. The news came a few hours before the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual shareholder meeting in Frankfurt, due to start at 9am London time, where the group is expected to face a protest from shareholders over its poor performance. Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new chief executive, Christian Sewing, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We remain committed to our corporate and investment bank and our international presence \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we are unwavering in that \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 However, we must concentrate on what we truly do well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When Sewing, the former co-head of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail banking arm, was appointed to replace his British predecessor, John Cryan, in April, he vowed to take \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tough decisions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to return the bank to profitability. Deutsche has suffered three years of losses and Cryan had been criticised for being too slow in pushing through cost-cutting measures. Paul Achleitner is now claiming that Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board should be praised for handing back some bonuses, in recognition of the problems at the bank. Achleitner reminds the AGM that eleven executives who served during the financial crisis agreed to wave \u00e2\u201a\u00ac38.4m of bonuses, even though an internal investigation found that no-one could be held personally responsible for Deutsche mistakes. Chairman Achleitner is trying to refute claims that he botched the change of CEO last month. He insist that Christian Sewing (who has worked at Deutsche Bank) is the right man to lead the company, rather than a heavy-hitting external candidate. Achleitner says Sewing is the right man, because he is a Deutsche man. Christian Sewing is our first choice..... He is Deutsche Bank through and through. True, but this hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prevented Sewing from deciding to lay off thousands of fellow Deutsche workers today. And it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t please critics who argue that Deutsche needs fresh blood. Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM is getting underway in Frankfurt. Chairman Paul Achleitner is getting his defence in early, telling shareholders that he hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planned to oust CEO John Cryan last month - but was forced to act due to a leak. Achleitner says: We had to act - even though it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t originally our intention to make our change so swiftly. Personally I had hoped that the reshuffle at the top of our bank would be made in a constructive spirit at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual general meeting.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He adds that Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management had failed to show sufficient discipline when sticking to strategy plans over the last year. This led to last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing loss (the third in a row), forcing the supervisory board to reshuffle its top team. Achleitner is now berating those who leaked details of the reshuffle over Easter - this damaged the bank, and forced the early appointment of Christian Sewing to replace CEO John Cryan. No wonder Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders are angry - the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value has slumped by a third in the last year. Dr. Hans-Christoph Hirt of Hermes Investment Management, a Deutsche Bank shareholder, blames chairman Paul Achleitner for the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes. Hirt tells Bloomberg TV that Achleitner has failed in three ways: Too much managerial change; with Deutsche Bank now on its fourth CEO under Achleitner No strategy to create value A lot of turnover on the supervisory board. These are all important responsibilities for a chairman, Hirt says, adding: In our opinion, he hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t done a particularly good job. However, Hermes won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t support today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no-confidence vote, as it believes Deutsche doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need any more disruption. We will give him one last warning - saying you need to do better, you are in the last-chance house. Protesters have gathered outside Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM in Frankfurt. They are calling on the bank to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153get out of coal, weapons and tax havens\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with a sign reading \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Deutsche Bank: Ich krieg die Krise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (literally,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m getting the crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). Angry investors will try to oust Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, Paul Achleitner, at its AGM today. Achleitner is under fire for failing to stop Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s track record of underperformance in recent years, and for a series of strategic zig-zags that have left shareholders dizzy. He now faces a vote of no-confidence from investors who believe his time is up. Achleitner made his name selling East German government assets following reunification in 1990. He has been chairman of Deutsche since 2012 - a time in which Deutsche has struggled to shake off the legacy of the financial crisis. The New York Times explains: Mr. Achleitner left Allianz in 2012 to become chairman of Deutsche Bank, overseeing the executives who run the company on a day-to-day basis. Deutsche Bank had grave problems. The culture was toxic. Large swaths of the business were poorly managed. Risks were not controlled. The bank had a tendency to needlessly antagonize regulators. It was caught up in just about all of the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst scandals: rigging interest rates, selling toxic mortgages, laundering money, violating sanctions. Rivals like UBS and Credit Suisse scaled back their investment banks in the wake of the financial crisis. But Deutsche Bank, with Mr. Achleitner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s backing, continued to try to play in the Wall Street big leagues. Mr. Achleitner insisted that Europe needed a counterweight to the big American investment banks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t watch out,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said in an interview with a German magazine in May 2015, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have the same American dominance that we already have in the internet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares in Deutsche Bank have risen 0.4% in early trading in Frankfurt, as investors react to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job cuts. Postbank, which is Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer banking unit, faces heavy job losses under today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restructuring plan. Last night, the Financial Times reported that workers in the US and the City are also at risk: The person familiar with the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans said that the 10,000 jobs included \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a few thousand jobs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s German retail division Postbank, which were already earmarked to be culled. The Wall Street Journal first reported the plans on Wednesday. Roughly half of the additional job cuts would be taking place in the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling investment bank, he added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most of the cuts will happen in the US, but London will see the axe too.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Deutsche is trying to convince investors that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s serious about returning to profitability after three years of losses, says the AFP newswire. It adds: The bank said it would slash leverage exposure in the investment bank by 10 percent of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1,050bn of leverage exposure reported at the end of the first quarter of 2018.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A Deutsche Bank spokesperson says that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job cuts will affect \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcall regions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, but they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give a detailed breakdown. However, it seems certain that the UK will be hit, as Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest investment banking office is in the heart of London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square Mile. Deutsche employs 8,500 people in the UK, making it one of the biggest employers in the City. The bank says: Deutsche Bank chooses to base its largest investment banking operations in the City of London, a centre of global flows of trade and wealth. We use this position as a global bank to keep our UK clients connected to markets, and help clients do business all over the world. It also has offices in Birmingham and Bournemouth. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Deutsche Bank has sent a shiver through the City by announcing that it plans to lay off thousands of staff worldwide. German\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank plans to cut its headcount to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwell below\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 90,000, from 97,000 today, as it shake up its corporate and investment banking operations. It says: The number of full-time equivalent positions is expected to fall from just over 97,000 currently to well below 90,000. The associated personnel reductions are underway. The move follows rising investor anger over Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance - the bank has posted three annual losses in a row, and sacked CEO John Cryan last month. Cryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successor, Christian Sewing, had pledged to cut back on risk operations and refocus on Europe - and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now wielding the axe. In a statement, Sewing says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We remain committed to our Corporate &amp; Investment Bank and our international presence, we are unwavering in that.... However, we must concentrate on what we truly do well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate and investment bank will face the brunt of the restructuring. The wide-ranging cuts include 25% headcount reduction at the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equities sales and trading business following a review of the business. The announcement comes just a few hours before Deutsche faces investors at its annual general meeting on Thursday. More details and reaction to follow.... Also coming up today: New retail sales figures will show whether UK consumers hit the shops in April, as the cold snap ended. Economists predict that sales jumped by 0.8% during the month, after a 1.2% decline in March. A weak reading, though, might weaken the pound and spark fresh concerns about the UK economy and consumer confidence.

They also continued to downplay the negative influence of adverse weather conditions on the figures, in contrast to the views of the Bank of England and indications from some business surveys that this was a more significant factor.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153On the expenditure side, subdued growth of consumer spending of just 0.2% was an important factor behind the slowdown, although retail sales bounced back strongly in April so we expect somewhat stronger growth in the second quarter. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business investment was also weak, falling by 0.2% in the first quarter, though perhaps surprisingly total fixed investment growth was relatively strong at 0.9%. This reflects the fact that both government investment and private housebuilding investment were recorded as rising by more than 3% in the first quarter, which is surprising given the weakness of construction output in this period. There could well be some revisions to come in the future to iron out these apparent inconsistencies in the stories told by the output and expenditure data on investment.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overall, the figures confirm the view that UK growth was subdued in the first quarter, though we continue to believe that this overstates the underlying weakness of the economy, bearing in mind the strong jobs growth we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen. We expect some recovery in the second quarter, with GDP growth of around 1.3% for 2018 as a whole.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today.

                "bodyText":"Time for a quick recap. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown has been confirmed, with new GDP figures showing the economy only expanded by 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Hopes that last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preliminary growth figures might be upgraded were dashed, with the data also showing growth of just 1.2% in the last year. Business investment shrank by 0.2% during the quarter, while household spending only rose by 0.2% - the weakest reading in over three years. The Office for National Statistics warned that the UK economy performed poorly in the first quarter. Manufacturing growth slowed to 0.2%, while the services sector only grew by 0.3%, and construction output shrank sharply. The ONS also stuck to its guns that last winter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s snow didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hurt particularly hurt growth - something the Bank of England disagrees with. The figures highlight how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate has lagged behind most rivals in the last year: Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool argues that the Office for National Statistics should get credit for not changing its growth estimates today: Praise for the ONS should be in order. Since the Brexit vote, the ONS has really stepped up its game as the median difference between the first and the revised reading for annual GDP growth is zero(!). In other words, the professional work of the ONS suggests that UK policymakers, already consumed by Brexit-related uncertainty, do not have to deal with big data revisions that would challenge further their policy decisions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, hopes that growth will pick up this year. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The ONS left their estimate of first quarter GDP growth unchanged at 0.1%, with construction and retailing being the main sources of weakness on the output side. They also continued to downplay the negative influence of adverse weather conditions on the figures, in contrast to the views of the Bank of England and indications from some business surveys that this was a more significant factor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On the expenditure side, subdued growth of consumer spending of just 0.2% was an important factor behind the slowdown, although retail sales bounced back strongly in April so we expect somewhat stronger growth in the second quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business investment was also weak, falling by 0.2% in the first quarter, though perhaps surprisingly total fixed investment growth was relatively strong at 0.9%. This reflects the fact that both government investment and private housebuilding investment were recorded as rising by more than 3% in the first quarter, which is surprising given the weakness of construction output in this period. There could well be some revisions to come in the future to iron out these apparent inconsistencies in the stories told by the output and expenditure data on investment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overall, the figures confirm the view that UK growth was subdued in the first quarter, though we continue to believe that this overstates the underlying weakness of the economy, bearing in mind the strong jobs growth we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen. We expect some recovery in the second quarter, with GDP growth of around 1.3% for 2018 as a whole.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting, and have a great weekend. GW Newsflash: US durable goods orders sank by 1.7% last month, a bigger fall than expected. The decline was driven by a 29% plunge in orders for civilian aircraft - a volatile area (as airlines typically make large orders occasionally). Strip that out, and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccore durable goods orders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rose by 0.9%, thanks to increased demand for cars, computers and other electrical devices. The opposition Labour Party blame government cutbacks for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown. Jonathan Reynolds MP, Shadow Treasury Minister, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This second GDP estimate confirms that this is the weakest Q1 growth since 2012 with business investment falling. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no good for the Chancellor to blame this on bad weather when even the ONS said in their initial estimate that this had a limited impact. The truth is that continued Tory austerity cuts are weakening growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The next Labour government will end austerity and provide the investment vitally needed to kick-start the economy, delivering rising living standards for the many, not the few.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Austerity has certainly has a negative impact on UK growth since the financial crisis (even the independent fiscal watchdog, the OBR, has said as much). But today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report also shows that government spending actually increased by 0.5% in the last quarter. The largest contributor to this increase was spending on public administration, the ONS says. Back in the financial markets, the euro has hit its lowest level since last November as political tensions swirl in Italy and Spain. The single currency has shed half a cent against the US dollar to $1.166, as investors worry that the eurozone crisis is flaring up again. The selloff was sparked by the news that Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy faces the prospect of a no-confidence vote. The opposition Socialist party called the vote this morning, accusing Rajoy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s party of staining Spanish democracy. The move came after 29 members of Rajoy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Popular Party were jailed in a massive corruption scandal. PP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former treasurer, Luis Barcenas, was jailed for 33 years. This has prompted calls for Rajoy to call fresh elections; the PM, though, is standing firm. News of the no-confidence vote has sent shares sliding in Madrid, where the Spanish IBEX index has fallen 2%. Spanish government bonds are also being sold off with gusto, sending the yield (interest rate) on the debt spiking. Italian bonds are also suffering, as investors worry that its new populist-controlled government will clash with Europe over fiscal policy. Newsflash: UK home furnishing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chain Dunelm has just dropped a nasty surprise on the City - a profits warning. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another sign that consumer spending in the UK is fragile, with wages only growing slightly faster than inflation. Dunelm has told shareholders that trading conditions have become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153materially more challenging\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in recent weeks, with fewer visitors to its outlets. Like-for-like takings at the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stores, which sells bedding, rugs, garden furniture, curtains and lights, are down 4.7% this quarter. Online sales, though, are up 43.7%. But even so, the company now believes profits will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moderately\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd below last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a3109.3m. Shares in the company have plunged by 9%. Nick Wilkinson, chief executive, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe have seen an unexpectedly challenging start to the fourth quarter, with continuing softness in the homewares market and reduced footfall to our stores. Wilkinson, who was only appointed in January, is due to leave the company in the autumn. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth report doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look too good when compared to other major economies. With quarterly growth of 0.1%, and annual growth of 1.2%, the UK is behind most of its rivals. For example, Germany expanded by 0.3% in Q1 2018, and by 2.3% over the last year. France also grew by 0.3% in the quarter, or 2.1% annually. Even Italy, a perennial eurozone laggard, beat Britain with quarterly growth of 0.3% and annual growth of 1.4%. America expanded at a faster pace - with growth of 0.6% in the quarter, and 2.9% over the year. Japan, though, bucked the trend by contracting by 0.2% in January-March. Our economics correspondent, Richard Partington, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report will fuel fears over the UK economy. He writes: The weakest household spending for three years and falling levels of business investment dragged the economy to the worst quarter for five years, official statisticians have confirmed. The Office for National Statistics confirmed its previous estimate that GDP growth slumped to 0.1% in the first quarter, while sticking to its view that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beast from the east\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had little impact. The latest figures will further stoke concerns over the strength of the UK economy, amid increasing signals for deteriorating growth as Britain prepares to leave the EU next year. Some economists, including officials at the Bank of England, thought the growth rate would be revised higher as more data became available. Threadneedle Street delayed raising interest rates earlier this month following the weak first GDP estimate, despite arguing that the negative hit to the economy from heavy snowfall in late February and early March had probably been overblown. Instead the ONS said it had seen a longer-term pattern of slowing growth in the first three months of the year. Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran blames the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (mis)handling of the Brexit negotiations for the slowdown in growth Moran, who backs the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum on the final deal with the EU, says uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is hurting the economy: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit is the backdrop for these poor figures and the government only has it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s itself to blame. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiations have been a total shambles. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Weak household spending and business investment are both factors directly related to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the European Union. Businesses are reluctant to spend on new offices and equipment while Brexit remains so uncertain. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This all shows why we need a final say on the Brexit deal.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation, sees \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfew crumbs of comfort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new growth figures. The weak 0.1% expansion was confirmed, with the detailed breakdown showing more of the same subdued growth in household spending and small declines in both exports and business investment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Taking together the forces of Brexit uncertainty, softening indicators in overseas markets and consumers that have yet to regain their mojo, it is hard to see what will spur some renewed momentum in the economy over the next couple of quarters. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report to justify an imminent rise in UK borrowing costs. Anthony Kurukgy, Senior Sales Trader at Foenix Partners, says interest rates could stay on hold at 0.5% until 2019. If Bank of England Governor Mark Carney was hoping for a surprise uplift in the latest GDP estimate this morning, he was dealt yet another blow. The latest reading, which came in line with market expectations (0.1%) reaffirms the UK Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views that a combination of stagnated growth and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsofter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data will only keep the likelihood of UK interest rate hikes on hold. With the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at the helm, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an argument to say that one interest rate rise in 2018 isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly a forgone conclusion. Howard Archer of the EY ITEM Club says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy seems to have lost momentum since the start of 2018: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures: While growth in the first quarter was clearly savaged by the Beast from the East, the extent of the slowdown has fuelled strong suspicion that there was a significant underlying loss of momentum in economic activity in addition to the weather impact The component breakdown of growth in the first quarter was also unappetizing - thereby reinforcing concerns - with consumer spending muted and business investment and exports both falling. However, net trade was flat as imports also fell The Office for National Statistics isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pulling its punches -- it says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy put in a poor performance at the start of this year. The ONS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of GDP Rob Kent-Smith said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overall, the economy performed poorly in the first quarter with manufacturing growth slowing and weak consumer-facing services. Oil and gas bounced back strongly, however, following the shutdown of the Forties pipeline at the end of last year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While there was some evidence of the poor weather hitting construction and high street shopping, this was offset to an extent by increased energy supply and online sales.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hotels and restaurants were the worst-performing part of the UK services sector in the last quarter. The ONS reports: transport, storage and communications increased by 0.4% business services and finance increased by 0.4% government and other services increased by 0.1% distribution, hotels and restaurants decreased by 0.1% On the industrial side, manufacturing grew by a modest 0.2% while energy production was stronger (because it was so chilly!). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning increased by 2.5% (2.3%) mining and quarrying increased by 2.2% (3.5%) manufacturing increased by 0.2% (unrevised) water supply industries decreased by 1.0% (negative 0.3%) Bloomberg points out that UK household spending rose at the slowest rate since 2015 - a sign that consumers are cautious. They say: U.K. consumer spending lost momentum in the first quarter and companies cut investment after severe weather swept the country. Household spending rose just 0.2 percent, the weakest performance in more than three years, and business investment declined 0.2 percent as snowstorms kept shoppers at home and hit construction projects. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction to the UK growth figures: The ONS also insists that we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame the Beast from the East for the slowdown. It says: While the bad weather had some impact on the economy, particularly in construction and some areas of retail, its overall effect was limited, with partially offsetting impacts in energy supply and online sales. However, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regional agents have a different view. They have reported that the snowy weather did have a notable impact on growth earlier this year. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures also confirm that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy actually shrank in the first three months, once you adjust for population changes. GDP per capita shrank by 0.1% between the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, the ONS says. Effectively we all became a little poorer. Newsflash: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official, UK growth slowed to just 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. The second estimate of GDP, just released, confirms that growth slowed to a five-year low in the first three months of this year. The Office for National Statistics reports that the pattern of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slowing growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd continued in the last three months, as consumer-facing industries suffered a slowdown. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building sector actually shrank during the quarter, while the dominant services sector grew by 0.3%. Importantly, the data also shows that business investment shrank in January-March 2018. That may be a sign that firms are reluctant to spend on new offices, factories and equipment while Brexit remains so uncertain. Household spending rose though. The ONS says: The services industries increased by 0.3% in Quarter 1 2018; while construction decreased by 2.7% in Quarter 1 2018. Household spending grew by 0.2%, while business investment decreased by 0.2% between Quarter 4 2017 and Quarter 1 2018. More to follow! One of the most disastrous retail ventures in recent years is over. Overnight, Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wesfarmers offloaded the Homebase DIY chain for a nominal \u00c2\u00a31, two years after buying it for \u00c2\u00a3340m - chucking out its furnishings and aiming for a hard-core DIY audience. My colleague Sarah Butler explains: Wesfarmers had intended to spend \u00c2\u00a3500m giving the Homebase chain a facelift, turning it into a British version of its successful Australian DIY chain Bunnings, which is famous for low prices and sausage sizzles. But in a tough UK market, where the entire DIY sector is under pressure and there is heavy competition from the likes of B&amp;Q, Argos, Wickes and the supermarkets, it has struggled to get a foothold and suffered heavy losses. Just in: German business confidence was unchanged in May, following five months of declines. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the Munich-based IFO economic institute, whose business morale index held steady at 102.2. That suggests that anxiety over trade wars has abated (or at least not got any worse). Last month, the first estimate of GDP showed that the UK economy only grew by 1.2% over the last 12 months. If that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmed at 9.30am, it means Britain has been one of the slowest-growing major economies in the last year. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 stock index has risen by 31 points (or 0.4%) to 7749 as traders await this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures. European markets are also gaining ground; Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC are up around 0.5%. The City is taking comfort that North Korea has said Kim Jong Un is still willing to meet Donald Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at any time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd even though next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s summit seems to be off. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures come just hours after the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governor warned of the economic costs of a disorderly Brexit. Mark Carney said that failure to agree a smooth transition deal would have damaging consequences. This could force the BoE to launch emergency measures, such as an interest rate cut. Carney told the Society of Professional Economists in London last night that a Brexit crisis could force the Bank to allowing inflation to spike (because the pound would tumble), rather than hiking interest rates and sending the economy sliding into recession. As Carney put it: From a monetary policy perspective, the bank is ready for Brexit. Although the exact policy response cannot be predicted in advance, observers know from our track record that, in exceptional circumstances, we are both willing to tolerate some deviation of inflation from target for a limited period of time and that there are limits to that tolerance Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Never mind GDPR. What really matters today is GDP - and whether Britain really slipped to the brink of stagnation at the start of 2018. Updated growth figures from the Office for National Statistics will give a better insight into the state of the UK economy. They will probably confirm that growth fell to a measly 0.1% in January-March, the weakest quarterly growth rate in five years. The data will also give a more detailed breakdown of the economy, showing how business investment and household spending changed. Economists had originally expected that the economy expanded by 0.4% in Q1, so last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first estimate of GDP was a nasty shock. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that the growth rate could be revised up from 0.1% to 0.2% this morning, which would bring some cheer to the markets. Indeed, the Bank of England has pretty much said that it thinks the original data is too gloomy, and that bad wintery weather hit growth. But there are also worries that weak consumer spending, and uncertainty over Brexit is hurting the economy. A weak growth report would also reduces the chance of UK interest rates rising in the next few months, and hit the pound. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second estimate of Q1 GDP is expected to come in at 0.1% unchanged from the previous estimate and given the poor weather in March it would be a surprise if any of the other indicators were revised higher, though we could see exports revised up to 0.5%. Also coming up today: European markets are expected to recover some of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses, as fears over North Korea abate slightly. Overnight, Pyongyang signalled it was still willing to hold a summit with the US - despite Donald Trump cancelling June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. We also get a new estimate of German business confidence, and new US durable goods sales (machinery, large electrical devices and the like).

At the same time there has been a noticeable slowdown in growth across the EU this year which will also continue to weigh on sentiment towards both Italian and EU wide assets. Throw in heightened geopolitical risks in other parts of the world such as the US and Asia, rising interest rates and the reduction in central bank support through quantitative easing, then the outlook for financial markets is far less certain than over the past few years. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b0d2c65e4b003306905ffa2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-29T10:35:16.055Z\">11.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 latest report on the volatility in the markets:</p> <blockquote> <p>A deepening political crisis in Italy, the euro zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third biggest economy, fuelled a heavy selloff in Italian assets and the euro reminiscent of the euro zone debt crisis of 2010-2012.</p> <p>Short-term Italian bond yields, which move inversely to price, were set for their biggest one-day jump since 1992, while Italian and wider euro zone banking stocks were set to suffer their worst day since August 2016.</p> <p>Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president has set the country on a path to fresh elections by appointing a former International Monetary Fund official as interim prime minister, with the task of planning for snap polls and passing the next budget.</p> <p>The concern is that fresh elections could deliver an even stronger mandate for Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-establishment, eurosceptic politicians.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The spectacular rise of 2-year yields in Italy this morning reflects break-up or redenomination fears,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Martin van Vliet, ING Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior fixed income strategist, said.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b0d2aa9e4b022a3efa0c682\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-29T10:29:12.595Z\">11.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier Italy sold \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.5bn worth of six month bonds, but at the highest yield for more than five years.</p> <p>Amid the turmoil surrounding the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political future, it sold the expected amount of bonds but at a yield or interest rate of an average 1.213%.

Whilst a lot has already been written on the topic, the moves this morning warrant attention as we are seeing some incredible price action in Italian bonds with the market moving at speeds not seen since the worst of the Eurozone debt crisis. </p> <p> The big question is whether this is just an Italian problem or one that risks significant spill-over into the rest of Europe. The one thing that has become apparent is that markets treated the election result with excessive calm and has been jolted by the populists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 success in agreeing terms...</p> <p>For now this looks contained largely to Italy, but the contagion risks mount. Italian bond moves are isolated and whilst the euro has given some ground again it is mounting a firm defence above 1.15 for the time being. Italian stocks today are underperforming Europe, with the FTSE MIB falling more than 3% before bargain hunters produced a slight paring of the losses. However, the situation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which increasingly is a crisis in the making \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is seeing investors take risk off the table and stocks across Europe are 1-2% lower.</p> <p>Italian bond yields have risen sharply and spreads are widening with Bunds. The Italian 2-year yield has jumped above 2% and has kept on going, approaching 2012 sovereign debt crisis territory at 2.4%. Spreads with 10-year Bunds are now at the widest since 2013 and the market is moving before our eyes.</p> <p>Eurozone breakup risks are higher, although they remain small overall (unless you take the long term view that every empire falls at some point and the EU is no different). If snap elections produce a clearer mandate for the populists and they succeed again in forming a government, Italy heads for a collision for the EU shortly after. EU and Eurozone rules are far too inflexible to handle radical domestic policy shifts of this kind and based on experience of Brexit negotiations, Italy could not hope for the EU rule makers to back down. A disorderly Italexit would be nasty enough but as a founding member of the club it would be a moment that the bloc would not recover from.</p> <p> The chief risk is that the developments over the last week lead to a snap election that becomes in effect a referendum on membership of the euro. The two main populist parties may well step up their anti-euro, and anti-EU positions.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b0d1522e4b069235b5cda3b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-29T08:59:24.909Z\">9.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Italy a few steps away from losing trust - central bank boss Visco</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The head of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has said the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is recovering and growth is increasingly self sustained, but said any move to weaken the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances could undermine confidence and years of valuable reforms.</p> <p>Ignazio Visco, speaking to the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual meeting, made the comments amid the political turmoil which is likely to lead to a new election, with euro membership likely to be among the main issues for voters.</p> <p>Visco added that moderate growth and gradually rising inflation were the most likely path for Italy.</p> <p>He said he expected Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s smaller banks to come up with plans to tackle non-performing loans by the autumn, with a quarter of them showing a negative return on equity.</p> <p>He said Italy must press on with reforms, and there were no short cuts for cutting debt. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are only ever a few short steps away\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from a serious risk of losing trust, he said.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-05-29T11:25:52.999Z\">at 12.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b0d12abe4b022a3efa0c592\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-29T08:51:16.581Z\">9.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The market rout is intensifying, in the wake of the Italian political crisis.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 is now down nearly 120 points or 1.5%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 1.6% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has fallen 1.87%.</p> <p>As for Italy, the FTSE MIB is now down 3.2%.

                "bodyText":"The turmoil over the failed Italian coalition, with the prospect of new elections in the autumn, has revived memories of the crisis which engulfed the eurozone over Greece. Investors have taken fright that Italy might effectively vote to leave the euro, sending markets and bond prices tumbling. And on top of that, there is concern over Spain, where the government faces a no confidence vote on Friday. Various comments from EU and ECB officials have hardly helped calm the mood, while separately billionaire financial George Soros has warned the EU faces \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an imminent existential threat.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meanwhile said Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating could be downgraded if the next government does not get to grips with its huge debt pile. Oh yes, and Italian consumer confidence was weaker than expected in May. With all that, Italian bonds suffered their worst day since 1992, with two year bond prices falling and yields surging more than 150 basis points to 2.73%. They have since recovered slightly to 2.36%. Stock markets were also under pressure although again they are off their worst levels, with Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB down 2.3% at the moment. Elsewhere Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 1% and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex has lost 2.3%. The FTSE 100 has fallen 1.25% while on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently.0.8% lower. The euro dropped to a new six and a half month low against the dollar of $1.1510 before regaining some ground to $1.1580. But the pound failed to benefit, remaining virtually flat against the euro and down 0.26% against a strengthening dollar. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Could this be a slap on the wrist from the President of the European Council for some of the earlier comments from the ECB and EU? The global market slump in the wake of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest political problems has spread to the US, with Wall Street opening sharply lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 190 points or 0.7% while the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.6% at the start of trading and the Nasdaq Composite losing 0.4%. US Treasury bonds, one of the perceived havens for investors in times of turmoil, have moved higher, with the 10 year yield conversely at the lowest level since April. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just Italy causing concern of course: At times like this it is worth looking at the VIX index - the so-called fear index which shows investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of near term market volatility. So far today it has jumped 17% to 15.49, the highest level since the beginning of May. Unless there is something lost in the translation here, this appears to be another unhelpful comment, this time from EU commissioner G\u00c3\u00bcnther Oettinger: As the Italian crisis continues, billionaire financier George Soros is in a negative mood about the EU in a speech today: As the Italian crisis grips investors, markets had become complacent in the wake of the QE support programmes from the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading central banks, says Premier Asset Management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jake Robbins: The Presidential rejection of a democratically elected coalition government has thrown Italy into a constitutional crisis, one made worse given it was because of the coalition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti EU beliefs. In echoes of the euro crisis earlier this decade, these events could ultimately threaten the future of the EU, or at the very least, question it in its current form. Whilst it is no surprise that Italian yields have soared and equities plunged as investors reprice the actual risk of holding Italian assets, this crisis has been on the cards for some time and shows how complacent financial markets have become in the era of quantitative easing. At the same time there has been a noticeable slowdown in growth across the EU this year which will also continue to weigh on sentiment towards both Italian and EU wide assets. Throw in heightened geopolitical risks in other parts of the world such as the US and Asia, rising interest rates and the reduction in central bank support through quantitative easing, then the outlook for financial markets is far less certain than over the past few years. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 latest report on the volatility in the markets: A deepening political crisis in Italy, the euro zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third biggest economy, fuelled a heavy selloff in Italian assets and the euro reminiscent of the euro zone debt crisis of 2010-2012. Short-term Italian bond yields, which move inversely to price, were set for their biggest one-day jump since 1992, while Italian and wider euro zone banking stocks were set to suffer their worst day since August 2016. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president has set the country on a path to fresh elections by appointing a former International Monetary Fund official as interim prime minister, with the task of planning for snap polls and passing the next budget. The concern is that fresh elections could deliver an even stronger mandate for Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-establishment, eurosceptic politicians. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The spectacular rise of 2-year yields in Italy this morning reflects break-up or redenomination fears,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Martin van Vliet, ING Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior fixed income strategist, said. Earlier Italy sold \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.5bn worth of six month bonds, but at the highest yield for more than five years. Amid the turmoil surrounding the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political future, it sold the expected amount of bonds but at a yield or interest rate of an average 1.213%. At the previous auction for this maturity the yield was negative at -0.421%. There are more sales due on Wednesday - up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6bn in five year and ten year bonds. US markets are expected to open lower in the wake of the European declines, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average forecast to lose around 190 points at the start of trading. Not sure this is an entirely helpful remark from the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vitor Constancio. When asked about any ECB help for Italy he is quoted as saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Italy knows the rules. They might want to read them again.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reuters reports: Any intervention by the European Central Bank to help Italy in the event of liquidity problems must meet the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mandate and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certain conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, its outgoing Vice-President was quoted as saying on Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Italy knows the rules. They might want to read them again,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Vitor Constancio told Spiegel magazine in an interview, according to a pre-release, when asked if the central bank would intervene if needed and rescue Italy from insolvency. The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never-used emergency bond buying scheme -- known as Outright Monetary Transactions or OMT -- is a potential tool to help Italy but comes with a long list of conditions. For a country to be eligible for OMT, it must be in a European Financial Stability Facility/European Stability Mechanism adjustment or precautionary programme and support must be warranted from a monetary policy perspective. A deepening political and constitutional crisis in Italy, the euro zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third biggest economy, fuelled a sharp rise in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s short-term borrowing costs on Tuesday and renewed selling in the euro and stocks. Back with the markets, and analyst Joshua Mahony at IG, says: With markets transfixed on affairs in Italy and Spain (amid a vote of no confidence for Rajoy), we are seeing a sharp shift into safe haven assets, driving the Japanese yen and gold prices higher in recent days. FTSE 100-listed gold producers Fresnillo and Randgold are the best performers in the bluechip index in early trade amid a shift into gold. We often see stocks benefit when currencies come under pressure, but the flight to safety this morning means the euro and the pound are also getting another pounding alongside the stock market declines. Away from markets for a moment, and some good news for Pret A Manger employees after the takeover deal, as tweeted by the chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive: Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, which recently put Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Baa2 credit rating on review for a downgrade, has commented on the latest developments. It said Italy was likely to be downgraded if the next government pursued fiscal policies which were not sufficient to place the public debt ratio on a sustainable downward trajectory in the coming years. Its rating could be confirmed if there was an ambitious programme of structural reform by the next government. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, says: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a steep selloff in risk assets as the Italian political troubles deepen, with investors seemingly dumping their exposure to Italy. Whilst a lot has already been written on the topic, the moves this morning warrant attention as we are seeing some incredible price action in Italian bonds with the market moving at speeds not seen since the worst of the Eurozone debt crisis. The big question is whether this is just an Italian problem or one that risks significant spill-over into the rest of Europe. The one thing that has become apparent is that markets treated the election result with excessive calm and has been jolted by the populists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 success in agreeing terms... For now this looks contained largely to Italy, but the contagion risks mount. Italian bond moves are isolated and whilst the euro has given some ground again it is mounting a firm defence above 1.15 for the time being. Italian stocks today are underperforming Europe, with the FTSE MIB falling more than 3% before bargain hunters produced a slight paring of the losses. However, the situation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which increasingly is a crisis in the making \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is seeing investors take risk off the table and stocks across Europe are 1-2% lower. Italian bond yields have risen sharply and spreads are widening with Bunds. The Italian 2-year yield has jumped above 2% and has kept on going, approaching 2012 sovereign debt crisis territory at 2.4%. Spreads with 10-year Bunds are now at the widest since 2013 and the market is moving before our eyes. Eurozone breakup risks are higher, although they remain small overall (unless you take the long term view that every empire falls at some point and the EU is no different). If snap elections produce a clearer mandate for the populists and they succeed again in forming a government, Italy heads for a collision for the EU shortly after. EU and Eurozone rules are far too inflexible to handle radical domestic policy shifts of this kind and based on experience of Brexit negotiations, Italy could not hope for the EU rule makers to back down. A disorderly Italexit would be nasty enough but as a founding member of the club it would be a moment that the bloc would not recover from. The chief risk is that the developments over the last week lead to a snap election that becomes in effect a referendum on membership of the euro. The two main populist parties may well step up their anti-euro, and anti-EU positions. The head of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has said the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is recovering and growth is increasingly self sustained, but said any move to weaken the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances could undermine confidence and years of valuable reforms. Ignazio Visco, speaking to the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual meeting, made the comments amid the political turmoil which is likely to lead to a new election, with euro membership likely to be among the main issues for voters. Visco added that moderate growth and gradually rising inflation were the most likely path for Italy. He said he expected Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s smaller banks to come up with plans to tackle non-performing loans by the autumn, with a quarter of them showing a negative return on equity. He said Italy must press on with reforms, and there were no short cuts for cutting debt. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are only ever a few short steps away\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from a serious risk of losing trust, he said. The market rout is intensifying, in the wake of the Italian political crisis. The FTSE 100 is now down nearly 120 points or 1.5%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 1.6% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has fallen 1.87%. As for Italy, the FTSE MIB is now down 3.2%. Italian two year bond yields are on track for the biggest one day rise for more than 16 years. But the yields on UK gilts have fallen to their lowest levels this year as investors seek havens for their cash amid the turmoil. The euro is also being hit, down 0.3% against the dollar and below $1.16 for the first time in six and a half months. But the pound is not benefiting much, flat against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1451 and down 0.6% against the dollar to $1.3220, its lowest since November. It may not have taken in the latest developments, but the recent political uncertainty in Italy has hit consumer confidence. The confidence index fell to 113.7 in May, the lowest since August last year and below the 116.5 level expected by analysts. The April figure came in at 116.9. The business morale index fell from 105.0 to 104.7 in May, the worst level since January last year. Time to call this a crisis, says Kit Juckes of Societe Generale: Having rejected the NL/5-star leaders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 nomination of Paolo Savona as [Italian] Economy Minister, President Mattarella has called on Carlo Cottarelli to form an interim administration. His chances of succeeding are slim and elections are likely in September. Which leaves us 3-4 months of uncertainty ahead of a vote that may be seen as a referendum on Euro-membership. The threat of further rating downgrades hangs over the BTP [Italian bond] market (and is largely priced-in), and the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for providing forward guidance on policy normalisation are up in the air. Which means that the risk of EUR/USD reaching 1.10 by the end of the summer is significantly higher than the possibility of a recovery to 1.20. With 10-year Bund yields under 30bp this morning, and the BTP/Bund spread heading towards 3% at a rate of knots, we should now call this a crisis. The 2010 and 2011-2012 Euro crises took EUR/USD down by 20-25%, which may put the 10% we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen so far in context. Both those falls were almost completely reversed when the crisis passed, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for another day, even if that day comes sooner as result of these developments. EUR/USD 1.1550 is the next key psychological level but I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it holding. 1.0860, the springboard from which the euro rallied after the French election, should hold.... As expected the threat of a new eurozone crisis - this time involving Italy and/or Spain rather than Greece - has sent markets sharply lower in early trading. The FTSE 100 is down 0.78% at 7670, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dropped 0.6% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac 0.69%. As for the two countries in the spotlight, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB has lost 1.9% to hit its lowest level since August last year, while the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking index is down3.4% at a new 13 month low. Meanwhile Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex is off 1.29%. More on the sale of ubiquitous sandwich chain Pret A Manger: Pret a Manger, the British sandwich shop chain, is being taken over by the German-controlled company behind Krispy Kreme donuts and Kenco coffee in a deal worth more than \u00c2\u00a31.5bn. Bridgepoint, the UK-based private equity firm, has agreed to sell Pret to the investment group JAB Holdings, which has been rapidly acquiring companies linked to the coffee market in recent years. Pret is based in London, where it was started by the entrepreneur Julian Metcalfe and his friend Sinclair Beecham with one shop in 1986. Metcalfe went on to create the Itsu restaurant chain and Metcalfe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s skinny popcorn. Having expanded rapidly in recent years, opening 50 shops in the past year alone, Pret has more than 500 stores, generating revenues of \u00c2\u00a3879m. It also has stores in the US, China and Dubai. The company is trying to attract more British workers as it prepares for potential staff shortages after Brexit and seeks to expand further in the US and internationally. The full story is here: Back with Italy, and bond yields are continuing to leap higher: The unscheduled trading statement from Dixons Carphone shows it now expects profits of around \u00c2\u00a3300m in its next financial year, well below the \u00c2\u00a3387m expected by analysts. It forecast the UK electrical market would contract, and new broom chief executive Alex Baldock - eight weeks in the job - seemed to take a swipe at previous management when he said: We will correct recent underinvestment in both our colleague and customer proposition. In the coming year we expect to make a cost investment of around \u00c2\u00a330m in these areas across the UK and Ireland, giving our colleagues the right tools and the customer an improved experience. It said it expected cost increases in UK electricals, notably the National Living Wage and IT depreciation. On mobile, Baldock said the company had taken early action with the planned closure of 92 Carphone Warehouse standalone stores this year. Its shares have slumped 27% to 170p on the news. Retail analyst Nick Bubb said: The share price of Dixons Carphone has been recovering strongly since new CEO Alex Baldock took over, on the back of vibes about strong trading ahead of the World Cup. But, out of the blue, the company has come out with a profit warning today! The issue appears to be that although headline of PBT of \u00c2\u00a3382m for y/e April will hit City expectations that will be only down to an odd one-off \u00c2\u00a325m systems implementation benefit, given gross margin pressures in Q4. And the company has come out with detailed guidance for the year that has just started, y/e April 2019, warning of a fall back to headline PBT of \u00c2\u00a3300m! That is partly because of the impact of one-off items, but also reflects continued problems in the mobile phone business (despite the much-vaunted talks with the networks about better terms) and, amazingly, a \u00c2\u00a330m hit to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153correct recent underinvestment in both our colleague and customer proposition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. After all that, investors may not be in much of a mood to listen to the new CEO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assertion that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153though there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty to fix, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all fixable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd... Indeed. Italian bond yields have jumped on the political turmoil engulfing the country, with the two year yields rising above 1% for the first time since 2014. The euro continues to come under pressure, falling to its lowest level since November 2017 against the dollar. It is down 4% so far this month at $1.159, and is also at a new six and a half month low against the Swiss franc. It has fallen 0.1% against the pound. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a little while, but the eurozone looks like it could be heading towards another period of turmoil. And it is not Greece this time. Both Italy and Spain are rattling stock markets, the former following the collapse of its eurosceptic coalition between the Five Star Movement and Lega party and the latter facing a vote of no confidence in the government on Friday. Italian president Sergio Mattarella has vetoed the proposed anti euro candidate for finance minister, Paolo Savona, and appointed Carlo Cottarelli, a former International Monetary Fund official, as interim prime minister. In some ways the veto on Savona should be good for the euro, but any benefits have been overshadowed by the political turmoil caused and the prospect of new elections later this year. Here is our story on the latest political developments: Meanwhile in Spain prime minister Mariano Rajoy is facing the no confidence vote after a Spanish corruption case involving members of the ruling party. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: The overriding problem for investors is that these are two of the largest, most important economies in the eurozone. Euro traders are aware that the potential fallout from Italy mainly, but also this Spanish headache, dwarfs the fallout which could have been following the Greek debt saga and as a result the euro has fallen heavily out of favour and has continued to decline overnight. With potential elections just around the corner in both Spain and Italy, a summer of volatility now seems almost a given. So with the euro weakened by these new uncertainties, European stock markets are expected to open lower: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly quiet day on the economic front but there are a couple of bits of corporate news. Sandwich chain Pret A Manger is being sold for around \u00c2\u00a31.5bn while Dixons Carphone has issued a profits warning. More to come on this....",

                "bodyText":"The United States and its traditional allies are on the brink of a full-scale trade war after European and Canadian leaders reacted swiftly and angrily to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium producers. The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, promised immediate retaliation after the US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, said EU companies would face a 25% duty on steel and a 10% duty on aluminium from midnight on Thursday. Europe, along with Canada and Mexico, had been granted a temporary reprieve from the tariffs after they were unveiled by Donald Trump two months ago. However, Ross sent shudders through global financial markets when he said insufficient progress had been made in talks with three of the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s traditional allies to reduce America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit and that the waiver was being lifted. Wall Street slumped as the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down more than 250 points as investors sold off shares in manufacturers and corporations with global reach. Shares across Europe also declined. The move from Washington \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which comes at a time when Trump is also threatening protectionist action against China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c triggered an immediate and angry response from Canada, Brussels and from individual European capitals.

There is an eerie sense of calm after all the ructions caused by the Italian political crisis, with investors hoping a new government can be formed after all without the need for another election campaign. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Not too long ago, a coalition government in Italy consisting of two eurosceptic populist parties was a feared and unlikely prospect that many believed would majorly concern investors. While much of this remains true, it is also currently viewed as the least unattractive and feasible outcome for markets, with the other alternative being fresh elections and the possibility that the parties are given an even stronger and potentially less euro-friendly mandate. </p> <p>Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s President, Sergio Mattarella, may have believed he was acting in the best interest of the country when he rejected to populists choice of Finance Minister but the reality is that in doing so, he has given both parties more ammunition with which to attack the euro. Mattarella has already been accused of acting on behalf of Germany and others while Brussels has been accused of interference, it all feeds very well into the eurosceptics message that the country no longer even has control over its domestic politics.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b35d86c9efd92c20581531724ce127c1ec69232\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b35d86c9efd92c20581531724ce127c1ec69232/0_22_5309_3184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Quirinale presidential palace in Rome.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Quirinale presidential palace in Rome.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincenzo Pinto/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Should the country move straight on to another election, both Five Star Movement and Lega will look to take advantage of any fury linked to perceived meddling and could significantly add to their numbers.

With both parties now in discussions again, there is a hope that the political impasse can be resolved which is helping to lift sentiment in the near-term.

While we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still far away from the days of the debt crisis and the risk of a breakup, a second election was being portrayed as a vote on the euro which seems drastic and probably overhyped but it certainly hit the single currency. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b0fd09ce4b0033069061649\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/stephanie-kirchgaessner\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-31T10:39:41.033Z\">11.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Markets are still managing to hold onto their gains - just - on hopes that the Italian political crisis can be resolved before too long.

And, as selling price expectations have been weakening in the recent soft patch of economic data, it does not seem like we are at the start of a marked increase in inflation.</p> <p>The understatement of recent months was also helped by a weakening euro, which dampened some of the effects from the higher oil price. Petrol prices jumped significantly in May, on the back of an oil price of around $80 per barrel for most of the month and a weakening euro.</p> <p>Be careful what you wish for, ECB. After years of pushing for inflation to return to just under 2%, it could not have come at a more difficult time. Eurozone financial market turmoil has returned because of Italian politics this week and it is very difficult to see how the Italian political situation is going to play out. Economic data has been weakening over the past months, and the ECB is eager to determine whether this is just a soft patch. Finally, the US seems on the brink of announcing tariffs on European steel and aluminium, which clouds the exports outlook and could have an additional inflationary impact if the trade conflict gets out of hand.</p> <p>The ECB therefore now has to decide whether it will provide certainty straight away by announcing an extension to QE or take a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wait and see\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd approach at the June meeting.

Commenting on the credit figures, he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not something markets or analysts typically spend much time looking at each month, but the unexpectedly sharp fall in consumer credit in March was probably a key factor in the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to keep rates on hold in May.</p> <p>Admittedly the reasons for this sudden decline were fairly unclear, and the latest figures released today show that the amount of unsecured consumer credit supplied fully recovered in April, rising by \u00c2\u00a31.8 billion. This tentatively suggests that the fall was simply a blip, perhaps related to the wider economic slowdown in March (although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not entirely clear why the bad weather would have resulted in such a sharp change).</p> <p>We still think this is a story worth keeping an eye on over the next couple of months. A net 39% of banks said they tightened up on credit availability in the first quarter according to a Bank of England survey. If credit growth were to slow further, it would no doubt be a bad omen for growth - particularly as, of what little spending there has been over the past year, much of it appears to have been financed by borrowing.</p> <p>Meanwhile consumers continue to remain cautious. While household incomes are no longer being squeezed quite as much as before, shoppers are now being confronted with higher petrol prices, and the latest confidence surveys suggest individuals remain pessimistic about the economic situation overall.</p> <p>These cracks forming in the retail sector remain a big risk to the Bank of England outlook.

We have to believe that at some point their common sense will prevail. But we see no sign of that in this action today by the US administration.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Canadian officials said they would impose tariffs against up to C$16.6bn worth of imports of steel, aluminium, whiskey, orange juice and other products from the US. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are imposing dollar for dollar tariffs,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign affairs minister. The tariffs are expected to take effect on 1 July. The tariffs violate Nafta and WTO trade rules, added Freeland, who said that Canada plans to launch dispute settlement proceedings under Nafta Chapter 20 and the WTO. Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign minister Chrystia Freeland says Canada will impose retaliatory measures against US steel, aluminium and other products \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but subject to a 15-day consultation. Freeland also said Canada would continue to defend \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free, open rule-based trade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but would also challenge US tariffs under both the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Word trade Organisation. Trudeau said the tariffs will harm industries and workers on both sides of the Canada-US border. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are an affront to the long-standing security partnership between Canada and the United States, and in particular an affront to the thousands of Canadians who have fought and died alongside their US comrades in arms. The ties of commerce, friendship and in many cases family between Americans and Canadians are undiminished. We are confident that shared values, geography and common interest will ultimately overcome protectionism.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister Justin Trudeau has hit back strongly at the imposition of tariffs, calling them \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 totally unacceptable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at a news conference. French President Emmanuel Macron said the United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision to impose tariffs on European metals exports is illegal and a mistake. The French leader said he would talk to President Donald Trump on the subject later on Thursday Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister Trudeau and Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Enrique Pe\u00c3\u00b1a Nieto have reportedly spoken and agreed to co-ordinate retaliation efforts... A formal complaint by the EU at the WTO in Geneva is expected tomorrow, Friday. In joint statement the French minister and German finance minister, Bruno la Marie and Peter Altamira, said they regretted the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unilateral decision\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd taken by the White House and backed the European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliatory response. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau is expected to speak at 1.30pm ET. In the meantime, we have Kathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, who has called Trump a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bully\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, describing him as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153man who simply does not seem to get that his bluster and his bullying are costing real people real jobs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The conservative business network backed by the wealthy industrialist brothers Charles and David Koch has also come out in opposition to the tariffs. Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce and Americans for Prosperity warned there would be a tax increase on all Americans and would undermine the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and low unemployment rates. Now for the reaction from Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Kevin Brady, the Texas Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has said the Trump administration is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hitting the wrong target\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and officials will need to provide answers to Congress about the damage to US businesses. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When it comes to unfairly traded steel and aluminum, Mexico, Canada and Europe are not the problem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c China is. These tariffs are hitting the wrong target.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brady urged the administration to exempt allies from the new import tariffs. And he warned that administration officials \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will need to come to Capitol Hill to provide answers about the indiscriminate harm these tariffs are causing our local businesses\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Continuing the denunciations of the US decision, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign minister Heiko Maas says the European Union \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is ready to react accordingly with counter measure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. As Europe prepares to hit back with tariffs on a list of US exports worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.4 billion ($7.5 billion), Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy ministry has said it will target several US goods in response, including some steel and pipe products, lamps, berries, grapes, apples, cold cuts, pork chops and various cheese products \u00e2\u20ac\u0153up to an amount comparable to the level of damage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd linked to the US tariffs. Canada is also expected to impose retaliatory measures, details of which are expected soon. Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), called the US move \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hugely disappointing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and warned that the tariffs \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will hurt companies and communities in many areas of the UK, as well as their customers in the US\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK government must reach out to and support the many supply chain businesses that face becoming the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccollateral damage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protectionist push. British ministers must also work hand in hand with the EU to avoid any further escalation, and to find a long-term solution.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But he also warned that the US decision to impose punitive tariffs should serve as a reminder that self-interest looms large in trade negotiations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ministers should reflect on this carefully before they pursue any future trade deal between the UK and the USA.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More from Boffey: Manfred Weber, the leader of the European People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Party, the largest group in the European Parliament, and a key ally of the German chancellor, warned that treating the EU as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enemy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd would lead to US consumers hurting too. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Europe does not want a trade conflict. We believe in a fair trade regime from which everybody benefits. We have tried everything to make dialogue and mutual understanding prevail. If President Trump decides to treat Europe as an enemy, we will have no choice but to defend European industry, European jobs, European interests.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But he warned his party would not accept \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this highly regrettable decision without reacting. This will have consequences for the American people too. In a trade conflict there are only losers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The situation, he added, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has to be a wake-up call for us Europeans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the US closing in on itself, we should be bridge-builders and reliable partners for the rest of the world. Europe now has to act with a clear message and remain united, calm and proportionate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, called the US decision \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bad day for the steel sector, for international relations and for free trade.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said it is vital that the EU and US continue discussions to find a way through the current impasse and reach an agreement that works for all parties. But he called on the EU to forge ahead with safeguard action. And from the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political correspondent Jessica Elgot: A UK government spokesman said they were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply disappointed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the outcome. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK and other European Union countries are close allies of the US and should be permanently and fully exempted from the American measures on steel and aluminium,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the spokesman said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have made clear to the US government at the highest levels the importance of UK steel and aluminium to its businesses and defence projects. We will continue to work closely with the EU and US Administration to achieve a permanent exemption, and to ensure that UK workers are protected and safeguarded.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd May will raise the tariffs with Trump directly when the pair meet at the G7 in Canada next week, where the issue is likely to figure prominently. May has personally lobbied the US president repeatedly in recent weeks and months. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daniel Boffey from Brussels: Brussels has been preparing a retaliatory hit on an array of US goods, both industrial and agricultural, ranging from Harley Davidson motorbikes to blue jeans and American bourbon. Ambassadors from the 28 member states were in immediate communication with the European Commission following the announcement from the Trump administration. Speaking at a conference in Brussels, Juncker said the EU would launch retaliatory action \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the coming hours\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a bad day for world trade,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Juncker. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s totally unacceptable that a country is imposing unilateral measures when it comes to world trade. What they can do, we are able to do.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Susan Danger, chief executive of the American Chamber of Commerce to the EU (AmCham EU), said the White House did not have any justification for imposing the tariffs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153American companies in Europe oppose the US government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to impose tariffs on EU imports of steel and aluminium. We urge the US government to revisit its plans and the EU to take a balanced approach in responding to these measures. We are very concerned by the damage a tit-for-tat dispute would cause to the transatlantic economy and its impact on jobs, investment and security across the Atlantic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Undersecretary of Foreign Trade, Juan Carlos Baker, tweeted: Ram\u00c3\u00b3n Beltr\u00c3\u00a1n, the president of Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Chamber of the Aluminium Industry, told \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAristegui En Vivo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nobody will win [the trade war that is beginning]. The US will lose.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Frankly, we do not like this at all,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Beltr\u00c3\u00a1n added. Beltr\u00c3\u00a1n claimed the US move was designed to pressure Mexico over NAFTA negotiations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[But] we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t contaminate one thing with the other.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Secretariat of Economy said it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153profoundly regretted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the US move and announced it would hit back with tariffs on products including including grapes, apples, pork legs and shoulders, blueberries, some cheeses as well as flat steel. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mexico has repeatedly made clear that these kinds of measures based on national security are neither appropriate nor justified,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the secretariat said in a statement. The former Belgian prime minister, and leader of the liberals in the European Parliament, Guy Verhofstadt, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unfortunately, these steps weaken the transatlantic alliance. Instead of imposing punitive tariffs on their closest allies, the US and EU should work together to tackle China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unfair trading practices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He continued: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As with Brexit, what is most important now is unity within the EU. If we are united, we will have a strong position to face this wave of protectionism, which will benefit no one. The EU has proven to be a strong and reliable global trading partner. In recent months, the EU secured major free trade deals with partners like Canada, Japan and Mexico. This shows what we can achieve when Europe speaks with one voice. We need to continue in this spirit and work with partners around the globe to preserve the rules-based multilateral trading system.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In his statement, EU commission president Juncker said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am concerned by this decision. The EU believes these unilateral US tariffs are unjustified and at odds with World Trade Organisation rules. This is protectionism, pure and simple. Over the past months we have continuously engaged with the US at all possible levels to jointly address the problem of overcapacity in the steel sector. Overcapacity remains at the heart of the problem and the EU is not the source of but on the contrary equally hurt by it. US equities fell on the news, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 250 points. Mexican stocks also fell, while the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar hit their lows of the day against the dollar after news of US tariffs broke. Author and historian Simon Schama has also weighed in, posting on Twitter that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Europe now has to show some real spine or else it will just become Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doormat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, has issued a statement and commented on Twitter: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bad day for world trade. US leaves us no choice but to proceed with a WTO dispute settlement case and the imposition of additional duties on a number of US imports. We will defend the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interests, in full compliance with international trade law.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Markets have edged into negative territory despite earlier rises on hopes of a resolution to the Italian political crisis. The moves came as the US imposed steel and aluminium tariffs on the EU, Mexico and Canada. Investors are also fretting about other geopolitical problems, including Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote of no confidence in Spain, the continuing concerns about North Korea and Iran, the prospect of a trade war between the US and China. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is currently down 0.13%, while Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex is 0.2% lower and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 0.75%. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has managed to edge up 0.03% while the FTSE 100 is 0.18% higher. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 145 points or 0.62%. On the economic front, eurozone inflation came in higher than forecast in May. UK consumer credit rebounded in April, as the City regulator ordered a clampdown on high cost credit. In the US, consumer spending and weekly jobless claims both came in better than expected. Finally, the Bank of England has appointed academic Jonathan Haskel to its rate setting monetary policy committee, the only man on a shortlist of five candidates. US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross has confirmed that it will impose steel and aluminium tariffs on the EU, Canada and Mexico from midnight tonight. The tariffs will be 25% for steel and 10% for aluminium. Amid fears of a trade war, Ross said if any party retaliated that did not rule out further negotiations. He said talks with the EU had made progress, but not enough to continue an exemption from tariffs, which was due to expire tomorrow. While European markets are still just about holding onto gains in the hope that Italy can come up with a plausible government after the recent turmoil, Wall Street has opened lower on worries about trade wars. With the US set to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium from the EU, Canada and Mexico, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 112 points or 0.4%. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.28% lower and the Nasdaq Composite has lost 0.08%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the appointment of the only man on a five person shortlist to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee: The Bank of England interest rate setting committee, which has only one woman among its nine members, will continue to be male-dominated after the Treasury opted to appoint the only man from a shortlist of five candidates. In a move that immediately sparked protests from women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s groups, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, said Jonathan Haskel, an Imperial College economist, would join the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governor, Mark Carney, on the monetary policy committee (MPC) for a three-year term starting in September, when he will succeed the outgoing Ian McCafferty. The Treasury said four women were on the shortlist, but an internal panel made up of two women and one man chose Haskel as the best candidate. Clare Lombardelli, first female chief economic adviser to the Treasury, chaired the panel. She was joined by the former MPC member Kate Barker and Richard Hughes, the Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director of fiscal policy. A Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Equality party (WEP) spokeswoman said the appointment of Haskel sent the wrong message- about the Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to improving diversity in important areas of public life. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It suggests that even if they had an all-female shortlist, they would probably still appoint a man,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. The full report is here: Shares in troubled Deutsche Bank are down around 5% following reports that US authorities have put its business in the country on a list of troubled institutions. More signs of the strength of the US economy. Weekly jobless claims fell by more than expected, down 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 221,000. Analysts had forecast a fall to 228,000. The jobless rate at 3.9% is a near seventeen and a half year low and close to the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of 3.8% by the end of the year. The news comes ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll report, where economists expect around 188,000 jobs to have been created in May. Meanwhile US consumer spending rose by a higher than expected 0.6% last month, the biggest increase in five months. The forecast was for a 0.4% increase. Back in Italy: Meanwhile over in Spain, the no confidence debate is taking place. Our latest report: The future of the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, is hanging in the balance as parliament prepares to debate a motion of no-confidence tabled after his Partido Popular (People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s party) was found to have profited from a huge kickbacks-for-contracts scheme. A defiant Rajoy addressed MPs early on Thursday, accusing the opposition Partido Socialista Obrero Espa\u00c3\u00b1ol (Spanish Socialist Workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 party) of opportunism and reminding the PSOE of its corruption scandals. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With what moral authority are you speaking? Are you perhaps Mother Teresa of Calcutta?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he asked. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There have been corrupt people in the PP, but the PP is not a corrupt party.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The no-confidence vote, scheduled to take place on Friday, is likely to be very close. The PSOE needs the support of 176 of the 350 MPs in congress of deputies. The votes of the five MPs of the Partido Nacionalista Vasco (Basque Nationalist party) will prove decisive, with the PNV saying it would meet and hear what the PSOE leader, Pedro S\u00c3\u00a1nchez, had to say before announcing its decision. S\u00c3\u00a1nchez called for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153democratic regeneration\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as he sought the backing of MPs, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Resign, Mr Rajoy. Your time is up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The full story is here: With European markets drifting - but mainly still managing to stay in positive territory - Wall Street is expected to open marginally lower. There is an eerie sense of calm after all the ructions caused by the Italian political crisis, with investors hoping a new government can be formed after all without the need for another election campaign. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: Not too long ago, a coalition government in Italy consisting of two eurosceptic populist parties was a feared and unlikely prospect that many believed would majorly concern investors. While much of this remains true, it is also currently viewed as the least unattractive and feasible outcome for markets, with the other alternative being fresh elections and the possibility that the parties are given an even stronger and potentially less euro-friendly mandate. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s President, Sergio Mattarella, may have believed he was acting in the best interest of the country when he rejected to populists choice of Finance Minister but the reality is that in doing so, he has given both parties more ammunition with which to attack the euro. Mattarella has already been accused of acting on behalf of Germany and others while Brussels has been accused of interference, it all feeds very well into the eurosceptics message that the country no longer even has control over its domestic politics. Should the country move straight on to another election, both Five Star Movement and Lega will look to take advantage of any fury linked to perceived meddling and could significantly add to their numbers. All of a sudden, the worst case scenario prior to the election looks tolerable compared to what could come from another. With both parties now in discussions again, there is a hope that the political impasse can be resolved which is helping to lift sentiment in the near-term. That said, a positive outcome now poses many further risks in the long-term. While Italian assets have bore the brunt of the pain from the latest period of political instability and uncertainty, there has been a negative impact on the wider markets including the euro which dropped to a 10-month low against the dollar. While we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still far away from the days of the debt crisis and the risk of a breakup, a second election was being portrayed as a vote on the euro which seems drastic and probably overhyped but it certainly hit the single currency. Markets are still managing to hold onto their gains - just - on hopes that the Italian political crisis can be resolved before too long. Here is our latest report on the developments: The leader of the Italian far-right party the League, Matteo Salvini, cancelled political rallies to return to Rome early on Thursday, in what was seen as a sign that a weeks-long political impasse that has left the country without a fully-functioning government for months might soon be coming to an end. Salvini was heading back to the capital to meet with his coalition partner, Luigi Di Maio, the 31-year-old head of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, after the Italian president gave the pair more time to form a government. Italian press reports indicated that any agreement to form a new populist government involving the League, formerly known as the Lega Nord, and M5S would include the nomination \u00e2\u20ac\u201c again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of Giuseppe Conte, a formerly obscure law professor, to serve as prime minister. But the two populists, Di Maio and Salvini, were expected to back down on their earlier insistence that the 81-year-old Eurosceptic Paolo Savona, who had called Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s adoption of the euro a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153historic mistake\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, serve as finance minister. There were also small indications that the populists would try to assure markets that they were not planning any big moves to try to hasten an Italian exit out of the euro, a fear that roiled markets this week. The full story is here: Given the controversy over the comments from male executives making excuses for why there are now women on their boards, the fact that the new member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MPC is male hardly helps matters. Worse - the shortlist for the appointment included four women and one man. And the man was given the job. From the Treasury release: The release also says: The Treasury is committed to appointing a diverse range of people to public appointments, including at the Bank of England. The Treasury continues to work to attract the broadest range of suitable applicants for posts. As part of this recruitment process, the Chief Economic Advisor at the Treasury and chair of the interview panel contacted 87 potential applicants to inform them of the vacancy, of whom 44 were women. Could Haskel also be hawkish? David Owen, chief european financial economist at Jefferies, says: His expertise will also be invaluable when it comes to assessing how much spare capacity there is in the UK economy, as well as trend GDP growth, both key when looking at monetary policy. Jonathan Haskel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent book \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Capitalism Without Capital: The Rise of the Intangible Economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd highlights the growing use of things that we cannot really measure accurately in the production process in the UK. Everything being equal, this would suggest that labour productivity is stronger than official estimates suggest and like Ian McCafferty (who leaves the BoE in August) will vote for a rate rise when he joins the MPC. The government has appointed Jonathan Haskel, a professor of economics at Imperial College Business School, as the newest member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate setting Monetary Policy Committee. Haskel will serve a three year term as an external member and will start on 1 September, when Ian McCafferty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s term ends. In his Imperial College profile, Haskel says: My main research interests are productivity, innovation, intangible investment and growth. I currently study (a) how much firms investment in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intangible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153knowledge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd assets, such as software, R&amp;D and new business processes (b) how much such investment contributes to economic growth as whole and (c) what public policy implications there might be, especially for science policy. This work uses a mix of data at the levels of company, individual, industry and whole economy. Economist Bert Colijn at ING Bank said the eurozone inflation figure puts the European Central Bank in an awkward position: As this jump in inflation just thinly masks underlying core weakness and uncertainty about the economy is high, it is unlikely to convince the ECB to normalise policy more quickly.... [The] core inflation reading is still below where we would expect it to be with the improving labour market and increased selling prices indicated in business surveys. And, as selling price expectations have been weakening in the recent soft patch of economic data, it does not seem like we are at the start of a marked increase in inflation. The understatement of recent months was also helped by a weakening euro, which dampened some of the effects from the higher oil price. Petrol prices jumped significantly in May, on the back of an oil price of around $80 per barrel for most of the month and a weakening euro. Be careful what you wish for, ECB. After years of pushing for inflation to return to just under 2%, it could not have come at a more difficult time. Eurozone financial market turmoil has returned because of Italian politics this week and it is very difficult to see how the Italian political situation is going to play out. Economic data has been weakening over the past months, and the ECB is eager to determine whether this is just a soft patch. Finally, the US seems on the brink of announcing tariffs on European steel and aluminium, which clouds the exports outlook and could have an additional inflationary impact if the trade conflict gets out of hand. The ECB therefore now has to decide whether it will provide certainty straight away by announcing an extension to QE or take a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wait and see\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd approach at the June meeting. Then it could just hint at an extension while taking another six weeks to see how the political situation in Italy and the trade conflict with the US play out, and take in more economic data. Eurozone inflation rose by more than expected in May, partly due to the recent surge in oil prices. The increase towards the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target comes as it wants to run down its stimulus programme, but faces the prospect of market turbulence disturbing its plans. The cost of living in the 19 eurozone countries rose from 1.2% in April to 1.9% in May, according to an initial estimate from Eurostat, higher than the forecasts of around 1.6%. Energy prices rose by 6.1% compared to 2.6% in April, while food was 2.6% higher, uup from 2.4%. Excluding energy and food prices, inflation rose from 1.1% to 1.3%. Meanwhile unemployment in the eurozone fell from 8.6% in March to 8.5% in April. A UK interest rate rise in August is by no means a done deal, says ING Bank economist James Smith. Commenting on the credit figures, he says: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not something markets or analysts typically spend much time looking at each month, but the unexpectedly sharp fall in consumer credit in March was probably a key factor in the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to keep rates on hold in May. Admittedly the reasons for this sudden decline were fairly unclear, and the latest figures released today show that the amount of unsecured consumer credit supplied fully recovered in April, rising by \u00c2\u00a31.8 billion. This tentatively suggests that the fall was simply a blip, perhaps related to the wider economic slowdown in March (although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not entirely clear why the bad weather would have resulted in such a sharp change). We still think this is a story worth keeping an eye on over the next couple of months. A net 39% of banks said they tightened up on credit availability in the first quarter according to a Bank of England survey. If credit growth were to slow further, it would no doubt be a bad omen for growth - particularly as, of what little spending there has been over the past year, much of it appears to have been financed by borrowing. Meanwhile consumers continue to remain cautious. While household incomes are no longer being squeezed quite as much as before, shoppers are now being confronted with higher petrol prices, and the latest confidence surveys suggest individuals remain pessimistic about the economic situation overall. These cracks forming in the retail sector remain a big risk to the Bank of England outlook. While we are inclined to think policymakers have a preference to hike rates again in August if economic data allows (particularly given the better wage growth trend), this is certainly not a done deal. As one committee member said recently, the cost of waiting a bit longer before hiking rates is relatively low. The independent economist is referring to remarks made earlier this month at at select committee hearing, when Sir Dave said there was a risk households were spending less than the Bank had expected - as reported by the Financial Times (\u00c2\u00a3). Speaking of credit, there has been a spike in borrowing by UK consumers in April after a slowdown the previous month blamed on the snowy weather. Consumer credit lending rose by a higher than expected \u00c2\u00a31.832bn, the biggest increase since November 2016, compared to an increase of just \u00c2\u00a3425m in March. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise of \u00c2\u00a31.3bn. The number of mortgages approved slipped from 62,802 in March to 62,455, less than the expected 63,000. Net mortgage lending rose by \u00c2\u00a33.894bn. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the Financial Conduct Authority clamping down on high cost credit: The City watchdog is planning a price cap for rent-to-own retailers as part of a crackdown on high-cost credit and overdrafts to save consumers more than \u00c2\u00a3200m a year. Although stopping short of capping charges on overdrafts, the Financial Conduct Authority outlined a series of measures on Thursday amid growing calls to protect vulnerable consumers. The changes, the result of an 18-month review by the regulator, come as the Bank of England becomes increasingly concerned about rapid growth in personal borrowing, which is returning to levels unseen since the financial crisis. The Hollywood actor Michael Sheen, debt charities and the Labour party have applied significant pressure on the regulator to act. The FCA said it would consider introducing a price cap for the rent-to-own sector, which includes firms such as BrightHouse, from as early as April next year, although it warned it would need to consult on the measure with the industry first. The full report is here: More positive news for Italy: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dipped into the red but other European markets are holding up as investors await the latest developments in the Italian political crisis. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Further steps in the right direction in regards to Italy avoiding another snap election \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even if it does result in the Five Star Movement and League parties forming a Eurosceptic government \u00e2\u20ac\u201c allowed the European markets to hold steady on Thursday. Rising 0.4% the euro managed to put a bit more distance between it and the 10 month lows it struck against the dollar on Tuesday night, the single currency climbing back towards $1.17 after the bell. Against the pound it was a bit more sluggish; however, flat at just under \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.14, it is trading at the top end of its recent bracket. The Eurozone indices, meanwhile, were broadly positive as well. Though the DAX dipped into the red, the CAC and FTSE MIB both continued to rise, the latter especially expressing its relief that things \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for now, at least \u00e2\u20ac\u201c appear to be calming down. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be interesting to see what role the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s May inflation reading plays in the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading. The surge in oil prices means analysts are expecting a sharp month-on-month jump, from 1.2% to 1.6%; that could give the euro a bit more room to breathe, but only if investors are willing to overlook the fact that the increase isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really due to anything going on in the Eurozone. Italian bond yields - which soared on Tuesday as the price fell on political concerns - continue to fall back. The two year yield is now down at 0.9% as calm returns - for the moment at least. Two days ago the yield hit 2.84%. Australian shares ended the month on a positive note, helped by the hopes for a solution to the Italian crisis and a rise in mining shares on the back of higher commodity prices. The S&amp;P/AX index rose 0.5% on the day, helping it to a similar increase for the month as a whole. Markets are likely to remain volatile, says Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com: European equities are firmer in early trade and yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound for stocks may well hold if we see the two populists form a government, though longer term any such government faces a clash with the EU/ECB. They may also face a considerable backlash from bond markets again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c calm for the moment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if they push ahead with plans to increase debt-to-GDP... Reports this morning suggest Paolo Savona could become foreign minister in a Lega-M5S government, a move that could be palatable for all the sides. In the near term the avoidance of snap elections would be positive for risk, but longer-term concerns remain. It does look as though the main risk being priced in earlier this week when bonds and stocks sold off sharply was the threat of another election that could have been framed in a more anit-EU light. Again we must reiterate that stock and bond markets will remain volatile and highly sensitive to the political situation in Rome. Added to this we have the prospect of a no-confidence vote in Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy, a move that would likely bring down the centre-right government. The debate, which starts today, adds to investor concerns that Europe is in a very rocky patch politically at the moment. It is indeed a positive start for European markets, albeit a slightly tentative one given all the geopolitical tensions at the moment. With hopes of a resolution to the Italian political impasse, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is up 0.38%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 0.12% better and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.18%. In the UK, the FTSE 100 is up 0.19%. Economist Paul Donovan at UBS said: We are not back to normal, but markets have reacquainted themselves with what normal might look like. Italian bond yields fell and the euro recovered yesterday. A consensus is forming that there will not be elections in Italy until September at the earliest. Italian President Mattarella is waiting to see if the two anti-parties can in fact form a coalition. Ahead of the eurozone inflation figure we have had an update from France. Reuters reports: French inflation rose in May to its highest level since August 2012, according to data from the INSEE national statistics agency, adding to a raft of strong inflation readings across the euro zone as the European Central Bank considers whether or not to tighten its monetary policy. French consumer prices rose from April due partly to higher energy and food prices. The year-on-year inflation rate came in at 2.3 percent, according to EU-harmonised data from INSEE, above a forecast for an inflation reading of 2.0 percent according to a Reuters poll. Earlier this week, data had also shown inflation in Germany, the euro zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest economy, surging more than expected in May to its highest level in more than a year, while data also showed inflation picking up in Spain. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s May inflation of 2.2 percent also surpassed the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (ECB) target of just under 2 percent for the euro zone as a whole. ING Bank economist James Smith says the UK credit numbers could be interesting: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more on the Financial Conduct Authority\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clampdown on high cost credit. FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey said: High-cost credit is used by over three million consumers in the UK, some of who are the most vulnerable in society. Today we have proposed a significant package of reforms to ensure they are better protected including the possibility of a cap on rent-to-own lending. The proposals will benefit overdraft and high-cost credit users, rebalancing in the favour of the customer. Here is the full FCA announcement. Eurozone inflation is expected to move sharply higher, partly due to the recent surge in oil prices. UniCredit economists said: We expect headline inflation to rebound strongly in May, from 1.2% to 1.8% year on year. We see two main drivers: a rebound in core inflation and a jump in energy prices. Core inflation probably reversed its April drop and rose to 1.1% year on year from 0.7%. This would reflect normalization in the price of holiday-sensitive items, with the April reading having been distorted to the downside by the early timing of Easter. Surging oil prices are likely to push energy prices up strongly, adding 0.3 percentage points to headline inflation . Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Optimism that the Italian political crisis can be resolved without new elections is expected to see markets continue their revival today. The 5 Star and Lega parties are making renewed efforts to form a coalition, which has eased fears that a new vote could give a mandate for the country to leave the euro - Italexit or Quitaly, take your pick. So Italian bond yields have fallen back from their highs earlier in the week, while European markets are expected to make a positive start. CMC Markets UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening forecasts show The FTSE 100 up 3 points Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax 20 points higher France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbing 8 points Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB up 50 points. CMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief market analyst Michael Hewson said: [Market] optimism was reinforced by a call from the Five Star movement for Paolo Savona to withdraw his candidacy for the position of finance minister. This would appear to be at odds with the position of the League and its leader Matteo Salvini, whose pick Savona is. The differences of opinion between the two parties certainly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bode well for any future relationship in government, if Salvini does change his mind about Savona and put someone else forward as finance minister... Even though investors have significant concerns about the recent steep rise in Italian borrowing costs it should be noted they still remain well below their long-term averages prior to the financial crisis, when they were on average in and around the 4% level for most of the noughties. This means that while Italian borrowing costs now are high relative to the last few years, they still remain low by historical standards. Still, investors would be right to be cautious. Italy is not the only potential problem in the eurozone, with Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister Rajoy facing a no confidence vote on Friday. On the same day, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s temporary exemption from the US steel and aluminium tariffs is due to expire although developments could come as soon as today, while there are also the continuing concerns about a trade war between the US and China, as well the situation in North Korea. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s set to be a busier day all round, with news already that the UK regulator the Financial Conduct Authority is clamping down on high cost credit. Meanwhile Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest house price index has shown weaker than expected growth in May, with prices up 2.4%, down from a 2.6% increase in April and below the expected figure of 3%. Jonathan Samuels, chief executive of property lender, Octane Capital, said: Tight supply and subdued demand are the key contributors to the ongoing limbo gripping the UK property market. A lethargic economy populated by cautious and squeezed consumers has created a property market lacking both momentum and direction. And on the corporate front, the chief executive of train and bus business FirstGroup is leaving with immediate effect. As the company reported a poor set of results, Tim O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Toole said: The time is right for me to step aside. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results clear the way for the new approach sought by our Chairman and the Board. Investors will also be watching out for European inflation figures after Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s higher than expected consumer price index from Germany.
