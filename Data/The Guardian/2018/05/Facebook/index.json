Why did it fail? Did TSB perform thorough testing prior to flicking the switch on the migration of user accounts? Why did the testing not uncover the issues? How thorough can it have been, given issues became apparent almost immediately?<br></li> <li><strong>Was there a back-up? </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/mar/20/how-will-the-takeover-of-tsb-affect-me\">Sabadell\u2019s takeover of TSB</a> was predicated almost entirely on the \u00a3100m savings to be made from cutting TSB free from the \u00a3214m-a-year bill it had to pay Lloyds for continuing to run the bank\u2019s accounts. Was it rushed through, without sufficient back-up? Why was the old system not still in place to mitigate customer troubles when it was clear Proteo4UK, the name given to the new platform, was not up to the task? <br></li> <li><strong>Why were customers misinformed? </strong>The transition was scheduled from Friday evening to Sunday evening. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/23/tsb-online-banking-failure-prompts-complaints\">failures began appearing</a>, almost immediately afterwards, TSB initially said the problems were only \u201cintermittent\u201d. Early on Wednesday, Pester said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/apr/25/tsb-online-banking-mobile-app-paul-pester-business-live?page=with:block-5ae01a58e4b0ed4091d25a53#block-5ae01a58e4b0ed4091d25a53\">system was \u201cup and running\u201d </a>again but customers continued to report problems.</li> <li><strong>Who was in control?</strong> Much is being made of a rift between TSB in the UK and Sabadell in Spain.

                "bodyText":"Any ambitious junior bank executives out there should watch that hearing again closely, as an example of how not to handle a select committee. In happier times, Paul Pester would challenge his staff to \u2018beat the boss\u2019 in triathlons. But today, the TSB CEO found himself on the wrong end of a beating from MPs. There\u2019s clearly a massive disconnect between TSB\u2019s view of its IT crisis, and the view which MPs hear from constituents who have been unable to get a decent banking service (or ANY, in some cases) for 12 days and counting. Although Pester did remember to apologise a few times (an essential shield on these occasions), it looked less-than-fully sincere when he then argued that many things were actually running smoothly. The correct response to being told that two of the committee\u2019s own staff can\u2019t log into TSB is NOT to joke about having so many customers. It looks arrogant, when contrition is required. No wonder Nicky Morgan accused Pester of simply not understanding the size of his mess, and the reputational damage to TSB and beyond, saying: What we are hearing this afternoon is the most staggering example of a chief executive who seems unwilling to realise the scale of the problem that is being faced. That could yet be his epitaph, if TSB can\u2019t get systems working properly, fast, and satisfy the 40,000 complaints filed in the last 12 days. Pester also failed to answer some predictable questions. For example: He couldn\u2019t say when the crisis will be over He didn\u2019t know exactly how many small firms have been hit He wouldn\u2019t say how large the compensation bill could be Pester has, finally, had the nous to give up any bonus for this IT migration - but this may be an empty gesture, as the board may well have decided that he\u2019d not earned it anyway. He could still get a bonus for his wider work (although not for today\u2019s performance, I suggest). MPs may have had some sympathy when Pester said how much he regretted the \u201cterrible\u201d decision to press on with the migration. But alas, Doc Brown wasn\u2019t waiting outside Portcullis House with a DeLorean - and with Pester\u2019s recent form, it might have stalled anyway. And on that note, we\u2019re wrapping up for the day. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW A TSB customer, Penny Simpson, isn\u2019t impressed by Pester\u2019s performance: Pester is in another world. He is producing sheets of data that tell him 95% of his customers can log on. WE CANNOT LOG ON and we have not been able to for 11 days. Is he in denial or just telling lies? Please media, help us. He is just telling people to contact him if they have problems. How? You cannot get through on the phone, you cannot log on. Nicky Morgan wraps up the session by telling TSB that the committee expects customers to be properly compensated -- including finding a replacement car for Simon Clarke\u2019s constituent. She also declares that the committee expects to see the full Slaughter and May report into what went wrong. Meddings politely protests, saying the committee can certainly see the key findings, but might not be allowed to see any commercially sensitive information. Morgan says the committee would like to see the full report...and early information on the compensation scheme. And she concludes with a fairly damning assessment of the situation at TSB: At the end of the day, this is a bank for whom many customers feel you are not saying \u201cyes\u201d...but making it as difficult as possible to get hold of the money to pay bills and putting them in an impossible financial situation. That\u2019s the end of the session. Q: With hindsight, would you do the migration again? CEO Paul Pester says he would not! If I had a time machine, I would take myself back to one minute before one o\u2019clock in the afternoon and change the decision. If there was one decision in my life I could change, it\u2019s the decision to go ahead with the migration on 1pm on Sunday afternoon Clearly it was \u201ca terrible decision\u201d for our bank, for our customers, and me personally, Pester explains ruefully. Of course I would change it. Chairman Richard Meddings concurs - but also insists that TSB didn\u2019t have any idea that the migration would go so badly. If it had seen any hint of the problems, it wouldn\u2019t have pressed on. Paul Pester can\u2019t say how many people have left TSB since the crisis began. And the committee\u2019s obvious amazement, Paul Pester thinks TSB can still win new customers in the weeks and months ahead. Nicky Morgan picks her jaw off the floor, and lashes Pester for simply not understanding the impact of this crisis: Do you recognise the reputational damage that this has caused, not just to TSB but to online banking generally? The UK needs TSB to be a challenger to the big five banks, Pester insists. Your customers need TSB to provide a good banking service, Morgan shoots back. Pester tried to pay tribute to TSB\u2019s thousands of hard working staff, saying he\u2019s confidence that his \u2018partners\u2019 can persuade customers to move to TSB in the future. Those partners have been badly let down by senior management, Morgan retorts. Quite. Pester says customers should use TSB\u2019s online complaint form to get in touch, rather than trying to phone or using social media to report problems. Everyone enjoys tweeting, but it is \u2018shouting into the void\u2019, TSB\u2019s CEO adds. Nicky Morgan won\u2019t stand for this, pointing out that TSB\u2019s own Twitter account says people should phone. They can phone if they prefer, Pester replies. After 90 minutes of evidence, Morgan has heard enough - and lays into Pester: What we are hearing this afternoon is the most staggering example of a chief executive who seems unwilling to realise the scale of the problem that is being faced. Saying that social media is \u2018shouting into the void\u2019 doesn\u2019t show much inclination to being a truly digital online presence, she adds firmly. Simon Clarke MP brings up the case of a third constituent, whose business is threatened because he can\u2019t access his banking services. Pester sounds concerned, but he is also insistent that most of TSB\u2019s services are working well. Millions of customers are using their bank cards every day, he says. There\u2019s clearly a disconnect here -- MPs (and the media) are hearing from people in a real fix, but TSB thinks problems are intermittent. Q: What is the quantum of the compensation bill? Pester sways away from this one, playing the \u201cwe\u2019ve been so focused fixing the problems that we haven\u2019t calculated it\u201d card. Conservative Simon Clarke MP now challenges Pester, citing the case of a constituent called Kerry. She has been stuck on telephone lines, paying 50p per minute. She relies on pensions credit, and is at her \u201cwits end\u201d with her gas about to be cut off. Q: who should she contact to resolve this today? Pester apologises to Kerry, and says that TSB wants to deal with complaints. Again, he encourages customers to get in touch with their problems. He also reveals that the bank is using \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 to find vulnerable customers. (I\u2019m glad to see there\u2019s some intelligence involved in this mess). Clarke then cites another customer - Alison Wickes, who lost a non-returnable deposit on a car because she couldn\u2019t get the money to buy it out of TSB, and the dealer sold it to someone else. More reaction from irate customers.... ...and unimpressed journalists: Q: Has this shambles, or meltdown, put customers at risk of fraud? Based on experience, we know that fraudsters will be following the news, following social media and will take any opportunity to take advantage, Pester replies. That\u2019s why TSB wrote to customers this week warning them to be careful. Q: Will there be any legal action over this mess? Sabadell\u2019s Miquel Montes says not. But....TSB\u2019s chairman is more circumspect. Richard Meddings says it all depends on Slaughter and May\u2019s independent review: Q: When will this shambles be over, asks John Mann Meddings says TSB is seeing \u201cimprovement\u201d on its online services, and across its other channels. But it\u2019s still not good enough\u201d. The wrong thing to do would be to set a date, Meddings claims -- but \u201cwe are working as hard and as fast as we can\u201d. Q: Can you do better, Mr Pester? I can\u2019t give a fixed date, Pester replies. If I give one it\u2019s likely to be unfair to customers, he adds. Q: This week, next week, the week after next? Pester won\u2019t be drawn. Mann turns in exasperation to Sabadell\u2019s COO, Miguel Montes.... We are very close, Montes replies. Q: That sound like days. Could it be days? Hopefully yes, Montes replies cautiously [and not very convincingly, I fear]. John Mann turns to the issue of compensation, and the case of a TSB customer whose wedding planning thanks to the IT chaos. Q: How will TSB make things right? Meddings says TSB don\u2019t simply use a \u2018financial calculation\u2019 when assessing compensation. It will also take stress and inconvenience into account. Deloitte are helping TSB to draw up a framework to help deal with compensation claims, Meddings explains Q: What if customers aren\u2019t satisfied? They could consider appealing to a financial onbudsman, Meddings suggests. Mann turns his guns to chairman Richard Medding about the \u201cshambles\u201d at TSB. The only similar mess I can remember in my time on this committee is the Co-op Bank, says Mann. They lost their chief executive and chairman - are you going to lose yours too? No, Medding replies. Q: What about Mr Pester\u2019s bonuses? Boom! Meddings reveals that Pester has offered to give up the bonus related to the successful migration of the IT system. That\u2019s the right thing to do, Meddings adds. Q: So, no bonus for Mr Pester this year? It\u2019s not as simple as that. A decision over his total pay and bonus package will be taken at the end of the year, once the review into the IT project has been concluded, Meddings explains. Now it\u2019s Labour MP John Mann\u2019s turn. Q: How many SMEs have had problems? Pester doesn\u2019t know (again, not a good look). In percentage terms it\u2019s similar to the wider average (where around 50% of customers couldn\u2019t get online at any one time), he says. Q: How many customers have had problems speaking to your telephone helpline? We\u2019ve been very disappointed with the abandon rate -- Q:...with WHAT?!, Mann interjects. ....These are customers who decide not to wait, Pester explains Q: How long are you making them wait? The average wait time is 30 minutes, Pester says, it hasn\u2019t improved in recent days. [But as MPs realise, this wait time doesn\u2019t customers whose patience hits breaking point and hang up after a lengthy wait] Pester says that IBM experts are helping to fix the IT issues....but if it was a simple problem, we would have fixed it, he adds. Stuart Hosie now challenges Paul Pester over his claim that most of the bank is running smoothly. One of Hosie\u2019s constituents found that his standing orders had bounced yesterday (a problem TSB claims to have fixed). A second customer has an even more worrying story - he tried to pay seven cheques into his local branch, but the staff couldn\u2019t make the system work. He tried to access his balance on another account, Hosie continues, and staff couldn\u2019t get into it. This customer has been locked out of their business account since 20 April, and their complaint hasn\u2019t even been responded to. Fixing Pester with a steely look, Hosie declares: It isn\u2019t just the online, it isn\u2019t just the digital, it\u2019s the technology in the branch [too], and the complaints aren\u2019t being addressed, are they? Pester says TSB have responded to 22,290 of the 40,000 complaints received since the IT migration. It is in the process of dealing with the rest, and he apologises to this constituent. SNP MP Stuart Hosie asks if Pester understands the importance of digital services today, when a broken app is as bad as a closed branch. Pester agrees. He says TSB\u2019s busiest time is typically between 7.30am and 8.30am, as customers check balances over breakfast or on the way to work. Q: So why weren\u2019t you ready for the demand when you brought your services back online (on Sunday night, April 22nd)? Pester says the bank had assumed very high usage of its telephone services, the internet banking, and its mobile app. TSB thought that it was ready -- Slaughter and May\u2019s independent review has to discover why it wasn\u2019t. Nicky Morgan has more inside information from TSB - a worker who says they weren\u2019t actually allowed to fail things in testing, only say they had passed or need more work. Pester says TSB\u2019s testing operation will be examined as part of its review. Q: And why are people who closed accounts years ago now getting texts? Did you move too much data? Pester says TSB has to hold customer data for seven years. Q: Was your bonus contingent on getting this migration done now, Mr Pester? Pester denies it. He says there was a \u201creward\u201d for getting the operation done, but not at a particular time. [Background: in February, TSB\u2019s board decided to withholding a potential \u00a31 million-plus payment for Pester until the bank completed its delayed IT improvements.] Rushanara Ali turns to Sabadell\u2019s COO, Miquel Montes. Q: Would this migration have saved \u00a3100m per year? (on fees paid to Lloyds?) Montes confirms that this is the case Q: Did you speed the migration up because there was a financial benefit? Montes denies it. All decisions taken by the TSB board have been backed by Sabadell, he says. Q: So there was no pressure on TSB to move quickly? Pester jumps in, saying there was no pressure from TSB\u2019s parent company. Q: So why didn\u2019t the migration work? Pester says he\u2019s handled several migrations before - including bringing Alliance &amp; Leicester and Bradford &amp; Bingley onto Santander (following the financial crisis) and carving TSB out of Lloyds. Subtext: he knew what he was doing.... Now chairman Richard Meddings chips in - he confirms that TSB have called legal firm Slaughter &amp; May in to carry out a review. He\u2019s happy to share the conclusions with MPs when it\u2019s done. Labour MP Rushanara Ali takes issue with Pester\u2019s claim that TSB customers should get in touch with problems. She points out that customers have suffered long delays on its helplines, or lengthy journeys to their nearest bank. Q: What have the bank done to help? Pester says the bank have prioritised vulnerable customers, and also searched social media to find customers affected. Ali isn\u2019t impressed, saying that the tone of TSB\u2019s response hasn\u2019t been good enough. Pester isn\u2019t winning his audience over, judging by these tweets from watching journalists: CEO Paul Pester is trying to persuade the Treasury committee that the situation isn\u2019t that bad really. The engine of the bank is running smoothly, the issue is handling enough customers trying to log on simultaneously, particularly through our app and our digital channels. But Nicky Morgan has another trump card - a second member of the committee now can\u2019t into their TSB account. It\u2019s great to have so many customers, grins Pester (ill-advisedly, I think). \u201cThank you very much for using TSB\u201d Morgan shoots back that it\u2019s not clear how much longer they\u2019ll actually be TSB customers. Q: Hasn\u2019t this IT migration been a complete failure, asks Charlie Elphicke MP. It\u2019s not been a complete failure, Paul Pester insists - sticking to his earlier argument that much of the migration went smoothly (it\u2019s just that lots of customers couldn\u2019t actually do any banking). Pester reveals that TSB has received 40,000 complaints since the migration (on April 20-22nd). It would normally receive 3,000 over the same period. They are being investigated, and they will be put right. Charlie Elphicke MP takes up the cudgel, asking about TSB\u2019s senior management regime - and who take responsibility for this mess? Q: Who does the buck stop with? It stops with me, says Pester. Q: So you take responsibility? I take absolutely responsibility, Q: Have you failed in the basic duty to customers? Pester says he is proud of TSB\u2019s work since it was spun out of Lloyds in 2013. I\u2019m deeply sad that the good work of the last five years has been so damaged over the last 10 days, Pester continues, but we will come back. Q: But how can your customers ever trust you again, Mr Pester? Because I will ensure that we get TSB out of these problems, and that no customers end up out of pocket. A TSB customer has tweeted the committee about the irony of watching Paul Pester saying there are no problems logging into TSB, while \u201csimultaneously trying and failing to log into my account\u201d. How can you say that this migration went smoothly? Nicky Morgan asks. Paul Pester says he has data showing him that almost all customers are getting online,. If people are struggling, please contact us, he says. [That won\u2019t cut much ice with customers who have reported long delays on its telephone line] Nicky Morgan plays her trump card -- one of the committee\u2019s own staff are trying to log in, and they can\u2019t log in either. Nicky Morgan asks about another case, about a TSB customer who says they were let down by the bank, and has subsequently passed away. In response, chairman Richard Meddings also apologises for the IT migration failures. Nicky Morgan says Pester is downplaying the problems at TSB. She quotes an email from a TSB customer who has suffered disruption for the last two weeks. This person has seen their balance fluctuate, been unable to withdraw cash, and with no idea if their data has been compromised. How is someone supposed to cope without banking services for two weeks? Could Paul Pester cope? Pester says he doesn\u2019t recognise this situation. He says that there have been problems getting enough customers online at the same time, but that around 50% of customers who tried to log in, were able to at anyone time. Morgan isn\u2019t impressed - are you saying this customer isn\u2019t telling the truth? There\u2019s no group of customers who haven\u2019t been able to log in since the migration, Pester insists. Morgan cites another email, from a TSB customer who hasn\u2019t been able to buy a house as they can\u2019t access three months of bank statement? Isn\u2019t it complacent to say that this migration went well, when people are not in control of their bank accounts? The session is underway. Committee chair Nicky Morgan begins by quoting TSB\u2019s ambition to become \u201ca digital business that just happens to be a bank\u201d. Isn\u2019t the truth that it is actually a broken bank? CEO Paul Pester begins by apologising for the disruption suffered by customers since the IT migration last month, saying he is truly sorry. But he insists that much of the migration worked well - balances were accurately transferred \u201cto the penny\u201d and the underlying engine of the bank is running relatively smoothly But, the platform\u2019s ability to allow enough people to log in at the same time hasn\u2019t worked well enough - preventing some customers from using its internet banking service and mobile app. That has led to an unacceptable experience for some customer, Pester says, apologising again. While we wait for the hearing to begin, here\u2019s our latest news story on TSB.... The Treasury committee hearing on TSB\u2019s IT problems is due to start in five minutes. The witnesses are TSB chief executive Paul Pester and chairman Richard Meddings, plus Miquel Montes, chief operating officer of Sabadell Group (TSB\u2019s parent company). It should be streamed live here. Back in the 1980s, TSB billed itself as \u201cThe Bank That Likes to Say Yes\u201d, in a series of jaunty adverts: Satirical magazine Private Eye have now helpfully updated the slogan for today\u2019s circumstances: TSB\u2019s IT meltdown crisis has reared its head at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions. Nicky Morgan MP, chair of the Treasury committee, tells the House of Commons that the crisis has had very severe consequences for thousands of customers. It is unfair to businesses, to vulnerable customers, and it is particularly unfair when banks are closing branches, Morgan says (giving TSB a taste of this afternoon\u2019s grilling). Does the prime minister agree that \u201ca robust and reliable banking IT infrastructure\u201d is essential in the modern economy. Theres May says she certainly does agree that a \u201crobust, safe and reliable\u201d IT system is essential to underpin modern banking. She\u2019s sure the Treasury Committee will get to the bottom of what went wrong at TSB, starting with today\u2019s hearing. Another question for MPs: why has TSB\u2019s board called in a top UK law firm, Slaughter &amp; May? Sky News\u2019s Mark Kleinman has more details: Sky News has learnt that directors of the UK\u2019s sixth-biggest bank have asked Slaughter &amp; May to conduct an independent probe of the circumstances leading to the IT upgrade which has prompted a furious backlash from thousands of customers. The appointment of Slaughters, one of the so-called \u201cMagic Circle\u201d law firms, has been rubber-stamped by TSB\u2019s board and is expected to be confirmed by directors when they appear in front of MPs on the Treasury Select Committee later on Wednesday. MPs on the Treasury committee could also ask TSB about the weird and less-than-wonderful state of its online banking site. Technology expert Chris Applegate took a look under the bonnet yesterday, and recoiled after uncovering a host of errors and questionable coding work. Some of the errors suggest that stressed techies are making basic mistakes as they race to get TSB\u2019s banking services online again. Also... the site\u2019s security certificate - used to secure credit card transactions and log-in details - will soon be out of date. Not a good sign at all. This is TSB\u2019s front-end code, for the pages seen by customers, rather than the digital nuts and bolts underpinning the bank. But it\u2019s still not a reassuring sight. Oof! Britain\u2019s economy is suffering its worst run against the US and the eurozone in 12 years. So says Barret Kupelian, senior economist at PwC. He has crunched today\u2019s eurozone GDP figures (see 10.12am) and compared them to last Friday\u2019s growth data for Britain and America. And as you can see, Britain\u2019s annual growth rate started dipping at the end of 2016 -- the year of the EU referendum: It\u2019s particularly disappointing as the wider global economy has been enjoying decent growth of late, as Kupelian explains: \u201cToday\u2019s flash estimate of Eurozone GDP growth for the first quarter of 2018 shows that the bloc as a whole grew by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter. This is broadly in line with expectations but slower than the 0.7% growth rate recorded in Q4 2017. However, these preliminary Eurozone figures are likely to be revised once national authorities release their data. \u201cThis was the fifth out of seven consecutive quarters that the Eurozone grew faster than the UK following the EU referendum. This suggests that the UK has not been able to reap the full benefits of an upturn in global economic activity unlike other large economies like the Eurozone and the US. \u201cThis now means that the UK has been the slowest growing economy relative to the US and the Eurozone for the fourth consecutive quarter - something last experienced 12 years ago. Economist Rupert Seggins has also shown how Britain is lagging behind: Several TSB customers are tweeting their unhappiness that the bank has billed them their usual monthly charge, despite the disruption of the last 12 days. Although some of TSB\u2019s current accounts are free, it charges \u00a39.95 per month for its Silver account, and \u00a38.95/month for its \u2018select\u2019 option (no longer available). TSB wrote to customers this week, promised to waive overdraft fees for March and April and promising that no-one will be left \u2018out of pocket\u2019. But still, charging account fees when people haven\u2019t had the usual service clearly rankles with some customers. Another newsflash: Growth across the eurozone slowed to 0.4% in the first three months of 2018. That\u2019s down from 0.7% 0.6% in October-December 2017, and highlights how the global economy has softened in recent months. This also means the eurozone grew faster than Britain - again (as UK GDP only rose by 0.1% during the quarter). We\u2019d like to hear from TSB customers who are still suffering from the IT problems. You can get in touch anonymously here. Back to TSB, and writer Michelle Davies is still having problems with her bank account: Better news: UK construction sector returned to growth in April, as builders returned to work after the \u2018Beast from the East\u2019 disrupted activity in March. A quick economic newsflash: Growth across the eurozone\u2019s factories has slowed to a 13-month low. Data firm Markit reports that activity across Europe\u2019s manufacturers cooled in April, with growth slowing in the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Spain and Greece. It\u2019s due to a drop in new order growth, meaning firms took on fewer new staff. Firms reported that new order growth slowed last month, as did new hirings, as the strong growth of 2017 fades. However, at least factories are still expanding. The overall eurozone factory PMI fell to 56.2 in April, from 56.6 in March (any reading over 50 shows growth). [for comparison, the UK factory PMI fell to 53.9 yesterday, a 17-month low) It\u2019s more than a week since TSB\u2019s chief Paul Pester tweeted that \u201cour mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running\u201d...and yet there are still problems. The bank\u2019s service status page warns that customers can\u2019t see their mortgage account via internet banking and the mobile app. Some business customers are still struggling to make payments online - which could be disastrous for a firm which needs to pay suppliers or staff. Replacement debit and credit cards are currently taking a little longer to process too. If customers can\u2019t get online, TSB recommends they try \u201cclosing your mobile app fully and then restarting it, or closing your internet browser and trying again\u201d. Advice straight out of The IT Crowd.... Reuters has also investigated the TBS crisis -- and confirmed that rushed and inadequate testing and poor internal communication were to blame. Reporter Lawrence White explains: \u201cThere wasn\u2019t time to test everything, digital and mobile payment testing weren\u2019t properly scoped, so it wasn\u2019t a surprise to me when it went live last week and those parts didn\u2019t work,\u201d said one source, a project manager who oversaw people working on the upgrade, referring to the testing up to the first deadline. A second source, a software tester, said tests were in some cases poorly designed or rushed in order to meet the initial project launch date. He also cited a lack of communication between IT and the business about who was managing the testing. Some background: TSB\u2019s IT meltdown was created because the bank moved from its old technology at Lloyds Bank (who sold it in 2013) onto a new system created by current owner Sabadell. Insiders have told us that the team working on the migration were set unrealistically tight deadlines that didn\u2019t acknowledge the challenge of unpicking TSB out of Lloyds\u2019 sprawling network of legacy systems. My colleague Sam Gibbs wrote about the mess on Saturday: By the summer of 2016, work on developing the new system was meant to be well under way and December 2017 was set as a hard-and-fast deadline for delivery. \u201cThe time period to develop the new system and migrate TSB over to it was just 18 months,\u201d the insider said. \u201cI thought this was ridiculous. TSB people were saying that Sabadell had done this many times in Spain. But tiny Spanish local banks are not sprawling LBG legacy systems.\u201d To make matters worse, the Sabadell development team did not have full control \u2013 and therefore a full understanding \u2013 of the system they were trying to migrate customer data and systems from because Lloyds Banking Group was still the supplier. \u201cThis turned what was a super-hard systems job [into] a clusterfuck in the making,\u201d the insider said. By March 2017, the nightmare for customers that was going to unfold a year later appeared inevitable. \u201cIt was unbelievable \u2013 hardly even a prototype or proof of concept, yet it was supposed to be fully tested and working by May before the integration work started,\u201d the insider continued. \u201cSenior staff were furious about the state it was in. Even logging in was problematic.\u201d MPs must ask Pester why the bank didn\u2019t heed these warning signs, and instead plunged on into the current mess. Some TSB customers are fuming this morning after it emerged that the bank had failed to execute their standing orders yesterday. The blunder affected important bills, such as monthly rent payments, set to be paid at the start of the new month. Scientist Stacey Bell found herself caught up in the mess, when her rent found its way back into her account: TSB says the issue has been fixed - but it has created further anxiety among its customers: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Twelve days ago, TSB pressed the button to switch its 5 million customers onto a shiny new IT platform. Later today, the bank\u2019s top brass will try to explain to MPs why they made such a botch of it. TSB chief executive Paul Pester and chairman Richard Meddings will face parliament\u2019s Treasury committee at 2.30pm today, to answer questions about why millions of customers were locked out of their internet and mobile bank services for days. They\u2019ll be accompanied by Miquel Montes, chief operating officer of TSB\u2019s parent company, Sabadell, which oversaw the move onto the Proteo4UK platform. Pester - who took personal control of the mess nearly a week ago - will be quizzed on what exactly went wrong, and why TSB hasn\u2019t been able to get back online. Was the system tested properly, and why wasn\u2019t there a contingency plan in case gremlins struck? And are customers really going to be properly compensated for their losses, and the inconvenience they have suffered? My colleague Patrick Collinson has helpfully drawn up a list of questions for the MPs to bang over the net to the trio: Why didn\u2019t the new computer system work? TSB spent, by its own admission, 2,500 human years on the IT transfer from Lloyds, with 1,000 people involved in one way or another. Why did it fail? Did TSB perform thorough testing prior to flicking the switch on the migration of user accounts? Why did the testing not uncover the issues? How thorough can it have been, given issues became apparent almost immediately? Was there a back-up? Sabadell\u2019s takeover of TSB was predicated almost entirely on the \u00a3100m savings to be made from cutting TSB free from the \u00a3214m-a-year bill it had to pay Lloyds for continuing to run the bank\u2019s accounts. Was it rushed through, without sufficient back-up? Why was the old system not still in place to mitigate customer troubles when it was clear Proteo4UK, the name given to the new platform, was not up to the task? Why were customers misinformed? The transition was scheduled from Friday evening to Sunday evening. When failures began appearing, almost immediately afterwards, TSB initially said the problems were only \u201cintermittent\u201d. Early on Wednesday, Pester said the system was \u201cup and running\u201d again but customers continued to report problems. Who was in control? Much is being made of a rift between TSB in the UK and Sabadell in Spain. Pictures on LinkedIn showed celebrating IT workers in Madrid toasting the \u201csuccess\u201d of the transfer. Pester is now paying for IBM specialists to fix the problems. Will Pester pin the blame on head office in Spain or other external contractors? Will Pester still receive a \u00a31.6m bonus? He may try to dodge this by saying bonuses are at the discretion of the remuneration committee, and nothing has been decided. But MPs are likely to press Pester on whether he think he deserves a bonus after this fiasco. How will TSB compensate customers? The bank has promised that no one will be left out of pocket. But will they receive compensation only if they complain? Will the bankcontact customers? And what does it expect the compensation bill to be? Did regulation work? MPs will want to know the extent to which the giant transfer of 1.3bn records was supervised by regulators such as the Financial Conduct Authority, and what it says about the robustness of Britain\u2019s banking infrastructure. TSB will have to tell MPs how far the debacle has exposed customers\u2019 data, and how much, if at all, any accounts have been compromised Also coming up today We\u2019ll be wading through a river of data this morning, with new surveys of the eurozone factory sector and Britain\u2019s builders. We also get the first estimate of eurozone growth in the first quarter of this year. Growth is expected to have slowed to around 0.4%, from 0.6% in the last three months of 2017 - still rather better than Britain\u2019s slothlike 0.1% expansion... The agenda: 9am BST: Eurozone manufacturing PMI survey for April 9.30am: UK construction PMI for April 10am BST: Eurozone GDP for Q1 2018 (first estimate) 2.30pm BST: Treasury committee hearing on TSB\u2019s IT problems",

                "bodyText":"Sports Direct bosses have accused a former Labour MP of wiping millions off the retailer\u2019s share price and triggering violent assaults on shop staff. The allegations were made as part of a formal complaint to parliament about Iain Wright\u2019s conduct when he spearheaded an inquiry into the retailer\u2019s working practices. Wright was also accused of presiding over a \u201cmedia circus\u201d while he was chair of the business select committee, in a letter from Sports Direct\u2019s chairman Keith Hellawell.

                "body":"<p>In one fell swoop DIY giant Homebase became the high street\u2019s latest pound shop last week after its Australian owner, Wesfarmers, offloaded the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/25/bunnings-pulls-out-of-britain-after-1bn-plus-disaster\"> loss-making chain for a token sum</a> to a restructuring firm. The deal is expected to trigger fresh pain on a high street that is already shedding stores and jobs at a faster rate than during the recession in 2009. Major high-street names including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/23/marks-and-spencer-reports-sharp-drop-in-annual-profits\">Marks &amp; Spencer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/19/debenhams-profits-slump-52-beast-from-the-east-sales\">Debenhams</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/23/arcadia-owner-tina-green-was-paid-25m-by-taveta-despite-topshop-slump\">Topshop</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/10/house-fraser-slides-44m-loss-ahead-chinese-takeover\">House of Fraser</a> are also struggling. On Friday the homewares chain Dunelm issued a profit warning, blaming \u201cchallenging\u201d conditions. So why is life so tough on the high street?</p> <h2>Online rivals</h2> <p>It is hardly a surprise that the high street is under pressure as the internet has hoovered up about a fifth of all retail spending, with non-food sales online rising by 7.5% in the past year. Now smartphones are ubiquitous, it is possible to buy a sofa on the bus, a designer handbag from the sofa or a new kitchen while in bed.</p> <p>The internet has made life challenging for retailers in a number of ways. Apart from directly diverting sales, it has given shoppers less reason to visit their high street, reducing small retailers\u2019 chances of drawing in passing trade, while the cost and complexity of building the infrastructure to deliver goods to homes efficiently has hit profits. As traditional retailers struggle to adapt, they are being pressed by online specialists, such as Asos, Amazon and Boohoo.com, unhindered by a long tail of outdated stores. The ease of comparing prices and accessing goods from around the world has given more options to those based in small towns who are no longer restricted to shopping local, making competition tougher than ever.</p> <p>The internet is also enabling savvy shoppers to trade goods among themselves much more easily. Whether it is bundles of baby clothes selling on Facebook, fashion fans searching for vintage on eBay or Etsy, or teenagers flogging their unwanted impulse purchases on fast-growing mobile app Depop, this market is on the rise. In the US, the fashion resale market, both on and offline, is expected to rise 13% between 2016 and 2021 to $33bn, and new specialist sites such as Hewi (Hardly Ever Worn It) and Vinted as well as Depop are also expected to drive growth in the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5904679958514494aa0624f6090f7ae9fec636d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5904679958514494aa0624f6090f7ae9fec636d/0_0_2169_3014/720.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon fulfilment centre\" width=\"720\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Online specialists such as Amazon are unhindered by a long tail of outdated stores.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Barlow/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Rising costs</h2> <p>As traditional retailers battle to fund adapting their businesses to cope with the shift to online shopping, they are being hit with a perfect storm of other cost rises. The fall in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote has pushed up the cost of sourcing goods abroad. The impending exit from the EU and lower value of sterling have also acted to push up wages in some areas as it has been more difficult to find skilled workers who have traditionally come from mainland Europe, such as van drivers. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/13/how-much-is-an-hour-worth-the-war-over-the-minimum-wage\">rise in the legal minimum wage</a> and imposition of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/jan/25/ministers-should-listen-employers-apprenticeship-levy\">apprenticeship levy</a> have also pushed up costs, as has a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/04/hammond-under-pressure-to-axe-business-rates-rise\">rise in business rates</a> this year. While some businesses have seen a cut, and many small stores were protected, those in the south, particularly in London, have seen major rate rises. About 1,400 shops, pubs, restaurants and hotels received an average rise of almost \u00a350,000 according to property adviser Altus Group.</p> <h2>Consumption fatigue</h2> <p>After years of filling their wardrobes and homes with material possessions, Brits appear to have reached \u201cpeak stuff\u201d. Young people are now more likely to be renters rather than buyers, meaning they\u2019ve no yearning to fill a bottom drawer with household goods they may have to lug between short-term lets. Barclaycard data for last year reveals a 10% increase in spending on entertainment and an 11.4% rise in spending on telecoms, which of course doesn\u2019t include all those direct debits paying for long-term phone contracts. Entertainment, pubs and restaurant spending was all up in double-digit percentages last year, according to Barclaycard, but women\u2019s clothing spending was down. The latest data from Visa indicates that spending on household goods and clothing continues to fall, while restaurants, hotels, pubs and bars are still on the up.</p> <h2>High-street decline</h2> <p>Retailers are currently closing stores at a faster rate than during the recession, but despite the underlying issues being well rehearsed, no coherent plan has emerged to tackle high-street decline. Some 50,000 stores are deemed surplus to requirements and MPs have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/10/mps-to-investigate-ways-of-reviving-online-hit-high-streets-inquiry-shopping\">recently launched a fresh inquiry</a>, with the goal of drawing up a vision of what high streets and town centres could look like by 2030. There is no shortage of brain power being devoted to this emotive subject; retail guru Bill Grimsey is currently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/12/retail-tsar-restarts-taskforce-amid-high-street-crisis\">leading a taskforce that is revisiting his influential 2013 review.</a> But while MPs and retail experts bang their heads together, the pace of decline only accelerates. Last week Marks &amp; Spencer confirmed plans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/22/marks-spencer-close-stores\">to close 100 of its traditional high-street stores by 2022 as sales move online</a>. M&amp;S\u2019s predicament typifies that of large chains with long histories: stores opened on once-thriving high streets are now surrounded by discount stores and fast-food outlets. If shoppers have abandoned a high street and shops are ever more expensive to run, how can retailers be expected to stay?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30e99239ccfcd2fb261e9f1672de15fcf694041a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30e99239ccfcd2fb261e9f1672de15fcf694041a/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"M&S store front\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">M&amp;S\u2019s predicament typifies that of large chains with long histories: stores opened on once thriving high streets are now surrounded by discount stores and fast food outlets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Business Today\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4139\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe>\u00a0 <figcaption>Business today: Get the headlines and editors\u2019 picks every weekday morning.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Bad management</strong></h2> <p>Retail executives have plenty of excuses up their sleeves \u2013 ranging from the weather to declining footfall and the rise of the internet \u2013 for falling sales but no one admits to lacking skills and vision. The world wide web has been around for more than 25 years so retail bosses have had plenty of time to get used to the idea and adapt their businesses. Nearly 50% of Next\u2019s \u00a34bn sales are rung up online, whereas last week Marks &amp; Spencer admitted that despite spending the best part of \u00a3400m on its website operation, it is still too clunky and needs more money thrown at it. There are clear instances of bad management heightening the pressure created by the structural change bearing down on the high street: Homebase, which employs more than 11,000 people, was sold for just \u00a31 after its new Australian owners, Wesfarmers, made terrible decisions that turned a profitable business into a massive loss-maker; the struggling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/17/mothercare-to-close-50-outlets-and-reinstate-ousted-ceo\">Mothercare</a> chain can no longer persuade new parents to shop there despite around 1,900 babies being born every day. Analysts level claims of inexperience at the bosses of retail chains such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/02/house-of-fraser-to-close-stores-restructuring-deal-jobs-at-risk-chinese-firm-cbanner\">House of Fraser</a>, which has joined a long list of household names that includes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/21/carpetright-moss-bros-kingfisher-high-street-retail-mothercare\">Carpetright, New Look and Mothercare</a> resorting to company voluntary arrangements (CVA), a form of insolvency, to jettison their weakest stores.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"309fc9b1fc861a48565441e6512ff071a5d31b44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/309fc9b1fc861a48565441e6512ff071a5d31b44/0_168_5029_3017/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Homebase\u2019s Australian owners, Wesfarmers, saw a profitable business become a massive loss-maker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Homebase\u2019s Australian owners, Wesfarmers, saw a profitable business become a massive loss-maker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Spending squeeze</h2> <p>Consumers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/21/uk-earnings-interest-rate-rise-wages\">have just escaped a long period of falling real income</a> and the scars are now becoming visible on the high street.</p> <p>Last year saw inflation rise to 3%, while wages remained stuck between 2% and 2.5%. According to pay experts, most wage bargaining deals signed last year were nearer 2%.

                "bodyText":"In one fell swoop DIY giant Homebase became the high street\u2019s latest pound shop last week after its Australian owner, Wesfarmers, offloaded the loss-making chain for a token sum to a restructuring firm. The deal is expected to trigger fresh pain on a high street that is already shedding stores and jobs at a faster rate than during the recession in 2009. Major high-street names including Marks &amp; Spencer, Debenhams, Topshop and House of Fraser are also struggling. On Friday the homewares chain Dunelm issued a profit warning, blaming \u201cchallenging\u201d conditions. So why is life so tough on the high street? Online rivals It is hardly a surprise that the high street is under pressure as the internet has hoovered up about a fifth of all retail spending, with non-food sales online rising by 7.5% in the past year. Now smartphones are ubiquitous, it is possible to buy a sofa on the bus, a designer handbag from the sofa or a new kitchen while in bed. The internet has made life challenging for retailers in a number of ways. Apart from directly diverting sales, it has given shoppers less reason to visit their high street, reducing small retailers\u2019 chances of drawing in passing trade, while the cost and complexity of building the infrastructure to deliver goods to homes efficiently has hit profits. As traditional retailers struggle to adapt, they are being pressed by online specialists, such as Asos, Amazon and Boohoo.com, unhindered by a long tail of outdated stores. The ease of comparing prices and accessing goods from around the world has given more options to those based in small towns who are no longer restricted to shopping local, making competition tougher than ever. The internet is also enabling savvy shoppers to trade goods among themselves much more easily. Whether it is bundles of baby clothes selling on Facebook, fashion fans searching for vintage on eBay or Etsy, or teenagers flogging their unwanted impulse purchases on fast-growing mobile app Depop, this market is on the rise. In the US, the fashion resale market, both on and offline, is expected to rise 13% between 2016 and 2021 to $33bn, and new specialist sites such as Hewi (Hardly Ever Worn It) and Vinted as well as Depop are also expected to drive growth in the UK. Rising costs As traditional retailers battle to fund adapting their businesses to cope with the shift to online shopping, they are being hit with a perfect storm of other cost rises. The fall in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote has pushed up the cost of sourcing goods abroad. The impending exit from the EU and lower value of sterling have also acted to push up wages in some areas as it has been more difficult to find skilled workers who have traditionally come from mainland Europe, such as van drivers. The rise in the legal minimum wage and imposition of the apprenticeship levy have also pushed up costs, as has a rise in business rates this year. While some businesses have seen a cut, and many small stores were protected, those in the south, particularly in London, have seen major rate rises. About 1,400 shops, pubs, restaurants and hotels received an average rise of almost \u00a350,000 according to property adviser Altus Group. Consumption fatigue After years of filling their wardrobes and homes with material possessions, Brits appear to have reached \u201cpeak stuff\u201d. Young people are now more likely to be renters rather than buyers, meaning they\u2019ve no yearning to fill a bottom drawer with household goods they may have to lug between short-term lets. Barclaycard data for last year reveals a 10% increase in spending on entertainment and an 11.4% rise in spending on telecoms, which of course doesn\u2019t include all those direct debits paying for long-term phone contracts. Entertainment, pubs and restaurant spending was all up in double-digit percentages last year, according to Barclaycard, but women\u2019s clothing spending was down. The latest data from Visa indicates that spending on household goods and clothing continues to fall, while restaurants, hotels, pubs and bars are still on the up. High-street decline Retailers are currently closing stores at a faster rate than during the recession, but despite the underlying issues being well rehearsed, no coherent plan has emerged to tackle high-street decline. Some 50,000 stores are deemed surplus to requirements and MPs have recently launched a fresh inquiry, with the goal of drawing up a vision of what high streets and town centres could look like by 2030. There is no shortage of brain power being devoted to this emotive subject; retail guru Bill Grimsey is currently leading a taskforce that is revisiting his influential 2013 review. But while MPs and retail experts bang their heads together, the pace of decline only accelerates. Last week Marks &amp; Spencer confirmed plans to close 100 of its traditional high-street stores by 2022 as sales move online. M&amp;S\u2019s predicament typifies that of large chains with long histories: stores opened on once-thriving high streets are now surrounded by discount stores and fast-food outlets. If shoppers have abandoned a high street and shops are ever more expensive to run, how can retailers be expected to stay? Bad management Retail executives have plenty of excuses up their sleeves \u2013 ranging from the weather to declining footfall and the rise of the internet \u2013 for falling sales but no one admits to lacking skills and vision. The world wide web has been around for more than 25 years so retail bosses have had plenty of time to get used to the idea and adapt their businesses. Nearly 50% of Next\u2019s \u00a34bn sales are rung up online, whereas last week Marks &amp; Spencer admitted that despite spending the best part of \u00a3400m on its website operation, it is still too clunky and needs more money thrown at it. There are clear instances of bad management heightening the pressure created by the structural change bearing down on the high street: Homebase, which employs more than 11,000 people, was sold for just \u00a31 after its new Australian owners, Wesfarmers, made terrible decisions that turned a profitable business into a massive loss-maker; the struggling Mothercare chain can no longer persuade new parents to shop there despite around 1,900 babies being born every day. Analysts level claims of inexperience at the bosses of retail chains such as House of Fraser, which has joined a long list of household names that includes Carpetright, New Look and Mothercare resorting to company voluntary arrangements (CVA), a form of insolvency, to jettison their weakest stores. Spending squeeze Consumers have just escaped a long period of falling real income and the scars are now becoming visible on the high street. Last year saw inflation rise to 3%, while wages remained stuck between 2% and 2.5%. According to pay experts, most wage bargaining deals signed last year were nearer 2%. That made for a significant fall in inflation-adjusted earnings and depressed the disposable incomes of most shoppers. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way, with employment at record levels and unemployment so low that it has dropped to levels last seen in the 1970s. What many economists depict as full employment was meant to send wage rates soaring. However, Brexit uncertainty \u2013 and the transformation of working life following the rise of self-employment, part-time jobs and zero-hours contracts \u2013 more than offset the pressure from rising vacancy rates to send household incomes falling backwards. A lack of investment by British business has also played its part, keeping productivity and wage rises low. To maintain their standard of living, consumers have ramped up their borrowing, especially to buy cars and other big-ticket items. They have also run down their savings. The hope is that falling inflation this year will allow real incomes to rise again and a credit binge can be avoided. That\u2019s what most forecasters expect, though the twists and turns of Brexit could wreck that prediction.",
