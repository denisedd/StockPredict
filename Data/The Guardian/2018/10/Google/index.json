                "bodyText":"Johnston Press, which owns titles including the i newspaper, the Scotsman and the Yorkshire Post, has put itself up for sale. The beleaguered publisher, which owns almost 200 regional newspapers, had become bogged down in negotiations with bondholders over a \u00c2\u00a3220m refinancing due in June that it cannot afford. David King, the Johnston Press chief executive, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This comes after a year-plus of working out various strategic options. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In my view, we are obliged to find out what the market thinks about buying Johnston Press. We need to galvanise people, potential buyers, to make it clear if you wait, you might miss out.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd King said he would prefer to sell the business as a whole and believes there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reasonable prospect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of a sale keeping Johnston Press intact. However, he admitted rival publishers and interested parties are likely to focus on its most desirable assets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have a lot of very high-quality assets at Johnston Press sitting under a large debt pile that we inherited,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd King said. The i newspaper, which Johnston Press bought from the Independent and the Evening Standard owner, Evgeny Lebedev, for \u00c2\u00a324m in 2016, is considered to be the most valuable title in a group that has a stock market valuation of less than \u00c2\u00a33m due to its onerous debts. The newspaper has performed well since the acquisition and is on track to make up to \u00c2\u00a312m in profit this year, which would lead Johnston Press to seek a potential price tag of \u00c2\u00a360m once the newspaper is decoupled from its parent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt burden. The i is likely to garner strong interest. When Lebedev quietly sounded out potential buyers for the title, Reach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the publisher of the Mirror and the Express \u00e2\u20ac\u201c expressed an interest but was not willing to pay the amount Johnston Press eventually stumped up. Reach has the printing contract for the i. It is understood News UK, the publisher of the Sun and the Times, also previously ran the rule over the i. The cut-price national title could also prove to be of strategic importance to other national newspaper publishers. However, the actual value of the i will be difficult to gauge because of issues such as cost allocation and an \u00c2\u00a3850,000 annual content deal it has in place with Lebedev\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Independent and Evening Standard, which expires early next year. Johnston Press expects prospective buyers to submit indicative bids within the next six weeks. In an internal email, King sought to reassure staff about the future of the business. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This process is about securing a positive future for Johnston Press,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the meantime, it is business as usual. Johnston Press is a strong and resilient business, with good profits and strong profit margins, great people and prestigious titles. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am certain that whatever the future ownership of the company, we will continue to produce our titles long after the end of the strategic review.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Johnston Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest shareholder, on 22%, is Christen Ager-Hanssen, who last year looked to oust its board in a plan involving the former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond. The second-largest shareholder is the activist fund Crystal Amber, run by Richard Bernstein, which controls 10%. Johnston Press has struggled over the past decade to reduce a debt pile that stood at well over \u00c2\u00a3400m, built up from a string of acquisitions made before the arrival of Google and Facebook hammered the profitability of newspapers. In 2004, the year Mark Zuckerberg launched Facebook, the UK regional newspaper advertising market was worth \u00c2\u00a32.7bn. By the end of next year, it will be worth \u00c2\u00a3700m, according to WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Group M. Between 2009 and 2016, the combined annual circulation of UK regional and local titles halved, from 2.2m to 1.1m, according to Enders Analysis.

The group, which has held the status of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most valuable advertising group since 2011, has seen its stock market value plunge to about \u00c2\u00a313bn ($17bn) as it faces both internal and external crises. WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Mark Read, is struggling to steady the ship after the abrupt departure of its founder, Sir Martin Sorrell. In addition, he is fighting to re-engineer the sprawling group as the digital advertising power of Google and Facebook grows, and advertisers increasingly question the benefits of giving their marketing spend over to traditional global holding companies such as WPP and Omnicom. In the space of a week, embattled WPP has lost three global assignments, including creative duties for Ford, a client for 75 years, as well as American Express and United Airlines. Omnicom has now overtaken WPP in terms of stock market value: it is worth $17.3bn, representing a remarkable, and symbolic, reversal of fortunes for the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two biggest ad groups. As recently as 2014, WPP hit a record market cap of almost $30bn after a winning run that resulted in Sorrell earning more than \u00c2\u00a3200m from pay, and lucrative \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and highly controversial \u00e2\u20ac\u201c reward schemes over a five-year period. During that time, WPP was worth as much as 50% more than Omnicom in market cap terms. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value has collapsed in the last five years,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Alex DeGroote, an independent analyst. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153WPP has lost 60% of its value in the last two years. There has been stark value erosion. The market is hoping that new management can draw a line in the sand and reach a point [where] the share price won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drop any more.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Last year the company reported its lowest level of growth since the advertising recession of 2009. Read, who took over WPP on an interim basis after Sorrell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure in April, and was confirmed as chief executive in September, has rung the changes, merging some of its advertising networks to streamline the empire. The company employs more than 200,000 staff, in 400 separate ad businesses, in more than 3,000 offices in 112 countries. WPP has also opened talks to sell a stake in its China operation and started selling off stakes it holds in businesses such as AppNexus and Globant. WPP remains the biggest marketing services group in the world by revenues, at \u00c2\u00a315bn annually. Last year, Omnicom reported $15bn in revenues.",

The UK recognised \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the substantial potential for Saudi Arabia as a global investment powerhouse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while the Saudis recognised London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unrivalled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd place as a financial centre, a position the <a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/york-overtakes-london-worlds-top-083248614.html\" title=\"\">capital promptly lost to New York</a> shortly afterwards.</p> <p>But the core of the agreement was for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mutual investment opportunities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd worth $100bn over 10 years, including $30bn in direct investments in the UK from the PIF. In exchange, the UK is to share expertise in clean energy, electric vehicles, financial services, culture and entertainment, healthcare, life sciences and, of course, defence.</p> <p>Any and all of these partnerships are likely to involve businesses which, right now at least, fear Saudi is toxic.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a line between not going to a public event [the FII] and what happens with actual cash placements,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Ziemba. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But for some investors, this is another example of uncertainty around Saudi foreign policy.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153They may have more challenges attracting inward investment than placing it abroad with companies that usually need the money.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Nigel Kushner, chief executive of W Legal and an expert in sanctions, warns that the worst-case scenario for the Saudis is if the US decides to put individuals and businesses on the list of those sanctioned under its Magnitsky Act.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The reality is that business internationally would be closed for anyone on the list,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Kushner. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If they put businesspeople or companies on the list that would have a meaningful impact: it could all be removed overnight if the US were minded to do so. But I very much doubt it will be.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <h2>A wide portfolio</h2> <p>The vast oil wealth of Saudi Arabia and its royal family has been spread liberally around the world in recent years. Many of their overseas assets are owned via the mammoth $93bn Vision Fund shared with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Softbank, while some are personal playthings of sundry royals.</p> <p>These are some of the assets, ranging from steel to Silicon Valley.</p> <p><strong>The Vision Fund</strong><br>Saudi Arabia put up $45bn of the $93bn in the Vision Fund, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest private equity pot, managed by Softbank. The investment vehicle has poured cash into more than 25 companies, particularly tech startups and champions such as Uber \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Vision Fund is the ride-hailing app\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s single biggest shareholder with a $9bn stake. Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), separately owns 5%, worth $3.5bn.</p> <p>ARM Holdings is the second biggest investment in the Vision Fund stable. The Cambridge-based tech firm designs chips used in millions of smartphones around the world. The Vision Fund has a 25% stake worth $8.3bn, as well as $8.2bn in fellow chipmaker Nvidia.</p> <p>It has also ploughed $2.3bn into GM Cruise, the driverless cars unit of General Motors, and $4.4bn into workspace company WeWork.</p> <p>London-based startup Improbable, which creates virtual worlds for video games, attracted $500m from Softbank, which later moved it into the Vision Fund.</p> <p>Slack, perhaps best described as a Facebook for business, is a cloud-based virtual office that won a $300m injection. Other Vision Fund investments include food delivery service DoorDash ($500m), German online car dealer Auto1 ($460m) and biopharma firm Roivant ($1bn).</p> <p><strong>Blackstone infrastructure</strong><br>During President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit to Saudi last year, it was announced that the PIF would plough $20bn into a $40bn US infrastructure fund managed by investment giant Blackstone. The project is in its early stages and has struggled to find appropriate investments.</p> <p><strong>Other investments</strong><br>The PIF has also sought out tech projects beyond the Vision ambit and owns a 5% stake in electric car maker Tesla. It also joined big-name backers to invest in secretive augmented reality startup Magic Leap, backing it with $400m. It also holds interests in steel, via a subsidiary of ArcelorMittal.</p> <p><strong>Personal investments</strong><br>Some Saudi royals are big investors in their own right<strong>.</strong> Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal spent $25m on a 2.3% stake in Snapchat this year, plus $267m on shares in French music streaming service Deezer. He already owns stakes in Twitter and ride-hailing service Lyft.</p> <p>Then there are the usual personal fripperies, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/18/300m-french-chateau-bought-by-saudi-prince-linked-to-da-vinci-purchase-report\" title=\"\">Mohammed bin Salman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $300m French chateau</a> and a yacht that cost even more, at $500m. But they hardly seem worth mentioning.</p>",
                "bodyText":"When Mohammed bin Salman was touring the UK and US earlier this year, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and its de facto ruler \u00e2\u20ac\u201c could have relied almost exclusively on businesses backed by the kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money. Landing in London, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153MBS\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd might have dispensed with his chauffeur-driven car, travelling into the capital by Uber, while his aides finalised his itinerary on smartphones powered with chips designed by Cambridge-based ARM Holdings.

On the US leg of the journey, perhaps slumming it in an Accor hotel, MBS and his entourage might have dialled up a plate of the Saudi national rice dish, kabsa, from delivery service DoorDash.

Every one of these companies is part of the portfolio of Riyadh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which manages the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil wealth.

But even if funds can be raised elsewhere, the international investment component of the masterplan is at risk, due to the allegations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c denied by the crown prince \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that he ordered the murder and dismemberment of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The keystone of the international strategy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which could now be under threat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has been the kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s provision of nearly half the money in the $93bn Vision Fund managed by Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Softbank. Much of that cash has gone into potential future blue-chips such as Uber, electric car start-up Lucid Motors and General Motors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s driverless car unit, GM Cruise. MBS is close to Softbank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s billionaire chief executive, Masayoshi Son, one of the few business leaders not to have pulled out of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Future Investment Initiative (FII) in Riyadh \u00e2\u20ac\u201c described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Davos in the desert\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in light of the allegations.

A memorandum of understanding signed with the UK after MBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit earlier this year offers some insight into how Riyadh envisages a symbiotic relationship between internal investment and domestic projects. The document was full of mutual praise. The UK recognised \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the substantial potential for Saudi Arabia as a global investment powerhouse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while the Saudis recognised London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unrivalled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd place as a financial centre, a position the capital promptly lost to New York shortly afterwards. But the core of the agreement was for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mutual investment opportunities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd worth $100bn over 10 years, including $30bn in direct investments in the UK from the PIF. In exchange, the UK is to share expertise in clean energy, electric vehicles, financial services, culture and entertainment, healthcare, life sciences and, of course, defence. Any and all of these partnerships are likely to involve businesses which, right now at least, fear Saudi is toxic. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a line between not going to a public event [the FII] and what happens with actual cash placements,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Ziemba. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But for some investors, this is another example of uncertainty around Saudi foreign policy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They may have more challenges attracting inward investment than placing it abroad with companies that usually need the money.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nigel Kushner, chief executive of W Legal and an expert in sanctions, warns that the worst-case scenario for the Saudis is if the US decides to put individuals and businesses on the list of those sanctioned under its Magnitsky Act. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The reality is that business internationally would be closed for anyone on the list,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Kushner. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If they put businesspeople or companies on the list that would have a meaningful impact: it could all be removed overnight if the US were minded to do so. But I very much doubt it will be.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A wide portfolio The vast oil wealth of Saudi Arabia and its royal family has been spread liberally around the world in recent years. Many of their overseas assets are owned via the mammoth $93bn Vision Fund shared with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Softbank, while some are personal playthings of sundry royals. These are some of the assets, ranging from steel to Silicon Valley. The Vision Fund Saudi Arabia put up $45bn of the $93bn in the Vision Fund, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest private equity pot, managed by Softbank. The investment vehicle has poured cash into more than 25 companies, particularly tech startups and champions such as Uber \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Vision Fund is the ride-hailing app\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s single biggest shareholder with a $9bn stake. Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), separately owns 5%, worth $3.5bn. ARM Holdings is the second biggest investment in the Vision Fund stable. The Cambridge-based tech firm designs chips used in millions of smartphones around the world. The Vision Fund has a 25% stake worth $8.3bn, as well as $8.2bn in fellow chipmaker Nvidia. It has also ploughed $2.3bn into GM Cruise, the driverless cars unit of General Motors, and $4.4bn into workspace company WeWork. London-based startup Improbable, which creates virtual worlds for video games, attracted $500m from Softbank, which later moved it into the Vision Fund. Slack, perhaps best described as a Facebook for business, is a cloud-based virtual office that won a $300m injection. Other Vision Fund investments include food delivery service DoorDash ($500m), German online car dealer Auto1 ($460m) and biopharma firm Roivant ($1bn). Blackstone infrastructure During President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit to Saudi last year, it was announced that the PIF would plough $20bn into a $40bn US infrastructure fund managed by investment giant Blackstone. The project is in its early stages and has struggled to find appropriate investments. Other investments The PIF has also sought out tech projects beyond the Vision ambit and owns a 5% stake in electric car maker Tesla. It also joined big-name backers to invest in secretive augmented reality startup Magic Leap, backing it with $400m. It also holds interests in steel, via a subsidiary of ArcelorMittal. Personal investments Some Saudi royals are big investors in their own right. Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal spent $25m on a 2.3% stake in Snapchat this year, plus $267m on shares in French music streaming service Deezer. He already owns stakes in Twitter and ride-hailing service Lyft. Then there are the usual personal fripperies, such as Mohammed bin Salman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $300m French chateau and a yacht that cost even more, at $500m. But they hardly seem worth mentioning.",

Docker was receiving \u00c2\u00a33,800 a month in rent.</p> <p>Rodrigues and his firm, which is still trading, were convicted of 22 offences including failing to protect occupiers and failing to provide a safe means of escape.</p> <p>Newham council housing officer Paul Oatt, who inspected the property, said the pub was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153death trap\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as tenants at the top of the building would have struggled to get out alive in the event of a fire.</p> <p>Rodrigues told the Guardian he knew nothing about the fine or breaking down a door. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I do not know anything about a fine,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not aware of anything.

                "bodyText":"The most comprehensive ever survey of convicted landlords in England and Wales, carried out by the Guardian and ITV News, reveals that 502 landlords committed 752 housing offences in 2017. They were fined a total of \u00c2\u00a32.7m \u00e2\u20ac\u201c less than \u00c2\u00a33,600 per offence. Many of the landlords were repeat offenders, with 123 convicted of multiple housing offences in the same year. The survey is based on FoI responses from more than three-quarters of councils in England and Wales with responsibility for the private rented sector. Highest fines in 2017 A letting agent who is claimed to have terrorised migrants living above a dangerous former pub owned by a property tycoon received the highest total amount of fines for housing offences last year, according to freedom of information requests made by the Guardian and ITV News. Jose Marcos Bispo Rodrigues and his company were fined a total of \u00c2\u00a3190,500 in April 2017, our survey found. Rodrigues was subletting 15 small, sometimes windowless, rooms to at least 20 migrant workers and students above the former Castle pub in Plaistow, east London, according to court documents. The court heard that tenants lived in fear of Rodrigues because he had ripped off the door to one of the bedrooms to confront a man who could not afford an increase in the rent. The former pub, owned by luxury property developer Michael Docker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s firm Castle Estates Limited, had no working fire alarm nor a fire door to prevent fire spreading from the kitchen. Docker was receiving \u00c2\u00a33,800 a month in rent. Rodrigues and his firm, which is still trading, were convicted of 22 offences including failing to protect occupiers and failing to provide a safe means of escape. Newham council housing officer Paul Oatt, who inspected the property, said the pub was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153death trap\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as tenants at the top of the building would have struggled to get out alive in the event of a fire. Rodrigues told the Guardian he knew nothing about the fine or breaking down a door. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I do not know anything about a fine,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not aware of anything. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to find out.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rodrigues did not respond to subsequent efforts to contact him. Rodrigues and his firm ML Arndt Rodrigues Ltd have not paid any of the record fine, which was imposed six months ago. The Ministry of Justice said the matter had been passed to bailiffs. Docker, who let the former pub to Rodrigues after he struggled to get planning permission, was fined \u00c2\u00a33,825 for breaching the building\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s single-family licence and failing to produce a gas safety certificate. District judge Timothy Rose said Docker did not properly inspect his property. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He was the licensee; whether he \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclikes it or not\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 he had the responsibility to ensure that he was complying with licence requirements and he cannot avoid that by stating that he left it all to others on his behalf,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he wrote in his judgment. Docker also owns the Gracewood Group, which has built about 40 luxury residential schemes across east London worth more than \u00c2\u00a3300m. The property developer claimed he ran his business in accordance with all residential statutory and regulatory requirements. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was the only occasion that I have been prosecuted for a breach of a statutory requirement and I am saddened that this occurred due to a combination of tenant obstruction and administrative error,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. The biggest single fine was imposed on Bewel Property Ltd, which was ordered to pay \u00c2\u00a3150,000 in 2017 after a judge said live wiring and a rotten balcony in a Bayswater flat the company was renting out was endangering the lives of six \u00e2\u20ac\u0153young professionals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to responses to the FoI requests made by the Guardian and ITV News. They were each paying around \u00c2\u00a31,000 a month in rent. The sole director of Bewel, which owned the lease on the property at the time the offences were committed, was Jeffery Hu, who was fined \u00c2\u00a35,000. He told the Guardian the fines were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ridiculous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and denied the tenants lives had been put at risk. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That wire was not dangerous \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was dead. The leak from the roof \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I could not do nothing about that. It was leaking a long time and it affected the damp in the living room.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hu insisted he could not be held responsible for the condition of the properties: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to fix everything on behalf of the landlord. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make sense.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That, however, was not Bewel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only offence.

Hu was fined \u00c2\u00a32,000 for not submitting gas certificates. Both Hu and Bewel are still operating in the central London rental market. Hu holds two licences for house shares in Westminster, while Bewel holds another. Most convictions Absentee landlord Mustafa Taghdi had the most convictions for both licensing and non-licensing offences in 2017. He pleaded guilty to renting out 16 unlicensed flats and houses in Liverpool and breaching two emergency prohibition orders \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which are used by councils to prevent serious harm to tenants.

Against all the macro headwinds, the micro factor of strong U.S. corporate earnings had been enough to insulate the market.

The problems in the U.S. market are having knock-on effects on global equities, and the rising U.S. dollar is exacerbating difficulties for emerging markets and Asia. However, the global economy is still growing and corporate earnings are still positive.

                "bodyText":"Alphabet also missed Wall Street forecasts. The company behind Google posted revenue of $33.74bn in the last quarter, missing estimates of $34.05 billion. Still, Alphabet also reported net profit of $9.19 billion, or $13.06 per share, up from $9.57 per share a year ago. eMarketer analyst Monica Peart says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing a larger than expected slowdown in Google properties\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 revenue, representing its core search business. This is likely related to the ramp-up in competition from Amazon, as consumers increasingly turn to the ecommerce giant for their product searches.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight! GW Amazon has taken a bite out of Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new-found optimism tonight, by missing analyst expectations: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Amazon.com Inc. reported sales that missed analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 estimates, and issued a disappointing revenue forecast for the busy holiday quarter, suggesting the online marketplace may be reaching a saturation point in the U.S. Revenue gained 29 percent to $56.6 billion in the third quarter, the e-commerce giant said Thursday in a statement. Analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 projected $57.1 billion. Sales will be from $66.5 billion to $72.5 billion in the current period, falling short of analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 average estimate of $73.8 billion. Shares declined as much as 6.5 percent in extended trading. Ut-oh... Amazon and Alphabet have just released results as the echo of the closing bell fade. And Wall Street is NOT happy..... Intel has smashed earnings forecasts, though: Breaking: After Wipeout Wednesday, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Turnaround Thursday. October has maintained its run of wild swings tonight, as Wall Street bounces back. The Dow Jones industrial average has closed 401 points higher, a gain of 1.6%, at 24,984. Technology, industrials companies and banks led the rally. Microsoft closed 6% higher, while Intel gained 4.8%. With tech stocks romping ahead, the Nasdaq has posted its biggest one-day jump in seven months. The Nasdaq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery is even punchier than the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The tech-focused index has leapt by 3%, with just a few minutes to go. Tesla, Twitter and Microsoft have all done their bit, with forecast-beating results in the last 24 hours. The rebound has legs! With just 30 minutes to go, the Dow is up an impressive 490 points, or 2%, at 25,073. That means its recovered a large chunk of the Wednesday wobble. Traders in New York must be dizzy! The Dow is holding onto its gains. With two hours to go, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 380 points at 24,963, up 1.5%. Microsoft is leading the charge, up 5.7% after impressive results last night. Intel (+5%) and VISA (+3.45%) are close behind. The ongoing market turbulence hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deterred US company Yeti from floating on the stock market today. Yeti makes high end coolers and outdoor gear, popular with outdoor types like hunters and surfers, and pitmasters who spend time tending barbecues (important work!). Their kit isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cheap. The Tundra 125 cooler retails at $549 -- for that, you get enough space for 73 cans or dozens of hot dogs, hamburger patties and cold cuts. Yeti floated at $18 per share -- so far, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve slipped by 7% to $16.80. Not a great start - still, a yeti makes a change from all those Wall Street bears. After tumbling in early trading, European stock markets have recovered to end the day higher. In London, the FTSE 100 has climbed back over the 7,000 point mark, ending up 41 points at 7,004. It would be higher, but for WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB had a good day, gaining 1.8% after Mario Dragji said he was confident that the deadlock over Rome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget plans would be resolved. The French CAC gained 1.6%, and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX rose 1%, as traders welcomed the rally in New York. On Wall Street, the Dow is now up 350 points - trying to put Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shocker behind it. Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble into a bear market overnight is still a concern, though, as market volatility remains high. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses could be a buying opportunity...... Wall Street started on the front foot with tech stocks on the rise after falling sharply in the previous session. Upbeat results from Microsoft and Telsa have gone some way to calming investor nerves after disappointments from Caterpillar and 3M earlier in the week. Whilst a slew of risk factors have hit traders confidence hard this month, investors will be looking searching for the bottom of this recent shake out. So far market shake out\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this year have been buying opportunities and whilst we are still in a bull market, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see why this one should be any different right now. Neil MacKinnon, Global Macro Strategist at VTB Capital, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council meeting came at a tricky time for the ECB. The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to hold current interest rate levels at 0% takes place at a time of a cyclical slowdown in the Eurozone economies, as well as persistently subdued core CPI inflation. Business growth is at its slowest in two years and companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of future growth have slipped to the lowest in four years. The Italian budget drama is also high on the agenda and the stand-off between Rome and Brussels is unlikely to be resolved. Also noteworthy is the risk of a worsening \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdoom-loop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 between Italian banks and their holdings of domestic sovereign debt. Italy is not Greece and Rome will react badly if the ECB resorts to its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcenforcement tools\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of closing down bond purchases and turning off the liquidity tap for the Italian banking system.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some expert reaction to the European Central Bank press conference today: Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference Draghi chose to strike a relatively hawkish note, while acknowledging somewhat weaker economic momentum as of late. There has been some concern in the market about a number of disappointing data prints this month, including the flash PMIs yesterday, but evidence so far has not been strong enough to change the ECB stance. Anthony Kurukgy, Senior Sales Trader at Foenix Partners Mario Draghi stuck to the script again at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB Press Conference, delivering yet another \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbalanced\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment of the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. The ECB President quelled recent concerns of weaker economic data as merely a slowdown of growth momentum, not a downturn. This aside, the ECB remain committed to ending the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond-buying programme come December. Transitory or not, Draghi and Co. will need to buy themselves more time to distinguish what effect trade wars, Brexit and the recent Italian budget crisis will have on its interest rate hike timeline in 2019. Silvia Dall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Angelo, Senior Economist, Hermes Investment Management The bottom line is that the ECB is on a gradual path of monetary policy normalisation for now, but risks from protectionism, a further slowdown in external demand, domestic political instability, Brexit and volatility in financial markets cast a dark shadow on the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans. Policy uncertainty has increased both externally and domestically: international trade tensions have remained high, there is no solution for the Brexit issue in sight, and the Italian government seems determined to defy the European fiscal rules. The recent turmoil in financial markets is a new addition to the list of downside risks. Marina Mensah-Afoakwah, Senior Economist at the CEBR Between Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget drama and the precarious nature of Brexit, there is a lot that threatens the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stability. For the time being these pressures haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t risen to a level requiring ECB intervention. Time will tell however, as latest figures suggest cracks are beginning to show in the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bounceback on Wall Street means some investors may be snaffling up bargains. Or at least, what they hope are bargains. CNBC explains why traders may be putting their toes into the water again: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The technical picture has turned increasingly bearish this month,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The percentage of S&amp;P 500 companies trading above their 200-day moving averages was down to 37% after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debacle.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He noted, however, that prior similar declines during this bull market have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153marked buying opportunities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yardeni added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If this is still a bull market, as we believe it is, then the latest bearish technicals and October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s swoon should mark the latest buying opportunity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in the markets, shares are rising in New York as traders return to the fray after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alarming late sell-off. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 192 points at the open, or 0.8%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an encouraging start, after Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 608-point slide. The Nasdaq is also recovering, after slumping ingloriously into a correction yesterday, in its worst day since 2011. The strong results from Twitter today, plus Microsoft and Tesla yesterday, may be calming nerves. Tesla has surged by over 8% in early trading, with other carmakers also up (Ford has gained almost 6%). Twitter has leapt by 15%, after beating profit and revenue forecasts today. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early days. Investors will be watching nervously to see if Wall Street can hold onto these gains, or be dragged down again. Mario Draghi warns that there could be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcuneasiness\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the financial markets, unless Britain and the EU make progress towards a Brexit deal. Asked about Brexit at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference, the ECB president says he is confident that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good, common sense solution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will be found. But he also warns that time is running out - if a deal isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reached, banks and other businesses will be forced to trigger their contingency plans. As Draghi puts it: If this lack of a solution continues, and approaches the end date, the the private sector itself will have to prepare on the assumption that it will be a hard Brexit. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where there will be financial uneasiness in markets. Boom! Mario Draghi has admonished politicians, such as Donald Trump, who put pressure on central banks to change their policy. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been asked the pressure on the European Central Bank and the Fed to maintain their stimulus programmes, or do more. Draghi tells reporters in Frankfurt that these attacks threaten central bank independence. He says: Central bank independence is a precious thing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s precious because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s essential for the credibility of the central banks, and credibility is essential for effectiveness. That means giving central banks the independence to deliver their mandates, and to choose which instruments are most effective. If that is eroded, then a central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effectiveness is reduced, he warns. Earlier this week, Trump blasted the Fed for being too keen to raise interest rates, accusing it of threatening the US economy. In Europe, the ECB has faced criticism from Germany, for example, over its stimulus programme and record low interest rates. Draghi suggests that politicians should see the big picture: Actually the legislators themselves, who are often the very same people who are arguing for the central bank to do this or that, should be the first ones to care about monetary policy effectiveness and central banks achieving their goals. Q: What options do you have if the financial markets continue to fall, if economic data worsens, or if relations between Italy and the EC deteriorate further? We still have tools in the toolbox, Draghi replies. He reveals that two speakers at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Governing Council meeting mentioned its TLTRO programme -- which provides cheap financing to eurozone banks. Mario Draghi is fending off several questions about Italy, and whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worried about the rise in its bond yields. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arguing that the spillover impact from Italy onto other countries is limited so far. Q: Are you worried that the spread between Italian and German bonds could continue to widen, perhaps to 400 basis points? Would that cause impairments to Italian banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 balance sheets? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a crystal ball, Draghi snaps back briskly. But yes, there is a linkage betweem Italian sovereign debt and its banks (which hold a lot of it). If they lose value, they are denting into the capital position of the banks. Mario Draghi adds that he is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconfident\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that an agreement between Italy and the European Commission over its budget will be found . [reminder, the EC rejected Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans on Tuesday, but Rome is refusing to rewrite them] Q: What does the ECB think about the clash between Rome and Brussels over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget? Italy is a fiscal discussion, Draghi replies, so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discussed much at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Onto questions.. Q) Did the ECB discuss downgrading their assessment of the eurozone economy today? Mario Draghi speaks at some length, explaining that the governing council agreed that economic momentum has weakened, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not facing a downturn. Various \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcidiosyncratic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reasons are to blame - such as the slowdown in Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car sector as manufacturers get to grips with new emission rules. There are also a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbunch of uncertainties\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, such as the stalemate between the US and China over trade, Brexit, and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget. Plus, Draghi adds, growth is returning to potential when it was clearly above potential in 2017. These risks are not considered enough to merit changing our balance of risks, he insists firmly. Draghi ends his statement with his traditional call for eurozone government to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsubstantially step up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 their structural reforms, to take advantage of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus measures. Eurozone states must raise their long-term growth potential, he adds. Over in Frankfurt, ECB president Mario Draghi is explaining today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision. He has singled out protectionism, emerging market vulnerabilities and financial market volatility as important risks to the eurozone recovery. However, overall risks are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbroadly balanced\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, he says. On inflation, the ECB thinks domestic cost pressures are strengthening and broadening, as wage increases feed through to prices. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on those durable goods figures: Newsflash: Orders for durable goods at American firms has fallen for the second month running (if you strip out aircraft and defence sales). Core durable goods orders shrank by 0.1% last month, new data shows, following a 0.2% decline in August. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a small move, of course, but it suggests US manufacturing isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sizzling. Perhaps tariffs are having an effect. Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings beat is going to help drive Wall Street up again, after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late rout. The tech-focused Nasdaq is now forecast to jump by 1.7% when trading begins. The Dow is on track to gain 220 points (or more than a third of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump). Electric carmaker Tesla is also likely to surge, after surprising investors with a return to profitability last night. Microsoft also beat forecasts last night, partly thanks to strong growth at its Azure cloud computing division. Twitter isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only company beating forecasts today. Comcast, which recently won the battle for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sky News, has also impressed investors. Net income jumped by 9% in the last three months, as it attracted more broadband customers. NEWSFLASH: The European Central Bank has (to no-one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise) left eurozone interest rates at their current record lows. That means the headline borrowing rate remains at zero, while banks face a negative interest rate of -0.4% on their deposits at the ECB (to encourage them to lend the money instead). It also makes three important points: The ECB is still \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcanticipating\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 it will end its bond-buying programme in December, after buying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn of securities each month until the end of the year. The ECB reiterated that it expects to leave rates on hold until at least the summer of 2019, to ensure that inflation returns sustainably to its target of just below 2%. It also restated its plan to reinvest the proceeds of bonds bought under its QE stimulus programme. That would avoid the risk of tightening monetary policy too quickly, even if the ECB has stopped printing any more electronic money. Dr Ben Marder, Senior Lecturer in Marketing at University of Edinburgh Business School, is concerned that Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s active user base is shrinking. He thinks that the site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fake News problem is hurting: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald Trump, no matter your opinion of the man, is Twitter gold. His tweets attract vast swathes of traffic to the site and he has no doubt had a positive effect on Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock price in the past few years. This was a mutually beneficial relationship as Twitter was pivotal for Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2016 presidential election success. However, despite Twitter posting higher than expected earnings and revenue in Q3 2018, monthly active users have fallen for a second quarter in a row as the company continues to purge bots and fake accounts. It seems Trump is now biting the hand that used to feed him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Twitter, much like other social media giants are starting to bleed-out from the large thorn in their side which is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Worsening the wound are world-wide governments, including the US who are threatening regulatory action against the tech giants for facilitating the dissemination of fake news. Adding to the many great ironies for Trump, he is largely rumoured to be a not so secret proponent of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Par exemple..... Twitter is benefitting from a surge in advertising deals, explains Anthony Capano, managing director of Europe for Rakuten Marketing: While Twitter focused its efforts earlier this year on cleaning the platform of fraudulent actors, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that the focus has returned to investing in global opportunities for advertisers. Earlier in Q3 the platform revealed a host of content partnerships including Bloomberg, Sony Music and NBCUniversal that would bring hundreds of hours of livestreams and other videos to the platform in the Asia-Pacific region. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important UK marketers see how relevant these opportunities are to their operation. In Britain alone, as many as 35% of our client transactions are now taking place overseas. Some Silicon Valley early risers are waking up to the news that Twitter did better than expected last quarter: Newsflash: Twitter has smashed Wall Street forecasts with its latest financial results. The social network site grew its earnings to 21 cents per share in the last quarter, well ahead of estimates of 14 cents. Revenues came in at $758, beating forecasts of $702m, thanks to a 29% leap in advertising sales. However, Twitter also revealed that the number of monthly active users fell to 326 million; analysts expected 331.5 million. That may be due to Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to eradicate trolls, and malicious accounts created to pump out fake news and influence elections. Twitter also warned that it expects to keep losing active users in the current quarter. Shares are soaring in pre-market trading, as investors cheer the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings growth. 2018 has been a pretty rough year for the markets, with nearly $7 trillion (!) wiped off stock values since the end of January. So, the 42 trillion dollar question is whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re heading towards a proper, old-fashioned crash... or if these lower prices actually give value. Neil Wilson of Markets.com suggests the long-running bull market hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run out of steam yet. Stocks could rally if the Federal Reserve decides to slow the pace of future interest rate rises - as Donald Trump has been demanding. Wilson writes: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a period of pressure building to the downside as we get more down days than up and the breadth of the decline is important as is the volume. However whilst the recent spike in volatility may be seen as meaning we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re past the peak, there may yet be a few breaths left in this old bull. Valuations - while not going for a song - are a lot more attractive at about 16x forward earnings. Confidence is clearly lacking however and it may require a softening tone from the Fed to assuage concerns on rates. Softer inflation figures would help greatly and the autumn/winter may provide respite on that front. If we go back a couple of weeks we must recall that this selling started on some very hawkish jawboning by Jerome Powell on rates. This may be the start of the age of the Bears but it may equally be just a tantrum. The macro outlook is not great - China, trade, Italy are all weights but for most of 2018 US investors were able to shrug off any global worries. Advertising giant WPP is having a torrid day, as its new boss gets to grips with the business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems. Shares are down 16%, at their lowest level since December 2012, after it missed sales forecasts and slashed its guidance. CEO Mark Read, who replaced industry veteran Sir Martin Sorrell earlier this year, was blunt about WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems, saying: Clearly we have underperformed our competition in the third quarter. We are not going to sugarcoat the reality.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Facebook has been buffeted by the stock market sell-off. Its shares slid by 5% yesterday, and are down 17% this year as the social network giant faces tough questions about extremism and election interference. In another blow, it has just been fined half a million pounds by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s information commissioner for not protecting users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data. This follows the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which exposed how third party developers had been allowed to access user information without sufficient consent. In monetary terms, \u00c2\u00a3500k is barely a mosquito bite on a mammoth company worth $421bn. But it comes with a stern rebuke from information commissioner Elizabeth Denham, who says: Facebook failed to sufficiently protect the privacy of its users before, during and after the unlawful processing of this data. A company of its size and expertise should have known better and it should have done better. After that shaky start, European stocks have now turn positive for the day! Germany, France and Italy have all rebounded from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows, with Italian banks are leading the rally. Even the FTSE 100 is getting a boost, clawing its way back from that seven-month low. One factor - Wall Street is currently expected to rally in a few hours. The Dow futures show a gain of 224 points, following Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 608-point rout. Another factor: One of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition leaders has vowed to step in if a bank or other company needs help. Deputy PM Matteo Salvini, who also leads the right-wing Northern League party, said any help provided would be different from past interventions. Salvini also suggested that investors are too pessimistic about Italy, having driven its bond yields higher in recent weeks. Reuters has more details: Salvini, who is also the leader of the ruling League party, said on the sidelines of a conference in the northern city of Verona that the Italy/Germany bond yield spread would inevitably fall if it followed the real economy. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says investors are nervous about the state of the world. He explains: The chief concerns are the potential negative impacts of higher interest rates, weaker global growth and the knock-on effects of trade tariffs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The FTSE 100 fell 0.7% in early trading on Thursday to 6,912 with pharmaceuticals, insurers and oil companies the biggest contributors to the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei index incurred heavy losses, falling 3.7% in a single session.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in Australia, insurance group AMP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares crashed by 25% today, as it paid the price for past misdeeds. AMP shocked investors by revealing that its wealth management business suffered a $1.5bn asset withdrawal in the last quarter. The company suffered badly from Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Royal Commission into banking, earlier this year. That inquiry exposed that AMB had charge customers who had died, and imposed fees even if it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide a services. More here: Our latest Brexit dashboard shows how consumer spending slowed last month, even before the stock market turmoil hit confidence. Two leading economists argue that the government needs to take bold action, by ending austerity and helping businesses navigate Brexit uncertainty: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubled retail sector is reeling from another blow this morning, as Debenhams outlines plans to shut up to 50 stores. The closure plan puts thousands of jobs at risk, on top of tens of thousands of redundancies at fellow chains such as Toys R Us, Mothercare, Carpetright and Maplin. Debenhams dropped the bad news as it reported a \u00c2\u00a3500m annual loss, partly due the cost of writing off unwanted shop leases and IT systems. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an astonishing amount, for a company only valued at \u00c2\u00a3100m. The closures will take place over the next three to five years, Debs says, as it pulls out of unprofitable stores. Simon Underwood, business recovery partner at accountancy firm Menzies LLP, warns that the days of the traditional department store are numbered. Instead, they will become \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexperimental showrooms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, or places for meetings etc. Underwood adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decision to focus on a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprofitable core\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of stores is a good one. However, the question is whether closing just ten stores now, with a view to reducing store numbers further over the next three to five years will be enough in view of the speed of changes in the marketplace as consumers shift to buying online. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The high street needs support, but some of the ideas being mooted by Government could prove counterproductive. For example, the Chairman of John Lewis, Sir Charlie Mayfield has recently spoken out against the Amazon tax and many bricks and mortar retailers fear that a blanket levy on online sales would be tantamount to hitting the high street when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down, as most of them sell goods online too. German firms are also anxious about the danger that Britain leaves the EU without a deal, says IFO. The row between Italy and the EU over its 2019 budget is another worry, it adds. Just in: business morale in Germany has taken a tumble this month. The German business climate index produced by the IFO institute dropped to 102.8 this month, down from 103.7 in September. Company bosses said business conditions had deteriorated, while their expectations also become gloomier. Geopolitical tensions, such as the trade wars between the US and China, seem to be hurting. Ifo chief Clemens Fuest blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglobal uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the drop in confidence, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Firms were less satisfied with their current business situation and less optimistic about the months ahead. Growing global uncertainty is increasingly taking its toll on the German economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Worryingly, there doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be a single cause for the current sell-off (unlike in 2008, say, or in 2015 when investors fretted about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy). Instead, a cocktail of problems are being blamed, as traders worry that the long bull market in shares may be petering out. Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, says the lack of a single cause for the current volatility is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153troubling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There are many symptoms but no one can diagnose the illness. Geopolitics, rising bond U.S. bond yields, a more hawkish looking U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed), slowing Chinese growth, a strong U.S. dollar and the already well known problems in some emerging economies have all contributed to the market unease. The focus for investors had been on corporate earnings. Against all the macro headwinds, the micro factor of strong U.S. corporate earnings had been enough to insulate the market. So far the U.S. earnings season has been decent, with approximately 30% of the S&amp;P 500 companies by market capitalization having reported and 83% of those having beaten analyst\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations for earnings. The anxiety now in markets stems from whether this is the peak in earnings and growth, as higher input costs from rising wages, the impact of tariffs and higher funding costs start to impinge on corporate margins. The problems in the U.S. market are having knock-on effects on global equities, and the rising U.S. dollar is exacerbating difficulties for emerging markets and Asia. However, the global economy is still growing and corporate earnings are still positive. They may not grow as fast or be as positive from here on out, but these are still reasons to favour risk assets and equities. Markets are likely to remain jittery for the rest of the year. The upcoming G20 meeting is not likely to result in a resolution of the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. Both sides are caught in a case of political brinkmanship. There are heavy losses in Europe too. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX index has fallen by 0.8%, to its lowest level since December 2016. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC hit its lowest level since March 2017, down another 0.4% in early trading. Here are the best and worst performing shares on the FTSE 100 this morning. Utilities, precious metal miners, and other defensive stocks are in - most other companies are out! Boom! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has hit a seven-month low at the start of trading in London. The blue-chip index has fallen by 75 points to 6887, a drop of over 1%, its lowest level since late March. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now lost around 8% of its value in the last four weeks, as the market sell-off has gathered pace. Advertising giant WPP are leading the selloff, slumping by 18% after reporting that revenues 1.5% fell in the last quarter. Consumer goods producers, technology companies, miners and energy firms are also in the red, as Europe picks up the sell-off baton from Asia. Some context: Stephen Innis of foreign exchange firm OANDA fears that the US stock markets are on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153verge of crumbling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, after last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late rout. If people are struggling to find a driver I suggest, they wake up and smell the coffee. The catalysts are nothing new -- Tariffs, Italy, Brexit, Saudi Arabia. But with the towering pillars of market strength, the US equity markets, is looking ever so fragile and on the verge of crumbling. The air is so thick with a sense of foreboding that you can cut it with a dull butter knife. Maybe there are too many things going sideways clouding investor judgement, but things could turn nasty in a heartbeat. With risk sentiment tanking, we could be facing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the early stages of a protracted equity market meltdown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he adds. Yesterday was the worst day for tech stocks on Wall Street for seven years, dragging the Nasdaq into bear-market territory and wiping out the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2018 gains. And today, markets were in retreat from Sydney to Shanghai, my colleague Martin Farrer reports: In Australia the benchmark ASX200 closed down 164 points or 2.8% as it suffered its fifth straight day of losses. In Japan the Nikkei was off 3.7% and has now dropped around 13% from a 27-year peak of 24,448.07 touched in early October. A broad indicator of shares in the region \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the MSCI Asia Pacific index \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has now fallen 20.3% from the year-to-date high set on 29 January, representing an official bear market. The Vix \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fear\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd index, which measures volatility across the market, has spiked sharply this week and was up 21% overnight. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t thought that selling would be this steep. This sell-off makes us think the market may be set for capitulation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Shoji Hirakawa, chief global strategist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The sell-off in global stock markets is accelerating today, as stocks keep sliding across the globe. Asian stock markets have plunged into bear market territory, meaning they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve shed 20% of their value since their highs in January. Fears over the health of the global economy, future US interest rate rises, Jamal Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s murder, and America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war with China are all being blamed as investors try to grab the nearest tin hat to ride out the storm. Some disappointing corporate results this week - including from industry bellwether Caterpillar - have also dampened the mood, and raised fears that growth is slowing. After a very bruising session, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei has tumbled by 3.7%, while Australia has lost 2.8%. China suffered fresh losses too, taking it deeper into its own bear market. Analysts are worried that the sell-off has further to run, and could turn into a full-blown collapse. As Greg McKenna, an independent markets strategist in Australia, put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fear is palpable in stock markets at the moment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This could get much worse before it gets better. Collapses happen after falls. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the danger.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That follows another rocky session on Wall Street, where the Dow slumped by another 600 points (-2.4%). That wipes out all its gains for this year, as a wave of worry swept the trading floors. Optimism is out, and volatility is back. Bears are prowling the trading floors this morning in Europe too. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is expected to fall, and could hit a new seven-month low. Other European markets are expected to slide too, as the spat between Rome and Brussels over next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget continues. The EU has asked for a new version within three weeks, but Italy is refusing to rewrite its plans. Also coming up The European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council is meeting today to set monetary policy. No change is expected, but Mario Draghi will be quizzed by journalists. Given the market volatility, is Draghi still happy to end the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus programme in December? And how worried is he about Italy? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a busy day for corporate results in London, with Lloyds Banking Group, WPP and Debenhams reporting results (and store closures, in Deb\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case).

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap Global stock markets are on track for their worst month in five years ,after another day of losses. In London, the FTSE 100 has lost nearly 1% to close at its weakest level since March. At one point it hit a 22-month low. The US stock markets is also in the red today. Technology stocks are leading the sell-off, after Amazon and Alphabet underwhelmed Wall Street with their results last night. Investors have not taken much cheer from the latest US GDP report, which showed a slightly faster acceleration in growth than expected. Consumer spending and government spending both boosted growth, but trade was a drag. Asia-Pacific markets also ended the week with another bout of volatility, and fears that contagion was spreading through the markets. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story on the markets, after a turbulent week: Shares in New York are also climbing back from their earlier lows. The Dow is now down just 140 points, or 0.6%, as a degree of calm returns to Wall Street. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 250, an index of smaller companies, also lost almost 1% today: As European traders count their losses and head to the pub, their counterparts on Wall Street have just endured a rough morning Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest damage: Dow Jones industrial average: down 279 points or 1.1% at 24,715 S&amp;P 500: down 43 points or 1.6% at 2,661 Nasdaq: down 153 points or 2.2% at 6,862 Neil Wilson of Markets.com says the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) are doing the damage. He writes: Bloody FAANGs means Halloween comes early in nightmare month for equities. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No respite for equity markets today as the weight of the FAANGs dragged on the wider market and raises a real risk that this selloff is about to turn into a full bear market. The S&amp;P 500 has now dipped into correction territory in little over a month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a steep selloff. Amazon and Alphabet earnings disappointed with less upbeat outlooks casting a cloud over tech stocks in particular. Bear in mind that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still the only real bright spot out there YTD and now it looks as though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s starting to rollover. If FAANGs are rolling over the weaker sector stocks are very vulnerable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Snap off 15% today after reporting another quarter of declining users and offered a pessimistic outlook. Snap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment thesis was always shaky and the truth is it was never going to deliver. Quality like Microsoft and Intel are holding relatively firm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not seen sky high valuations as some of the FAANGs so are seen a bit safer, while both have delivered on earnings. Just in: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has ended the day solidly in the red, at the end of a volatile week. However, the losses aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as bad as earlier in the day, when stocks were languishing at a 22-month low. The FTSE 100 closed 64 points lower, or -0.92%, at 6,939 points. Things looked worse an hour ago, before shares rallied into the closing auction in London. Evraz was the biggest faller, down 6.3%, followed by online supermarket chain Ocada (-5%) and BT (-4.5%). There are losses in Europe: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.94% French CAC: -1.3% Italian FTSE MIB: -0.7% Fiona Cincotta of City Index says: The large-scale volatility that we have seen across the week was certainly not packing away for the weekend early. The bloodbath continued with markets across the globe slamming lower as concerns over US corporate results overshadowed a robust US GDP figure. As shares slide, investors are piling into the safety of government bonds. Debt issued by Germany and America is always attractive on these occasions. So as prices leap, bond yields (the interest on the bond) are dropping. Newsflash: The FTSE 100 just hit its lowest level since December 2016. It fell 152 points, or over 2%, to 6851, as markets end the week on a low. Technology stocks had been a stellar performer earlier this year. But now they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sliding, and dragging the wider markets down, according to David Madden of CMC Markets: The S&amp;P 500 has fallen into correction territory as the decline in stocks intensifies. Amazon and Alphabet shares are in the red after both companies missed on revenue forecasts last night, and Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guidance was also below the consensus estimate. US tech stocks set a series of record-highs throughout the summer, and they were the first to fall in the recent market rout. There is a sense that the tech sector is setting the pace for the rest of the world. The sell-off is gathering pace, again. The S&amp;P 500 index, which covers a broader spread of the US economy than the Dow, is down 2.2%. That puts the S&amp;P 500 into correction territory, more than 10% off its peak in September. The good news for City investors is that this week of pain is almost over. The bad news is that the FTSE 100 is wallowing close its lowest level since December 2016. The blue-chip Footsie index is down 117 points, or almost 1.7%, at 6887. Steel and mining company Evraz is the biggest faller, down 7.6% after mixed production numbers yesterday. WPP has shed another 4.6%, after Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout following a profits warning. Several economists are predicting that the US economy will slow in the quarters ahead, after six months of solid growth. Capital Economics believes tighter monetary policy is already having an impact: At 3.5% annualised, GDP growth remained unusually strong in the third quarter, thanks partly to this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal stimulus, but there are signs that higher interest rates are beginning to have a bigger restraining effect. Once the boost from fiscal stimulus fades next year, we expect economic growth to slow below its potential rate, forcing the Fed to the side-lines by mid-2019. Kay Daniel Neufeld, managing economist of CEBR, believes the trade war with China will also hurt growth. Q3 growth surprised on the upside, showing that the US economy continues to perform with considerable momentum in the second half of the year. However, house-made problems including the deteriorating global trading conditions and the fast pace of monetary tightening spell trouble for the coming quarters.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ouch! The Dow Jones industrial average is now down 400 points, or 1.7%, as the market turmoil continues. Another tech firm, Cisco, is the biggest faller on the Dow (down 2.1%), followed by Home Depot (-1.9%) and American Express (-1.7%). Technology stocks are sliding in New York, particularly those which have disappointed Wall Street. Hard drive maker Western Digital has tumbled by 17%, after reporting a 3% drop in revenues for the last quarter. Profits shrank by 24%. Amazon has slumped by 7.5% after giving disappointing guidance for the holiday period last night. Google parent company Alphabet has shed 3%. This is all weighing on the Nasdaq, of course, which is down over 2%. The bell has rung and stronger-than-expected US growth in Q3 has failed to cheer investors. Opening scores: Dow Jones: -242 points or -1% at 24,742 S&amp;P 500: -39 points or -1.5% at 2,666 Nasdaq: -186 points or -2.5% at 7,132 Three minutes until the opening bell on Wall Street... Balraj Sroya, trader at currency firm Foenix Partners, says the US growth figures are key to both Trump and the Federal Reserve: Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mantra of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMaking America Great Again\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is echoing across the US economy as third quarter GDP growth outpaced market consensus with a print of 3.5%. Consumer spending and businesses increasing their inventories aided the strongest back to back quarters for growth in over two years. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s print was crucial for Trump and the GOP ahead of the Midterm elections as GDP seems to be aligning with the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target for 2018, however it could spark the Fed to consider a more aggressive monetary policy. The detail behind the headline GDP growth figure, published by the US Commerce Department, shows that consumer spending boosted the economy in the third quarter, but net trade was a drag as exports fell but imports rose. The Department said: The increase in real GDP in the third quarter reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures, private inventory investment, state and local government spending, federal government spending, and nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by negative contributions from exports and residential fixed investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased. The deceleration in real GDP growth in the third quarter reflected a downturn in exports and a deceleration in nonresidential fixed investment. Imports increased in the third quarter after decreasing in the second. These movements were partly offset by an upturn in private inventory investment. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said Donald Trump is likely to jump on the US growth figures: We can expect President Trump to wax lyrical about these results in the run up to the congressional midterm elections, adding evidence to his promise on expanding the economy. However, growth has already moderated and will continue to do so in 2019 as the tax cut boost dissipates and inflation tightens its grip as a result of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tit for tat with China. (No Trump tweet about Q3 as yet...) Pre-trading on Wall Street has picked up after the news that US growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter, to 3.5%. US futures are still down before the opening bell, but less so: Dow Jones: -177 points or -0.7% S&amp;P 500: -24 points or -0.9% Nasdaq: -124 points or -1.8% Breaking: The US economy grew by 3.5% in the third quarter, faster than the 3.3% predicted by economists. It was a slowdown compared with the second quarter, when the economy grew by 4.2% on an annual basis. Economists at Investec have taken a step back from this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market mayhem to look at prospects in the months ahead for the global economy. In a month full of uncertainties, a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglass half full\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 approach might be to say that there has been some respite in global trade tensions. However the pause looks to be because the Chinese and US authorities are eyeing more constructive talks after the US mid-terms. Even with this respite, risk assets are currently under pressure amid continuing concerns that the Fed may embark on a more aggressive tightening path, concerns over earnings and equity valuations and as other global political concerns have arisen. Furthermore some signs have emerged that suggest recent protectionist actions have spilt over into confidence and growth. But as yet we do not judge risks related to the above to be substantial enough to shift our world GDP forecasts, particularly given supportive fiscal policy in the US and China. We continue to look for 3.8% world growth this year and 3.7% next. Risks though lie to the downside for 2019. The pound is down 0.3% against the dollar at a two-month low of $1.2784. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly a story of a stronger dollar, which is up against a basket of currencies ahead of the US GDP number at 1.30pm UK time. Another day, another statement from Patisserie Valerie, the troubled cafe and bakery chain which earlier this month discovered a black hole in its accounts and a \u00c2\u00a31m unpaid tax bill that threatened the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse. The latest news is that Chris Marsh, the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance director who was arrested on suspicion of fraud and subsequently bailed, has resigned. Pat Val\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, Patisserie Holdings, issued a brief statement: Patisserie Holdings plc announces that following the suspension of Chris Marsh on 9 October 2018, the company has now accepted his resignation as the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance director with immediate effect, while reserving its position in respect of any potential claims it may have against him. The latest announcement isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite surprising as the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other ones over the past month. Thursdays rebound on Wall Street - with the Dow Jones surging 401 points - is nowhere to be seen today, with global markets on course for their longest losing streak in more than five years. European markets are sharply lower and US futures suggest the Dow could lose another 300-or-so points when the bell goes on Wall Street. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a look at US futures: Dow Jones: -271 points or -1.1% S&amp;P 500: -38 points or -1.4% Nasdaq: -174 points or -2.5% The MSCI all-country index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was earlier down 0.3% and on track for a fifth week of losses - the longest losing streak since May 2013. Royal Bank of Scotland is weighing on the FTSE 100 this morning, with shares down nearly 5%. The bailed-out bank published third-quarter results this morning, and the detail has underwhelmed investors. Attributable profit - the figure which determines the dividend - was up 14% in the three months to the end of September, at \u00c2\u00a3448m, but it was below expectations of \u00c2\u00a3507m. Operating costs also increased as the bank set aside another \u00c2\u00a3200m for payment protection insurance claims. In better news, pre-tax profit rose 10% in the third quarter, to \u00c2\u00a3961m. But that has not been enough for traders, and RBS is among the top FTSE fallers: Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says that hopes appear to have been dashed for a positive end to the week for the FTSE . Any suggestion UK stocks might end the week on a more positive note has been swatted aside after the third quarter sales performance of Amazon and Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company Alphabet disappointed after the market close in the US. Given the technology sector helped lead US indices to fresh highs in 2018 and is so dominant, its performance in the current earning season was always likely to be pivotal to investor sentiment. As if traders didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough to contend with, later today we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get US GDP data for the third quarter. Figures are expected to show the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy grew by 3.3% in the third quarter, on an annual basis. It would be a slowdown from 4.2% in the second quarter. The figures will be published at 1.30pm, UK time. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spread Ex, says the number could weigh on investor moods: Given that the slightest thing sets the markets off at the moment, it is going to be interesting to see how they deal with this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first look at the US third quarter GDP figure. Analysts are expecting a slowdown from 4.2% in Q2 to 3.3% in Q3, a decline that may only cause further problems at the end of a tiring and tricky week. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take a closer look at the markets in Europe, where losses are accelerating this morning: As well as the disappointing results (on some measures) from Amazon and Alphabet, investors are also concerned by a number of other risks. To name a few - the US/China trade war, rising US interest rates, instability in emerging markets, and Brexit. Here is our story on how the market volatility has gripped Asian and Australian markets overnight: Opening bells have rung across Europe and the mood is gloomy: FTSE 100: -0.8% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -1.1% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -1% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.5% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.6% Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.6% David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, explains why Amazon and Alphabet disappointed investors: We heard from tech giants Amazon and Alphabet after the closing bell last night. Amazon topped the earnings per share forecast, but missed on revenue and the guidance. Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent, Alphabet, exceeded estimates on EPS, but undershot the revenue forecast. Both stocks dropped heavily in the post-market session, and in turn sparked selling across major US indices. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re almost at the end of what has been a hugely volatile week for global stock markets. Wall Street bounced back on Thursday, with the Dow Jones surging 401 points, a gain of 1.6%, to close at 24,984. It followed sharp falls on Wednesday, and the turnaround in sentiment was largely down to technology stocks - after positive Twitter and Microsoft results - industrials companies and banks. But sentiment soured when US tech giants Amazon and Alphabet reported disappointing revenues after the closing bell on Wall Street. It was enough to send US futures lower, which in turn triggered a sell-off in Asia where shares hit 20-month lows. Markets across Europe are expected to open sharply lower this morning as the gloomy sentiment spreads across the Atlantic: We will be following the markets and all the latest business news as this volatile week for global markets draws to a close.",

It will come into effect in April 2020 and will raise \u00c2\u00a3400m a year, the chancellor said. Digital tech giants will be taxed 2% on the money they make from UK users.</p> <p>Stella Amiss, head of tax policy at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong words of recent months were no bluff. At home, the confirmation of a new digital services tax was trailed as a step towards levelling the playing field between online retailers and the high street. But it is much more than that. Working out who is taxed and who isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the digital economy is no mean feat when all businesses operate in an increasing technological world.</p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise then that the chancellor has approached this with caution - a narrowly targeted regime, a 2% rate, and an effective implementation date pushed back to 2020. This new tax is well and truly aimed at the tech giants and not the online retailers so will do little to address the woes of bricks and mortar retailers and could well be perceived across the pond as an anti-American measure that could come back to bite us as the UK looks to move to trade talks after the Brexit deadline.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5bd737e8e4b0bda4dc41b9d9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-10-29T16:46:29.408Z\">4.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Duty on beer, cider and spirits has been frozen for a year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while wine wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spared, with duty going up in line with inflation. </p> <p>The Wine and Spirit Trade Association was quick to respond. Its chief executive Miles Beale welcomed the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to freeze duty on spirits, but deplored the increase in wine duty.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The decision by the chancellor to increase wine rates significantly is a hammer blow to this great British industry.

                "bodyText":"It has been a good day for stock markets. In the eurozone, the Dax closed up 1.2% while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC was up 0.4% and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB gained 1.9%. The FTSE 100 index pared some of the gains made before the budget speech when it was up more than 120 points, and closed down 86.76 points at 7026.32, a 1.25% gain. Despite growth upgrades, sterling was little moved by the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech (the growth outlook is still poor by historical standards). The pound slipped a bit more against the dollar, by 0.26% to $1.28, while it remained flat against the euro. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: We got a confident, jocular chancellor and a fair bit of extra cash being splashed around for various departments \u00e2\u20ac\u201c defence, potholes, schools etc. Nothing earth-shatteringly major however. This was a political budget aimed at tackling the Corbyn threat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c end of PFI and a kind of pseudo Google tax. And the elephant in the room was Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it could all change if there is no deal, the odds of which are shortening by the day. We are closing the blog for the day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we will be back tomorrow. Good night. You can read more reaction and analysis on our budget live blog: And here are the key points at a glance: One of the main budget announcements was a new digital services tax, on tech giants such as Google (but not start-ups). It will come into effect in April 2020 and will raise \u00c2\u00a3400m a year, the chancellor said. Digital tech giants will be taxed 2% on the money they make from UK users. Stella Amiss, head of tax policy at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: The chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong words of recent months were no bluff. At home, the confirmation of a new digital services tax was trailed as a step towards levelling the playing field between online retailers and the high street. But it is much more than that. Working out who is taxed and who isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the digital economy is no mean feat when all businesses operate in an increasing technological world. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise then that the chancellor has approached this with caution - a narrowly targeted regime, a 2% rate, and an effective implementation date pushed back to 2020. This new tax is well and truly aimed at the tech giants and not the online retailers so will do little to address the woes of bricks and mortar retailers and could well be perceived across the pond as an anti-American measure that could come back to bite us as the UK looks to move to trade talks after the Brexit deadline. Duty on beer, cider and spirits has been frozen for a year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while wine wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spared, with duty going up in line with inflation. The Wine and Spirit Trade Association was quick to respond. Its chief executive Miles Beale welcomed the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to freeze duty on spirits, but deplored the increase in wine duty. The decision by the chancellor to increase wine rates significantly is a hammer blow to this great British industry. It actively undermines a sector that has been hardest hit since the Brexit Referendum and will be thoroughly unwelcome for the 33 million consumers of the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most popular alcoholic drink. This inflationary rise is grossly unfair, unjustified and counter-productive. The UK is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest wine trading nation and, as such, deserves government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support, not punishment. The wine industry is, unfortunately, no stranger to harsh treatment from chancellors. Since 2012 wine overtook beer as the largest contributor to the public purse through duty payments, and no alcoholic drink has paid more to the Treasury since then. The chancellor has pledged a \u00c2\u00a3675m high street fund and business rates to be cut by a third to help embattled high street retailers. Paul Clement, head of place shaping at property group Savills, says: We are very pleased that the chancellor has recognised the need to extend an essential lifeline to the British high street. Business rate relief alongside a new fund for local authorities to redevelop and transform town centres are just some of the key recommendations made by Savills as part of the evidence submitted to the Housing Communities and Local Government Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (HCLGC) latest government inquiry. Creating places where people want, rather than need to be, can only be achieved through this kind of systemic change. Earlier, Hammond said we are at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pivotal moment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the Brexit talks. If we get it right, there will be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153double Brexit dividend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More investment, currently on hold, will come on stream, and the Treasury will no longer have to hold back money. But the chancellor also said he was increasing the amount of spending for no deal planning to \u00c2\u00a32bn. Markets shrugged off the comments... As to whether the budget commitments are funded whether there is a Brexit deal or not, as No. 10 said today, the chancellor suggested the opposite yesterday. The new UK growth forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, announced by Philip Hammond in his budget speech a few minutes ago, are higher than in March but still dismal. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, tweeted: The speech has had little impact on markets so far. The FTSE 100 index is about 105 points ahead at 7045.42, a 1.5% gain. The pound still 0.2% lower against the dollar at $1.2805, and flat against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1242. In other news, easyJet now expects to be flying electric plans by 2030, pushing back its forecast from 2027, but expressed confidence about a technology that is expected to cut the energy costs of a plane by 30%. The low-cost carrier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive Johan Lundgren told Reuters: We can definitely see a way forward in how we will get this aircraft into the fleet. EasyJet has a partnership with US start-up Wright Electric, which is working on an electric engine for a nine-seater plane that will fly next year, following success with a two-seater, and will also start working on a 50-seater version. The goal is to build battery-propelled aircraft for flights of less than two hours. More importantly, the chancellor has echoed Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the era of austerity is finally coming to an end\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. You can follow the budget speech more closely at our budget live blog: Hammond says the last time a UK budget was presented on a Monday was in 1962, when he was six. He recalls that his parents turned to him and said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Philip, one day that could be you.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And we are off. Philip Hammond has started his budget speech. With the UK budget just a couple of minutes away, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take a quick look at the markets. All the major indices are in the green. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones rose as much as 300 points and is now trading 175 points higher, or 0.7%, at 24,867.62 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c compared with the 27,000 all-time highs at the beginning of the month. The eurozone has shrugged off Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision not to seek re-election as CDU party leader. Markets took comfort from her intention to stay on as chancellor until the next German federal election in 2021. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 1.8% ahead at 11,405.95. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB has rocketed 2.4% as S&amp;P kept Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating unchanged, while the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s battle with the EU over its budget continues. Rome was last week given three weeks to rewrite its draft budget. As for the FTSE, it is trading over 100 points higher at 7051.32, a 1.6% gain. The pound is feeling the pressure of the budget, slipping back under $1.281 against the dollar, down 0.2%. John Flint, the chief executive of HSBC, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank, reckons that the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi is unlikely to hurt Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to attract foreign investors. Flint said this morning: I understand the emotion around the story but it is very difficult to think about disengaging from Saudi Arabia, given its importance to global energy markets. Flint was one of several banking chief executives who pulled out of a major investment conference in Riyadh last week, along with Tidjane Thiam of Credit Suisse, Bill Winters of Standard Chartered and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase. However, Samir Assaf, the head of HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global banking and markets, attended the event. While most western business leaders shunned it, the kingdom managed to get $50bn of deals signed at the investment conference. Flint said: My decision [to pull out] was not an easy decision but I felt it was the right thing to do under the circumstances. But he defended the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to send a less high-profile figure to the conference: We are the biggest foreign bank in Saudi Arabia, so we own 40% of the Saudi British Bank, we have 4,000 employees in the kingdom and we have many customers in the kingdom as well so we have a responsibility to them. Flint hinted at future investment in the Middle East, saying: We are a significant part of the banking system in many parts of the region \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We will build our businesses as the opportunities arise. Here is our full story on the HSBC results, out earlier today. Poland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign minister Jacek Czaputowicz said today that Merkel plays an important role in stabilising the European Union, and expressed support for her to stay on as chancellor. Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision not to seek re-election as CDU party chairwoman which means her fourth term as chancellor will be her last heralds the end of an era in which she has dominated European politics. She became Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chancellor in 2005. The race for a successor to Merkel at the top of the CDU has already started. This morning, three candidates announced their ambitions: Party secretary-general Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer Health minister Jens Spahn Former parliamentary leader when Merkel started as party chair, Friedrich Merz Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany, says the key question is will the new CDU leader move to the political right again or continue Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy of capturing the political centre. Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement remains less of a risk for the German government than the SPD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses in the last elections. The CDU has no interest in Merkel stepping down as chancellor or a snap election before any successor has been able to build up a profile. The SPD, however, remains in an existential crisis which could easily lead to the decision to leave the coalition next year. As historic as today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement is, the approaching end of an era also holds the potential for positive developments. Not so much because new is always better but rather because it could give Merkel the freedom and the tailwind - freed from party ties - to put a final stamp on her legacy, possibly with bolder steps to reform the German economy and the monetary union. Three years of a lame duck government would clearly be harmful, not only for Europe but also for Germany. Somehow, the announced end is typical for the entire era Merkel: unpretentiously pulling the strings. Stefan Koopman, market economist at Rabobank, notes that after the initial shock caused by Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement, the market reaction has been relatively muted as she also said she would like to see her term through to 2021. The CDU is suffering heavy losses in state elections and the opinion polls indicate there is no improvement in sight. It will now be increasingly difficult for her to stay on as Chancellor, and having shown signs of weakness, the wolves may come for her sooner rather than later. Germany has been a cradle of political stability over the last decade, but this now looks to be over. Ms Merkel has been a driving force in Europe, leading the response to major political and economic upheaval like the Eurozone debt crisis. What now remains to be seen is whether her CDU successor has the political will and gravitas on the European stage to hold it together in these testing times. With Brexit imminent and growing controversy around the Italian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending plans, there couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a worse time for Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steady ship to hit choppy waters. This implies more financial market volatility going forward and is another reason to remain bearish about the euro. More on Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to step down as CDU party chair but stay on as Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chancellor until the next national election in 2021. She has argued against splitting the two roles in the past... Her move comes after disastrous regional elections in Hesse and Bavaria for her Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the CSU. Holger Schmieding, economist at Berenberg Bank, says Her first step towards the exit adds to the risk that her coalition partner SPD will walk out of the Berlin coalition in late 2019 upon a mid-term review of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda. If Merkel were to lose her position as chancellor, the most likely outcome would be a CDU/CSU-Green-FDP coalition in Berlin led by somebody else from the CDU or - as a slightly less likely alternative - new elections. Here are the main contenders for the CDU leadership: Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the CDU general secretary, appears to be Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs preferred choice Armin Laschet, prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most populous state, whose experience would make him well suited to lead a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jamaica\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 coalition with the Greens and the FDP Jens Spahn, the more conservative minister for health Friedrich Merz, a conservative who once was Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rival and is reportedly ready to re-enter frontline politics. Other candidates with fewer chances are: Peter Altmaier, the economy minister, Daniel G\u00c3\u00bcnther, the state prime minister of Schleswig Holstein and Julia Kl\u00c3\u00b6ckner, the minister of agriculture. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones climbed about 200 points at the open to 24,922.34, a gain of almost 1%. Wall Street is also expected to rally when trading begins shortly..... European stock markets are pushing higher, as traders try to put the nightmare of October behind then. The FTSE 100 is now up 126 points, or 1.8%, as it bounces back from last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seven-month low. Fiona Cincotta of City Index explains: Strong earnings from banks and positive company news boosted European markets helping them to shrug of the gloom emanating from Asia. HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong results this morning certainly seem to have cheered the City; its shares are now up almost 6%. Markets are up across Europe - bringing some relief to investors, after hitting their lowest levels since December 2016 last week. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX index has jumped by over 2%, led by those car companies. Traders are clearly more excited by Chinese tax cuts than Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political future.... In Milan, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mild jubilation that S&amp;P didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t downgrade Italy on Friday night. Dean Popplewell of trading firm OANDA explains: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year BTP bond yield has fallen to a one-week low this morning, narrowing the gap to the German Bund, on relief that ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s left the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating unchanged. Shares in European carmakers are surging, thanks to a report that China is considering halving the sales tax on most vehicles. The move would help Beijing spur auto sales, as it tries to protect its economy from the chill winds of the US trade war. Bloomberg has more details: The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic planning body submitted a plan to key policymakers to lower the purchase tax to 5 percent for passenger vehicles with engines no bigger than 1.6 liters, according to people familiar with the matter. No decision has been made on implementation, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t public. European car shares have jumped by over 4%, including by Volkswagen (+5.6%), Daimler (+4.6%) and BMW (+4.1%). Elsewhere in the eurozone, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is flying after S&amp;P left the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating unchanged on Friday night. The FTSE MIB has leapt by 2.5%, and Italian government bonds are also rallying. BREAKING: In a major development, Angela Merkel has decided not to stand for re-election as the chair of her CDU party in December. Merkel took her decision after an election drubbing over the weekend, which saw voters in Hesse abandon the CDU in favour of the Green party and the anti-immigrant Alternative f\u00c3\u00bcr Deutschland (AfD). This could trigger a battle to succeed Merkel as Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chancellor, a job she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s held since 2005 (and isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t giving up yet...) Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: German Chancellor Angela Merkel has told leaders of her Christian Democrats (CDU) that she will not seek re-election as party chairwoman at a conference in early December, a senior party source said. Merkel has been CDU chairwoman since 2000 and giving up the role would start a race within the party to succeed her as chancellor. The euro has promptly fallen by 0.4% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.138. Support for the CDU in Hesse fell by 10 percentage points since the last election in 2013 - a major snub by voters. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s left-wing SPD party, who are in coalition with the CDU, also performed badly in Hesse, fuelling speculation that the coalition could collapse. More here: European stock markets are all showing gains this morning. Bank stocks are up, following HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong results, along with healthcare groups and industrial companies. Banking giant HSBC is pulling the London stock market higher, after growing its profits sharply. HSBC shares have leapt by 4% in early trading, after beating City expectations this morning. The bank posted a 16% year-on-year rise in adjusted pre-tax profits to $6.19bn, ahead of its previous forecasts. Revenues rose 8.8% to $13.8bn, as its investment banking and wealth management divisions enjoyed a strong quarter. Three-quarters of HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits came from Asia. This has lifted the FTSE 100 up to 7002 points, up 62 points. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153HSBC may be the second biggest company on the UK stock market, but its profits are predominantly emanating from its historic home in the far east. Three quarters of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits so far this year have come from its Asian operations, leaving the European business trailing in its wake. Profit growth has been broad-based across HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main banking activities, and what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive is that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coming from a rising top line rather than simply cost-cutting, which can only deliver results for so long. Indeed adjusted operating costs have actually ticked up, though that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to support investment in growth opportunities, notably in the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s digital proposition. As an international retail and commercial bank, HSBC is clearly plugged into the global economy, and in particular the fortunes of China and the surrounding area. While in the long term this looks like an ace in the sleeve, investors should expect a bumpy journey, particularly if Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war dents growth in the region.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Last week the US stock markets fell into correction territory, after several heavyweight companies posted disappointing results: David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, says last week was grim: Global stock markets had a terrible time last week as investor sentiment continued to sour. Concerns about higher interest rates in the US, along with political uncertainty in Italy as well as geopolitical concerns played on investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds. Last week, Amazon and Alphabet both released quarterly figures and the revenue components missed market estimates and that added to the decline. The major US indices enjoyed a positive run over the summer, and there was a sense that valuations were lofty, particularly for the tech sector. The S&amp;P 500 is now in correction territory, which means it had fallen more than 10% from the recent peak, and this underlines how large the correction has been. The Shanghai Composite lost over 2% overnight after China confirmed that industrial profit fell for the fifth straight month. Financial blogger Jeroen Blokland says a range of factors have hurt the markets this month. However, that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re facing a repeat of the 2008 crisis. He writes: This chart by Bloomberg shows that global equities have lost almost USD 8 trillion in market cap in October, the worst sell-off since 2008. However, the absolute numbers can be deceptive as the total market capitalization has increased by roughly 50% since start of the financial crisis. But more importantly, while there are definitely a number of factors that are negatively impacting markets (China-US trade war, rising geopolitical risk, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s massive debt pile \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to name just a few), current economic circumstances make it less likely that a crisis like the one in in 2008 will happen now. Of course, things could change quickly, especially if market sentiment remains as depressed as it is now, but this might be a good moment to take a step back and refocus on the fundamentals. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses in China suggest markets have further to fall, warns Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at foreign exchange broker FXTM: The steep sell-off in U.S. equity markets suggests October could be the worst month since the global financial crisis of 2008. Seven trillion dollars have already been wiped from the global market cap, and still there are no signs of bulls returning. Chinese stocks fell today with the CSI 300 declining more than 3% while the Yuan remained trading near a decade low. The Nikkei 225 gave up gains of more than 1% to trade in negative territory. Moving against the trend were stocks in Australia, with the ASX 200 gaining more than 1% supported by the healthcare and telecom sectors. The bears seem well in control of the market and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re many reasons to justify their actions. Whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakening global economic growth, the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, monetary policy tightening, fears of a hard Brexit, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget woes\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and the list goes on. What is more interesting is that investors are even punishing companies that have reported positive earnings surprises. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. October has been a pretty brutal month for the markets. Over the last four weeks, trillions of dollars of value have been wiped off bonds and shares, as nervous investors have sold up. Bloomberg estimates that $8 trillion has been \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclost\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, amid fears over US interest rate hikes, the US-China trade war, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget row and Brexit. That would make October the worst month in a decade, since the collapse of Lehman Brothers. They say: Equities globally have lost almost $8 trillion of value this month, set for the biggest wipeout since the height of the financial crisis a decade ago on concerns ranging from the peak being past for earnings growth to the U.S.-China trade war to the end of central bank quantitative easing. Traders are paring wagers on Fed rate hikes for next year, with markets now expecting fewer than two quarter-point increases in 2019, compared with three that policy makers project. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room for a bit of a downside to go, because I do see this as being largely a structural shift in markets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kyle Rodda, a market analyst at IG Group in Melbourne, said on Bloomberg Television. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sentiment is still to the downside, is still quite bearish and there will be a little while for this correction to play out.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The new week has begun badly in China, where the Shanghai stock market has fallen over 2% today. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a brighter picture in Europe. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 had jumped by 36 points, or 0.5%, after hitting a seven-month low on Friday night. Perhaps the extra hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep has cheered traders up a bit. Also coming up today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget Day in the UK. Chancellor Philip Hammond is expected to announce that the public finances aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as bad as previously thought, clearing the way for more spending on the NHS, help for UK high streets, money to build roads and fix potholes, He could also tighten pension relief limits (taking money from higher earners) and raise income tax personal allowances (handing money back to them). We also get new consumer credit and mortgage approvals figures from the Bank of England The agenda: 9.30am GMT: UK mortgage approvals and consumer credit figures 3.30pm GMT: The Budget speech",

                "bodyText":"UK retail sales growth slowed significantly in October as British consumers reined in their spending after a summer spree fuelled by warm weather and the World Cup, according to the latest industry figures. The latest snapshot from the Confederation of British Industry showed retail sales growth dropped to the weakest level since April, while separate government figures showed an increasing number of UK companies entering insolvency as trading conditions remain tough on the high street. The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly retail sales index fell further than expected to +5 in October from a reading of +23 in September, missing analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 estimates for a smaller decline in consumer spending. The details from the survey of 104 firms, of which 45 were retailers, show sales volumes were significantly below average for the time of year, and that online shopping was the only sector to record increasing sales volumes. The figures come after the chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced tax breaks on business rates for smaller shops in the budget on Monday, with reductions on rates by a third for up to 90% of retail properties. The budget also contained measures to impose a digital services tax on large US technology companies including Google, Facebook and Amazon, which he said was to ensure \u00e2\u20ac\u0153these global giants with profitable businesses in the UK pay their fair share\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. High streets have come under growing pressure as an increasing number of consumers shop online, while sluggish wage growth and high levels of inflation have constrained their spending power. Statistics from the Insolvency Service, a government agency, showed the biggest rise in company insolvencies since the depths of the financial crisis, which analysts said was connected to the struggles on the high street. It recorded a 19.3% year-on-year rise in the third quarter, the biggest increase since the second quarter of 2009, when Britain was still struggling to emerge from a recession. Nick Levine, the head of enterprise at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said it was likely the tough trading conditions and the economic climate were having an impact. He suggested the slowing growth in the number of EU migrants since the Brexit vote could also have had an impact. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is not only high street stores suffering. The hospitality industry is also seeing an increasing amount of businesses go insolvent,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Duncan Swift, the vice-president of R3, the insolvency and restructuring trade body, said it was the first time more than 4,000 corporate insolvencies had been recorded in a single quarter since the start of 2014. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For every struggling retailer unable to pay its debts, there will be numerous suppliers as well as shop-fitting or delivery firms who come under pressure,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.

When the tower was completed in 1966 it did not attract enough high-paying office tenants and remained vacant for a decade, leading to it to be nicknamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s empty skyscraper\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Homelessness campaigners staged an occupation of the tower in 1974 to highlight the problem and the tower then lent its name to homelessness charity CentrePoint. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now its happening all over again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Centre Point\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s redevelopers have taken fright at Brexit jitters and decided many of its luxury apartments must remain empty again,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Chris Bailey, campaign manager of charity Action on Empty Homes. He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are over 20,000 long-term empty homes in London, while over 50% of the 79,880 families and 123,230 children in temporary accommodation in England are in London, costing London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s councils hundreds of millions a year. London can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep on funding this while land is gobbled up to build empty towers for an increasingly speculative global market which now appears to be faltering before the spectre of Brexit price dips.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The drop in confidence among buyers appears to have caught Almacantar by surprise as the tower\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s development team were very confident that all of the flats would be snapped up in short order when they gave the Guardian a tour of the tower this summer. Kathrin Hersel, Centre Point\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property director, said the duplex penthouse spanning the 32nd and 33rd floors would sell itself. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are plenty of people in the world who could afford it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. That penthouse features five ensuite bathrooms and a wraparound terrace with a vista across all of London taking in St Paul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cathedral, Tower Bridge, the Houses of Parliament and beyond to Surrey Hills on a good day. Almacantar had even sold one \u00c2\u00a35m two-bedroom apartment to the parents of a Chinese student about to start studying at UCL. Hussey said Almacantar, which is part-owned by Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s billionaire Agnelli family, might relaunch sales after a Brexit deal had been agreed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When buyers feel more confident about the wider macro situation, they will also feel more confident about paying these prices again,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told the trade magazine Estates Gazette. Hussey declined to speak to the Guardian. Almacantar has told its estate agents at Knight Frank and CBRE to stand down. Mark Collins, chairman of CBRE, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Centre Point Residences is a beautifully executed project that we believe will have enduring appeal in the market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added they would be ready to try selling again next year when there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a clear runway ahead\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Henry Pryor, an independent luxury property buying agent, said rich overseas buyers were very concerned about the risk of overpaying for central London properties particularly if the economy suffered in the wake of a disorderly Brexit or if Jeremy Corbyn became prime minister and introduced a wealth tax. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The wealthy are far more worried about the risk of a Corbyn-led government than even the hardest of Brexits.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",
