Its British shoppers, 80% of whom are aged 13 to 24, buy an average of 20,000 items a day. It reckons that hundreds of its top sellers make more than \u00a3150,000 a year selling online.</p> <p>Depop has caught on to a trend in which secondhand is no longer second best, along with other online marketplaces including US-based <a href=\"https://www.thredup.com/\">Thredup</a>, <a href=\"https://poshmark.com/\">Poshmark</a> and <a href=\"https://www.grailed.com/\">Grailed</a>, which trade in a more social way than the more established eBay and Gumtree. The online fashion specialist Asos\u2019s marketplace section includes vintage boutiques, while British startup <a href=\"https://studenthighstreet.com/\">Student High Street</a> holds sellers\u2019 events at universities.</p> <p>A study in the US by Thredup suggested there was a 25% rise in the number of women prepared to buy secondhand in 2017 compared with the year before. It predicted 15% annual growth in the market over the next few years. compared with just 2% for the overall fashion sales.</p> <p>Thredup estimates that secondhand clothes now make up 6% of respondents\u2019 wardrobes, double that of 10 years ago, and that proportion could almost double again to 11% by 2027.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost a dark market,\u201d says Lorna Hall, the head of insight at the trend forecasting firm WGSN. \u201cMoney is coming out of the mainstream market because of this way of shopping, particularly in Generation Z [under 25s].\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople love that you can easily search for people selling on Depop who are close to you, pick up your purchase and avoid postage costs,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Simon Beckerman founded Depop in Italy in 2011 but moved the company to London three years ago after winning $8m in backing from Balderton Capital, the UK-based investment firm which has previously backed Betfair and Figleaves.</p> <p>Beckerman told Artefact magazine his initial goal was to aim for \u201cyoung designers and cool collectors \u2026 but we discovered this world of girls who want to sell their whole wardrobe and I didn\u2019t imagine there would be such a need for that. Ebay is complicated, long and, if you want to sell something for \u00a35, it just doesn\u2019t work.

                "bodyText":"Caitlin Young is one of millions of teenagers and 20-somethings who are shaking up the fashion industry by digging out their parents\u2019 cast-offs, raiding charity shops and scanning boot sales to build mini businesses online. Young picks up 1990s and \u201cY2K\u201d early 2000s \u201cvintage\u201d gear from charity shops and jumble sales and then styles or customises them for her 22,500 followers on Depop, a fast-growing social media app which combines the image creation of Instagram with a digital version of market trader bargaining. \u201cPeople in my family say, \u2018You sell used shoes?,\u2019 like they are so disgusted, but everyone I know buys vintage. It\u2019s what people do now,\u201d says Young. \u201cIt pays for my life,\u201d adds the animation student, who sells up to \u00a32,000-worth of secondhand clothing a month online. Young and other online clothing sellers are shrugging off the trends shovelled out by mainstream brands and high street chains and making thousands of pounds by trading vintage trainers, fluorescent hoodies and high-waisted jeans their parents wore to raves in the 1990s and early 2000s. Founded in 2011, Depop now has 10m users, most of whom are in the UK, and takes more than \u00a3300m ($400m) a year in sales, a figure that has doubled year on year. Its British shoppers, 80% of whom are aged 13 to 24, buy an average of 20,000 items a day. It reckons that hundreds of its top sellers make more than \u00a3150,000 a year selling online. Depop has caught on to a trend in which secondhand is no longer second best, along with other online marketplaces including US-based Thredup, Poshmark and Grailed, which trade in a more social way than the more established eBay and Gumtree. The online fashion specialist Asos\u2019s marketplace section includes vintage boutiques, while British startup Student High Street holds sellers\u2019 events at universities. A study in the US by Thredup suggested there was a 25% rise in the number of women prepared to buy secondhand in 2017 compared with the year before. It predicted 15% annual growth in the market over the next few years. compared with just 2% for the overall fashion sales. Thredup estimates that secondhand clothes now make up 6% of respondents\u2019 wardrobes, double that of 10 years ago, and that proportion could almost double again to 11% by 2027. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a dark market,\u201d says Lorna Hall, the head of insight at the trend forecasting firm WGSN. \u201cMoney is coming out of the mainstream market because of this way of shopping, particularly in Generation Z [under 25s].\u201d \u201cPeople love that you can easily search for people selling on Depop who are close to you, pick up your purchase and avoid postage costs,\u201d she says. Simon Beckerman founded Depop in Italy in 2011 but moved the company to London three years ago after winning $8m in backing from Balderton Capital, the UK-based investment firm which has previously backed Betfair and Figleaves. Beckerman told Artefact magazine his initial goal was to aim for \u201cyoung designers and cool collectors \u2026 but we discovered this world of girls who want to sell their whole wardrobe and I didn\u2019t imagine there would be such a need for that. Ebay is complicated, long and, if you want to sell something for \u00a35, it just doesn\u2019t work. So having Depop as a social marketplace with chat is better and all the girls love it\u201d. The 2008 recession sparked a change in attitude that has been embraced by young people who want to be fashionable but are concerned about the environmental impact of throwing away clothes after only a few wears. \u201cWe are living in an age of DIY and the rise of being able to create your own platform,\u201d says Depop seller Thidarat Kaha, who sells about \u00a36,000 of clothes a month to her 44,000 followers. \u201cThe mainstream market used to be just buying something from Topshop, and someone else would have that same dress. \u201cThe magic of this product is it is usually one on one.
