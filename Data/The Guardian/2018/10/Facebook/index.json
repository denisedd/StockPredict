I began working on site in 2016 as a construction engineer with Tideway.</p> <p>I graduated in mineral engineering in Greece in 2010 but I was always fascinated by how materials are used and converted into buildings and other infrastructure projects, which can change peoples\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lives.</p> <p>My dad is an engineer, I used to go to work with him and was surrounded by engineers and architects from a young age.

The culture has also changed, even the PPE (protective clothing) we wear has been tailored to fit women, with higher waisted trousers and the tops fit better.</p> <p>There has been a effort from different sources; there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more awareness in schools than there used to be. As a Stem ambassador, I go to schools and talk about engineering. We have a lot of young people visiting so they can see the reality and we have many women on site (and it helps to encourage young women to get into the industry).</p> <p>Working in construction makes you feel very valuable in a society. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working in a job that you know can change people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quality of life.

My background is in environmental engineering and I started my career six years ago on Crossrail as an environmental team assistant where, at the beginning, I was the only woman in the team.</p> <p>I think there is probably still a lack of women in construction in site-specific roles such as electricians or machine operators but things are improving. Six out of eight members of the environmental team are women and, in the site construction team, the project manager and site project engineer are both female.</p> <p>My family and friends were all enthusiastic to know that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m working in construction and thought I was perfect for this job as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m really determined and I feel really comfortable in this industry.</p> <p>I truly believe that there is no difference between females and males in terms of skills and added values they bring to a project. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a matter of encouraging women to start this kind of career.</p> <p>I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m mentoring young environmental advisers by helping them to gather more site experience and guiding them to improve their knowledge of environmental issues on site. Through this mentoring, I am able to support and encourage confidence within young women in the hope that they will do the same for others as they progress in their careers to encourage further diversity within our industry.</p> <p>I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m really happy about my role in construction and I love my job. Every day is different, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dynamic, challenging and really motivates me. It keeps me driven and curious to know and learn more.</p> <p>There are several aspects of my role that I love but the best part is the satisfaction from building relationships and the sense of achievement at the end of day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"eb3ec84a1559137746d651daa411bad1ac93df78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb3ec84a1559137746d651daa411bad1ac93df78/1326_347_5003_3706/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Concepcion Vicente, site project manager\" width=\"1000\" height=\"741\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Concepcion Vicente, site project manager</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Concepcion Vicente, 39</h2> <p><strong>Project manager</strong></p> <p>Just being a woman at management level in construction is a major challenge in itself, and a positive impact on the industry.

I am part of that low percentage and feel really proud to add value in this way.</p> <p>I am the only woman contractor project manager dealing with a CSO site within not just the Tideway Central section project (one out of eight CSO sites) but within the whole Tideway project.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00d7c7de6dbe441808d0ef8c532d01d3fb4f2550\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00d7c7de6dbe441808d0ef8c532d01d3fb4f2550/0_295_6306_4185/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Concepcion Vicente, site project manager.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Concepcion Vicente, site project manager.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Within that low percentage, I also add something very important and needed which is diversity. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a professional born in a different country and with vast experience. This cross-cultural mix and the exchange of experiences, lessons learnt, methodologies, procedures, subcontractors, systems, even mindsets, are powerful tools that help us to improve and continuously develop to the benefit of ourselves and our industry, and move towards better results and goals for instance.</p> <p>It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter if you are a woman or a man, you have to love what you do in order to deliver the best. I am proud to say that I love my career and my job. Because of this, and the passion I feel about the industry, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a champion for this profession. My colleagues and friends see me as an example and a pioneer after what happened to most of us during the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153credit crunch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

It was very difficult to get a job when I graduated from Salford University in 2007. My first job was as a labourer, I worked on site for three months. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve definitely experienced sexism in my job. When I was at university there were about 60 students in my class but only four were women.</p> <p>My goal is to be a construction manager. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the industry is ready to see more women in this role.</p> <p>My sister is an architect. When I was young, we always said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I want to build houses\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I like to create things. You see the building going up and staying as part of history.

I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see that happening where I previously worked in Staffordshire. I found it more male dominated for an everyday working environment.</p> <p>I started in the construction industry in 1998 when I did a technical modern apprenticeship in engineering alongside a higher national certificate in mechanical engineering.</p> <p>I have found when competing against male counterparts for job opportunities, nine times out of 10 it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more likely such job opportunities went directly to the male candidate.</p> <p>Since being back in London, and being a part of Women into Construction, the number of women I have come into contact with who are in senior management positions within the industry has been very positive to see.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"3d3a24d275f83028a5c603a2d1ccf10f0dbe48a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d3a24d275f83028a5c603a2d1ccf10f0dbe48a5/0_0_6594_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Aguilar, site environmental advisor at Tideway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Barn Elms Sports centre site in south London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"679\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruth Aguilar, site environmental advisor at Tideway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Barn Elms Sports centre site in south London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><br>Ruth Aguilar, 31</h2> <p><strong>Site environmental</strong><strong>advis</strong><strong>er, who is </strong><strong>five months pregnant</strong></p> <p>I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been working in construction since September 2015. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m from Mexico but came to London in 2012 to study for a masters in global environmental change at Kings College London.</p> <p>I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planned to work on construction sites. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d worked in the food industry for three years so I thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be working in food manufacturing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a learning process for me.</p> <p>My dad taught me and my two sisters a lot when he built our house. We helped him with the painting, levelling the walls, putting the bathroom in.</p> <p>I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m an internal auditor so I get to see all of the Tideway sites. You can see that some sites have more women than others, some are 50/50, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really nice to see. At some they have more men. But I think access for women to go for jobs in construction is growing.</p> <p>I try to go into schools and colleges at least every term. We do Stem volunteering with Tideway, showing young people the kind of jobs that are on offer in the industry. If they are interested in engineering, we show them that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a place for them. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just building, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the environment side, the design side, learning to manage people. There are a lot of people behind a building.</p> <p>My employer is excited that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pregnant. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been very favourable and taken in a positive way.</p> <p>One of the things I enjoy the most about this industry is working with people from all over the world. In London, you can find people from places you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even know existed. Having that mix of cultures, I just love it.</p> <p>The UK has construction companies with a very good reputation, working with them will open doors for you anywhere in the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"40cec9588ba009c268b2885609e5ee084016ec54\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40cec9588ba009c268b2885609e5ee084016ec54/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katie Kelleher, crane driver, at Tideway Blackfriars site in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katie Kelleher, crane driver, at Tideway Blackfriars site in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><br>Katie Kelleher</h2> <p><strong>Crane operator</strong></p> <p>I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been a crane operator for four years. I fell into it after working in recruitment. I never knew that women worked in the industry. I think everyone has a preconception about construction, when I was a recruitment consultant I did, too. A friend on Facebook messaged me saying his seven-year old daughter wants to be an engineer like me because she saw photos of me in front of a TBM (tunnel boring machine) on Crossrail. That was great.</p> <p>My first day on site was tough. I do think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s getting easier for women but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intimidating because there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a lot of women who operate machinery; you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see them on site, people stare a lot. It can be quite hard to take. It will get better. It is changing, but it is tough.</p> <p>The best things about working on site is that the environment changes and progresses so much. I like saying I built Tottenham Court Road station, you do say that! You say I built it, just me in a crane! Everyone does it. My dad, who was a bricklayer, used to do it. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get the train into Victoria and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say, you see that one over there, I built that. Now I can say I built something that will outlive me. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what I like about it, leaving a bit of a legacy around London.</p> <p>When I told my family I was going to quit recruitment and train to be a crane operator everyone asked me if I was sure, my mum, my dad, my boyfriend at the time told me it was a dirty job, full of men, it was hard work and long hours. I think people tried to dissuade me a little bit. I think I thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d prove them all wrong and just do it anyway. Everyone was really supportive in the end.</p> <p>I see more women coming on to site now than when I started four years ago. I think it will take a long time to change dramatically, but companies are more aware of the need for diversity. We need more active female role models, to talk to schools, educate parents, teachers, students. Apprenticeships are important, a lot of young people are pushed down the university route and it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work for everyone. It is changing but it will take a long time.</p> <p>I got really attached to my first crane. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re living in it for 11 or 12 hours a day. You keep it clean, you know where everything is, it becomes your living space. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen people cutting out carpets for theirs, leaving their shoes outside. My first crane was a little 60 tonner, it was a LCR 1060, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re lovely cranes, really really nice. It felt like it was mine!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"9ce4e29cc3229e27070ce4a1062daf552d350f8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ce4e29cc3229e27070ce4a1062daf552d350f8a/0_140_6540_4283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Noorganah Robertson (Nogs), a trainee electrician at the Sutton Point development in south London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Noorganah Robertson (Nogs), a trainee electrician at the Sutton Point development in south London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Noorganah Robertson, 34</h2> <p><strong>Trainee </strong><strong>electrician</strong></p> <p>I have a degree in film but went back to college in 2010 to learn to be an electrician. It was mostly men on the course, just me and one other woman in a class of 20. When I graduated it was difficult to get a job, it took about two years from the time I finished college.</p> <p>I thought working on a building site was rough and tough and full of lots of guys, and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I could handle that. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m generally more academic and into the arts. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m also quite sensitive. When I had my induction for my first job on site I thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d made a mistake. It was pretty intimidating at first but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good culture of teaching on building sites. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re interested in learning, people will show you what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing and help and support you.</p> <p>My family were pleased that I was doing something practical. My dad used to be a jeweller, my uncle is a carpenter, he did all the electrics in every building he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever owned. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re quite a practical family.</p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just about hiring more women, you have to create an environment where people can grow. If you do that, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s naturally going to draw more women to it.</p> <p>If the industry changes some of its ideology and philosophy at a fundamental level, women will more naturally be drawn to construction because they are more likely to feel safe, supported and valued. Women (or anybody regardless of gender) are not going to voluntarily go into an environment where they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel safe or are made to feel vulnerable. What is often misunderstood, usually by male workers in construction companies where women work on site, is that the base level of feeling comfortable is at different levels for men and women. Once these issues are more widely understood, the industry will naturally become more balanced gender-wise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"6cb1e5d695c5b704a47af044830874b6950f6a66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cb1e5d695c5b704a47af044830874b6950f6a66/531_163_5757_3921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leah Blackwell, 32, painter and decorator at a BAM Nuttall site.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leah Blackwell, 32, painter and decorator at a BAM Nuttall site.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Leah Blackwell, 32</h2> <p><strong>Painter and decorator</strong></p> <p>I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been working in constructionfor five years. I was 24 when I changed careers, I was stuck in retail, hated it, so I took the plunge. At first I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to go into construction because I thought it was a man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world. I thought it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not for women. My mum kept banging on to me, get a trade, get a trade, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never be out of a job. I put myself through evening courses at college whilst still in full-time employment in retail.</p> <p>Just because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re females it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an end to how far you go up the career ladder. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entirely down to you, the individual. If you see yourself in a certain place in 10 years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time, strive for it and go for it, just keep fighting. Guys will do the same thing, so do we. In terms of what sex you are, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t determine how far you should go up the ladder or where you should stop in your career. Last year, I decided I wanted to move up. I wanted to get off the tools and change to health and safety. You get responsibility, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking after everyone on site.</p> <p>My family is construction based; when I told them I was going to get into it I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually get any negativity. My friends were great. I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t received any negativity, everything was positive.</p> <p>In the past five years, more girls are coming through. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been on jobs where you have female sparkies, electricians, plumbers. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just trades, young people, school leavers, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re put off by construction because they see it as a dirty job. We need more information out there; you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily have to go into construction and be a tradesman. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to be a sparky, a chippy or a plumber, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health and safety and then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management. There are so many different aspects. Best move I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for sure.</p> <p>There are a lot more women coming into the industry now. Every job I go on now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m bound to see at least three females on the tools. Painters, electricians, chippies. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really good to see. </p> <p>I think more women are coming through now because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more information out there. We talk to school leavers about construction, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job centres, even job fairs at the Excel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trying to reach out to females of all ages and say: look, this is where I started, this is where I am now, and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be intimidated, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s changing, it is changing so fast, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really good to see.</p> <p>Working on construction sites gives a sense of freedom; you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re constantly doing something different and moving round. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the people I work with, too, we just have a laugh. They never overstep the line. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that level or respect. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite nice.</p> <p>There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never a dull moment; you have a lot of laughs on a construction site. If you like your freedom, doing different things, if you like a challenge, construction is for you.</p> <p>If I had a group of young people sitting in front of me right now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say get into construction and change the world. The more females we have working in construction shows society that women can do it, too. If men can lift it, so can we.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m at home when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m on site with the boys. The key is communication. Treat people how you want to be treated, speak to people how you want to be spoken to.

                "bodyText":"Dimitra Koutsi, 32 Construction engineer at Tideway I have been working in construction for four years and I started as a graduate engineer in 2014. I began working on site in 2016 as a construction engineer with Tideway. I graduated in mineral engineering in Greece in 2010 but I was always fascinated by how materials are used and converted into buildings and other infrastructure projects, which can change peoples\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lives. My dad is an engineer, I used to go to work with him and was surrounded by engineers and architects from a young age. I looked up to him a lot. I think my mum thought working on site would be quite challenging for me, but she knows it makes me happy. The industry has changed quite a lot for women and there are a lot more women on site now than there used to be. The culture has also changed, even the PPE (protective clothing) we wear has been tailored to fit women, with higher waisted trousers and the tops fit better. There has been a effort from different sources; there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more awareness in schools than there used to be. As a Stem ambassador, I go to schools and talk about engineering. We have a lot of young people visiting so they can see the reality and we have many women on site (and it helps to encourage young women to get into the industry). Working in construction makes you feel very valuable in a society. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working in a job that you know can change people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quality of life. You feel proud doing this job. Silvia Fiorini, 34 Senior environmental and sustainability advisor I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m from Fiuggi, a little town close to Rome. My background is in environmental engineering and I started my career six years ago on Crossrail as an environmental team assistant where, at the beginning, I was the only woman in the team. I think there is probably still a lack of women in construction in site-specific roles such as electricians or machine operators but things are improving. Six out of eight members of the environmental team are women and, in the site construction team, the project manager and site project engineer are both female. My family and friends were all enthusiastic to know that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m working in construction and thought I was perfect for this job as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m really determined and I feel really comfortable in this industry. I truly believe that there is no difference between females and males in terms of skills and added values they bring to a project. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a matter of encouraging women to start this kind of career. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m mentoring young environmental advisers by helping them to gather more site experience and guiding them to improve their knowledge of environmental issues on site. Through this mentoring, I am able to support and encourage confidence within young women in the hope that they will do the same for others as they progress in their careers to encourage further diversity within our industry. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m really happy about my role in construction and I love my job. Every day is different, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dynamic, challenging and really motivates me. It keeps me driven and curious to know and learn more. There are several aspects of my role that I love but the best part is the satisfaction from building relationships and the sense of achievement at the end of day. Concepcion Vicente, 39 Project manager Just being a woman at management level in construction is a major challenge in itself, and a positive impact on the industry. The UK has the lowest percentage of female engineering professionals in Europe. Only 11% of the engineering workforce is female and only 5% of registered engineers and technicians are women. I am part of that low percentage and feel really proud to add value in this way. I am the only woman contractor project manager dealing with a CSO site within not just the Tideway Central section project (one out of eight CSO sites) but within the whole Tideway project. Within that low percentage, I also add something very important and needed which is diversity. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a professional born in a different country and with vast experience. This cross-cultural mix and the exchange of experiences, lessons learnt, methodologies, procedures, subcontractors, systems, even mindsets, are powerful tools that help us to improve and continuously develop to the benefit of ourselves and our industry, and move towards better results and goals for instance. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter if you are a woman or a man, you have to love what you do in order to deliver the best. I am proud to say that I love my career and my job. Because of this, and the passion I feel about the industry, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a champion for this profession. My colleagues and friends see me as an example and a pioneer after what happened to most of us during the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153credit crunch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I worked extremely hard throughout these years to carry on with my development. Stela De Sena, 43 Civil engineer I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m originally from Portugal and a qualified civil engineer, working on the Crossrail project. I always wanted to do engineering. It was very difficult to get a job when I graduated from Salford University in 2007. My first job was as a labourer, I worked on site for three months. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve definitely experienced sexism in my job. When I was at university there were about 60 students in my class but only four were women. My goal is to be a construction manager. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the industry is ready to see more women in this role. My sister is an architect. When I was young, we always said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I want to build houses\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I like to create things. You see the building going up and staying as part of history. Every time I go to the Olympic Park now, it reminds me that I was involved in the project. Shelin Mcintosh, 39 Environmental monitoring engineer I moved back to London to work because I wanted to see women that looked like me actually reach senior management positions within a company. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see that happening where I previously worked in Staffordshire. I found it more male dominated for an everyday working environment. I started in the construction industry in 1998 when I did a technical modern apprenticeship in engineering alongside a higher national certificate in mechanical engineering. I have found when competing against male counterparts for job opportunities, nine times out of 10 it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more likely such job opportunities went directly to the male candidate. Since being back in London, and being a part of Women into Construction, the number of women I have come into contact with who are in senior management positions within the industry has been very positive to see. Ruth Aguilar, 31 Site environmentaladviser, who is five months pregnant I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been working in construction since September 2015. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m from Mexico but came to London in 2012 to study for a masters in global environmental change at Kings College London. I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planned to work on construction sites. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d worked in the food industry for three years so I thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be working in food manufacturing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a learning process for me. My dad taught me and my two sisters a lot when he built our house. We helped him with the painting, levelling the walls, putting the bathroom in. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m an internal auditor so I get to see all of the Tideway sites. You can see that some sites have more women than others, some are 50/50, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really nice to see. At some they have more men. But I think access for women to go for jobs in construction is growing. I try to go into schools and colleges at least every term. We do Stem volunteering with Tideway, showing young people the kind of jobs that are on offer in the industry. If they are interested in engineering, we show them that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a place for them. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just building, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the environment side, the design side, learning to manage people. There are a lot of people behind a building. My employer is excited that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pregnant. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been very favourable and taken in a positive way. One of the things I enjoy the most about this industry is working with people from all over the world. In London, you can find people from places you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even know existed. Having that mix of cultures, I just love it. The UK has construction companies with a very good reputation, working with them will open doors for you anywhere in the world. Katie Kelleher Crane operator I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been a crane operator for four years. I fell into it after working in recruitment. I never knew that women worked in the industry. I think everyone has a preconception about construction, when I was a recruitment consultant I did, too. A friend on Facebook messaged me saying his seven-year old daughter wants to be an engineer like me because she saw photos of me in front of a TBM (tunnel boring machine) on Crossrail. That was great. My first day on site was tough. I do think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s getting easier for women but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intimidating because there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a lot of women who operate machinery; you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see them on site, people stare a lot. It can be quite hard to take. It will get better. It is changing, but it is tough. The best things about working on site is that the environment changes and progresses so much. I like saying I built Tottenham Court Road station, you do say that! You say I built it, just me in a crane! Everyone does it. My dad, who was a bricklayer, used to do it. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get the train into Victoria and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say, you see that one over there, I built that. Now I can say I built something that will outlive me. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what I like about it, leaving a bit of a legacy around London. When I told my family I was going to quit recruitment and train to be a crane operator everyone asked me if I was sure, my mum, my dad, my boyfriend at the time told me it was a dirty job, full of men, it was hard work and long hours. I think people tried to dissuade me a little bit. I think I thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d prove them all wrong and just do it anyway. Everyone was really supportive in the end. I see more women coming on to site now than when I started four years ago. I think it will take a long time to change dramatically, but companies are more aware of the need for diversity. We need more active female role models, to talk to schools, educate parents, teachers, students. Apprenticeships are important, a lot of young people are pushed down the university route and it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work for everyone. It is changing but it will take a long time. I got really attached to my first crane. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re living in it for 11 or 12 hours a day. You keep it clean, you know where everything is, it becomes your living space. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen people cutting out carpets for theirs, leaving their shoes outside. My first crane was a little 60 tonner, it was a LCR 1060, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re lovely cranes, really really nice. It felt like it was mine! Noorganah Robertson, 34 Trainee electrician I have a degree in film but went back to college in 2010 to learn to be an electrician. It was mostly men on the course, just me and one other woman in a class of 20. When I graduated it was difficult to get a job, it took about two years from the time I finished college. I thought working on a building site was rough and tough and full of lots of guys, and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I could handle that. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m generally more academic and into the arts. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m also quite sensitive. When I had my induction for my first job on site I thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d made a mistake. It was pretty intimidating at first but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good culture of teaching on building sites. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re interested in learning, people will show you what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing and help and support you. My family were pleased that I was doing something practical. My dad used to be a jeweller, my uncle is a carpenter, he did all the electrics in every building he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever owned. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re quite a practical family. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just about hiring more women, you have to create an environment where people can grow. If you do that, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s naturally going to draw more women to it. If the industry changes some of its ideology and philosophy at a fundamental level, women will more naturally be drawn to construction because they are more likely to feel safe, supported and valued. Women (or anybody regardless of gender) are not going to voluntarily go into an environment where they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel safe or are made to feel vulnerable. What is often misunderstood, usually by male workers in construction companies where women work on site, is that the base level of feeling comfortable is at different levels for men and women. Once these issues are more widely understood, the industry will naturally become more balanced gender-wise. Leah Blackwell, 32 Painter and decorator I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been working in constructionfor five years. I was 24 when I changed careers, I was stuck in retail, hated it, so I took the plunge. At first I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to go into construction because I thought it was a man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world. I thought it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not for women. My mum kept banging on to me, get a trade, get a trade, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never be out of a job. I put myself through evening courses at college whilst still in full-time employment in retail. Just because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re females it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an end to how far you go up the career ladder. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entirely down to you, the individual. If you see yourself in a certain place in 10 years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time, strive for it and go for it, just keep fighting. Guys will do the same thing, so do we. In terms of what sex you are, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t determine how far you should go up the ladder or where you should stop in your career. Last year, I decided I wanted to move up. I wanted to get off the tools and change to health and safety. You get responsibility, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking after everyone on site. My family is construction based; when I told them I was going to get into it I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually get any negativity. My friends were great. I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t received any negativity, everything was positive. In the past five years, more girls are coming through. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been on jobs where you have female sparkies, electricians, plumbers. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just trades, young people, school leavers, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re put off by construction because they see it as a dirty job. We need more information out there; you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily have to go into construction and be a tradesman. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to be a sparky, a chippy or a plumber, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health and safety and then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management. There are so many different aspects. Best move I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for sure. There are a lot more women coming into the industry now. Every job I go on now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m bound to see at least three females on the tools. Painters, electricians, chippies. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really good to see. I think more women are coming through now because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more information out there. We talk to school leavers about construction, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job centres, even job fairs at the Excel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trying to reach out to females of all ages and say: look, this is where I started, this is where I am now, and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be intimidated, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s changing, it is changing so fast, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really good to see. Working on construction sites gives a sense of freedom; you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re constantly doing something different and moving round. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the people I work with, too, we just have a laugh. They never overstep the line. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that level or respect. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite nice. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never a dull moment; you have a lot of laughs on a construction site. If you like your freedom, doing different things, if you like a challenge, construction is for you. If I had a group of young people sitting in front of me right now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say get into construction and change the world. The more females we have working in construction shows society that women can do it, too. If men can lift it, so can we. We can pick up a hammer, pick up a drill. Claire Kilrane, 28 Section engineer at Tideway I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been working in construction for four-and-a-half years, two years with Tideway. Before that I was on Crossrail, it was my first job in construction. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been slight changes in terms of being a women in the industry, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fitted PPE (protection clothing) for women and female toilets. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think my friends and family were surprised that I was working on site, people were positive. My mum though I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be well suited to it. Construction is so diverse, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something for everyone. If you like to be outside, you can do that; if you like planning or doing anything software related you can work in digital engineering; if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re into innovating, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of focus on that as well. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an issue if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the only woman on site; the culture\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s changed. Michelle Umagho-Ukueku Health and safety adviser I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been working in construction for over 10 years always as a health and safety adviser. I love working with the lads on site. Construction is so varied, there are different people from all walks of life, different cultures. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fantastic place to be. We have our banter, I love it. I give as good as I get if not worse. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see myself working anywhere else. I have administrative duties but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather be out on site. People would say construction is a man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world, far from it. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got loads of females from different walks of life, different jobs. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how you take it, how you get on with it. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m at home when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m on site with the boys. The key is communication. Treat people how you want to be treated, speak to people how you want to be spoken to. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a them and us. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all equal. I would call my colleagues my family. Women are strong, the right women with the right attitude, skills, knowledge, or she can learn it on the go. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely more women on site than there were 10 years ago. More female trainee site managers, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have that when I first started. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got female bosses in my job. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inspiring to see them. You think about your own path, where you want to go. Camilla Bernal, 38 Senior environmental manager who is five months pregnant I moved to the UK 10 years ago from Colombia. When I started, I was the only Colombian in my project and there were very few women. It was a big challenge; there were still stigmas around working on construction sites. Women are as capable as men. People think that construction is dirty, male dominated and dangerous, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not like that. The perception needs to change and I believe that we, as women, have a responsibility to do that. I am a proof that women can succeed in construction. I was nominated for an award called 100 Colombians to recognise talent of Colombians living abroad. I returned to Colombia for a ceremony with the president in 2014. It was fantastic. It gave me the opportunity to show other Colombians that if you are really passionate about what you do, if you are persistent, you can achieve anything. When I started in this industry, I saw myself as the weakest link: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a woman, English is my second language, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a biologist and I work in environment. Then I realised that all of those things were my strengths. You need to be out of your comfort zone to achieve things. There are more women working on construction projects now than there were 10 years ago. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great. We can bring so much to a project.",

Rising interest rates mean higher borrowing costs for companies and individuals, such as higher mortgage rates. Investors are fearful that firms and consumers will struggle to cope with higher costs.</p> <p>Charlie Ripley, a senior strategist at Allianz Investment Management, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The equity sell-off is a reaction from investors finally realising we are in a higher interest-rate environment and, given the elevated level of stocks, market participants were likely looking for a reason to sell.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <h2>Which stocks have been worst hit?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7832602692bd7688af7edbf04278bcd7c6b6ec61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7832602692bd7688af7edbf04278bcd7c6b6ec61/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The US technology giants collectively known as Faangs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The US technology giants collectively known as Faangs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/10/dow-jones-drops-800-points-stock-markets\">The rout has been led by technology stocks</a>. In the US the Dow Jones and the S&amp;P 500 both lost more than 3% overnight, their worst declines since February, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled more than 4%, the biggest fall since the Brexit vote. The best-performing stocks over the past year have been the so-called Faang group, comprising Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google, which have endured some of the biggest losses.</p> <p>Tech companies tend to be highly leveraged, so will be vulnerable to rising interest rates. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/21/facebook-google-and-amazon-to-pay-fair-tax-under-eu-plans\">EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned new tax on technology companies</a> is also putting pressure on tech giants. </p> <h2>Why are bond yields rising?</h2> <p>The Fed has raised interest rates three times this year and traders are expecting another increase in December, followed by three more next year. This is pushing up bond yields and higher bond yields can weigh on stock markets as they provide more competition for investors seeking returns.</p> <p>The yield on the two-year US government bond hit its highest level since 2008 on Wednesday, while the 10-year yield, which is used to price mortgages, auto loans and other debt, reached a seven-year high the previous day. Rising bond yields make it more expensive to borrow money.</p> <h2>What is the latest in the US-China trade war?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4981224b01a328bb7097925733bf08ceded471de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4981224b01a328bb7097925733bf08ceded471de/153_191_3328_1998/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump has threatened further tariffs on an additional $276bn of goods, covering virtually all Chinese imports.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/17/donald-trump-united-states-threatens-to-impose-200bn-import-tariffs-on-china-in-trade-war\">Washington imposed new tariffs on $200bn</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/17/donald-trump-united-states-threatens-to-impose-200bn-import-tariffs-on-china-in-trade-war\"> of Chinese goods</a>, hitting thousands of consumer goods, from luggage and electronics to homewares and foods. Tariffs were set at 10% but could go to 25% next year. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/18/china-us-new-tariffs-donald-trump-trade-war\">Beijing retaliated with extra duties on $60bn of US goods</a>. The US president has also threatened further tariffs on an additional $276bn of goods, covering virtually all Chinese imports.</p> <p>Earlier US tariffs imposed in July targeted imports of steel, aluminium and cars. Ominously, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/sep/19/the-us-china-trade-war-is-unlikely-to-be-settled-soon\">Jack Ma, the Alibaba billionaire, predicted that the US-China trade war could last 20 years</a>.</p> <p>This is expected to harm the world economy in the long run. Many economists and the International Monetary Fund <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/09/trumps-trade-war-with-china-and-europe-will-hit-global-growth-imf\">have warned</a> that the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasingly protectionist trade policies would hit global growth.</p> <h2>Why does Italy matter?</h2> <p>European stocks are being dragged down by the row between Rome and Brussels over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new budget. The populist government in Rome <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/09/imf-warns-italy-not-to-breach-eu-spending-rules-in-next-budget\">wants to raise public spending</a> to revive the economy but this would lead to a higher deficit in a country where the debt pile is already huge. The plans have driven up the Italian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of borrowing this week. The yield on the 10-year government bond is more than 3.5%, closer to the rate in Greece (4.5%) than to the rates in Spain (1.6%) and Portugal (2%).</p> <p>David Madden at CMC Markets UK sums up the fear haunting investors: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any downgrades to Italian debt could cause yields to rise further and potentially spark another round of the eurozone debt crisis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p>",

Donald Trump added to the pressure by branding the US Federal Reserve \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crazy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for planning further rate rises. The US economy is booming, prompting the Fed to raise rates to keep a lid on inflation. Rising interest rates mean higher borrowing costs for companies and individuals, such as higher mortgage rates. Investors are fearful that firms and consumers will struggle to cope with higher costs. Charlie Ripley, a senior strategist at Allianz Investment Management, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The equity sell-off is a reaction from investors finally realising we are in a higher interest-rate environment and, given the elevated level of stocks, market participants were likely looking for a reason to sell.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Which stocks have been worst hit? The rout has been led by technology stocks. In the US the Dow Jones and the S&amp;P 500 both lost more than 3% overnight, their worst declines since February, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled more than 4%, the biggest fall since the Brexit vote. The best-performing stocks over the past year have been the so-called Faang group, comprising Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google, which have endured some of the biggest losses. Tech companies tend to be highly leveraged, so will be vulnerable to rising interest rates. The EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned new tax on technology companies is also putting pressure on tech giants. Why are bond yields rising? The Fed has raised interest rates three times this year and traders are expecting another increase in December, followed by three more next year. This is pushing up bond yields and higher bond yields can weigh on stock markets as they provide more competition for investors seeking returns. The yield on the two-year US government bond hit its highest level since 2008 on Wednesday, while the 10-year yield, which is used to price mortgages, auto loans and other debt, reached a seven-year high the previous day. Rising bond yields make it more expensive to borrow money. What is the latest in the US-China trade war? Last month Washington imposed new tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods, hitting thousands of consumer goods, from luggage and electronics to homewares and foods. Tariffs were set at 10% but could go to 25% next year. Beijing retaliated with extra duties on $60bn of US goods. The US president has also threatened further tariffs on an additional $276bn of goods, covering virtually all Chinese imports. Earlier US tariffs imposed in July targeted imports of steel, aluminium and cars. Ominously, Jack Ma, the Alibaba billionaire, predicted that the US-China trade war could last 20 years. This is expected to harm the world economy in the long run. Many economists and the International Monetary Fund have warned that the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasingly protectionist trade policies would hit global growth. Why does Italy matter? European stocks are being dragged down by the row between Rome and Brussels over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new budget. The populist government in Rome wants to raise public spending to revive the economy but this would lead to a higher deficit in a country where the debt pile is already huge. The plans have driven up the Italian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of borrowing this week. The yield on the 10-year government bond is more than 3.5%, closer to the rate in Greece (4.5%) than to the rates in Spain (1.6%) and Portugal (2%). David Madden at CMC Markets UK sums up the fear haunting investors: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any downgrades to Italian debt could cause yields to rise further and potentially spark another round of the eurozone debt crisis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

Hardware maker Cisco Systems was the biggest faller on the Dow, down 2.2%, followed by Apple (-2.1%), Visa (2%) and Microsoft (-1.8%). The disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey also loomed over the markets. The oil price has risen - Brent is 0.4% higher at $80.76 tonight - amid chatter that Riyadh could cut supplies in retaliation for any sanctions. And on the fiscal side, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit has jumped to $779bn, thanks to a burst of spending. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all from us today. Goodnight. So much for the rally! A late swirl of selling has sent Wall Street into the red at the closing bell. The Dow shed 89 points, or 0.35%, back down to 25,250. The Nasdaq had a worse day, losing 1%. Once again, anxiety over US interest rate rises and worries over an economic slowdown weighed on the markets. Is volatility turning into the new normal? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly more common than it used to be.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a couple of photos from Wall Street today: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a photo from Riyadh, where the Tadawul All-Share Index (TASI) jumped by 3.5%, after heavy losses on Sunday With one hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading to go, Wall Street is edging higher. The Dow is now up 0.5%, or 122 points, at 25,462, and on track for its second \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcup day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in a row. The numbers are in.... America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit jumped by over $100bn in the last fiscal year, to nearly $780bn. Higher defence and social security spending helped to drive up the deficit, even though the economy grew strongly too. Marketwatch has the details: The U.S. recorded a $779 billion deficit in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, an increase of $113 billion, as spending climbed while revenue remained nearly flat, the Treasury Department announced Monday. Outlays grew by $127 billion, or 3.2%, while government receipts rose 0.4%, or $14 billion. Compared to GDP, the deficit rose to 3.9%, up by 0.4 percentage points. In September alone, the U.S. recorded a surplus of $119.1 billion. UK defence firm BAE Systems saw its shares fall today, as traders pondered the implications of the Khashoggi case. Earlier, Donald Trump told reporters that the Saudi king had firmly denied being responsible for the journalist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappearance - indeed, Trump suggested that rogue elements could be to blame (inside the Saudi consulate in Ankara?). Trump has now dispatched his Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, to the Middle East to investigate. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says the Saudi tensions loomed over the City: Ironically, it was UK defence giant BAE Systems that bore the brunt of the dispute, trading down 3.46% on the day, as a conflict with the oil producing country could threaten its \u00c2\u00a310 billion deal for 48 Typhoon jets. The oil market was surprisingly placid about rising political tensions with Brent crude trading up 0.35% and WTI up 0.39%. Instead some investment went into gold and gold shares, notably Rangold and Anglo American. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market also had a better day, with the DAX gaining 90 points or 0.8%. France ended slightly lower, though. A day that started with blustery rain and deep puddles in the City of London has ended with a modest recovery. The FTSE 100 has nudged its way back over the 7,000 point mark, gaining 33 points or 0.45% to finish at 7,029. This means the Footsie has avoided setting another six-month closing low, as looked possible this morning. Wall Street is attempting to push higher, and add to Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery. The Dow is now up 84 points, or 0.3%, while the Nasdaq is coming off its lows. Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market sell-off was partly due to worries that the global economy is slowing. And Capital Economics has added to those concerns, by predicting that the next recession could be closer than previously thought. Neil Shearing, their chief economist, believes it will be triggered in America, as the Federal Reserve raises rates to calm inflation (as Donald Trump has warned). Shearin\u001cg writes: The next global downturn is likely to come much sooner than the current consensus anticipates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c indeed, we think that world GDP growth is already peaking in this cycle and that it will slow relatively sharply in 2019-20. The downturn itself is likely to be led by the US, where higher interest rates will begin to weigh on rate-sensitive sectors of the economy, and China, which is undergoing a structural slowdown. And while we anticipate that the next global downturn will be relatively short and mild compared to previous cycles, there is a long and growing list of threats that mean there is a significant risk of a sharper adjustment. The newswires are reporting that Janet Yellen, the former chair of the US Federal Reserve, has criticised Donald Trump for his attacks on her predecessor, Jerome Powell. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal has the details: Yellen also cited the danger that the US economy is running too hot, and also cautioned that the US trade dispute with China could hurt the global economy. Back in New York, the sell-off is gathering momentum. The Nasdaq tech index is now down 1%. Pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca has frozen investment in the UK until it knows what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening with Brexit, according to the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman. Leif Johansson told French newspaper Le Monde that the UK-Swedish firm has activated its contingency plans. It is now stockpiling medicines at national borders and has duplicated some of its UK operations in Sweden. Johansson, whose company has operations in Cambridge and Macclesfield, adds: We have also stopped investing in the UK. More here. The chimes of the opening bell are ringing out across Wall Street, teeing up a fresh week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading. Traders are edgy following the worst week since March, and in the face of rising tensions around Saudi Arabia. And...shares are dipping in early trading. The Dow Jones industrial average has shed 20 points, or 0.1%, while the Nasdaq is 0.3% lower. Big tech stocks, including Facebook, Netflix and Amazon, are among the big fallers: Back in London, the FTSE 100 has struggled back from his morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s six-month low. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now up 19 points , or 0.3%, at 7015. But the FTSE 250 index, which contains smaller UK companies, is having a worse day. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down 199 points, or 1%, at 18,774, partly due to those nasty profit warnings from SuperDry and ConvaTec this morning. The weak US retail sales growth in September has surprised City economics and investors - here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some early reaction: Just in: Americans spent less in restaurants and malls than expected last month. US retail sales only rose by 0.1% in September, much weaker than the 0.6% growth which economists had expected. This is partly due to a 1.8% fall in spending at restaurants and bars, the biggest drop since December 2016. That wiped out a 0.8% surge in car purchases. Clothing sales rose by 0.5%, while online and mail-order shopping jumped by 1.1%. Such a big drop in spending in bars and eateries could worry economists - it may signal that US consumers are cutting back. However, it could also be due to one-off factors, such as the hurricanes which hit the US last month. Two more top US executives have pulled out of Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDavos in the desert\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 event, over the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi. Blackstone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stephen Schwarzman and BlackRock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Larry Fink have both withdraw from the high-profile Saudi Arabian investment conference taking place later this month (with a shrinking guest list). Over the weekend, the CEO of JP Morgan and the chairman of Ford both cancelled, as the furore over Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappearance intensified. Other top bosses are still weighing up their next move -- but I suspect we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re reaching where attending the event is more controversial than finding a previous engagement in the diary (or even subsequent one...) Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, has called for Britain to rethink its relationship with Riyadh too: We should not be in league with a brutal dictatorship that beheads its own citizens for standing up for their rights, which rains down airstrikes on civilian areas in Yemen with no concern for innocent children, and that thinks it can assassinate dissident journalists in other countries with impunity. We must apply the same standards to countries such as Saudi Arabia, Israel and Egypt that we apply to Iran, Russia and Syria. Where any of them abuse human rights and breach international humanitarian law, we must be prepared to call it out in the same measure, rather than treating it as one rule for our supposed friends and another for our supposed enemies. Just in: Bank of America has beaten Wall Street forecasts, which might calm some investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 nerves. The second-largest US bank make profits of 66 cents per share in the last quarter, ahead of the 62 cents expected by analysts. Revenues grew by 4%, as Bank of America benefitted from higher interest rates and recent US tax cuts. Chief executive officer Brian Moynihan sounds upbeat, declaring: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Responsible growth, backed by a solid U.S. economy and a healthy U.S. consumer, combined to deliver the highest quarterly pre-tax earnings in our company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More UK retail gloom: Fashion accessories retailer Claire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is considering a raft of store closures in the UK, according to a report on the Press Association. The US stock market is expected to lose ground when trading begins in three hours. The futures market is indicating the Dow Jones industrial average will shed 106 points, or 0.4%, at the open. New retail sales figures (at 1.30pm UK time) and financial results from Bank of America could both move the markets. The main Asian stock markets have all closed in the red today. Japan fell by almost 1.8%, Hong Kong lost 1.5%, Shanghai shed 1.4% and Australia finished 1% lower (our earlier summary has more details) The oil price is pushing higher this morning, amid rising tensions between Saudi and the US over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Brent crude has risen 1% to $81.25 per barrel, back towards the four-year high set earlier this month. Bloomberg is reporting that the Saudi King has ordered an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153internal probe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd into the Khashoggi - who is presumed to have been murdered after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. On Saturday, US president Donald Trump vowed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsevere punishment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 if it was confirmed that the Saudi regime had killed Khashoggi. This was a hardening of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original position, that he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to risk investment and jobs over the case. Saudi Arabia, though, denies being involved -- and has now vowed to retaliate if sanctions are imposed. In theory, Saudi could hurt America badly by cutting crude production -- in a repeat of the 1970s oil shock. That would send transport costs soaring, drive inflation higher, and hurt growth. Saudi is the biggest single producer in the Opec cartel, producing over 10 million barrels today (global demand is 100 barrels/day), so it could have a major impact on prices. However, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an argument that rival suppliers, such as the US shale industry, could step in to fill a production shortfall. Ouch. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchange has now overcome its technical issues, and traders are sending shares lower. The DAX has dipped by 20 points, or 0.18%, to 11,503 points, a new 20-month low. The gold price has jumped by 1% today to $1,231 per ounce. Bullion is benefiting from a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flight to safety\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as nervous investors look for a safer place for their money, says Stephen Innes of trading firm OANDA: While the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s version of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Red October \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 makes it way into the South China Sea, echoes of Octobers past are reverberating throughout global capital markets as risk off continues to linger with equity market look ever so fragile. The US Treasury is set to release the semi-annual FX report. While China doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t meet the historical criteria to be named a currency manipulator who is to say, President Trump, my not rewrite the requirements so that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inclusion in the future is assured? Geopolitical embers are smouldering, threatening to ignite the middle east powder over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The UK FTSE 100 has just hit a new six-month low, as its early gains fizzle out. The blue-chip index of leading sharews in London is now down 27 points at 6968. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest level since the end of March, adding to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. This follows the weak trading in Asia (where Japan lost 1.8% and China fell 1.4%). Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a noticeable lack of bargain hunters on Monday morning as last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound in select parts of the market fails to extend into the new working week. The FTSE 100 was down 0.1% in early trading at 6,988 with investors clearly lacking confidence to snap up stocks whose share prices were badly damaged in last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market sell-off. The biggest riser is gold producer Randgold \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a traditional \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsafe-haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in troubled times, with other \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdefensive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stocks such as British American Tobacco and BT Group also in demand. Engineering firms such as Melrose and BAE are among the big fallers: Pakistan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has made a bad start to the new week, falling over 2% in early trading. That follows a 4% tumble last week, as investors fretted about Pakistan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic outlook. Prime Minister Imran Khan is seeking an emergency bailout from the International Monetary Fund, who may demand tough austerity measures in return. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchange has been hit by a technical glitch that has prevented trading getting underway. The Financial Times explains: The opening of trade in Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market, the primary trading venue for German equities, was delayed on Monday by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153technical problems\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Xetrastock exchange, one of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest, faced issues with its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trading infrastructure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which meant the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trading start will not take place according to the usual trading schedule.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So, we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see how the German DAX is faring yet.... As feared, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no recovery in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market this morning. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the largest European companies, has dropped by another 0.4% to a fresh 22-month low. With traders reluctant to take risks, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a jittery feel in the trading floors again. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says: The Swiss franc and yen are stronger. Hard Brexit risks are mounting, global political risks are ever-present and equities and bond yields are lower ex-Italy. The breakdown in Brexit talks, the disappearance of dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the demise of the CSU in Bavarian elections, the impasse over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget and the worried tone coming from the IMF/World Bank meetings in Bali all combine to give financial markets an uncomfortable feel this morning. Shares in UK fashion group SuperDry have plunged by 20% after it shocked the City with a profits warning. SuperDry says that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unseasonably hot weather conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the UK, Continental Europe and on the East Coast of America has hit demand for its autumn ranges, and wipe \u00c2\u00a310m off profits. In another blow, the company is taking an \u00c2\u00a38m hit on foreign exchange costs, after discovering that its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hedging mechanisms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have not protected it from volatility in the currency markets. Investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed - sending SuperDry shares sliding from \u00c2\u00a310.15 to just \u00c2\u00a38.12. At the start of the year they were worth \u00c2\u00a320. Astonishingly, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not enough to make SuperDry the worst-performing stock today. That \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchonour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 goes to medical equipment maker ConvaTec, whose shares have lurched 30% lower. The colostomy and wound bag manufacturer has slashed its profit forecasts, due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153challenging market dynamics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and its CEO is retiring. In London, the FTSE 100 index has opened 20 points higher (+0.3%), as traders try to put last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses behind them. Artjom Hatsaturjants at City firm Accendo Markets says the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness is helping multinational companies: The muted open comes after a negative start to the week in Asia, where concerns over rising US interest rates continued weighing on equities. Brexit negotiations suffered another setback over the weekend, as PM Theresa May rejected key EU proposals over the Irish border, dealing a blow to negotiations to avert a hard Brexit. This has sent the GBP [the pound] sharply lower ahead of an EU leaders summit on Wednesday, helping FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international names. After another day of losses, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has sunk to its lowest closing level in almost four years. CHINA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122S SHANGHAI COMPOSITE INDEX CLOSES DOWN 1.49% TO 2568.1 CHINA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122S CSI 300 INDEX FALLS 1.4% TO 3,126.45 AT CLOSE A cocktail of risks are weighing on the markets, says Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group: Concerns over higher US borrowing costs were the catalyst for last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heavy sell off. However, there were plenty of other risk factors which were also dampening sentiment. Those risk factors, including US- Sino trade tensions, Brexit, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget proposal and now increased political tensions between the US and Saudi Arabia, are set to keep pressure on risk appetite this week. Good morning from a wet and grisly London. Last week wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a pretty one for the City - the FTSE 100 fell steadily to a six-month low, while European stock sank to their lowest in 21 months. And as the rain tips down, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little sign of optimism in the markets today. Germany traders have been rattled by yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bavarian state parliament election, which saw the ruling Christian Social Union lose its majority. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another blow to Angela Merkel (whose CDU party are partners with the CSU) There are tensions in Italy too, where the government is expected to approve its new budget, despite complaints from Brussels that it will breach EU fiscal rules. Yesterday, Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte announced the budget would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a change of gear for Italy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Conte suggests Europe would soften its view, once Rome has explained its growth strategy to them.... But until that happens, investors will fear another episode in the eurozone debt crisis. Spread-betting firm IG predicts fresh losses in Frankfurt and Milan today: The losses continue to mount up on financial markets amid uncertainty across the world about trade, rising US interest rates and now a potential clash between the US and Saudi Arabia over the fate of missing journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The Saudi tension has sent the price of oil up and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also been a rough night for the pound ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crunch Brexit summit with sterling slipping. The yen meanwhile has strengthened a touch against the dollar. Stock markets fell in Asia overnight led by the Nikkei in Japan. It is off 1.85% (not helped by the rising yen). Seoul -0.7%, the Hang Seng -1.24% and Shanghai is off 0.83%. The ASX200 in Sydney closed down 0.99%. Futures trade suggests a flat start later today for the FTSE100 while the Dax30 in Germany is seen dropping 0.25%. Wall Street is tipped to fall too. The pound is down 0.3% to $1.31 and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.135. Brent crude is up 1.25% amid Saudi tensions. JP Morgan and Ford bosses have joined the boycott of the Future Investment Intiative conference in Riyadh next week in the wake of the Khashoggi affair. China says it faces \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncertainties\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plenty of room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for fiscal manoeuvre if thin gs get sticky. Which they nevertheless say they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. The US dollar rose against the euro and other currencies. These included the Aussie dollar, a proxy for emerging market sentiment, which slipped to US71.06c from US71.26c on Friday. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m signing off now. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been an interesting day but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to hand over to Graeme Wearden in London. Thanks for joining us. It will be fascinating to see where the price of oil goes this week. Brent futures have risen 1.255 today to $81.5 a barrel and that could rise to $100 according to one analyst. Kazuhiko Fuji, senior fellow at the Japanese government thinktank, the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry, said: Oil prices could rise to $100 on worries about Saudi Arabia. People had thought the Saudis will make up for fall in Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output. If they are starting to use oil as their weapon, that will be a whole new chapter. Apologies - I jumpped the gun on the Aussie market. The final settlemtn pushed it deeper into the red to end down 58.6 points, or 0.99%, at 5837.1 points. Sears, the venerable US retailer, has gone into administration. It has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, according to a filing in a New York court, Reuters reports. The filing says Sears, which once dominated US retailing in the golden age of catalogues, has assets in the range of $1bn to 10bn and liabilities in the range of $10bn to $50bn. The ASX200 is done for the day. It finishes down 46 points, or 0.79%, at 5,849 points. Saudi Arabia has threatened to retaliate against the world economy if western nations impose sanctions or similar if it emerges that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security forces murdered the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But what form could Saudi action take? Our business reporter Rob Davies has been looking at the issues and his main points are The Saudis have the obvious power to push up oil prices. it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest producer and reducing output would see prices rise, possibly causing a devastating oil shock to the world economy. Second, the Saudis support thousands of US jobs through their extensive arms imports. Loss of those contracts would damage Donald Trump and he has already flagged that he doesnn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to jeopradise those deals for companies such as Boeing and Lockheed. Saudi funds are also important to planned US infrastructure development. And it is a key strategic ally in the Middle East On the other side of the ledger, the Saudis are relying on western companies to reform the kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stagnant economy and diversify it away from oil. The growing boycott of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh (now including JP Morgan and Ford) shows possible leverage. it will be a blow to Prince Mohammed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prestige if more high-profile names pull out. You can read Rob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full piece here: We seem to have hit a fairly quiet spot in the trading day. The ASX200 in Sydney is down around 1% and is due to close in a few minutes. The Nikkei hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t moved from the -1.5% mark for a couple of hours. Ditto the Kospi (-0.5%) and the Hang Seng ( -0.1%). The CSI300 in Shanghai is probably the biggest mover, sliding from positive territory a couple of hours ago to now being off 0.8%. Talking of China, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth revisiting comments by the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank governor at the close of the IMF meeting in Bali on Sunday. Yi Gang said China still had plenty of room for adjustment in interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) in the face of any negative impact from trade tensions with the United States. He admitted China faced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tremendous uncertainties\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but was seeking a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153constructive solution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the current trade tensions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We still have plenty of monetary policy instruments in terms of interest rate policy, in terms of RRR. We have plenty of room for adjustment, just in case we need it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yi said, indicating that Beijing feels it has plenty of ammunition to fire up the economy if needed. He added that he expected GDP to print at least 6.5% on Friday. Chris Weston of Pepperstone in Melbourne has weighed with some commentary, saying things could quite ugly on stock markets if data out of China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c inflation, GDP and retail sales \u00e2\u20ac\u201c disappoints later in the week. After last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s volatility shock to markets, we start the week on a negative tone, with broad weakenss through Asia and the ASX 200 falling out of bed. The weekend news flow has centred on a lack of progress in the Brexit negotiations, a deterioration in Saudi/US relations, which have resulted in a 1.1% rally in crude, and the loss of majority for the CSU party in the German regional elections. Here are the latest scores, courtesy of IC Markets (although I think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve missed the minus sign off the Hang Seng price): Summing up nicely, Masayuki Kubota, chief strategist at Rakuten Securities says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say the shock is over.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound is set for a volatile few days as the wrangling over Brexit intensifies ahead of the meeting of European leaders starting on Wednesday night. It sits at $1.31 at the moment after losing 0.3% today. The key issue is how to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The EU wants the North to remain essentially bound by EU customs rules but that is facing pushback from Brexiters. Theresa May is hoping a temporary \u00e2\u20ac\u0153backstop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd can be put in place where the whole country remains in the customs deal for the time being. (There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good explainer here from Daniel Boffey, or Brussels correspondent.) Meanwhile, former foreign secretary and would-be Tory leader, Boris Johnson, has sounded off again in his Telegraph column. He says the backstop idea should be rejected completely and says the EU is treating the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with contempt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: In presuming to change the constitutional arrangements of the United Kingdom, the EU is treating us with naked contempt. Like some chess player triumphantly forking our king and our queen, the EU commission is offering the UK government what appears to be a binary choice. It is a choice between the break-up of this country, or the subjugation of this country, between separation or submission. So seems like a good moment to run this brilliant picture of UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and other foreign ministers in the maze at his country retreat Chevening this weekend. Still with Australia and interesting to note that Shane Oliver, the high-profile chief economist at AMP, has suggested that he might have to revise downwards his forecasts on house prices. He tweeted on Saturday that the auction results weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good but his forecast of a peak to trough fall of 15% out to 2020 remained in place. But he told the AFR that he might hve to rethink that forecast on the downside. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The risks are skewing to greater than 5% declines per year, which is what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been assuming,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told the Financial Review on Sunday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am thinking about revising down again.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In Australia the ASX200 has had a torrid morning. At one point it was down more than 1.5% but it has recovered at bit and is now at 5,829, a fall of 66 points or 1.1%. The financial sector has been battered amid concern about the impact of the royal commission on the big four and the amount of compensation they will have to pay. Commonwealth is the worst performing, down more than 2%. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the question of the impact from a deteriorating housing market. According to the AFR this morning, less than half of properties at auction this weekend were sold. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bad outcome during what should be one of the busiest times of the year. Agents are blaming lack of credit for buyers pulling out. The Chinese trading day has kicked off. The Hang Seng is down nearly 1% while the Shanghai Composite is up a fraction. Another major factor in stock market losses this week has been the prospect of a full-blown US-China trade war. But calls for calm from leaders gathered at the IMF conference in Bali last week seem to have fallen on deaf ears. The Chinese currency fell again against the dollar today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now at 6.92. That is sure to rattle Washington where there is a widespread view that beijing manipulates the currency to benefit exporters. In Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IMF communique, members agreed to debate ways to improve the World Trade Organization so it can better address trade disputes and that countries would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153refrain from competitive devaluations and will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The latter point address concern that China will allow the yuan to depreciate in order to make its exports more competitive to cope with any downside from US tariffs. Hmm ... While the Ssudi government has come out fighting on the prospect of US sanctions in the Khashoggi case, the boss of the Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya satellite news network has gone a few steps further. Turki Aldakhil paints an apocalyptic picture of world affairs if the US tries to get tough on the Saudis. He says the kingdom would respond by slashing oil output and would team up with Russia and stop buying US arms. The US would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stabbing itself to death\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Imposing any type of sanctions on Saudi Arabia by the West will cause the kingdom to resort to other options, US President Donald Trump had said a few days ago, and that Russia and China are ready to fulfill Riyadh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s military needs among others. No one can deny that repercussions of these sanctions will include a Russian military base in Tabuk, northwest of Saudi Arabia, in the heated four corners of Syria, Israel, Lebanon and Iraq. At a time where Hamas and Hezbollah have turned from enemies into friends, getting this close to Russia will lead to a closeness to Iran and maybe even a reconciliation with it. The list of marquee speakers at the Future Investment Intiative conference in Saudi Arabia next week makes interesting reading because a few of them have now said they will not be going. Jamie Dimon has pulled out along with the boss of Uber and the editor of the Economist, Zanny Minton-Beddoes, while US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin is under pressure not to go. Watch this space for more. The rise in oil prices is gathering pace too. Brent futures are up 1.3% to $81.54 a barrel. The sellers are gaining the upper hand in stock markets around Asia Pacific today. Hong Kong and China open later this morning. But this is how it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looking so far: The Nikkei is now down 1.56%, or 353 points at 22,341 The Kospi is off 12 points, or 0.55% at 2,150 The ASX200 is down 62 points at 5,833, a fall of 1.07% so far Bill Ford, the chief executive of Ford, has become the latest high-profile business leader to pull out of the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh later this month, Reuters reports. He joins JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon in announcing his withdrawal on Sunday. Neither cited a reason but it is suspected that the diplomatic standoff over the Khashoggi affair would be high on the list. Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, Viacom boss Bob Bakish and billionaire Steve Case, one of the founders of AOL, have also said they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be going to the event dubbed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Davos in the desert\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Reuters said. Bloomberg and CNN have also pulled out of covering the event. Read the full story on the growing row by our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour: Trading is under way in Japan and Korea. The Nikkei is off 1% and the Kospi is down 0.5% in Seoul. That seems par for the course today given the poor start in Sydney, where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now off 0.89% for the day. The question is whether the markets can bounce back or they are dragged lower by a compound of problems ... The price of Brent crude has risen this morning to $80.5 a barrel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surely connected to the Saudi issue, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth looking again at what the kingdom has said about possibly retaliating to external pressure over the Khashoggi affair. A statement from Riyadh on Sunday said: The kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats and attempts to undermine it, whether through economic sanctions, political pressure or repeating false accusations. The kingdom also affirms that if it is [targeted by] any action, it will respond with greater action. Crucially, the statement also pointed out that the oil-rich kingdom \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plays an effective and vital role in the world economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That has to be an implicit threat to cut oil production and push up the price of a barrel, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it? The standoff between Saudi Arabia and just about everyone else in the world over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi looks like intensifying. The Saudis have promised pushback if Donald Trump carries out his threat of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153severe Punishment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if the kingdom is found to have disposed of Khashoggi, as alleged by Turkey. Now, Reuters report that JP Morgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon has cancelled plans to attend a Saudi Arabian investor conference later this month. The bank did not give any more details for Dimon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision not to attend the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, and did not comment on whether concerns about the disappearance of Khashoggi were a factor. In currencies, the US dollar has gained a bit today. That means the Aussie dollar is down slightly at US71.07 while the yen has slipped to 112.2. The pound is at $1.31. The benchmark ASX200 has slipped around 1% in the first few minutes. The banks, as usual of late, have been sold with the financial sector down 1.47%. Same for resources which are down more than 1% but utilities are off 2%. More commentary on the Australian market from Michael McCarthy at CMC Markets. His thrust is that this week sees a lot of data from China including lending, retail sales and GDP which should give us a picture of where the superpower is heading, ie is it in good enough shape to survive a trade-war inspired downturn? There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also inflation and trade data from Japan, retail sales in the UK and in the US, retail sales, housing numbers and Fed minutes. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what Michael says: Australian investors face a challenge at this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening. Despite positive moves for US shares and buoyant industrial commodities SPI futures were belted at the New York close, suffering a 51 point loss for the session. The first hour of trading may indicate whether this was an error or the beginning of further underperformance for Australian shares. Greg McKenna, the independent market strategist, says the markets narrative has been hijacked by the Saudi pushback and Brexit but reckons it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a close call on what direction things will take. This is what he says in his morning note: Much water to flow here especially for the Pound and oil prices. Looking back to Friday though and while stocks in the US rallied into the close it was a messy day and hardly a convincing bounce. Is it the bottom? Many think so and the medium-term charts recovered to hold channel bottoms. But we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian business live blog. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re firing up a bit earlier than usual today because it looks like being an interesting session in Asia Pacific markets. In Australia, the ASX200 has dropped 51 points after opening a few minutes, or just under 1%. The Nikkei in Japan in expected to fall 0.83% and the Hang Seng will also dip slightly. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CSI300 is set for a bounce though. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only part of the picture today though because Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to disrupt the global economy will likely send the oil price higher today. Stocks on the Saudi market fell on Sunday. Meanwhile, the Brexit talks in the UK remain very tense with questions about whether Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government can seal a deal on its backstop solution for the Irish border. Senior members of her Tory party are threatening to rebel over the matter and that has seen the pound drop substantially. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s buying $1.309 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down more than 1% on Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. A forecast showing that the UK economy is going to have its worst year since the financial crisis hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped.",

                "bodyText":"The government should focus on fixing business rates and corporation tax, the boss of the online fashion retailer Asos has said in response to the threat of a new digital sales tax. Asos highlighted the deep divide between the fortunes of online retailers and traditional rivals on Wednesday when it revealed a step-up in sales growth over the summer, when many high street stores have closed. The online retailer said sales rose 23% in the UK in the year to 31 August, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153accelerating as the year progressed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The performance is in stark contrast to some high street rivals, including Superdry and Ted Baker, which have partly blamed the heatwave for disappointing trading over the summer. The divide in fortunes has led bricks-and-mortar retailers to call for changes to the tax system, which disproportionately levies charges on those with a network of physical stores via business rates. Dave Lewis, the boss of Tesco, recently called for a 2% tax on any goods sold online as a way to even the playing field for struggling high street retailers after a wave of closures across the UK. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is meanwhile considering a digital services tax on UK advertising revenue, which would affect the likes of Google and Facebook. Nick Beighton, chief executive of Asos, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our responsibility and obligation is to pay the tax rate that the jurisdictions or government set us, and we will do that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But he added that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153core problems to solve and where the attention should be\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was adjusting business rates and tackling the practice of companies organising their corporate structures so that profits made in the UK were recognised abroad and so not subject to taxes here. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It strikes me that the core problems to solve and where the attention should be is on solving corporation tax leakage and fixing business rates,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK sales increased over the summer as its twentysomething shoppers bagged its new beauty range and sporty clothing. Beighton said sales of activewear had tripled and beauty sales were up 50% after the relaunch of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own-label skincare and beauty range, Face + Body. He said the results were the product of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153doing the things we do really well.

Beighton said there had been inflation in the UK fashion industry, fuelled partly by the drop in the value of the pound, but Asos pulled in shoppers by holding its prices and bringing in lower-priced goods. The strong UK performance combined with a better than expected 28% increase in sales in the EU, partly helped by launching its Premier service, which offers a year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free next-day delivery for under \u00c2\u00a310 in countries including Ireland, Denmark and the Netherlands. Asos said it had increased the number of Premier customers, who are mostly in the UK, by 53% to 1.3 million. Overall the group increased sales by 26% to \u00c2\u00a32.4bn, while pre-tax profits rose 28% to \u00c2\u00a3102m as the company increased US sales by a quarter. Beighton said it was not yet clear how Brexit might affect future trading at the London-based company, which took on about 1,000 new staff last year, including some EU nationals. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have a concern about whatever comes out of Brexit, [and whether it] will affect the flow of talent into London especially,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. But he said that Asos continued to innovate, playing to the trend for gender-neutral dressing with its new Collusion range, which launched earlier this month. The company has also launched Enki, its own voice-search service with Google Assistant. Great styling, plus-size models and easy returns show innovation Asos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s No 1 destination for fashion-loving twentysomethings\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hits the nail on the head when it comes to identifying the source of its success at commerce and content, writes Scarlett Conlon. It currently has curated photo galleries of corduroy suits, heritage blazers and sequins \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all recent catwalk trends that are now being peddled by tastemakers, from fashion publications to Instagram influencers. Remember Generation Z is the postmillennial cohort seduced by immediacy and won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be kept waiting (so the fashion experts say). That Asos is one of the quickest retailers to translate a trend into shoppable product stands squarely to its advantage when targeting this demographic. The same strategy applies to its editorial features that curate the latest inspiring street-style images to hook its users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attention and then offers them the chance to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shop the look\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Not to mention its Insiders Community, a platform where shoppers can buy their favourite Instagram stars\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 outfits using the hashtag #OOTD (outfit of the day). The fact that the fashion is inclusive is key. Asos is known to have one of the widest-ranging sizing in the fashion industry and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shy away from diverse representation. In 2017 its swimwear campaign featured untouched images of models with stretch marks and it cast the plus-sized model Vivian Eyo-Ephraim to model its 2018 line. Asos features rising stars in its ad campaigns and on the cover of its magazine who have something to say, like Jazelle, J Hus, Jorja Smith and Naomi Shimada (and who its customers listen to and follow). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an approach Generation Z demands of brands and Asos has delivered. That the styling is great (its cross-brand selling is spot on), delivery is speedy, and returns are super easy (research says lenient return policies increases purchases and limits returns) seals the deal.",

                "bodyText":"Before we close up for the today, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a look at markets across Europe, where the FTSE continues to outperform: FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,045 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.5% at 11,530 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.9% at 5,073 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.7% at 18,956 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.1% at 8,901 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.3% at 361 While the mood among investors is distinctly subdued, the news this morning that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 6.5% in the third quarter - the slowest rate since the financial crisis - has not prompted a major sell-off. In the UK, figures showed the government borrowed \u00c2\u00a34.1bn in September, less than the \u00c2\u00a34.5bn predicted by economists and \u00c2\u00a3800m than a year earlier. It was the lowest September borrowing figure since 2007, and potentially hands the chancellor more room for budget giveaways on 29 October. The big news this afternoon is that Nick Clegg is joining Facebook as head of global policy and communications. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find all the latest updates on the story here: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. Thank you for all the comments, and have a good weekend. As the shock news of Nick Clegg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Facebook appointment was breaking, the Treasury put out a response to this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lower than expected borrowing numbers. Does it provide any clues to what might be in the budget a week on Monday? If anything it suggests Philip Hammond is not prepared to splash the cash, despite a falling deficit this year. A Treasury spokesperson said: This is the lowest half-year borrowing for 16 years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c showing the strong progress we have made in fixing our public finances. But, at over 85% of GDP last year, our debt remains too high. Our balanced approach is getting debt falling while supporting our vital public services, keeping taxes low and investing in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. Twitter is reacting to the news that Facebook has hired Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader who lost his seat at the 2017 general election: Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newest recruit is none other than Nick Clegg, the former Deputy Prime Minister. According to the FT, he will join the social media giant as head its global affairs and communications team and will move to Silicon Valley in January. It follows months of wooing by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, who told Clegg,51, he would have a leading role in shaping the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy. As Theresa May returns from Brussels with no Brexit deal, to major divisions in her own party and a people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote march on Saturday, big business is also keeping up the pressure. In the latest intervention, the president of Japanese car maker Toyota has said a no-deal Brexit should be avoided \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at all costs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Noting the failure to agree a deal this week, Akio Toyoda said: Apprehension is therefore growing that a withdrawal without agreement may become a reality. It is necessary that an unimpaired trade environment between the United Kingdom and the European Union be maintained and that the automobile industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activities remain predicated on shared standards, including those regulating vehicle certification. Toyota employs about 2,600 people at its manufacturing plant in Derbyshire, and a further 600 in Deeside. Read the full story here: He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the chief executive of a FTSE 100 housebuilder and his huge \u00c2\u00a375m bonus payout - the biggest of any UK listed company - attracted widespread criticism earlier in the year. Yet Jeff Fairburn was lost for words when Spencer Stokes, a BBC journalist for Look North in Yorkshire, asked him about it during an interview. Asked if he has regrets about the furore surrounding his massive payout, Fairburn hesitates, before being interrupted by a press officer who is off camera. As Stokes persists with the line of questioning, Fairburn says: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather not talk about that, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been well covered actually. Are there any lessons to be learned, it was the biggest bonus in the country, Stokes asks. At which point Fairburn walks off camera and says: I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really unfortunate actually that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done that. Watch it here: The latest figures on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances have reinforced expectations that the Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independent forecaster will revise down borrowing for 2018-19. At the time of the Spring Statement in March, the Office for Budget Responsibility was forecasting borrowing to fall to \u00c2\u00a337.1bn from \u00c2\u00a345.2bn in 2017-18. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC: While there could be some catch-up in public spending later in the year, we still expect public borrowing in 2018/19 as a whole to be only around \u00c2\u00a330 billion, which would be around \u00c2\u00a37 billion less than the OBR forecast back in March. However, we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too excited about budget giveaways, Hawksworth adds: This borrowing undershoot should give the chancellor a little extra wiggle room for his budget, but it will not be enough on its own to cover the cost of announced increases in spending on the NHS, let alone other priority areas where there is pressure to bring austerity to an end. The budget is therefore still likely to require some tough choices between net tax rises, higher borrowing in the medium term and allowing austerity to continue in parts of the public sector. The chancellor Philip Hammond may well have a spring in his step this morning, after the latest official figures show government borrowing fell more than expected in September. Borrowing was \u00c2\u00a34.1bn last month, less than the \u00c2\u00a34.5bn predicted by economists and \u00c2\u00a3800m than a year earlier according to the Office for National Statistics. It was the lowest borrowing for the month of September since 2007 - shortly before the financial crisis hit. It means that halfway through the fiscal year, borrowing stands at \u00c2\u00a319.9bn - \u00c2\u00a310.7bn less than in the same period in 2017 and the lowest year-to-date for 16 years. It is the last set of data before Hammond presents his budget on 29 October. With Theresa May already declaring an end to austerity, could this be the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moment to pull a rabbit out of the hat with a surprise spending giveaway? Improvement in the public finances in September was driven by higher VAT and income tax receipts, and national insurance contributions. Not all businesses are reaping the benefits of consumer demand in China. New Look, the value high street fashion retailer, is exiting China, closing all 120 stores with the loss of more than 700 jobs. Corporate results this morning help to put into context slowing growth in China, where swelling middle classes continue to drive demand for luxury goods. The French spirits company, Remy Cointreau, reported stronger-than-expected second quarter sales, helped by robust demand for its premium cognac in China. Sales for the three months to 30 September were \u00e2\u201a\u00ac330m, a like-for like rise of 9.1%. Meanwhile, the Intercontinental Hotels Group said it would pay $500 million to shareholders in a special dividend as it reported a 1% rise in revenue per available room for the third quarter, driven by strong demand in China. Investors across Europe are subdued as the week draws to a close. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mixed picture, with the FTSE outperforming its peers. On the flip side, the FTSE MIB is firmly in the red in Italy, where budget concerns continue to weigh on investor minds and are dragging down banking shares. The latest scores: FTSE 100: 0.3% at 7,047 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: flat at 11,588 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.1% at 5,111 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -1.1% at 18,876 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.5% at 8,847 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: flat at 362 Putting China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures in context, Neil Wilson at markets.com says growth of 6.5% is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a nice problem to have\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Growth of 6.5% rather than 6.6% is a pretty nice problem to have but the trade war with the US, higher debt levels and a depreciating currency remain a concern. Any bounce in Chinese stocks needs to be seen in the context of the three-year collapse in equities. One of the weaker spots in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy was industrial production, with growth slowing to 5.8% year-on-year in September, from 6.1% in August. Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon, says: The slowdown makes sense in the context of the sharp downtrend in the manufacturing PMIs in recent months. The breakdowns available at this stage offer little sign of green shoots. In particular, cement production is falling again, though this could reflect environmental curbs, rather than suggesting that the construction sector is back in the doldrums, after its recent positive contribution. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 6.5% in the third quarter according to official figures published this morning. It was the slowest rate since the depths of the financial crisis in the first quarter of 2009, and slightly below economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts of 6.6% growth. It followed growth of 6.7% in the second quarter, and the slowdown of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy is expected to continue as the effects of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war with the US are increasingly felt. Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, gives his take: Official GDP growth slowed last quarter consistent with broader evidence that the economy is cooling. There are some early signs in the September data that policy support is starting to gain traction, but we think more easing will still be needed in order to stabilise growth. Looking ahead, we doubt the latest pick-up in infrastructure spending will be enough to prevent the economy from cooling further in the coming quarters. Policy easing has yet to reverse the downward trajectory in broad credit growth, a key headwind to the economy, and front-loading by US importers means that the impact of tariffs has yet to be felt. We anticipate a further loosening of both monetary and fiscal policy in the coming months, which should put a floor under growth by about the middle of 2019. Also coming up today, UK public finance figures for September at 9.30am BST will provide insight into how much spending room the chancellor, Philip Hammond, might have ahead of his budget on 29 October. Stay with us for updates on the latest news from business and markets.",

                "bodyText":"With its deserted tables and recycled office furniture, the Ping Pong Parlour in Maidenhead\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling Nicholsons shopping centre is not fooling anyone. The desperate attempt to fill what used to be Argos is evidence of the losing battle fought by private equity investors who have surrendered the keys after the mall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declining fortunes left them unable to meet huge loan repayments. The financial failure of the affluent Berkshire commuter town\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main shopping centre has brought this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high street crisis directly on to the embattled prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doorstep. Theresa May has been Maidenhead\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MP for more than 20 years but rows of empty shops contrast with noisy construction work as new flats populate the town\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revamped waterways, making it hard to tell whether its fortunes are falling or improving. On Thursday, clipboard-wielding market researchers were canvassing shoppers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 views on the squat mall built on the site of the Nicholson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brewery in the 1960s. One middle-aged woman does not sugar-coat the pill, rating the experience \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one out of 10\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shops keep shutting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to disagree, with at least 20 of the centre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 50 large stores empty or being marketed by property agents. The precinct bears the scars of a hiatus that has seen about 30 chains, including Toys R Us, Maplin and House of Fraser, go under this year in a domino run that has affected 2,100 stores and nearly 40,000 jobs. The metal grille over Poundworld remains shut as shoppers flow in to the centre from the weekly fruit and vegetable market on the high street. With all eyes on the Brexit negotiations in Brussels, attention will swing back to the UK in 10 days when the chancellor, Philip Hammond, delivers his budget. The fallout from last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business rates revaluation, which will add another \u00c2\u00a3180m to retailers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bills in April, has been the final straw for some struggling chains. Hammond is now under increasing pressure to make internet retailers share the load. Fashion store Next dealt the Maidenhead centre a blow when it followed Argos out the door. Avid Vogue reader May now has little to choose from locally, apart from H&amp;M (which she attended the opening of two years ago), Topshop or Marks &amp; Spencer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If this shopping centre disappeared, the town centre would die,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says one worried store manager . \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shopping habits have changed; young people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shop in shopping centres, they shop online. Amazon has taken over: why pay to park here when anything bog standard can be ordered online and delivered the next day? This situation is not unique. It is happening everywhere.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When private equity property investor Vixcroft teamed up with a hedge fund to buy Nicholsons for \u00c2\u00a337m in 2015, the centre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selling points included Crossrail and numerous upmarket residential developments on the horizon. The price tag, backed with a \u00c2\u00a326m loan, was less than half the \u00c2\u00a385m paid when it changed hands in 2007. Some property experts fear that Nicholsons, which has been pushed into receivership, is just the tip of an iceberg as hundreds of shopping centre deals brokered in the early part of the decade turn sour. Property asset firm Apam counts at least 175 malls in similar straits as high street names queue up to shut stores or negotiate lower rents. Retailers including Carpetright, Mothercare, House of Fraser and New Look have resorted to company voluntary arrangements \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a form of insolvency \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to close down shops, dramatically reducing the rental income collected by centre owners. Apam executive Simon Cooke says private equity investors did not anticipate the perfect storm created by business rates, weak consumer confidence and the fallout from Brexit: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They came with a five-year plan, in a five-year fund and with five years of debt. They thought they would be able to do a couple of new lettings and sell it on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Business rates have become a lightning rod for angry retail bosses saddled with expensive property portfolios in an internet age. Retailers in parts of the country where there have been property booms have been especially hard hit because rates are calculated as a proportion of a property\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value on 1 April 2015. As a result, Maidenhead\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total rates bill will increase again to \u00c2\u00a357m next year. That is \u00c2\u00a36m more than in 2016, the equivalent of a 12.6% increase, according to real estate advisor, Altus Group. Nicholsons owners, however, cannot blame its woes on business rates because its retailers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bills have been cut by a third \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a result of what Altus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Robert Hayton describes as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seismic shift\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd down in the rents being paid in the centre. Another problem for Nicholsons is that shoppers prefer bigger nearby centres such as Reading\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Oracle. Mary, a volunteer in the Maidenhead Heritage Centre where the attractions include a Spitfire simulator, heads to the upmarket Windsor for her retail therapy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The shops in town have been closing for a number of years,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says of Maidenhead. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of money around here but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to get the facilities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Councils in Kent and Shropshire have resorted to bailing out struggling malls and it remains to been seen who might be prepared to invest in the Maidenhead mall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some of these centres will ultimately be closed down if nothing is done, as the income will fall to below the running cost,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Cooke who suggests long-term partnerships with councils are the answer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not about property investors and banks losing money.

The investment vehicle has poured cash into more than 25 companies, particularly tech startups and champions such as Uber \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Vision Fund is the ride-hailing app\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s single biggest shareholder with a $9bn stake.

                "bodyText":"When Mohammed bin Salman was touring the UK and US earlier this year, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and its de facto ruler \u00e2\u20ac\u201c could have relied almost exclusively on businesses backed by the kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money. Landing in London, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153MBS\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd might have dispensed with his chauffeur-driven car, travelling into the capital by Uber, while his aides finalised his itinerary on smartphones powered with chips designed by Cambridge-based ARM Holdings. After glad-handing bank chiefs in the City, any investment plans they discussed could have been further developed using cloud office app Slack. On the US leg of the journey, perhaps slumming it in an Accor hotel, MBS and his entourage might have dialled up a plate of the Saudi national rice dish, kabsa, from delivery service DoorDash. Later, they could have relaxed by playing computer games partly designed by simulation technology firm Improbable. Every one of these companies is part of the portfolio of Riyadh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which manages the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil wealth. Under the stewardship of the young prince \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he is just 33 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the PIF has adopted a more aggressive investment approach, seeking out eye-catching, forward-looking deals, particularly technology startups. Its aim is to increase the pot from $250bn to $2 trillion in the next 12 years. This strategy is a key part of Vision 2030, a blueprint to reduce Saudi reliance on oil and diversify the economy into sustainable industries with a long-term future. But the plan hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gone smoothly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The idea is that you give the money to the PIF and they invest seriously all over the world, particularly in hi-tech and future-oriented industries,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says David Butter, Middle East and north Africa analyst at Chatham House. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But a sovereign wealth fund is by definition based on surplus revenue and Saudi Arabia has been running deficits because the oil price is weak, so they need to get [the money] from somewhere else.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Butter points out that Riyadh hoped to accelerate its plans by raising $100bn from the flotation of a 5% stake in its giant state oil company, Aramco, an offering since put on hold. But even if funds can be raised elsewhere, the international investment component of the masterplan is at risk, due to the allegations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c denied by the crown prince \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that he ordered the murder and dismemberment of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The keystone of the international strategy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which could now be under threat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has been the kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s provision of nearly half the money in the $93bn Vision Fund managed by Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Softbank. Much of that cash has gone into potential future blue-chips such as Uber, electric car start-up Lucid Motors and General Motors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s driverless car unit, GM Cruise. MBS is close to Softbank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s billionaire chief executive, Masayoshi Son, one of the few business leaders not to have pulled out of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Future Investment Initiative (FII) in Riyadh \u00e2\u20ac\u201c described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Davos in the desert\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in light of the allegations. But the gruesome scandal does appear to have tested even that close relationship. Earlier this month, MBS told Bloomberg that the PIF was ready to pump another $45bn into a second Vision Fund. By the end of last week, Softbank appeared to have cooled on the idea, with its chief operating officer, Marcelo Claure, saying there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no certainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd such a fund was in the offing. An impressive roll-call of business names have been rather less circumspect in putting distance between themselves and MBS. The high-profile pull-outs from the FII include JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jamie Dimon, the head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, Glencore chairman Tony Hayward and many more \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boss, Dara Khosrowshahi, despite the PIF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $3.5bn investment in his company. Separately, Richard Branson has suspended the Gulf state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $1bn investment in his space project, Virgin Galactic. Rarely have so many business leaders been seen running in the same direction, in this case away from Saudi Arabia at speed. All of this deals considerable damage to the public profile of a man who was meant to be the standard-bearer for reform and modernisation. When MBS was in California on his tour, he hired out most of the Four Seasons hotel in Beverly Hills, enjoying lunches with Rupert Murdoch, rubbing shoulders in Silicon Valley with the likes of Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg and schmoozing film stars. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The persona he was trying to put out there was that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of them, these business moguls. It was clear that rubbing shoulders with all of these big names was something he enjoyed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Butter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely a prestige goal and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been explicit about that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Rachel Ziemba, adjunct senior fellow at the Centre for a New American Security thinktank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a desire to be an economic powerhouse and an effort to invest in state-of-the art technologies that they hope to use in Saudi Arabia, but which also put them on the front page of the newspaper.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Even more crucial than prestige are the economic ramifications, and not just when it comes to boosting investment returns from the PIF. Every overseas deal brings with it international connections that contribute towards realising the domestic Vision 2030 plans. These include massive expansion into solar power, cultural and technological development, not to mention the so-called giga-projects, such as the construction of islands in a tourism complex along the Red Sea coast and a futuristic new city, known as Neom, in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far north-west. Achieving these goals requires expertise that the kingdom doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily have, cannot develop quickly and must import instead. A memorandum of understanding signed with the UK after MBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit earlier this year offers some insight into how Riyadh envisages a symbiotic relationship between internal investment and domestic projects. The document was full of mutual praise. The UK recognised \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the substantial potential for Saudi Arabia as a global investment powerhouse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while the Saudis recognised London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unrivalled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd place as a financial centre, a position the capital promptly lost to New York shortly afterwards. But the core of the agreement was for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mutual investment opportunities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd worth $100bn over 10 years, including $30bn in direct investments in the UK from the PIF. In exchange, the UK is to share expertise in clean energy, electric vehicles, financial services, culture and entertainment, healthcare, life sciences and, of course, defence. Any and all of these partnerships are likely to involve businesses which, right now at least, fear Saudi is toxic. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a line between not going to a public event [the FII] and what happens with actual cash placements,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Ziemba. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But for some investors, this is another example of uncertainty around Saudi foreign policy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They may have more challenges attracting inward investment than placing it abroad with companies that usually need the money.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nigel Kushner, chief executive of W Legal and an expert in sanctions, warns that the worst-case scenario for the Saudis is if the US decides to put individuals and businesses on the list of those sanctioned under its Magnitsky Act. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The reality is that business internationally would be closed for anyone on the list,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Kushner. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If they put businesspeople or companies on the list that would have a meaningful impact: it could all be removed overnight if the US were minded to do so.

Amazon was down 6.2% and Netflix 8.4%.</p> <p>There were several factors contributing to the drop, concerns over trade tensions between the US and China and rising interest rates being the most prominent. Tech companies tend to be highly leveraged, so can be vulnerable to rising interest rates. The EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned tax on technology firms is also putting them under pressure.</p> <p>The first to report, on Wednesday, will be Microsoft, releasing first-quarter results.

                "bodyText":"What does the future hold for US tech stocks? The coming weeks will tell, as eight of the most dominant technology companies report results. Microsoft, Alphabet (Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent), Amazon, Snap Inc (Snapchat), Twitter, Facebook, Apple and Spotify are all scheduled to report quarterly results between now and the start of November, with four of them making their announcements on the same day. The results will come after a difficult month for the tech companies. Just over two weeks ago, the worst drop in the Dow Jones average in eight months was led by sharp declines in technology stocks, mirrored on the Nasdaq. That Wednesday, the best-performing stocks over the past year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which include the so-called Faang companies: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u00e2\u20ac\u201c took some of the biggest losses. Amazon was down 6.2% and Netflix 8.4%. There were several factors contributing to the drop, concerns over trade tensions between the US and China and rising interest rates being the most prominent. Tech companies tend to be highly leveraged, so can be vulnerable to rising interest rates. The EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned tax on technology firms is also putting them under pressure. The first to report, on Wednesday, will be Microsoft, releasing first-quarter results. Attention will be focused on whether the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Azure cloud computing service is driving growth. The platform has been used by a number of governments recently. Next up, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Super Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will see Alphabet, Amazon, Snap Inc and Twitter all report on the same day. For Alphabet, analysis from Hargreaves Lansdown highlights the recent \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.3bn fine the EU slapped on Google, but says it expects growth in revenue numbers. Separately, the company has been investing heavily in areas such as self-driving cars and cloud computing. Amazon is expected to have enjoyed strong revenue growth, according to the analysts, with services such as Prime and Alexa making increasing progress, as is the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s web services division. Snap Inc, parent of social media app Snapchat, will also report third-quarter results. Investors saw some light earlier this month when chief executive Evan Spiegel said that he hoped the company would turn a profit next year. Finally for Thursday, Twitter will also make a third-quarter announcement. In July, its shares dropped by more than 20% after it reported a drop of a million users following its action to delete fake and offensive accounts. At the time, the social media platform told investors to expect user numbers to fall further as it took action to block fake accounts. One of the most eagerly anticipated results will be Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s: its third-quarter results will be reported on 30 October. In the summer, the company said that revenue growth would continue to slow in the second half of this year.

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Richard Partington on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market action: Wall Street and European stock markets followed Asian shares lower on Tuesday, as investors around the world took fright at the increasingly fractious global geopolitical outlook. Investors are growing increasingly worried about a cocktail of risks that could act as a significant drag on the world economy. Potential headwinds include the trade dispute between the US and China, rising US interest rates, the fallout from the death of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the budget dispute between the EU and Italy. Oliver Jones, a markets economist at the research firm Capital Economics, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Worries about problems in the US, and to some extent in the past few days China, have proved contagious.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Goodnight! Despite that late revival, the New York stock exchange has closed in the red. But things aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as bad as they looked earlier. The Dow has closed down 126 points, a drop of 0.5%, which means it clawed back most of its early losses. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still plenty of anxiety on the trading floors, following the big losses in Asia and Europe today. The EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refusal to accept Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget led to an unedifying confrontation between European commissioner Pierre Moscovici and an Italian MEP. My colleague Daniel Boffey has the details: Pierre Moscovici, the commissioner for economic and financial affairs, said the commission would hold talks with Rome with an open mind. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The opinion adopted today by the commission should come as no surprise to anyone, as the Italian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s draft budget represents a clear and intentional deviation from the commitments made by Italy last July,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, our door is not closing. We wish to continue our constructive dialogue with the Italian authorities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As Moscovici was leaving the press conference, an MEP for the League party, Angelo Ciocca, grabbed the commissioner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s notes and hit them with his shoe. He later tweeted that he had slammed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with a sole made in Italy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mountain of lies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Moscovici later responded that Ciocca had no respect for his function as a parliamentarian. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clip of the incident: Hello.... The US stock market is continuing to recover from its early lows. The Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now just 0.2% lower, or 60-odd points, having been 400+ down at the start of trading. October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning into a most volatile month in the markets.... Mike O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Rourke, chief Market strategist at JonesTrading, is also concerned by Caterpillar and 3M\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings. He told Marketwatch: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Caterpillar citing rising costs shows that the trade war is hitting home. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrials like Caterpillar that struggle when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at a cyclical top.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in New York, shares are climbing off their lowest points... but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still in the red. The Dow is currently 273 points lower at 25,038, down 1%. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are both 1.2% lower. Caterpillar (-7%) and 3M i(-4.5%) are both dragging the Dow down, following their results and guidance. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says Caterpillar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning of higher costs have shown the perils of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel tariffs and the trade war with China. These figures bring home loud and clear the ramification of the brewing trade war and come at a time when traders are starting to realise that the chances of a US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sino trade deal being achieved are diminishing. This US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sino trade spat is here to stay and that is frightening for the outlook of companies. Costs are increasing and fears that tighter trade conditions will slow global growth is making even the most level-headed trader nervous. When Caterpillar, a bellwether for economic activity starts to struggle, the smart money is seeing that as a signal to sell out of riskier assets. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip stock index has been skittled to its lowest level since March, amid another jittery day in the markets. The FTSE 100 has closed down 87 points, or 1.25%, at 6,955, a seven-month closing low. There are losses across Europe too, as the row between the EC and Rome over its 2019 budget intensifies. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell almost 0.9%, the French CAC lost 1.7% and the DAX shipped 2.1%. Worries over the US-China trade war hurt the markets (following Caterpiller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning of rising prices), while the Khashoggi murder also fuelled geopolitical worries. Brexit isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly helping the mood either, with investor confidence weak and factory orders down (as covered this morning). Day One of the Saudi Future Investment Initiative has been roundly overshadowed by the latest developments in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. One attendee has got in touch with some observations: 1. Apparently there are 3,000 attendees. I was advised that the original number was 3,500, so it seems 500 chose not to turn up. The event is taking place in the massive convention centre alongside the Ritz Carlton. Hotel. 2. Interesting to note that the first comment at the opening was drawing focus on the Kashoggi affair. The speaker articulated the fact that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrible event that happened\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is clearly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not in our Saudi DNA or the way we are. We decry what has happened and also want to thank the attendees that have come to Riyadh for the F.I.I. From abroad - your presence here is welcome and most appreciated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This overt recognition and expression of Saudi contrition and reinforcing the fact that the Saudi government is clearly distancing itself from the events in Istanbul. 3. Very strong police and security presence in place and in view across the city and a clear \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sanitized zone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd established around the venue and certainly pertaining to access into and within the convention venue. 4. It seems, when looking around the vast auditorium that the majority of the audience are Saudis and people from the Middle East. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest on the situation: October has been a bad month for equities, points out Neil Wilson of Markets.com. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153US equity markets turned sharply lower as investors turned chicken to the tune of some very risk-off mood music. However with earnings growth still very strong the valuations may start to look very attractive. US markets opened down around 2%, dipping to three months lows as they followed the selloff in Europe this morning which has shown no signs of abating. It of course early in the US session to make great pronouncements and these prices are moving a lot but the general tone is not good. October is turning out to be another bad one: The S&amp;P500 is on course for worst month since Sep 2011, while Nasdaq set for its worst since 2008, the Dow its shakiest since Aug 2015. The sell-off on Wall Street is accelerating. The Nasdaq is now down 2.5%, meaning it could slide into correction territory. The Dow has been lurching around too, dragged down by Caterpillar (which has tumbled by almost 10% today). Back in the US, motorbike manufacturer Harley-Davidson has reported a slump in sales to American consumers -- just months after Donald Trump pushed for a boycott. Retail sales in the United States fell 13.3% year-on-year in the last quarter, Harley said. Back in August, the US president blasted Harley for saying it would move some production overseas. Harley is being hit hard by the tit-for-tat tariffs imposed between the US and China, and the EU. This is pushing up import costs, and making motorbikes made in America less competitive. Chief Financial Officer John Olin told shareholders that the bill would run to over $40m \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our expectations for the impact of recently enacted tariffs includes incremental costs of approximately $15 million to $20 million for steel and aluminum and approximately $25 million for EU tariffs. Additionally, China increased its tariffs volume on foreign motorcycles produced in the United States by 25 percentage points and the U.S. has increased tariffs on certain products imported from China. We believe this will increase our 2018 cost by approximately $3 million. In total we now expect to incur approximately $43 million to $48 million of increased costs related to the tariffs during 2018.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Italian government has hit back, warning that it will not change its 2019 budget despite the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demand for a rewrite. Prime minister Giuseppe Conte has told Bloomberg that his government could tweak its fiscal plans, but not aim for a smaller deficit. Conte said he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cannot accept\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd dropping some of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending plans, warning that. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any B plan. I said that the deficit at 2.4 percent of GDP is the cap. I can say this will be our cap.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Italy is planning to boost its spending next year to meet the election pledges made by its two coalition partners, the far-right anti-immigrants League party, and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement. Promises such as tax cuts, a universal basic income and pension reforms will cost around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac17bn (\u00c2\u00a315bn). That creates a larger structural deficit, which is the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concern, but Rome argues it will also spur growth. If Italy doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t revise its budget, then the EC could launch an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Excessive Deficit Procedure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd against it. That could result in a large fine, and closer scrutiny of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax and spending plans. That could also worsen relations between the two sides, potentially alarming the markets or fuelling eurosceptic feelings. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici hopes that a compromise can be found.... This is why the EC has a problem with Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tax and spending plans: Newsflash: The European Commission has rejected Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget, and demanded a rewrite. As many analysts had predicted, Brussels has concluded that the Italian tax and spending plans breach EU guidelines. It is now giving Rome three weeks to submit a revised plan, with a smaller deficit for next year. This is the first time the Commission has rejected a member state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget, since being given the power during the eurozone crisis. Commission Vice President for the Euro Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters in Brussels that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today, for the first time, the Commission is obliged to request a euro area country to revise its draft budget plan,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we see no alternative than to request the Italian government to do so. We have adopted an opinion giving Italy a maximum of three weeks to provide a revised Draft Budgetary Plan for 2019. Dombrovskis added that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clarifications\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd submitted by Italy yesterday had not addressed the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Italian Government is openly and consciously going against the commitments it made. Boom! Global stock markets have slumped to their lowest level in over a year. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses in America, Europe and Asia have dragged the MSCI All-Country World Index to levels last seen in September 2017. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, says Caterpillar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results have added to the swirling cocktail of risks pulling shares down today. Caterpillar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third quarter earnings beat forecasts with progress across most end markets. But the tone of the report made clear earnings momentum was not the main story in the quarter. The impression was compounded by 2018 earnings forecasts remaining untouched, for the first time since two straight quarterly upgrades. Technology companies and banks are leading today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off in New York, as October continues to prove a volatile month. Ouch! The New York stock exchange has opened sharply lower. The Dow Jones industrial average fell by 430 points at the start of trading, a drop of 1.7%. That took the index back down to around 24,890 points -- around 2,000 points less than three weeks ago. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a grotty picture; Caterpillar has tanked by over 7%, after warning shareholders today that price pressures are rising, as tariffs take a bite out of profits. The S&amp;P 500 has dropped to its lowest level since July. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the drop in UK factory orders: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some cheerier news, as the Harry Potter phenomenon continues to boost Bloomsbury: A reminder of the big sell-off in Asia overnight: European stock markets are still deep in the red, as traders grimace and anticipate the start of trading in New York. In London, the FTSE 100 is now down 77 points at 6965, a drop of 1.1%, which would be its lowest closing point in seven months. This won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help investor confidence to claw its way back from the lows reported earlier. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stoxx 600 is still languishing at a 22-month low, with Germany down 1.8% and Italy losing 1.1%. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, blames renewed anxiety over China - which triggered the selloff in Asia overnight. Hopes that we may see a Chinese-led recovery have been dashed for the time being. After a strong two-day rally, Chinese stocks fell back sharply overnight [-2.2%]. As a result, the losses for European indices sharply increased at the open this morning while US index futures also fell across the board. Chinese equities, which had been hit the hardest this year, rebounded at the end of last week and start of this in part because of the Chinese government promising to provide more stimulus to stabilize its economy and offset the impact of US tariffs hurting its exports. In addition, there was some speculation that the US and China were going to put aside their trade spat and come to an agreement of some sort at the G20 meeting in Argentina next month, where US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were likely to meet. However, those hopes were dashed when White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow accused China of doing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nothing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to defuse the trade tensions. Marketwatch says Caterpillar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prediction of further rising prices (partly thanks to tariffs) has spooked investors: Though Caterpillar narrowly beat expectations for profit and warnings in the quarter, the outlook for more rising costs spooked investors. Caterpillar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares fell 5.9% in premarket trading on Tuesday. Caterpillar said it would raise prices 1% to 4% world-wide next year on most machines and engines to offset some of the higher costs. Other manufacturers have also said they are passing on higher costs by raising prices. Defence group Lockheed Martin may have bucked the gloom, by posting strong results and hiking its sales forecast for the rest of the year. Increased demand for its F-35 fighter plane helped to drive Lockheed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net sales up to $14.3bn in the last quarter, up from $12.3bn a year earlier. Earnings per share jumped to $5.14, up from $3.32 12 months ago. Lockheed Martin chairman, president and chief executive Marillyn Hewson says: Our team achieved another quarter of strong growth leading us to improve our expectations for our full-year financial results.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hold onto your hats! The Dow is now expected to tumble by 400 points, or more than 1.5%, at the open - partly due to those results from Caterpillar and 3M. In another blow, US conglomerate 3M has also posted underwhelming results. The group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial sales were flat in the last quarter, while healthcare sales fell 2.8%, consumer sales fell 3.4% and electronics and energy dropped by 4.8%. However, total sales grew 7.0 percent in Safety and Graphics. 3M also trimmed its earnings outlook for 2018. Shares have slumped by over 7%. Caterpillar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results also show that consumers are paying the price of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade disputes: NEWSFLASH: Caterpillar, the construction equipment giant, has just reported results -- and Wall Street isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy. Caterpillar has warned that it is facing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153supply chain challenges across the industry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Raw material costs have also jumped, it warns, partly due to increased steel prices and other tariffs introduced since Donald Trump was elected. It says: Manufacturing costs were higher due to increased material and freight costs. Material costs were higher primarily due to increases in steel prices and tariffs. Freight costs were unfavorable primarily due to supply chain inefficiencies as the industry continues to respond to strong global demand. Caterpillar says that recently imposed tariffs cost it around $40m in the last quarter, a concrete sign that the trade war is hurting US companies. On the upside, Caterpillar narrowly beat profit expectations in the last three months. It made $2.88 per share, ahead of forecasts of $2.72, while revenues jumped by 18% year-on-year to $13.5bn. Caterpillar CEO Jim Umpleby says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was the best third-quarter profit per share in our company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history. Our global team continues to do excellent work focusing on our customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 success and executing our strategy for profitable growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares have fallen by over 6% in pre-market trading. In further gloomy news, UK manufacturers have reported the sharp fall in orders since the EU referendum. The CBI, which represents Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bosses, reports that new orders at UK factories fell at the fastest pace in three years in the last quarter. Firms are also more pessimistic about business prospect, particularly about their chances of selling goods abroad. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a sobering set of figures demanding immediate action at home and abroad. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Planned investment is being scaled back in the face of deepening Brexit uncertainty, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vital that the Chancellor incentivises manufacturers to spend in areas that will help them become more productive. Using the upcoming Budget to increase the Annual Investment Allowance, alongside a wider review, could help the UK become more competitive with its global peers. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details from the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial trends report: 10% of firms said they were more optimistic about the general business situation than three months ago and 25% were less optimistic, giving a rounded balance of -16%, the fastest decline since July 2016. Optimism about export prospects for the year ahead deteriorated at the fastest pace since 2012 (-15% down from -2% in July). 27% of firms said the volume of output over the past three months was up and 14% said it was down, giving a balance of +13%, up from +11% in the quarter to September. 21% of businesses reported an increase in new orders, and 28% reported a decrease, giving a rounded balance of -6%, the weakest balance since October 2015. Domestic orders (-10%) and export orders both fell (-8%), a weaker reading than in the previous quarter (+8% and +21% respectively). No wonder the FTSE 100 is falling. UK investor morale has hit its lowest level in at least 23 years, according to financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown. Its Investor Confidence Index has fallen to 53 this month, from 58 in October - its lowest level since it began in 1993. It has averaged 92 over the last decade, but just 69 over the last 12 months. Brexit is the top issue worrying investors, while wider global instability is another concern pushing the index down: If this index is right, it means the City is more downbeat than during the 2008 financial crisis. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says the constant drip-feed of Brexit news has drenched investors in gloom: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcInvestors are in grim mood, as time is running out on Brexit negotiations with little progress on show. Sentiment was dented by the financial crisis, but not to the extent we are seeing today. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perhaps because the crisis unfolded in an unscheduled fashion, while the timeline on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU is there for all to see. A looming early Budget and a stormy October on the markets will do little to settle nerves. These are challenging times for investors who are faced with a significant known unknown in the form of Brexit. In such circumstances, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth falling back on the basics of investing. That means taking a long term perspective, keeping diversified, and drip feeding money into the markets to take advantage of any dips.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Over in Ankara, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president has told its parliament that the murder of Jamal Khashoggi was a premeditated and meticulously planned political assassination. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an vowed to pursue the investigation into Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death, calling on Riyadh to hand over those responsible. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a link to our liveblog. Importantly, Erdo\u00c4\u0178an appeared to absolve the Saudi leader while not mentioning crown prince Mohammad Bin Salman, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I do not doubt the sincerity of King Salman. That being said, independent investigation needs to be carried out. This is a political killing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Erdo\u00c4\u0178an did not release any significant new details about the killing. So the Saudi stock market has shaken off its early slump, and is now up on the day. Here are the best and worst performers on the FTSE 100 today, as the index wallows at a seven-month low. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has slid to a new seven-month low, as world stock markets extend today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. The Footsie is now down 82 points at 6,959, its lowest level since the end of March this year. The smaller FTSE 250, which contains medium-sized companies, has slumped by 1.8% or 350 points.. The slump is being led by technology stocks, miners, energy firms and industrial companies. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx blames a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153poisonous brewing cauldron of geopolitical and economic issues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [which sounds even scarier than this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthick blanket of risk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122] Ingredients bobbing in the cauldron include.... The unresolved US-China trade war (and fears about the latter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy), the US withdrawal from the INF Treaty, the Khasohoggi-related friction between the West and Saudi Arabia, Brexit (all of it, but specifically the rising chances of a no deal divorce), and, perhaps most pertinent to Tuesday, the ongoing EU-Italy budget dispute. A calamitous cavalcade of market concerns, of such seriousness that it is a surprise the global indices ever manage to edge into the green. The futures market is indicating a bad start on Wall Street later today. The Dow is now expected to drop by over 1%. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology company Dyson has decided to build its first electric car in Singapore. The company has chosen Singapore over the UK, as it prepares to get the vehicle on the road in 2021. The electric car is being designed and tested at Hullavington Airfield in Wiltshire, in western England, but will be manufactured almost 7,000 miles away. Dyson says it chose Singapore due to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153international nature\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of its operations. It already employs around 1,100 people in Singapore, where it makes electric motors. Jim Rowan, CEO of Dyson says: Our existing footprint and team in Singapore, combined with the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significant advanced manufacturing expertise, made it a frontrunner. Singapore also offers access to high-growth markets as well as an extensive supply chain and a highly skilled workforce. Singapore has a comparatively high cost base, but also great technology expertise and focus. It is therefore the right place to make high quality technology loaded machines, and the right place to make our electric vehicle. Fifteen years ago, Dyson was criticised for moving washing machines production from Wiltshire to Malaysia. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision feels like another blow to UK manufacturing. Dyson, though, points out that its total UK headcount has increased by 2.5 times over the last five years to 4,800. It is currently spending \u00c2\u00a3200m on new buildings and testing facilities at Hullavington. In a letter to staff, Rowan says: Dyson is truly global in its development, delivery and realisation of technology. This decision is good news for the exceptional teams we have in both the UK and Singapore. Saudi Arabia still expects to sign tens of billions of dollar of deals at its investment conference, despite those high-profile withdrawals following Jamal Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death. Reuters explains: Saudi Arabia brushed off an outcry over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and went ahead on Tuesday with an investment conference boycotted by Western political figures, leading international bankers and company executives. Speaking at the opening session, prominent Saudi businesswoman Lubna Olayan said the killing of the Washington Post columnist was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153alien to our culture\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and voiced confidence that the kingdom will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153emerge stronger\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Saudi Arabia, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest oil exporter, is expected to sign deals worth more than $50 billion in the oil, gas, industries and infrastructure sectors on the opening day with companies including Trafigura, Total, Hyundai, Norinco, Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes. Hundreds of bankers and company executives joined officials at a palatial Riyadh hotel for the Future Investment Initiative, an annual event designed to help attract billions of dollars of foreign capital as part of reforms to end Saudi dependence on oil exports. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re live-blogging president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Jamal Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death, here: WSJ reporter Rory Jones says the Saudi investment conference is underway - despite scores of big names pulling out. My colleague Rob Davies points out that a string of big names have resisted the chance to mix with crown prince MbS: The high-profile pull-outs from the FII include JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jamie Dimon, the head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, Glencore chairman Tony Hayward and many more \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boss, Dara Khosrowshahi, despite the PIF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $3.5bn investment in his company. Separately, Richard Branson has suspended the Gulf state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $1bn investment in his space project, Virgin Galactic. Rarely have so many business leaders been seen running in the same direction, in this case away from Saudi Arabia at speed. All of this deals considerable damage to the public profile of a man who was meant to be the standard-bearer for reform and modernisation. When MBS was in California on his tour, he hired out most of the Four Seasons hotel in Beverly Hills, enjoying lunches with Rupert Murdoch, rubbing shoulders in Silicon Valley with the likes of Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg and schmoozing film stars. Plenty of other executives have shown up, though: In another blow to Saudi Arabia, Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son has abandoned plans to speak at its Future Investment Initiative (FII), which started today. Michael Amon of the Wall Street Journal reports that Son may still be present, but he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be on the stage. Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has also dropped in early trading, down 1.2%. Traders will be worrying about Riyadh growing isolation following Jamal Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s murder, and the prospect of Turkey releasing the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153naked truth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the killing later today. Yesterday Donald Trump said he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy with the response from Saudi Arabia, telling reporters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am not satisfied with what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to get to the bottom of it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury secretary, Stephen Mnuchin, has cancelled his appearance at Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment conference - but he did met with crown prince Mohammed bin Salman yesterday. MBS - who had billed himself as a social and economic reformer - had built close ties with Washington, particularly with Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Now, though, he facing intense pressure over the Khashoggi case, with many analysts concluding that he authorised the killing. Several of his close aides have been arrested or dismissed. Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman, Tony Sayegh, has tweeted about the meeting: Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets points out that the US stock market fell yesterday, helping to trigger today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses in Asia and now Europe. The negative opens come after Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally cooled, retracing Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jump amid fresh fears about global trade, geopolitical tensions and the US midterm elections. Wall Street added to downbeat sentiment with banks and financials leading the slide as worries mount over the strength of earnings from the remainder of corporates set to report. Boom! As feared, European stock markets have slumped to their lowest point in almost two years. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX dropped 1.35% in early trading, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX both lost 1%, and Italy has shed 0.8%. This has hauled the Euro Stoxx 600 index down to its lowest point since December 2016. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets fears it will be a tough day, possibly dominated by worries about Italy. Geopolitical tensions, Italian budget woes and the ongoing standoff between the European Commission and Italy are making investors nervous. Given that there is no solution about the trade war between the US and China stand is making things a bit more arduous today. We need to have a solution to the Italian budget. Investors are going to keep a close eye on the European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision today about the Italian budget. The commission may end up doing something which is unprecedented- it may ask Italy to revise and resubmit its budget. It is widely expected that the commission is going to have a negative opinion about the budget, but the question is if Italy will be ready to comply with the request? The Italian banking sector could be the primary trade here because if the Italian bond spread touched the 400 basis points, it is going to create a lot of trouble for the sector. The bond spread has already touched a five-year high of 341 basis points on Friday. Ouch. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip stock index has fallen close to an eight-month low at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 is down 51 points, or 0.8%, at 6991, close to its lowest level since April Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff has pushed stocks across Asia to the brink of a bear market (more than 20 percent off their recent highs. MSCI Asia Pacific Index has dropped to its lowest since May 2017, with losses across the region. Bloomberg has the details: Among the steepest decreases were in Japan, Hong Kong and China, where shares had had the biggest jump in more than two years Monday. Global equities as measured by the MSCI World Index face their worst month since August 2015. S&amp;P 500 Index futures declined 1% and Euro Stoxx 50 contracts opened more than 1% lower, indicating the rout will spread to U.S. and European markets. The yen gained and gold ticked higher. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Pessimism is gripping the global markets this morning, as investors fret about a clutch of economic and geopolitical issues. The budget row between Italy and the EU, Brexit, the brutal killing of Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi, and America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces nuclear treaty with Russia are all creating angst on the trading floors today. The lack of progress in the US-China trade dispute isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helping either. Asian markets have already been hit, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Topix index sliding by 2.6% and Hong Kong losing 3%. China, which surged by over 4% yesterday on hopes of a government stimulus, has handed back half those gains today. Markets remain shrouded in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a thick blanket of risk today\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as investors fear shares could take a tumble, says Stephen Innes, head of Asia-Pacific trading for foreign exchange firm OANDA. The US dollar outperformed on Monday on the back of Italy and Brexit risk while the mere utterance of a protracted equity correction remains a highly sensitive topic that investors fear could morph from a wall of worry into a towering wall of pain. Risk aversion continues to permeate every pocket of the markets whether triggered by President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest tweets on immigration or the blustery headwinds from Riyadh to Rome; markets remain shrouded in a thick blanket of risk. European market are expected to take a jolt when trading begins shortly. Traders will be watching to see if Brussels orders Rome to rewrite its 2019 budget, which currently contains a deficit target of 2.4% of GDP. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is due to release more details about Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death in the Saudi consulate at Istanbul, in a speech later today. With international condemnation mounting, Saudi have now called the killing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tremendous mistake\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and launched an investigation.

However, the global economy is still growing and corporate earnings are still positive. They may not grow as fast or be as positive from here on out, but these are still reasons to favour risk assets and equities.</p> <p>Markets are likely to remain jittery for the rest of the year. The upcoming G20 meeting is not likely to result in a resolution of the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. Both sides are caught in a case of political brinkmanship.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5bd16d42e4b05b9fcceaff77\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-10-25T07:26:36.657Z\">8.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>There are heavy losses in Europe too.</strong></p> <p>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX index has fallen by 0.8%, to its lowest level since December 2016.</p> <p>France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC hit its lowest level since March 2017, down another 0.4% in early trading.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5bd16f97e4b0521246c58e0d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-10-25T07:25:28.648Z\">8.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the best and worst performing shares on the FTSE 100 this morning.

                "bodyText":"Alphabet also missed Wall Street forecasts. The company behind Google posted revenue of $33.74bn in the last quarter, missing estimates of $34.05 billion. Still, Alphabet also reported net profit of $9.19 billion, or $13.06 per share, up from $9.57 per share a year ago. eMarketer analyst Monica Peart says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing a larger than expected slowdown in Google properties\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 revenue, representing its core search business. This is likely related to the ramp-up in competition from Amazon, as consumers increasingly turn to the ecommerce giant for their product searches.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight! GW Amazon has taken a bite out of Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new-found optimism tonight, by missing analyst expectations: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Amazon.com Inc. reported sales that missed analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 estimates, and issued a disappointing revenue forecast for the busy holiday quarter, suggesting the online marketplace may be reaching a saturation point in the U.S. Revenue gained 29 percent to $56.6 billion in the third quarter, the e-commerce giant said Thursday in a statement. Analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 projected $57.1 billion. Sales will be from $66.5 billion to $72.5 billion in the current period, falling short of analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 average estimate of $73.8 billion. Shares declined as much as 6.5 percent in extended trading. Ut-oh... Amazon and Alphabet have just released results as the echo of the closing bell fade. And Wall Street is NOT happy..... Intel has smashed earnings forecasts, though: Breaking: After Wipeout Wednesday, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Turnaround Thursday. October has maintained its run of wild swings tonight, as Wall Street bounces back. The Dow Jones industrial average has closed 401 points higher, a gain of 1.6%, at 24,984. Technology, industrials companies and banks led the rally. Microsoft closed 6% higher, while Intel gained 4.8%. With tech stocks romping ahead, the Nasdaq has posted its biggest one-day jump in seven months. The Nasdaq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery is even punchier than the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The tech-focused index has leapt by 3%, with just a few minutes to go. Tesla, Twitter and Microsoft have all done their bit, with forecast-beating results in the last 24 hours. The rebound has legs! With just 30 minutes to go, the Dow is up an impressive 490 points, or 2%, at 25,073. That means its recovered a large chunk of the Wednesday wobble. Traders in New York must be dizzy! The Dow is holding onto its gains. With two hours to go, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 380 points at 24,963, up 1.5%. Microsoft is leading the charge, up 5.7% after impressive results last night. Intel (+5%) and VISA (+3.45%) are close behind. The ongoing market turbulence hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deterred US company Yeti from floating on the stock market today. Yeti makes high end coolers and outdoor gear, popular with outdoor types like hunters and surfers, and pitmasters who spend time tending barbecues (important work!). Their kit isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cheap. The Tundra 125 cooler retails at $549 -- for that, you get enough space for 73 cans or dozens of hot dogs, hamburger patties and cold cuts. Yeti floated at $18 per share -- so far, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve slipped by 7% to $16.80. Not a great start - still, a yeti makes a change from all those Wall Street bears. After tumbling in early trading, European stock markets have recovered to end the day higher. In London, the FTSE 100 has climbed back over the 7,000 point mark, ending up 41 points at 7,004. It would be higher, but for WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB had a good day, gaining 1.8% after Mario Dragji said he was confident that the deadlock over Rome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget plans would be resolved. The French CAC gained 1.6%, and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX rose 1%, as traders welcomed the rally in New York. On Wall Street, the Dow is now up 350 points - trying to put Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shocker behind it. Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble into a bear market overnight is still a concern, though, as market volatility remains high. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses could be a buying opportunity...... Wall Street started on the front foot with tech stocks on the rise after falling sharply in the previous session. Upbeat results from Microsoft and Telsa have gone some way to calming investor nerves after disappointments from Caterpillar and 3M earlier in the week. Whilst a slew of risk factors have hit traders confidence hard this month, investors will be looking searching for the bottom of this recent shake out. So far market shake out\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this year have been buying opportunities and whilst we are still in a bull market, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see why this one should be any different right now. Neil MacKinnon, Global Macro Strategist at VTB Capital, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council meeting came at a tricky time for the ECB. The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to hold current interest rate levels at 0% takes place at a time of a cyclical slowdown in the Eurozone economies, as well as persistently subdued core CPI inflation. Business growth is at its slowest in two years and companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of future growth have slipped to the lowest in four years. The Italian budget drama is also high on the agenda and the stand-off between Rome and Brussels is unlikely to be resolved. Also noteworthy is the risk of a worsening \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdoom-loop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 between Italian banks and their holdings of domestic sovereign debt. Italy is not Greece and Rome will react badly if the ECB resorts to its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcenforcement tools\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of closing down bond purchases and turning off the liquidity tap for the Italian banking system.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some expert reaction to the European Central Bank press conference today: Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference Draghi chose to strike a relatively hawkish note, while acknowledging somewhat weaker economic momentum as of late. There has been some concern in the market about a number of disappointing data prints this month, including the flash PMIs yesterday, but evidence so far has not been strong enough to change the ECB stance. Anthony Kurukgy, Senior Sales Trader at Foenix Partners Mario Draghi stuck to the script again at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB Press Conference, delivering yet another \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbalanced\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment of the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. The ECB President quelled recent concerns of weaker economic data as merely a slowdown of growth momentum, not a downturn. This aside, the ECB remain committed to ending the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond-buying programme come December. Transitory or not, Draghi and Co. will need to buy themselves more time to distinguish what effect trade wars, Brexit and the recent Italian budget crisis will have on its interest rate hike timeline in 2019. Silvia Dall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Angelo, Senior Economist, Hermes Investment Management The bottom line is that the ECB is on a gradual path of monetary policy normalisation for now, but risks from protectionism, a further slowdown in external demand, domestic political instability, Brexit and volatility in financial markets cast a dark shadow on the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans. Policy uncertainty has increased both externally and domestically: international trade tensions have remained high, there is no solution for the Brexit issue in sight, and the Italian government seems determined to defy the European fiscal rules. The recent turmoil in financial markets is a new addition to the list of downside risks. Marina Mensah-Afoakwah, Senior Economist at the CEBR Between Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget drama and the precarious nature of Brexit, there is a lot that threatens the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stability. For the time being these pressures haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t risen to a level requiring ECB intervention. Time will tell however, as latest figures suggest cracks are beginning to show in the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bounceback on Wall Street means some investors may be snaffling up bargains. Or at least, what they hope are bargains. CNBC explains why traders may be putting their toes into the water again: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The technical picture has turned increasingly bearish this month,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The percentage of S&amp;P 500 companies trading above their 200-day moving averages was down to 37% after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debacle.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He noted, however, that prior similar declines during this bull market have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153marked buying opportunities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yardeni added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If this is still a bull market, as we believe it is, then the latest bearish technicals and October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s swoon should mark the latest buying opportunity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in the markets, shares are rising in New York as traders return to the fray after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alarming late sell-off. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 192 points at the open, or 0.8%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an encouraging start, after Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 608-point slide. The Nasdaq is also recovering, after slumping ingloriously into a correction yesterday, in its worst day since 2011. The strong results from Twitter today, plus Microsoft and Tesla yesterday, may be calming nerves. Tesla has surged by over 8% in early trading, with other carmakers also up (Ford has gained almost 6%). Twitter has leapt by 15%, after beating profit and revenue forecasts today. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early days. Investors will be watching nervously to see if Wall Street can hold onto these gains, or be dragged down again. Mario Draghi warns that there could be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcuneasiness\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the financial markets, unless Britain and the EU make progress towards a Brexit deal. Asked about Brexit at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference, the ECB president says he is confident that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good, common sense solution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will be found. But he also warns that time is running out - if a deal isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reached, banks and other businesses will be forced to trigger their contingency plans. As Draghi puts it: If this lack of a solution continues, and approaches the end date, the the private sector itself will have to prepare on the assumption that it will be a hard Brexit. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where there will be financial uneasiness in markets. Boom! Mario Draghi has admonished politicians, such as Donald Trump, who put pressure on central banks to change their policy. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been asked the pressure on the European Central Bank and the Fed to maintain their stimulus programmes, or do more. Draghi tells reporters in Frankfurt that these attacks threaten central bank independence. He says: Central bank independence is a precious thing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s precious because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s essential for the credibility of the central banks, and credibility is essential for effectiveness. That means giving central banks the independence to deliver their mandates, and to choose which instruments are most effective. If that is eroded, then a central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effectiveness is reduced, he warns. Earlier this week, Trump blasted the Fed for being too keen to raise interest rates, accusing it of threatening the US economy. In Europe, the ECB has faced criticism from Germany, for example, over its stimulus programme and record low interest rates. Draghi suggests that politicians should see the big picture: Actually the legislators themselves, who are often the very same people who are arguing for the central bank to do this or that, should be the first ones to care about monetary policy effectiveness and central banks achieving their goals. Q: What options do you have if the financial markets continue to fall, if economic data worsens, or if relations between Italy and the EC deteriorate further? We still have tools in the toolbox, Draghi replies. He reveals that two speakers at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Governing Council meeting mentioned its TLTRO programme -- which provides cheap financing to eurozone banks. Mario Draghi is fending off several questions about Italy, and whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worried about the rise in its bond yields. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arguing that the spillover impact from Italy onto other countries is limited so far. Q: Are you worried that the spread between Italian and German bonds could continue to widen, perhaps to 400 basis points? Would that cause impairments to Italian banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 balance sheets? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a crystal ball, Draghi snaps back briskly. But yes, there is a linkage betweem Italian sovereign debt and its banks (which hold a lot of it). If they lose value, they are denting into the capital position of the banks. Mario Draghi adds that he is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconfident\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that an agreement between Italy and the European Commission over its budget will be found . [reminder, the EC rejected Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans on Tuesday, but Rome is refusing to rewrite them] Q: What does the ECB think about the clash between Rome and Brussels over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget? Italy is a fiscal discussion, Draghi replies, so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discussed much at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Onto questions.. Q) Did the ECB discuss downgrading their assessment of the eurozone economy today? Mario Draghi speaks at some length, explaining that the governing council agreed that economic momentum has weakened, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not facing a downturn. Various \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcidiosyncratic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reasons are to blame - such as the slowdown in Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car sector as manufacturers get to grips with new emission rules. There are also a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbunch of uncertainties\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, such as the stalemate between the US and China over trade, Brexit, and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget. Plus, Draghi adds, growth is returning to potential when it was clearly above potential in 2017. These risks are not considered enough to merit changing our balance of risks, he insists firmly. Draghi ends his statement with his traditional call for eurozone government to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsubstantially step up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 their structural reforms, to take advantage of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus measures. Eurozone states must raise their long-term growth potential, he adds. Over in Frankfurt, ECB president Mario Draghi is explaining today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision. He has singled out protectionism, emerging market vulnerabilities and financial market volatility as important risks to the eurozone recovery. However, overall risks are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbroadly balanced\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, he says. On inflation, the ECB thinks domestic cost pressures are strengthening and broadening, as wage increases feed through to prices. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on those durable goods figures: Newsflash: Orders for durable goods at American firms has fallen for the second month running (if you strip out aircraft and defence sales). Core durable goods orders shrank by 0.1% last month, new data shows, following a 0.2% decline in August. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a small move, of course, but it suggests US manufacturing isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sizzling. Perhaps tariffs are having an effect. Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings beat is going to help drive Wall Street up again, after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late rout. The tech-focused Nasdaq is now forecast to jump by 1.7% when trading begins. The Dow is on track to gain 220 points (or more than a third of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump). Electric carmaker Tesla is also likely to surge, after surprising investors with a return to profitability last night. Microsoft also beat forecasts last night, partly thanks to strong growth at its Azure cloud computing division. Twitter isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only company beating forecasts today. Comcast, which recently won the battle for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sky News, has also impressed investors. Net income jumped by 9% in the last three months, as it attracted more broadband customers. NEWSFLASH: The European Central Bank has (to no-one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise) left eurozone interest rates at their current record lows. That means the headline borrowing rate remains at zero, while banks face a negative interest rate of -0.4% on their deposits at the ECB (to encourage them to lend the money instead). It also makes three important points: The ECB is still \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcanticipating\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 it will end its bond-buying programme in December, after buying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn of securities each month until the end of the year. The ECB reiterated that it expects to leave rates on hold until at least the summer of 2019, to ensure that inflation returns sustainably to its target of just below 2%. It also restated its plan to reinvest the proceeds of bonds bought under its QE stimulus programme. That would avoid the risk of tightening monetary policy too quickly, even if the ECB has stopped printing any more electronic money. Dr Ben Marder, Senior Lecturer in Marketing at University of Edinburgh Business School, is concerned that Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s active user base is shrinking. He thinks that the site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fake News problem is hurting: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald Trump, no matter your opinion of the man, is Twitter gold. His tweets attract vast swathes of traffic to the site and he has no doubt had a positive effect on Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock price in the past few years. This was a mutually beneficial relationship as Twitter was pivotal for Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2016 presidential election success. However, despite Twitter posting higher than expected earnings and revenue in Q3 2018, monthly active users have fallen for a second quarter in a row as the company continues to purge bots and fake accounts. It seems Trump is now biting the hand that used to feed him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Twitter, much like other social media giants are starting to bleed-out from the large thorn in their side which is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Worsening the wound are world-wide governments, including the US who are threatening regulatory action against the tech giants for facilitating the dissemination of fake news. Adding to the many great ironies for Trump, he is largely rumoured to be a not so secret proponent of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Par exemple..... Twitter is benefitting from a surge in advertising deals, explains Anthony Capano, managing director of Europe for Rakuten Marketing: While Twitter focused its efforts earlier this year on cleaning the platform of fraudulent actors, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that the focus has returned to investing in global opportunities for advertisers. Earlier in Q3 the platform revealed a host of content partnerships including Bloomberg, Sony Music and NBCUniversal that would bring hundreds of hours of livestreams and other videos to the platform in the Asia-Pacific region. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important UK marketers see how relevant these opportunities are to their operation. In Britain alone, as many as 35% of our client transactions are now taking place overseas. Some Silicon Valley early risers are waking up to the news that Twitter did better than expected last quarter: Newsflash: Twitter has smashed Wall Street forecasts with its latest financial results. The social network site grew its earnings to 21 cents per share in the last quarter, well ahead of estimates of 14 cents. Revenues came in at $758, beating forecasts of $702m, thanks to a 29% leap in advertising sales. However, Twitter also revealed that the number of monthly active users fell to 326 million; analysts expected 331.5 million. That may be due to Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to eradicate trolls, and malicious accounts created to pump out fake news and influence elections. Twitter also warned that it expects to keep losing active users in the current quarter. Shares are soaring in pre-market trading, as investors cheer the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings growth. 2018 has been a pretty rough year for the markets, with nearly $7 trillion (!) wiped off stock values since the end of January. So, the 42 trillion dollar question is whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re heading towards a proper, old-fashioned crash... or if these lower prices actually give value. Neil Wilson of Markets.com suggests the long-running bull market hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run out of steam yet. Stocks could rally if the Federal Reserve decides to slow the pace of future interest rate rises - as Donald Trump has been demanding. Wilson writes: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a period of pressure building to the downside as we get more down days than up and the breadth of the decline is important as is the volume. However whilst the recent spike in volatility may be seen as meaning we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re past the peak, there may yet be a few breaths left in this old bull. Valuations - while not going for a song - are a lot more attractive at about 16x forward earnings. Confidence is clearly lacking however and it may require a softening tone from the Fed to assuage concerns on rates. Softer inflation figures would help greatly and the autumn/winter may provide respite on that front. If we go back a couple of weeks we must recall that this selling started on some very hawkish jawboning by Jerome Powell on rates. This may be the start of the age of the Bears but it may equally be just a tantrum. The macro outlook is not great - China, trade, Italy are all weights but for most of 2018 US investors were able to shrug off any global worries. Advertising giant WPP is having a torrid day, as its new boss gets to grips with the business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems. Shares are down 16%, at their lowest level since December 2012, after it missed sales forecasts and slashed its guidance. CEO Mark Read, who replaced industry veteran Sir Martin Sorrell earlier this year, was blunt about WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems, saying: Clearly we have underperformed our competition in the third quarter. We are not going to sugarcoat the reality.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Facebook has been buffeted by the stock market sell-off. Its shares slid by 5% yesterday, and are down 17% this year as the social network giant faces tough questions about extremism and election interference. In another blow, it has just been fined half a million pounds by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s information commissioner for not protecting users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data. This follows the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which exposed how third party developers had been allowed to access user information without sufficient consent. In monetary terms, \u00c2\u00a3500k is barely a mosquito bite on a mammoth company worth $421bn. But it comes with a stern rebuke from information commissioner Elizabeth Denham, who says: Facebook failed to sufficiently protect the privacy of its users before, during and after the unlawful processing of this data. A company of its size and expertise should have known better and it should have done better. After that shaky start, European stocks have now turn positive for the day! Germany, France and Italy have all rebounded from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows, with Italian banks are leading the rally. Even the FTSE 100 is getting a boost, clawing its way back from that seven-month low. One factor - Wall Street is currently expected to rally in a few hours. The Dow futures show a gain of 224 points, following Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 608-point rout. Another factor: One of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition leaders has vowed to step in if a bank or other company needs help. Deputy PM Matteo Salvini, who also leads the right-wing Northern League party, said any help provided would be different from past interventions. Salvini also suggested that investors are too pessimistic about Italy, having driven its bond yields higher in recent weeks. Reuters has more details: Salvini, who is also the leader of the ruling League party, said on the sidelines of a conference in the northern city of Verona that the Italy/Germany bond yield spread would inevitably fall if it followed the real economy. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says investors are nervous about the state of the world. He explains: The chief concerns are the potential negative impacts of higher interest rates, weaker global growth and the knock-on effects of trade tariffs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The FTSE 100 fell 0.7% in early trading on Thursday to 6,912 with pharmaceuticals, insurers and oil companies the biggest contributors to the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei index incurred heavy losses, falling 3.7% in a single session.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in Australia, insurance group AMP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares crashed by 25% today, as it paid the price for past misdeeds. AMP shocked investors by revealing that its wealth management business suffered a $1.5bn asset withdrawal in the last quarter. The company suffered badly from Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Royal Commission into banking, earlier this year. That inquiry exposed that AMB had charge customers who had died, and imposed fees even if it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide a services. More here: Our latest Brexit dashboard shows how consumer spending slowed last month, even before the stock market turmoil hit confidence. Two leading economists argue that the government needs to take bold action, by ending austerity and helping businesses navigate Brexit uncertainty: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubled retail sector is reeling from another blow this morning, as Debenhams outlines plans to shut up to 50 stores. The closure plan puts thousands of jobs at risk, on top of tens of thousands of redundancies at fellow chains such as Toys R Us, Mothercare, Carpetright and Maplin. Debenhams dropped the bad news as it reported a \u00c2\u00a3500m annual loss, partly due the cost of writing off unwanted shop leases and IT systems. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an astonishing amount, for a company only valued at \u00c2\u00a3100m. The closures will take place over the next three to five years, Debs says, as it pulls out of unprofitable stores. Simon Underwood, business recovery partner at accountancy firm Menzies LLP, warns that the days of the traditional department store are numbered. Instead, they will become \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexperimental showrooms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, or places for meetings etc. Underwood adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decision to focus on a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprofitable core\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of stores is a good one. However, the question is whether closing just ten stores now, with a view to reducing store numbers further over the next three to five years will be enough in view of the speed of changes in the marketplace as consumers shift to buying online. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The high street needs support, but some of the ideas being mooted by Government could prove counterproductive. For example, the Chairman of John Lewis, Sir Charlie Mayfield has recently spoken out against the Amazon tax and many bricks and mortar retailers fear that a blanket levy on online sales would be tantamount to hitting the high street when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down, as most of them sell goods online too. German firms are also anxious about the danger that Britain leaves the EU without a deal, says IFO. The row between Italy and the EU over its 2019 budget is another worry, it adds. Just in: business morale in Germany has taken a tumble this month. The German business climate index produced by the IFO institute dropped to 102.8 this month, down from 103.7 in September. Company bosses said business conditions had deteriorated, while their expectations also become gloomier. Geopolitical tensions, such as the trade wars between the US and China, seem to be hurting. Ifo chief Clemens Fuest blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglobal uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the drop in confidence, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Firms were less satisfied with their current business situation and less optimistic about the months ahead. Growing global uncertainty is increasingly taking its toll on the German economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Worryingly, there doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be a single cause for the current sell-off (unlike in 2008, say, or in 2015 when investors fretted about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy). Instead, a cocktail of problems are being blamed, as traders worry that the long bull market in shares may be petering out. Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, says the lack of a single cause for the current volatility is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153troubling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There are many symptoms but no one can diagnose the illness. Geopolitics, rising bond U.S. bond yields, a more hawkish looking U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed), slowing Chinese growth, a strong U.S. dollar and the already well known problems in some emerging economies have all contributed to the market unease. The focus for investors had been on corporate earnings. Against all the macro headwinds, the micro factor of strong U.S. corporate earnings had been enough to insulate the market. So far the U.S. earnings season has been decent, with approximately 30% of the S&amp;P 500 companies by market capitalization having reported and 83% of those having beaten analyst\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations for earnings. The anxiety now in markets stems from whether this is the peak in earnings and growth, as higher input costs from rising wages, the impact of tariffs and higher funding costs start to impinge on corporate margins. The problems in the U.S. market are having knock-on effects on global equities, and the rising U.S. dollar is exacerbating difficulties for emerging markets and Asia. However, the global economy is still growing and corporate earnings are still positive. They may not grow as fast or be as positive from here on out, but these are still reasons to favour risk assets and equities. Markets are likely to remain jittery for the rest of the year. The upcoming G20 meeting is not likely to result in a resolution of the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. Both sides are caught in a case of political brinkmanship. There are heavy losses in Europe too. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX index has fallen by 0.8%, to its lowest level since December 2016. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC hit its lowest level since March 2017, down another 0.4% in early trading. Here are the best and worst performing shares on the FTSE 100 this morning. Utilities, precious metal miners, and other defensive stocks are in - most other companies are out! Boom! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has hit a seven-month low at the start of trading in London. The blue-chip index has fallen by 75 points to 6887, a drop of over 1%, its lowest level since late March. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now lost around 8% of its value in the last four weeks, as the market sell-off has gathered pace. Advertising giant WPP are leading the selloff, slumping by 18% after reporting that revenues 1.5% fell in the last quarter. Consumer goods producers, technology companies, miners and energy firms are also in the red, as Europe picks up the sell-off baton from Asia. Some context: Stephen Innis of foreign exchange firm OANDA fears that the US stock markets are on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153verge of crumbling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, after last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late rout. If people are struggling to find a driver I suggest, they wake up and smell the coffee. The catalysts are nothing new -- Tariffs, Italy, Brexit, Saudi Arabia. But with the towering pillars of market strength, the US equity markets, is looking ever so fragile and on the verge of crumbling. The air is so thick with a sense of foreboding that you can cut it with a dull butter knife. Maybe there are too many things going sideways clouding investor judgement, but things could turn nasty in a heartbeat. With risk sentiment tanking, we could be facing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the early stages of a protracted equity market meltdown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he adds. Yesterday was the worst day for tech stocks on Wall Street for seven years, dragging the Nasdaq into bear-market territory and wiping out the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2018 gains. And today, markets were in retreat from Sydney to Shanghai, my colleague Martin Farrer reports: In Australia the benchmark ASX200 closed down 164 points or 2.8% as it suffered its fifth straight day of losses. In Japan the Nikkei was off 3.7% and has now dropped around 13% from a 27-year peak of 24,448.07 touched in early October. A broad indicator of shares in the region \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the MSCI Asia Pacific index \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has now fallen 20.3% from the year-to-date high set on 29 January, representing an official bear market. The Vix \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fear\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd index, which measures volatility across the market, has spiked sharply this week and was up 21% overnight. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t thought that selling would be this steep. This sell-off makes us think the market may be set for capitulation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Shoji Hirakawa, chief global strategist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The sell-off in global stock markets is accelerating today, as stocks keep sliding across the globe. Asian stock markets have plunged into bear market territory, meaning they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve shed 20% of their value since their highs in January. Fears over the health of the global economy, future US interest rate rises, Jamal Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s murder, and America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war with China are all being blamed as investors try to grab the nearest tin hat to ride out the storm. Some disappointing corporate results this week - including from industry bellwether Caterpillar - have also dampened the mood, and raised fears that growth is slowing. After a very bruising session, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei has tumbled by 3.7%, while Australia has lost 2.8%. China suffered fresh losses too, taking it deeper into its own bear market. Analysts are worried that the sell-off has further to run, and could turn into a full-blown collapse. As Greg McKenna, an independent markets strategist in Australia, put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fear is palpable in stock markets at the moment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This could get much worse before it gets better. Collapses happen after falls. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the danger.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That follows another rocky session on Wall Street, where the Dow slumped by another 600 points (-2.4%). That wipes out all its gains for this year, as a wave of worry swept the trading floors. Optimism is out, and volatility is back. Bears are prowling the trading floors this morning in Europe too. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is expected to fall, and could hit a new seven-month low. Other European markets are expected to slide too, as the spat between Rome and Brussels over next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget continues. The EU has asked for a new version within three weeks, but Italy is refusing to rewrite its plans. Also coming up The European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council is meeting today to set monetary policy. No change is expected, but Mario Draghi will be quizzed by journalists.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap Global stock markets are on track for their worst month in five years ,after another day of losses. In London, the FTSE 100 has lost nearly 1% to close at its weakest level since March. At one point it hit a 22-month low. The US stock markets is also in the red today. Technology stocks are leading the sell-off, after Amazon and Alphabet underwhelmed Wall Street with their results last night. Investors have not taken much cheer from the latest US GDP report, which showed a slightly faster acceleration in growth than expected. Consumer spending and government spending both boosted growth, but trade was a drag. Asia-Pacific markets also ended the week with another bout of volatility, and fears that contagion was spreading through the markets. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story on the markets, after a turbulent week: Shares in New York are also climbing back from their earlier lows. The Dow is now down just 140 points, or 0.6%, as a degree of calm returns to Wall Street. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 250, an index of smaller companies, also lost almost 1% today: As European traders count their losses and head to the pub, their counterparts on Wall Street have just endured a rough morning Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest damage: Dow Jones industrial average: down 279 points or 1.1% at 24,715 S&amp;P 500: down 43 points or 1.6% at 2,661 Nasdaq: down 153 points or 2.2% at 6,862 Neil Wilson of Markets.com says the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) are doing the damage. He writes: Bloody FAANGs means Halloween comes early in nightmare month for equities. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No respite for equity markets today as the weight of the FAANGs dragged on the wider market and raises a real risk that this selloff is about to turn into a full bear market. The S&amp;P 500 has now dipped into correction territory in little over a month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a steep selloff. Amazon and Alphabet earnings disappointed with less upbeat outlooks casting a cloud over tech stocks in particular. Bear in mind that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still the only real bright spot out there YTD and now it looks as though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s starting to rollover. If FAANGs are rolling over the weaker sector stocks are very vulnerable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Snap off 15% today after reporting another quarter of declining users and offered a pessimistic outlook. Snap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment thesis was always shaky and the truth is it was never going to deliver. Quality like Microsoft and Intel are holding relatively firm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not seen sky high valuations as some of the FAANGs so are seen a bit safer, while both have delivered on earnings. Just in: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has ended the day solidly in the red, at the end of a volatile week. However, the losses aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as bad as earlier in the day, when stocks were languishing at a 22-month low. The FTSE 100 closed 64 points lower, or -0.92%, at 6,939 points. Things looked worse an hour ago, before shares rallied into the closing auction in London. Evraz was the biggest faller, down 6.3%, followed by online supermarket chain Ocada (-5%) and BT (-4.5%). There are losses in Europe: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.94% French CAC: -1.3% Italian FTSE MIB: -0.7% Fiona Cincotta of City Index says: The large-scale volatility that we have seen across the week was certainly not packing away for the weekend early. The bloodbath continued with markets across the globe slamming lower as concerns over US corporate results overshadowed a robust US GDP figure. As shares slide, investors are piling into the safety of government bonds. Debt issued by Germany and America is always attractive on these occasions. So as prices leap, bond yields (the interest on the bond) are dropping. Newsflash: The FTSE 100 just hit its lowest level since December 2016. It fell 152 points, or over 2%, to 6851, as markets end the week on a low. Technology stocks had been a stellar performer earlier this year. But now they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sliding, and dragging the wider markets down, according to David Madden of CMC Markets: The S&amp;P 500 has fallen into correction territory as the decline in stocks intensifies. Amazon and Alphabet shares are in the red after both companies missed on revenue forecasts last night, and Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guidance was also below the consensus estimate. US tech stocks set a series of record-highs throughout the summer, and they were the first to fall in the recent market rout. There is a sense that the tech sector is setting the pace for the rest of the world. The sell-off is gathering pace, again. The S&amp;P 500 index, which covers a broader spread of the US economy than the Dow, is down 2.2%. That puts the S&amp;P 500 into correction territory, more than 10% off its peak in September. The good news for City investors is that this week of pain is almost over. The bad news is that the FTSE 100 is wallowing close its lowest level since December 2016. The blue-chip Footsie index is down 117 points, or almost 1.7%, at 6887. Steel and mining company Evraz is the biggest faller, down 7.6% after mixed production numbers yesterday. WPP has shed another 4.6%, after Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout following a profits warning. Several economists are predicting that the US economy will slow in the quarters ahead, after six months of solid growth. Capital Economics believes tighter monetary policy is already having an impact: At 3.5% annualised, GDP growth remained unusually strong in the third quarter, thanks partly to this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal stimulus, but there are signs that higher interest rates are beginning to have a bigger restraining effect. Once the boost from fiscal stimulus fades next year, we expect economic growth to slow below its potential rate, forcing the Fed to the side-lines by mid-2019. Kay Daniel Neufeld, managing economist of CEBR, believes the trade war with China will also hurt growth. Q3 growth surprised on the upside, showing that the US economy continues to perform with considerable momentum in the second half of the year. However, house-made problems including the deteriorating global trading conditions and the fast pace of monetary tightening spell trouble for the coming quarters.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ouch! The Dow Jones industrial average is now down 400 points, or 1.7%, as the market turmoil continues. Another tech firm, Cisco, is the biggest faller on the Dow (down 2.1%), followed by Home Depot (-1.9%) and American Express (-1.7%). Technology stocks are sliding in New York, particularly those which have disappointed Wall Street. Hard drive maker Western Digital has tumbled by 17%, after reporting a 3% drop in revenues for the last quarter. Profits shrank by 24%. Amazon has slumped by 7.5% after giving disappointing guidance for the holiday period last night. Google parent company Alphabet has shed 3%. This is all weighing on the Nasdaq, of course, which is down over 2%. The bell has rung and stronger-than-expected US growth in Q3 has failed to cheer investors. Opening scores: Dow Jones: -242 points or -1% at 24,742 S&amp;P 500: -39 points or -1.5% at 2,666 Nasdaq: -186 points or -2.5% at 7,132 Three minutes until the opening bell on Wall Street... Balraj Sroya, trader at currency firm Foenix Partners, says the US growth figures are key to both Trump and the Federal Reserve: Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mantra of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMaking America Great Again\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is echoing across the US economy as third quarter GDP growth outpaced market consensus with a print of 3.5%. Consumer spending and businesses increasing their inventories aided the strongest back to back quarters for growth in over two years. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s print was crucial for Trump and the GOP ahead of the Midterm elections as GDP seems to be aligning with the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target for 2018, however it could spark the Fed to consider a more aggressive monetary policy. The detail behind the headline GDP growth figure, published by the US Commerce Department, shows that consumer spending boosted the economy in the third quarter, but net trade was a drag as exports fell but imports rose. The Department said: The increase in real GDP in the third quarter reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures, private inventory investment, state and local government spending, federal government spending, and nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by negative contributions from exports and residential fixed investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased. The deceleration in real GDP growth in the third quarter reflected a downturn in exports and a deceleration in nonresidential fixed investment. Imports increased in the third quarter after decreasing in the second. These movements were partly offset by an upturn in private inventory investment. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said Donald Trump is likely to jump on the US growth figures: We can expect President Trump to wax lyrical about these results in the run up to the congressional midterm elections, adding evidence to his promise on expanding the economy. However, growth has already moderated and will continue to do so in 2019 as the tax cut boost dissipates and inflation tightens its grip as a result of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tit for tat with China. (No Trump tweet about Q3 as yet...) Pre-trading on Wall Street has picked up after the news that US growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter, to 3.5%. US futures are still down before the opening bell, but less so: Dow Jones: -177 points or -0.7% S&amp;P 500: -24 points or -0.9% Nasdaq: -124 points or -1.8% Breaking: The US economy grew by 3.5% in the third quarter, faster than the 3.3% predicted by economists. It was a slowdown compared with the second quarter, when the economy grew by 4.2% on an annual basis. Economists at Investec have taken a step back from this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market mayhem to look at prospects in the months ahead for the global economy. In a month full of uncertainties, a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglass half full\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 approach might be to say that there has been some respite in global trade tensions. However the pause looks to be because the Chinese and US authorities are eyeing more constructive talks after the US mid-terms. Even with this respite, risk assets are currently under pressure amid continuing concerns that the Fed may embark on a more aggressive tightening path, concerns over earnings and equity valuations and as other global political concerns have arisen. Furthermore some signs have emerged that suggest recent protectionist actions have spilt over into confidence and growth. But as yet we do not judge risks related to the above to be substantial enough to shift our world GDP forecasts, particularly given supportive fiscal policy in the US and China. We continue to look for 3.8% world growth this year and 3.7% next. Risks though lie to the downside for 2019. The pound is down 0.3% against the dollar at a two-month low of $1.2784. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly a story of a stronger dollar, which is up against a basket of currencies ahead of the US GDP number at 1.30pm UK time. Another day, another statement from Patisserie Valerie, the troubled cafe and bakery chain which earlier this month discovered a black hole in its accounts and a \u00c2\u00a31m unpaid tax bill that threatened the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse. The latest news is that Chris Marsh, the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance director who was arrested on suspicion of fraud and subsequently bailed, has resigned. Pat Val\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, Patisserie Holdings, issued a brief statement: Patisserie Holdings plc announces that following the suspension of Chris Marsh on 9 October 2018, the company has now accepted his resignation as the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance director with immediate effect, while reserving its position in respect of any potential claims it may have against him. The latest announcement isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite surprising as the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other ones over the past month. Thursdays rebound on Wall Street - with the Dow Jones surging 401 points - is nowhere to be seen today, with global markets on course for their longest losing streak in more than five years. European markets are sharply lower and US futures suggest the Dow could lose another 300-or-so points when the bell goes on Wall Street. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a look at US futures: Dow Jones: -271 points or -1.1% S&amp;P 500: -38 points or -1.4% Nasdaq: -174 points or -2.5% The MSCI all-country index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was earlier down 0.3% and on track for a fifth week of losses - the longest losing streak since May 2013. Royal Bank of Scotland is weighing on the FTSE 100 this morning, with shares down nearly 5%. The bailed-out bank published third-quarter results this morning, and the detail has underwhelmed investors. Attributable profit - the figure which determines the dividend - was up 14% in the three months to the end of September, at \u00c2\u00a3448m, but it was below expectations of \u00c2\u00a3507m. Operating costs also increased as the bank set aside another \u00c2\u00a3200m for payment protection insurance claims. In better news, pre-tax profit rose 10% in the third quarter, to \u00c2\u00a3961m. But that has not been enough for traders, and RBS is among the top FTSE fallers: Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says that hopes appear to have been dashed for a positive end to the week for the FTSE . Any suggestion UK stocks might end the week on a more positive note has been swatted aside after the third quarter sales performance of Amazon and Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company Alphabet disappointed after the market close in the US. Given the technology sector helped lead US indices to fresh highs in 2018 and is so dominant, its performance in the current earning season was always likely to be pivotal to investor sentiment. As if traders didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough to contend with, later today we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get US GDP data for the third quarter. Figures are expected to show the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy grew by 3.3% in the third quarter, on an annual basis. It would be a slowdown from 4.2% in the second quarter. The figures will be published at 1.30pm, UK time. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spread Ex, says the number could weigh on investor moods: Given that the slightest thing sets the markets off at the moment, it is going to be interesting to see how they deal with this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first look at the US third quarter GDP figure. Analysts are expecting a slowdown from 4.2% in Q2 to 3.3% in Q3, a decline that may only cause further problems at the end of a tiring and tricky week. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take a closer look at the markets in Europe, where losses are accelerating this morning: As well as the disappointing results (on some measures) from Amazon and Alphabet, investors are also concerned by a number of other risks. To name a few - the US/China trade war, rising US interest rates, instability in emerging markets, and Brexit. Here is our story on how the market volatility has gripped Asian and Australian markets overnight: Opening bells have rung across Europe and the mood is gloomy: FTSE 100: -0.8% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -1.1% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -1% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.5% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.6% Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.6% David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, explains why Amazon and Alphabet disappointed investors: We heard from tech giants Amazon and Alphabet after the closing bell last night. Amazon topped the earnings per share forecast, but missed on revenue and the guidance. Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent, Alphabet, exceeded estimates on EPS, but undershot the revenue forecast. Both stocks dropped heavily in the post-market session, and in turn sparked selling across major US indices. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re almost at the end of what has been a hugely volatile week for global stock markets. Wall Street bounced back on Thursday, with the Dow Jones surging 401 points, a gain of 1.6%, to close at 24,984. It followed sharp falls on Wednesday, and the turnaround in sentiment was largely down to technology stocks - after positive Twitter and Microsoft results - industrials companies and banks. But sentiment soured when US tech giants Amazon and Alphabet reported disappointing revenues after the closing bell on Wall Street. It was enough to send US futures lower, which in turn triggered a sell-off in Asia where shares hit 20-month lows. Markets across Europe are expected to open sharply lower this morning as the gloomy sentiment spreads across the Atlantic: We will be following the markets and all the latest business news as this volatile week for global markets draws to a close.",

The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly retail sales index fell further than expected to +5 in October from a reading of +23 in September, missing analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 estimates for a smaller decline in consumer spending. The details from the survey of 104 firms, of which 45 were retailers, show sales volumes were significantly below average for the time of year, and that online shopping was the only sector to record increasing sales volumes. The figures come after the chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced tax breaks on business rates for smaller shops in the budget on Monday, with reductions on rates by a third for up to 90% of retail properties. The budget also contained measures to impose a digital services tax on large US technology companies including Google, Facebook and Amazon, which he said was to ensure \u00e2\u20ac\u0153these global giants with profitable businesses in the UK pay their fair share\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. High streets have come under growing pressure as an increasing number of consumers shop online, while sluggish wage growth and high levels of inflation have constrained their spending power. Statistics from the Insolvency Service, a government agency, showed the biggest rise in company insolvencies since the depths of the financial crisis, which analysts said was connected to the struggles on the high street. It recorded a 19.3% year-on-year rise in the third quarter, the biggest increase since the second quarter of 2009, when Britain was still struggling to emerge from a recession. Nick Levine, the head of enterprise at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said it was likely the tough trading conditions and the economic climate were having an impact. He suggested the slowing growth in the number of EU migrants since the Brexit vote could also have had an impact. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is not only high street stores suffering. The hospitality industry is also seeing an increasing amount of businesses go insolvent,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Duncan Swift, the vice-president of R3, the insolvency and restructuring trade body, said it was the first time more than 4,000 corporate insolvencies had been recorded in a single quarter since the start of 2014. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For every struggling retailer unable to pay its debts, there will be numerous suppliers as well as shop-fitting or delivery firms who come under pressure,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Alpesh Paleja, the principal economist at the CBI, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Retail sales have begun to cool, as the boost from the summer heatwave and World Cup celebrations fades away. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear the challenges facing the retail sector are significant.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

                "bodyText":"Be gone, October! Wall Street has closed for the day, and the month, with a two-day rally. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 had both gained around 1% as the closing bell rang. The Nasdaq jumped by 2%, driven by the revival in FAANG stocks. Slightly worryingly, the rally did soften in the last few minutes (like a chocolate in the warm hand of a trick-or-treater). And the monthly losses are still alarming. The S&amp;P fell almost 7% in October, its worst month since 2011. The Dow shed 5%, its roughest month since January 2016. The Nasdaq had a real month to forget, down over 9% in its worst month since November 2008. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an up-sum of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading in London, from Fiona Cincotta of City Index: The FTSE rallied for a third straight session on Wednesday despite a stronger pound, jumping 115 points after a dismal October. October is traditionally a difficult month for equities but the FTSE shedding 4.8% is a significantly larger drop than what we would normally expect. How the beginning of November pans out will be interesting. Of the geopolitical issues which have be weighing on the market, namely Brexit, the Italian standoff with Brussels over spending, the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sino trade war or the slowing global, none have been resolved and we also have the US mid-term elections thrown into the mix. Gains were broad based on the FTSE with Standard Chartered a notable riser following impressive results with profits surging 37% on last year. Standard Chartered reported a pre-tax profit of $1.06 billion, up from $774 million a year before and 9% ahead of estimates. By focusing on what is does best \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Asia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the bank has managed to sharpen its competitive edge. Costs have been a concern in previous years, but the bank has shown its capabilities at reigning these in. Next fell following lacklustre results. The bellwether dropped close to 3% after results underwhelmed. The retailer confirmed that in store sales fell further in the third quarter, whilst overall sales grew by 2% thanks to a strong performance in online sales. Back in New York, tech shares are still on a tear - pushing the Nasdaq up by almost 3% today. By my maths, that still leaves the Nasdaq down 8% for the month. Good news: October is over, at least for traders in Europe. Better news: European stock markets have all ended today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session higher, clawing back some of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the closing prices: UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100: UP 92 points or 1.3% at 7,128 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: UP 160 points or 1.4% at 11,447 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: UP 51 points of 2.3% at 5,093 That still means European stocks have lost around 5% of their value this month. Could the worst be over? Possibly, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that nothing has really changed. All the factors blamed for the sell-off - from US interest rate policy to the Italian budget row - are in place. On the other hand, maybe there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relief that the earnings season hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been worse. Neil Wilson of Markets.com has a good take: Earnings are not universally strong and outlooks have betrayed some murkiness. But, on the whole, we have more companies beating earnings estimates than missing, and more than the average. Fundamentals are still strong but there are questions about earnings growth from here. So, if the US-China trade war pushes prices up (inflationary), and US wage growth picks up (also inflationary), does the Federal Reserve keep hiking? Or does it hold off, to protect asset prices? Wilson says: The stock market is telling the Fed to stop raising rates. Janet Yellen has come out to urge the Fed to keep to its course, but the signs are the equity market is highly susceptible to a more aggressive course of hiking. The Fed has been here before \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the question is do we get 1998 Greenspan Fed that listens to the equity market, or 2007/08 Bernanke Fed? October was a horrid month despite the gains of the last two days. We could see seasonal factors support further gains into the year-end but the primary trend could remain bearish.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Dow is holding onto its gains, now up 286 points (+1.15%) at 25,160 points. Wall Street traders are doing their best to end October on a positive note. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent results from GM, and strong ADP jobs figures, seem to be helping. October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s volatility probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spook the Federal Reserve out of raising US interest rates again in December. Capital Economics expect Fed chair Jay Powell will pave the way for a pre-Christmas hike, arguing: Although the Fed is unlikely to make any policy changes at next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, we expect the statement to reiterate the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to continue gradually raising interest rates, with the next move coming in December. With the latest data showing that activity has continued to expand at a rapid pace, hopes that the recent plunge in the stock market will prompt a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPowell put\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 are likely to prove misplaced. The US dollar is also surging today, making gains against emerging market currencies such as the Brazilian real and the Turkish lira. Last night, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg hailed the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcStories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 product as a key future source of growth, and admitted Facebook has reached saturation point in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153developed countries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Facebook missed analyst forecasts for revenue growth (despite pulling in 33% more than a year ago), but smashed forecasts for earnings. Wall Street is giving Facebook the thumbs-up today, with Royal Bank of Canada providing a list of five reasons to be bullish: Facebook stills owns two of the largest media assets in the world (Facebook and Instagram) and the two largest messaging assets in the world (Messenger &amp; WhatsApp); Our checks and management commentary suggest no material change in Marketer views of the attractiveness of Facebook platforms; Monetization of core Facebook and Instagram assets still has material upside potential and Messenger and WhatsApp are beginning early stages of monetization; Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aggressive investments are improving platform security and creating future revenue streams; Even under pressure, Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s producing impressive growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Richard Dickie Hodges, Manager of Nomura Global Dynamic Bond fund, blames US interest rate rise fears for October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market slump. Getting firmly into the Halloween spirit, he writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Federal Reserve remains the biggest, scariest vampire in the markets today. As it sucks the life-blood of investment markets with interest rate rises, the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153risk-free rate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd becomes more attractive, the cost of funding risk rises and all risky assets must adjust to offer higher returns. In other words, they must sell off. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBut our Nosferatu is a complex villain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it cares deeply for its victim. As rates climb, it forces volatility into the stock markets, especially emerging markets with US dollar funding requirements that fear the higher greenback. It is this volatility that may cause the Fed to slow or pause the blood-letting in 2019.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Halloween is a time for fangs, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appropriate that the FAANG stocks are rallying in New York. With Facebook now up 6.8%, Netflix also up 6.8%, Amazon up 4% and Alphabet up over 3.1%, technology stocks are in demand. But this treat comes after a very tricky October, which saw tech stocks slump by around 10% during the month. Microsoft is leading the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally, up 3%, followed by credit card firm VISA (+2.7%), industrial equipment firm Caterpillar (+2.4%) and Apple (+2.1%). There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Happy Halloween spirit on the New York stock exchange, as the final trading day of a brutal October kicks off. The Dow Jones industrial average has leapt by 251 points, or 1%, to 25,125. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on top of Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 400-point leap, and might cheer spirits on Wall Street. But it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fix October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad losses on its own. The Nasdaq index has surged by 1.6%, as technology stocks rally. Facebook shares have jumped by 5%, as investors show they like last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results from the social network giant. General Motors have surged by 6%, after beating profit and revenue estimates today. European markets are still sharply higher, as traders prepare for Wall Street to open.... Global stock markets is up 0.6% already today, thanks to gains in Asia and Europe. The MSCI All Country World Index has risen to 481.03 points, up from 478 last night. But October has still been a pretty horrific month for stocks. The ACWI ended September at 524 points, meaning it has lost over 8% this month. In points terms, this looks like the biggest destruction of value since the financial crisis of 2008. In percentage terms, it looks like the worst month since May 2012 (when the ACWI fell from 328 points to 297, down 9.4%). The US president reckons shares are going up again today... Boom! The FTSE 100 just nudged a new three-week high after a strong morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip index is now up 113 points, or almost 1.67%, at 7153 points, as traders try to shake off their October blues. Mining groups such as Antofagasta and Glencore are among the top risers, along with equipment rental firm Ashtead and banking group Standard Chartered (after its strong results this morning). Retailers are struggling, though, after Next reported slower growth this morning. Remember: The FTSE 100 started the month over 7,500 points, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still down 5% this month alone. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says traders are hoping for peace in the global trade wars: The unspooked celebrations continued on Wednesday, the markets wringing all they can from Donald Trump commenting on Tuesday that a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgreat deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with China is on its way, undoing some of the renewed trade war fears that had hit on Monday night. With basically every major sector in the green \u00e2\u20ac\u201c spare a thought for Next, languishing at the bottom of the index following its latest high street woes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the FTSE could jump more than 100 points as the day progressed. That lifted it above 7150 for the first time in 3 weeks, the index scraping off the top layer of October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses while coming nowhere close to mounting a full on recovery. Another reason for optimism: Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy expanded by 0.1% in August, a better performance than expected. Newsflash: American companies took on staff at a healthy pace this month. US firms created 227,000 new jobs this month, beating expectations of 189,000 fresh hires. Services companies led the way, expanding their payrolls by 189,000 to the total while construction and manufacturing firms both hired 17,000 new workers. That suggests the US economy remains robust, and could mean this Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll (employment report) is strong too. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little early for 2019 market predictions, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll make an exception for this one: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Happy Halloween for carmaker General Motors, which has just smashed Wall Street expectations. GM has also raised expectations for the months ahead, which should cheer US investors. Reuters has the details: General Motors on Wednesday posted far stronger-than-expected quarterly profit and said its full-year earnings forecast would come in at the high end of its forecast due to strong demand in North America. The Detroit automaker reported third-quarter net income of $2.53 billion, or $1.75 a share, compared with a loss last year of $2.98 billion, or $2.03 a share. Last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarter included a charge related to Europe. Excluding one-time items, GM earned $1.87 a share in the third quarter, easily beating the $1.25 analysts polled by Refinitiv estimates had expected. Revenue in the quarter rose 6.4 percent to $35.8 billion, above the $34.85 billion analysts had expected. A quick catch-up on the markets: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100: Up 105 points or 1.5% at 7141, a 3-week high Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stoxx 600: Up 5 points or 1.6% at 361, a nine-day high Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei: Closed 463 points higher at 21,920, up 2.16% China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite index: Closed 35 points higher at 2,602, up 1.35% The latest inflation data has given eurozone policymakers a Halloween headache. Consumer prices across the single-currency bloc rose by 2.2% this month, the fastest rate since 2014, up from 2.1% in September Core inflation, which measures underlying price pressures, jumped to 1.1% from 0.9% a month ago. That suggests the European Central Bank is right to rein in its stimulus plans, and halt bond-buying at the end of 2018. However, we learned yesterday that the eurozone economy slowed sharply over the summer -- which might mean more stimulus is needed. Separately, unemployment rate across the eurozone was unchanged last month at 8.1%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the joint-lowest rate in a decade, but also much higher than America (3.7%) and the UK (4%). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a grim day for UK butchers chain Crawshaw Group. The supplier of sausages, chops, joints and pies is falling into administration. This puts 600 jobs at risk across 54 stores, which could close unless a buyer can be found. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: The Yorkshire-based company, which was founded in 1954, has been talking to investors over the past month but has failed to raise the funds it needed. It expects to appoint administrators later on Wednesday who will then try to find buyers for the business and its assets. Crawshaw has 42 high street stores and 12 factory outlet stores across the Midlands and the north of England. Full marks to the Bond Vigilante\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team at M&amp;G, who have produced some spooktacular charts today. The first shows the remorseless march of US student debt, which has tripled over the last decade. Laura Frost, fixed interest investment specialist at M&amp;G, says this debt burden can undermine the wider economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153US Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell recently warned about the ever-increasing amount of US student debt outstanding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You do stand to see longer-term negative effects on people who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay off their student loans. It hurts their credit rating, it impacts the entire half of their economic life.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Student debt also impacts the overall economy: as graduates seek to repay their loans, they are forced to make concessions to their financial consumption, leading to an ever-growing drag on the economy. They buy fewer goods and services and are delayed in joining the housing ladder, with many choosing (or having) to rent instead. On top of this, student debt sees the highest 90+ day delinquency rate of all US consumer credit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Readers of a nervous disposition should take a deep breath, before looking at the next chart -- the interest rate on longterm US bonds. After falling steadily for decades, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s started going up! Frost explains why it matters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The long-end of the US Treasury market has often been described as a giant anaconda: it draws little attention as it sleeps most of the time, but the minute it wakes up, everybody around shakes. US 30-year bonds don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bite, but their moves can be as poisonous as they basically determine millions of mortgage rates, as well as the price that governments and companies around the world pay for debt. The 30-year Treasury yield has remained within the support and resistance level shown for over 30 years, rallying 6% over the period and giving investors a long bull run. Does the recent breach through this level mean that the anaconda is beginning to stir?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Finally, a picture that might scare Donald Trump - it shows how US central bankers have struggled to maintain full employment, without triggering a recession. Frost explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With US unemployment at rock-bottom levels and the stock market at near record highs, the Fed has begun hiking rates in an attempt to engineer a soft landing: it wants to slow the economy enough to avoid an overheating, but not so much that it causes a recession. How many times over the past 70 years has the Fed successfully managed to do this and return unemployment (green line) back up to its natural level (blue line) without a recession ensuing (vertical bars)? You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be scared after counting\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The slump in Red October has dragged many global stock markets into negative territory for this year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a selection of the best and worst performers in 2018: Bovespa Stock Index (Brazil) +9.7% NASDAQ 100 +6.5% (US) Dow Jones Industrial Average (US) +0.6% S&amp;P 500 +0.3% (US) Nikkei 225 (Japan) -3.7% CAC 40 (Paris) -4.5% FTSE 100 (UK) -7.3% DAX Xetra (Germany) -11.4% Hang Seng (Hong Kong) -16.5% SSE Composite (China) -22.3% But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still time for a turnaround. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says: The markets are racing ahead following a very good session last night in the US where the S&amp;P, Nasdaq and Dow Jones all posted gains in excess of 1.5%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now the turn of European and Asian stocks to join the rally with the FTSE 100 shooting up 1.5% in early trading on Wednesday and Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei 225 index jumping 2.2%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest rally means the S&amp;P, NASDAQ and Dow Jones are all back in positive territory for the year. The only other major index to share this status is Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bovespa index, up 9.7% so far this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The upturn in the market is positive for investors, although the main UK indices still have some way to go before they get back into the black. The FTSE 100 is currently down 7.3% year-to-date, and the FTSE 250 down 8.7%. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says markets may be turning the corner, after a rough October: Asia markets managed to close out the month of October and post their second consecutive day of gains in what has been a pretty poor month for equity markets in general. This rebound could well be down to some end of month position adjusting, however there have been some indications in the past few days that we might be starting to see a bit of a short term base, with most of the bad news already priced in to some extent. American\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get enough of Halloween, so Wall Street is eager to join today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the pre-market calls from CMC Markets: Dow Jones is expected to open 136 points higher at 25,010 S&amp;P500 is expected to open 18 points higher at 2,700 The FTSE 100 is continuing to push higher. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now up 115 points, or 1.6% to 7150. Nearly every sector is up, led by manufacturers, energy firms, tech stocks and banks: Here are the top risers on the Footsie this morning However, this still leaves the FTSE 100 nursing a 5% loss for October (it started the month at 7,510). Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Halloween rally, global markets are still on track for their worst month since the financial crisis. Figures calculated earlier this week showed that $8 trillion had been wiped off global stocks in October. Trade wars, the slowdown in China, tensions in the eurozone and Brexit have all encouraged investors to ditch risky stocks. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: Smart money is running for the hill and this was the message which October brought for the global equity market. Global stocks lost over $8 trillion in October, a headline which suits the best on the Halloween day. Investors are refusing to be spooked on Halloween, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEX: With October containing as much red as the goriest of slasher flicks, the markets oddly chose to rebound on what would have been an entirely calendar-appropriate day to continue the month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading horrors. Building on Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, the FTSE shot up 1.3% after the bell, allowing the index to cross 7100 for the first time in 3 weeks. It benefited from the market-wide shift in sentiment, which itself came despite further evidence that the trade war is hurting the Chinese economy, as the country suffered a slide in manufacturing activity. Overnight, China got the shivers, as manufacturing activity fell and the yuan was fixed at a new 10-year low to the dollar. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally is welcome, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not enough to wipe out this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. October has been particularly bad for US investors, with the main indices falling sharply. CNBC has crunched the numbers, and explains: After Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comeback, the Dow is down 5.9 percent this month, still its worst performance since August 2015. The S&amp;P 500 is off by 7.9 percent in October, on track for its worst month since May 2010. On Monday, the S&amp;P 500 closed in correction territory, down 10.2 percent from its record. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Obviously we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a correction phase of the stock market and I think investors have to realize that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The monetary environment has changed. As you can see, even with a 10 percent change in the stock markets, interest rates have barely moved lower.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European stocks are all jumping - fortunately not with fright. Weeeee! The FTSE 100 is flying faster than a rocket. The blue-chip index has gained 88 points, or 1.2%, to 7124, clawing back some of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Bank Standard Chartered is leading the charge, up 4% after reporting that profits rose from $557m to $752m in the last quarter. Retailer Next is struggling, though, down almost 5%. Next reported that full priced shares are up 2% year-on-year, but retail sales (at its high street stores) have plunged by 8.0% in the last quarter. Online sales growth has slowed, to just +12.7% compared to +14.8% in the year to date. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Halloween - a dark time of ritual, dressing-up, and trick-or-treating. But any children touring the City of London must make a special effort to scare investors; they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re well used to shocks and scares this month. October has been a torrid month for equities. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has shed 6% over the last 30 days, even hitting a 22-month low last week, as global markets took a collective chilly bath. If you really want to make a investor quiver, wave a chart showing how world markets have lose almost 8.5% this month, wiping out trillions of dollars of value. Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says there is fear on the trading floors: October has well and truly lived up to its chilling reputation, with stock markets around the globe suffering one of their worst months in recent memory. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a wild ride for investors and there is no guarantee it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over yet. Markets may have recovered their early losses and some indices may even be in the green for the week but volatility has not eased and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a concern. But after a month of gory red, things might be turning. Wall Street rallied last night, with the Dow gaining more than 400 points. Stocks have strengthened in Asia too, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei gaining 2% and China up nearly 1.5%. Thea main European markets are also up in early trading. There are still reasons to hide under the bedsheets, though. Yesterday, we learned that eurozone growth has halved. Later today we get fresh unemployment and inflation figures for the eurozone. David Madden of CMC Markets says this data could set the mood for the day, and beyond: The stand-off between the Italian government and the EU continues. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew 0.8% in the third-quarter on an annual basis, which was below the forecast of 0.9%. Matteo Salvini, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s joint deputy prime minister claimed the underwhelming update is a reason the government needs to increase spending, and in turn increase the budget deficit. The Italian situation could spark another round of the eurozone debt crisis, and given that the country has the third-largest government bond market in the world, the fallout could be enormous. Dealers will be keeping an eye out for the eurozone CPI and unemployment reports which are due out at 10am (UK time). The CPI rate is tipped to be 2.2%, and the jobless rate is expected to hold steady at 8.1%.
