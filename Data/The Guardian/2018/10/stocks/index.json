                "bodyText":"And finally, you can get up to speed with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade news with this one-minute video. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today (although I might pop back later for the close of Wall Street...) America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chemicals industry doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree that Nafta was a disastrous trade deal. According to the American Chemistry Council, around 46,000 chemicals jobs depend on trade with Mexico and Canada, due to the free trade links created over the last few decades. Chemical exports to the two countries have more than tripled, from $13 billion in 1994, to $44 billion in 2018. The ACC explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The U.S. chemical sector has capitalized on duty-free trade under NAFTA ever since its inception, more than tripling U.S. chemicals exports to Canada and Mexico \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from $13 billion in 1994, to $44 billion in 2018. Approximately 46,000 U.S. chemical jobs now depend on trade with Canada and Mexico. And due to the chemical industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early position in the supply chain, U.S. chemical manufacturers have exploited the cost savings from duty-free trade with Mexico and Canada in order to power growth throughout the supply chain and lower prices for manufacturers and consumers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ACC is now studying USMCA, but has already commended the negotiators for updating Nafta (despite Trump claiming Nafta is toast). Back in the markets, the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso are holding onto their earlier gains against the US dollar. Shares are still up on Wall Street too, as investors welcome the USMCA deal. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says: The dollar weakened against the Canadian dollar which was boosted by Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s freshly minted trade deal with the US. The deal with the slightly less elegant name of United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, will replace the existing NAFTA and will give the US access to the Canadian dairy market while capping Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car exports to its southern neighbour. Taken as a sign that the US will be open to finding resolutions to its other ongoing trade disputes the deal prompted rallies across the US markets and caused the DJIA to climb 250 points. Donald Trump used some big numbers to describe America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade imbalances.... but Daniel Dale of the Toronto Star reckons they were rather too big:  Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big press conference has descended into rancour, as reporters continue to ask about the Kavanaugh situation. The president does say the FBI should hold a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very comprehensive investigation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd into the allegations brought against his supreme court nominee, and interview anyone they want \u00e2\u20ac\u0153within reason\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So far so sensible... Unlike the moment when he jibes that one female reporter never thinks (WHAT?!).... and then accuses the entire press pack of being terribly unfair to him, and going \u00e2\u20ac\u0153loco\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Trump is now taking questions....although he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refusing to take any on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. On the negotiations, he says there were tensions with Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PM, but the two sides got there eventually. Q: Will tariffs on Canadian and Mexican steel and aluminium be lifted? No, says Trump... not unless something can be agreed on quotas to prevent too much metal coming into the US. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a blow for Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel industry, who must have hoped that USMCA would bring them some relief. Worryingly for Brussels, Trump suggests he could soon impose tariffs on EU car imports (which would go down very badly with the US and French auto industry). He also says he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want China to have a hard time on trade. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clip of Donald Trump announcing the new trade deal: Donald Trump ends his victory lap by pointing to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong labour market, and the 50% stock market rally since his election. In a warning to Beijing, Trump says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too early\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to hold talks with China to resolve the ongoing trade dispute. He claims that China wants to talk \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very badly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd....however, China did actually warn that it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t negotiate unless Trump dropped his threats. Getting into his stride, Trump now hits at the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153babies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who claim that tariffs don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a difference. We wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be standing here without tariffs, he argues. He adds that other countries such as India have been on the phone to the White House trying to renegotiate trade deals, because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re scared that the US will hit them with tariffs. Once USMCA is approved, it will be a new dawn for the US auto industry and the US auto worker, continues Trump. It will make North America a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153manufacturing powerhouse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he promises. But he also points out that the deal hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been approved by Congress, suggesting that some on Capitol Hill might oppose the deal \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just because Trump likes it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. No Trump speech is complete, it seems, without an attack on some of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading partners. And today, he turns his guns on Europe, saying it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a privilege for them to sell goods to America. Ditto Japan, Trump continues.. saying it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a privilege for them to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153attack the US piggy bank\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Onto the details... Trump says USMCA is the most modern, up-to-date and balanced trade agreement ever, with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153most advanced protections ever for workers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It will help US farmers and ranchers export wheat, poultry, eggs and dairy products to Mexico and Canada. The president also singles out the provision that higher-paid workers produce a proportion of cars n the region, and the new protection for intellectual property. Trump then thanks a string of top officials for their work on USMCA, singling out US trade representative Robert Lighthizer for special praise. Whenever you called Lighthizer, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d find him working in his office or another office, says Trump, hailing his work ethic. He also says Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outgoing president Enrique Pe\u00c3\u00b1a Nieto should get credit, calling him a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrific person\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Justin Trudeau got a great deal for Canada, Trump adds graciously. Donald Trump begins by saying it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a beautiful, beautiful day in Washington.... and a day in which he brings \u00e2\u20ac\u0153truly historic news for our nation, and the world.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We have successfully completed negotiations on a brand new deal to terminate and and replace Nafta with an incredible new deal with Canada and Mexico, called USMCA, Trump says proudly. USMCA has a good ring to it, he muses. The president then lays into Nafta, calling it the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worst trade deal ever made\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which cost America one in four auto jobs. USMCA, Trump continues, is the biggest trade deal in US history.... Donald Trump has arrived at the podium at the White House Rose Garden to speak about the USMCA trade deal, and presumably take a victory lap.... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good round-up of the key differences between Nafta and USMCA here in the Washington Post, by Heather Long. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick summary: New name. Goodbye NAFTA. The new deal will be known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA Big changes for cars. More cars and truck parts should be made in North America. WashPo says: Starting in 2020, to qualify for zero tariffs, a car or truck must have 75 percent of its components manufactured in Canada, Mexico or the United States, a substantial boost from the current 62.5 percent requirement. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a new rule that a significant percentage of the work done on the car must be completed by workers earning at least $16 an hour, or about three times what the typical Mexican autoworker makes. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory: Canada opens up its milk market by giving a larger share to U.S. farmers and eliminating its Class 7 pricing scheme. That means U.S. dairy farmers can probably send a lot more milk protein concentrate, skim milk powder and infant formula to Canada (and those products are relatively easy to transport and store). Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory: Chapter 19, allowing for a special dispute process, stays intact. Chapter 19 allows Canada, Mexico and the United States to challenge one another\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-dumping and countervailing duties in front of a panel of representatives from each country. This is generally a much easier process than trying to challenge a trade practice in a U.S. court On cars, Mexico and Canada get assurance that Trump won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pound them with auto tariffs. The US administration signed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153side letters\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd allowing Canada and Mexico can continue sending about the same number of vehicles and parts across the border free of charge, regardless of whether auto tariffs go into effect down the road. Only parts above that quota could face tariffs. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel tariffs stay in place (for now). Canada wanted Trump to stop his 25 percent tariffs on Canadian steel, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no deal (yet) Improved labor and environmental rights, particularly for Mexico.... For example, the USMCA stipulates that Mexican trucks that cross the border into the United States must meet higher safety regulations and that Mexican workers must have more ability to organize and form unions. Increased intellectual property protections. There are more-stringent protections for patents and trademarks, including for biotech, financial services and domain names - which weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t considered when Nafta was created in the 1990s. Chapter 11, giving investors a special way to fight government decisions, is (mostly) gone. That will please critics, who say it allowed investors to sue governments and win money off the taxpayer. Duncan Weldon of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Resolution Group also sees a theme developing.... The New York stock market has opened higher, as Wall Street traders give USMCA the thumbs-up. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 150 points as the opening bell rang out. The broader S&amp;P 500 index is also rattling higher... If USMCA isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchistoric\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 a change as president Trump claims, why has it been well-received in the markets? Well, economists will be relieved that the agreement maintains zero tariffs on swathes of goods between the three countries. That removes the risk of hefty new levies that would curb demand. But also, a pattern is emerging; the Trump White House demands major changes, gets some progress, declares a famous victory, and moves onto the next battle. A similar result with, say, the Chinese trade talks would be welcomed by investors..... Donald Trump is expected to speak about the USMCA deal at the White House at around 11am local time (4pm BST). The Financial Times have helpfully flagged up some of the differences between USMCA and Nafta. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not dramatic, but together they represent an evolution from the previous trade deal created in the Clinton era. For example, new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rules of origin\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will force carmakers to use more parts from the region. A new wages condition states that a minimum input must be added in factories that pay workers at least $16 an hour. That could move some work from Mexico back to America. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also now a sunset clause \u00e2\u20ac\u201c stating that USMCA will expire in 16 years (Nafta ran indefinitely). The FT explains: The Trump administration had long demanded such a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sunset\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd clause. Indeed, Washington had wanted the sunset clause period to last only five years, but was rebuffed by Canada and Mexico. Plus (as explained earlier), we have the new access to Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dairy industry (a win for America), and the retention of the Chapter 19 resolution facility (a win for Canada). More here. Cailin Birch, senior commodities analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, also argues that USMCA isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all that different from Nafta: She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although the details remain unclear, the broad agreement reached by the US and Canada on 30 September 30 fits with our forecast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c namely, that a trilateral trade agreement would be agreed with a few changes around the margin, but that the structure of the agreement would not be fundamentally altered. It is in all three countries\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 interest that a trilateral agreement was reached - Canada and Mexico are critical export markets for US producers, and regional supply chains have become deeply intertwined since Nafta was first introduced in 1994. As a result, US businesses would have been heavily negatively affected by the dissolution of Nafta. Likewise, both Canada and Mexico will have greater bargaining power as part of a North America-wide agreement than they would have had in separate bilateral deals with the US. The recent jump in both the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar confirms that market fears are beginning to ease, as clarity improves over the future of North American trade policy. However, the difficulty of the negotiations, and particularly the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153divide and conquer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd strategy employed by the Trump administration, is likely to weigh on North American diplomatic and political relations for the remainder of this administration.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tech sector hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t approved of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s belligerence on trade matters in the past - particularly the tariffs imposed on China. But today, the Information Technology Industry Council is all smiles. ITI president and CEO Dean Garfield says USMCA is a welcome move \u00e2\u20ac\u201c adding that it will build on Nafta, not just confine it to history. Garfield says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trilateral agreement is a significant step toward creating a foundation for North America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic prosperity for years to come. While we are still reviewing text, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re encouraged this plan will build upon the prior economic success of Nafta and adapt it to the fundamentally digital economy in which we live through new rules on digital trade, intellectual property, and trade in goods. We understand and appreciate that negotiators have taken their time to secure strong provisions in this agreement that will greatly advance digital trade in North America, enabling companies across industries to hire more workers, innovate more products and grow the economies in their communities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Political scientist Ian Bremmer argues that the USMCA deal is a genuine breakthrough, which could help president Trump force Beijing into a new trade deal too: European stock market have all rallied today, on relief that the Nafta trade deal is being updated, not abandoned. Shares have risen in London, Frankfurt, Paris and beyond...paving the way for a rally on Wall Street in a few hours. David Madden of City trading firm CMC Markets says: European equity markets have been boosted by the news that the US and Canada have struck a trade deal. The agreement between US and Canadian trade delegates was struck just hours before the midnight deadline, and President Trump will be delighted that he managed to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Mexican component of the deal was reached in August and now that the Canadian element has fallen into place, bullish sentiment is sweeping across global markets. Warm words from the White House.... The head of the OECD thinktank, Angel Gurr\u00c3\u00ada, has also welcomed the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new, modernised\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trade deal between the US, Mexico and Canada. Secretary-general Gurr\u00c3\u00ada says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The OECD has long supported open markets for trade and investment as a crucial driver of economic growth and jobs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement supports strong growth and good jobs in all three countries; it will boost the confidence of firms and investors by preserving stable and predictable rules-based trade in North America. It will make the region more productive and more competitive internationally.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Just in: Donald Trump has tweeted that the new trade agreement with Canada is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wonderful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153historic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd breakthrough. He argues that it will help US farmers and manufacturers sell goods overseas (a reference to Canada opening up its dairy sector to more competition). He adds that USMCA will help the US, Canada and Mexico compete with the rest of the world -- a reminder that Washington is still pushing Beijing to reform its trade practices too. The US government has now released the details of the revamped trade deal, online here. It begins by boldly declaring that America, Canada and Mexico have agreed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strengthen anew\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153longstanding friendship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd -- not that relations have been particularly chummy since Donald Trump became president. The agreement then confirms that the three parties have agreed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153REPLACE\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (their capitals) the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement with..... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153...a 21st Century, high standard new agreement to support mutually beneficial trade leading to freer, fairer markets, and to robust economic growth in the region\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That will allow Trump to declare that he has delivered on his pledge to reshape Nafta (presumably he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be awake and tweeting shortly...). But what of the new free trade deal itself? Wins for America include: US farmers get greater access to Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dairy market, through an increased quota on foreign imports. This may be slightly more generous than the quotas available to Asian countries under the Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal. Canada has agreed to eliminate two classes of milk, which had encouraged Canadians to buy domestic milk rather than from overseas. That should help US producers who want to sell more milk across the border (which explains why the Canadian dairy lobby aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy) Canada, meanwhile, will be pleased that: The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chapter 19 dispute-settlement mechanism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, created to resolve trade and anti-dumping disputes, remains untouched in the new agreement. Washington doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like these dispute panels, and had pushed for Chapter 19 to be abolished. On cars, the deal means there is no hard limit on Canadian auto exports to America. Canada has also been promised an exemption if Trump imposes new tariffs on this area. Getting back to the US-Canada-Mexico trade deal....and Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Joe Nocera has written a interesting article explaining why America need to agree a new trade deal with Canada. He points out that Canada is a massive trade partner for many US states, thanks to the elimination of tariffs under Nafta. For example, Virginia exports $3bn of goods to Canada -- around one-fifth of the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total exports -- while importing $2bn. So, even though Donald Trump has savaged the Nafta deal in the past, Washington couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford let it die without a replacement. Nocera explains: The media has been quick to label the deal with Canada \u00e2\u20ac\u201c called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153win\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Trump, but the truth is that for all his bluster, Nafta hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153renegotiated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so much as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been fiddled with on the margins. The new Nafta \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which Trump will no doubt praise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will be more or less the same as the old Nafta, which he has called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the worst trade deal in history.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Virginia will no doubt breathe a sigh of relief, as will businesses and labor unions and states across the country. They all understand that trade creates more jobs that it destroys, which is exactly what the Virginia example shows. Lee McDarby, Corporate IP Managing Director at moneycorp, suspects the weak pount helped UK factories to grow faster last month: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK manufacturing shifted up a gear in September, with significant growth showing a clear pace of expansion. This increase is likely to be down to the Pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness and the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown of manufacturing activity, with British manufacturers increasing outputs to take advantage of the opportunities to sell products overseas. Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, points out that economic uncertainty is still high: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An increase in the PMI figure this month is welcome news for a sector grappling with an ongoing lack of clarity about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trading relationship with the EU, escalating trade wars and rising commodity prices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Manufacturers across different sub-sectors are starting to react to the ever-increasing likelihood of a no-deal Brexit with a degree of nervousness. Announcements from major automotive firms in response to ongoing economic uncertainty and suppressed demand are signs it is creating unease. Capital Economics remain cautious: Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories have shaken off worries over trade wars and Brexit. Activity in the UK manufacturing sector picked up in September, according to the latest data from Markit. Output and new orders grew at a fast rate, while new export business returned to (modest) growth after a worrying decline in August. This pushed Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK manufacturing PMI up to 53.8 in September, better than expected (and faster than the eurozone too!). August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report has been revised up too, to 53.0. Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, says we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get carried away -- growth is still unspectacular, and firms did cut their headcount last month. Dobson adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153September saw a mild improvement in the performance of the UK manufacturing sector. Domestic market demand strengthened, while increased orders from North America and Europe helped new export business stage a modest recovery from August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contraction. Business confidence also rose to a three- month high. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite these causes for short-term optimism, conditions in manufacturing are still relatively lacklustre overall. Based on its historical relationship with official ONS data, the latest survey is consistent with output expanding at only a moderate pace. Although total exports rose, exports of goods used as inputs by other manufacturers fell for the third straight month, ending the worst quarter for over three years for such exporters, suggesting that foreign companies may be sourcing less from UK-based component suppliers. Eurozone factories aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only ones to find September tough. Over in China, manufacturing growth ground to a halt last month, according to the latest healthcheck from Markit. Chinese factory bosses reported that new export business had fallen at the quickest rate since early 2016, spurring them on to cut staffing levels. This pulled the Chinese manufacturing PMI down to 50.0, a level that shows stagnation. This will fuel concerns that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war with China is causing economic harm. Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, says Chinese factories are suffering from weaker demand, adding gloomily that.... Expansion across the manufacturing sector weakened in September, as exports increasingly dragged down performance and continued softening demand began to have an impact on companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 production. In addition, the employment situation worsened further. Downward pressure on China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy was significant.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: Growth across the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector has dropped to its lowest level in two years. Data firm IHS Markit says its eurozone manufacturing PMI, which measures activity across the industry, fell to 53.2 in September, down from 54.6 in August. That pulls it closer to the 50-point mark showing stagnation. Firms reported that export growth was modest last month, with several major EU nations faring particularly badly. Markis blames the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153weakening trade cycle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for denting demand for European goods, adding: Eurozone new export orders were little-changed during September, rising only slightly and at the weakest rate in the current 63-month sequence of growth. Whilst the Netherlands, Ireland and Greece all continued to record notable increases in exports, outright falls were seen in France and Germany. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, adds that eurozone manufacturing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshifted down yet another gear\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in recent months: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The survey paints the worst trade picture for over five years, with export growth having slumped sharply from a series record high in late 2017 to near-stagnation in September. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The slowdown can be linked to sluggish demand and increased risk aversion among customers, often linked to worries about trade wars and tariffs, but also ascribed to rising political uncertainty and higher prices. Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s farmers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe Justin Trudeau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the USMCA deal is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good for Canada\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re deeply unhappy that American farmers will get more access to Canadian consumers, and fear it will cost jobs. Pierre Lampron, president of Dairy Farmers of Canada, says: Granting an additional market access of 3.59% to our domestic dairy market, eliminating competitive dairy classes and extraordinary measures to limit our ability to export dairy products will have a dramatic impact not only for dairy farmers but for the whole sector. This has happened, despite assurances that our government would not sign a bad deal for Canadians. We fail to see how this deal can be good for the 220,000 Canadian families that depend on dairy for their livelihood. Donald Trump may be delighted, though. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long criticised Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s swathe of protections for its dairy industry, which guarantee prices for producers and restrict milk imports from overseas. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet know exactly what USMCA will entail (US officials have only said it includes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a host of provisions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rebalance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trade). Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit fears it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be an improvement on NAFTA (which cut a swath of trade barriers between its members). Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada concurs, saying: Details of the deal are still incomplete, though it appears Canada has conceded greater access to dairy markets and tighter rules of origin for cars. In return, the US has granted Canada limited guaranteed exception in the event of broader tariffs on car imports and the Chapter 19 dispute resolution mechanism remains unchanged. But Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo, reckons the deal should boost optimism: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Though markets were already anticipating an agreement, one source of worry will be swept away if a deal is made,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That will lead to a rise in trust in the U.S. economy, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy for risk sentiment to improve.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso are both rallying, on the back of the USMCA deal. The Canadian dollar, or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcloonie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, has jumped to a four-month high, touching C$1.2887 per dollar for the first time since May. The peso gained 0.5% cent to over 18.63 pesos per dollar, its highest since August, as trade war fears ebbed away. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: The trilateral agreement brings an end to months of uncertainty surrounding North American trade. The resultant risk on sentiment has seen equity futures rally strongly overnight. The S&amp;P futures are back towards record territory, whilst the safe haven yen tumbled to a fresh year to date low versus the dollar. Boom! Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark stock index, the Nikkei, has hit its highest level since 1991. The Nikkei gained 0.5% today, closing at 24,245 -- its best level in 27 years. Markets across Asia were boosted by reports that the US and Canada had agreed a new trade deal. Shares also got a lift from the recent weakness of the yen. It hit a one-year low against the US dollar today, which should help exporters and lift profits. However, the Nikkei is still a long way below its previous all-time high, at the end of the boom in 1989. Canadian PM Justin Trudeau told reporters that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good day for Canada,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after his cabinet backed the new USMCA deal -- even though his nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s farmers will now face more competition from US rivals. Jes\u00c3\u00bas Seade, top Nafta negotiator for Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s President-elect Andr\u00c3\u00a9s Manuel L\u00c3\u00b3pez Obrador, has tweeted that USMCA will provide \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certainty and stability to trade in Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The world has taken a step back from a damaging global trade war, after Canada and the United States reached a deal on reforming the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). After a nail-biting weekend of talks, negotiators from both countries managed to hammer out a new deal, dubbed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. USMCA doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trip off the tongue like Nafta, but that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop Justin Trudeau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cabinet signing the deal off shortly before midnight in Washington, to avoid trade relations with the US being poisoned. Robert Lighthizer, US trade representative, and Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign minister, both declared victory. In a joint statement, they said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153USMCA will give our workers, farmers, ranchers and businesses a high-standard trade agreement that will result in freer markets, fairer trade and robust economic growth in our region. It will strengthen the middle class, and create good, well-paying jobs and new opportunities for the nearly half billion people who call North America home.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Canada has made some concessions, including removing help for its dairy farmers, in return for protections for its car industry. Reuters explains: The deal will preserve a trade dispute settlement mechanism that Canada fought hard to maintain to protect its lumber industry and other sectors from US anti-dumping tariffs, Canadian sources said. But this came at a cost. Canada had agreed to provide US dairy farmers access to about 3.5% of its approximately $16bn annual domestic dairy market, the sources said, adding that the Canadian government was prepared to offer compensation to dairy farmers hurt by the deal. The influential Dairy Farmers of Canada lobby group \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which strongly opposes the idea \u00e2\u20ac\u201c said in a statement that it insisted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153any final Nafta deal should have no further negative impact on the dairy sector\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Canada also agreed to a quota of 2.6m vehicles exported to the US in the event that Trump imposed 25% global autos tariffs on national security grounds, a side letter to the agreement showed. The quota would allow for significant growth in tariff-free automotive exports from Canada above current production levels of about 2 million units, safeguarding Canadian plants. The breakthrough should be welcomed in the markets, where worries over trade wars have weighed on sentiment for months. Also coming up today New manufacturing data will show how UK and Eurozone factories fared in September. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory growth is expected to have slowed a little (the City expects the manufacturing PMI to drop to 52.5 from 52.8), while eurozone growth could be unchanged at 53.5.

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor Larry Elliott on Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to pay its staff more: Goodnight! GW Royal Mail was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 today, shedding another 8% to 359p after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning shocker. European stock markets ended the day lower, although Italy clawed its way back from an early-morning selloff. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 closed 21 points lower, or -0.28%, at 7,474, with Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB down a similar amount. The French CAC shed 0.7%, though, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX lost 0.4%. In the currency markets, the pound is down half a percent at $1.2978, having hit a three week low today. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The FTSE, which is normally a fan of a pummelled pound, found little to celebrate as the day went on, slipping 30 or so points to hit 7470. This despite a decent rebound from its miners, and the (admittedly slim) gains made by BP and Shell as Brent Crude lurked around $85 per barrel. Over in the Eurozone, the conflict between the EU and Italy has not only dragged the euro lower, but caused the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indices to reverse Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth. Happy scenes at an Amazon warehouse as the news broke: Bernie Sanders has given Amazon his blessing, and urged other businesses chiefs to copy them: Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay hike could be a watershed moment for the global economy, says Hinesh Patel of Quilter Investors. Patel thinks the move is partly PR-driven \u00e2\u20ac\u201d having the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest man leading tens of thousand of poorly paid staff isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a great look... In that sense, this shift is about improving the company image and guarding Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation. But, it also reflects changes in the jobs market, where tight labour supply is giving workers more muscle. If so, other firms may be forced to follow, Patel explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news could be a watershed moment in this paradigm shift, with one of the largest employers and a household name making such a bold statement on wages. This will place pressure on other large corporates to follow up this move with a comparable remuneration offer of their own. While these wage raises will cost Amazon, it has the financial might to absorb that cost increase and put the squeeze on rivals as the ripple effect of these wage rises hits other corporates. Similarly, while the national minimum wage has been static for some time, at state level increases have been implemented and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news could prompt Washington to revise the national minimum, with Amazon already indicating they will be lobbying Congress to that effect. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets will be watching the impact of this dynamic closely. A tightening labour market could create healthy inflation and boost consumer spending power but it could also have an impact on corporate earnings. Back in the financial markets, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deepening dispute with Brussels has driven the euro down to a six-week low. The single currency has dropped to $1.154 against the US dollar, down 0.3%, as Rome refuse to back down over its spending plans. Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio raised the stakes by insisting that his government will stick to its deficit target - of 2.4% of GDP. He told a radio interview: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are not turning back from that 2.4 percent target, that has to be clear ... We will not backtrack by a millimetre.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Italian bonds have also weakened today, pushing the gap with safe-haven German debt to a four-year high. Di Maio has insisted that his government aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning to leave the euro...but also blasted Brussels officials for fuelling the crisis. Investors are fretting that the eurozone crisis could be poised for another act. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: The administration in Rome are set to be on a collision course with Brussels over the proposed size of its deficit. Traders are worried that Italy might be aiming to exit the euro and or the EU, but Luigi Di Maio, one of the joint Deputy Prime Ministers denied those claims this morning. The political rumbling in Italy is weighing on their banking sector due to its exposure to the Italian government bond market. The UNI Global Union, a collection of 900 unions from 150 countries, is also pushing Amazon to do more for its workers. UNI Global Union General Secretary Christy Hoffman argues that Jeff Bezos must do better. She also points out that Amazon workers who are members of ver.di, the largest service worker union in Germany, began a two-day strike on Monday to push for pay increases. Hoffman says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A trillion-dollar company headed by the richest man in the world should pay its workers a wage above the poverty line. While this is a step forward, it is a long way from where Amazon needs to be. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These pay rises come only after workers and communities have demanded better from the company\u00e2\u20ac\u201dincluding Amazon workers striking in Germany today. Instead of giving Amazon pats on the back, unions around the world will continue pushing Amazon until it is a truly responsible global company, until it recognises union rights.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move comes four weeks after the Archbishop of Canterbury warned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic model was broken, with the gap between the rich (led by Jeff Bezos) and the poor widening. Archbishop Welby is part of a new commission on Economic Justice, led by the IPPR thinktank. It proposed a swathe of measures including a higher minimum wage, more protection for workers, and better regulation of digital firms. IPPR director Tom Kibasi has tweeted that Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage increases are a start: UK opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn has tweeted that Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay increase shows the power that workers can have if they work together. However, US Amazon workers have found it extremely hard to unionise. Some have reported intense pressure from management when they tried to form a union. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay hike may also be a sign that the company is finding it harder to recruit staff, especially with Black Friday and Christmas coming up... This is from Mike Jakeman, PwC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global economist: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unions aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too impressed by Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay rise - and are urging the company to improve working conditions too. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Amazon is a trillion-dollar company. It can easily afford to pay staff higher wages. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If Amazon is really serious about looking after its workforce it must recognise trade unions. And it must end the exploitative working practices that have seen hundreds of ambulances called to its UK warehouses. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All workers deserve decent conditions at work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not surveillance, inhuman targets and the threat of a disciplinary if they to go to the toilet. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement is the result of campaigning by the GMB and unions around the world. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a start and shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be spun as a huge act of generosity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in 2016, journalist James Bloodworth worked undercover at an Amazon warehouse, and reported that some staff were urinating in bottles because they feared disciplinary action if they took a toilet break. What could possibly have prompted Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sudden largesse? Well, the company has been facing rising criticism on both sides of the Atlantic for its business practices, from pay and conditions to its tax bills. Progressive US senator Bernie Sanders has targeted the company with a new bill called Stop BEZOS. It would penalise companies whose poorly paid staff were forced to take welfare payments to make ends meet. Amazon is one of the biggest employers of those who receive food stamps in the United States, with nearly one in three Amazon workers on food stamps in Arizona and one in 10 in Pennsylvania and Ohio. European workers are also unhappy. There have been strikes in Italy, Germany and Spain as unions demand better pay and conditions from the company. UK workers have also warned that conditions at Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warehouses are below standard, with ambulances had been called out 600 times to the online retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK warehouses in the past three years. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay rise won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t address those issues, but may show that Amazon has recognised it has a serious problem. And just yesterday, chancellor Philip Hammond called for urgent reforms to the way big technology firms are taxed. Amazon actually halved its UK corporation tax bill last year to \u00c2\u00a34.5m, despite continuing to grow strongly - often at the expense of traditional retailers. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dramatic wage increases: Amazon had previously paid its UK staff \u00c2\u00a38 per hour, or \u00c2\u00a38.20 in London. So staff in the capital are getting a pay rise of up to 28%, while those in the rest of the country could earn 18% more. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a whopping inflation-busting increase, especially as average UK wages are rising by less than 3% at present. Newsflash: Amazon is also hiking its minimum wage in the UK too. It just announced it will now pay at least \u00c2\u00a310.50 per hour in London, and \u00c2\u00a39.50 across the rest of the UK. As in America, the rise will apply to all full-time, part-time, temporary (including those hired by agencies), and seasonal employees from the start of November. Amazon says 17,000 staff, and 20,000 seasonal employees, will benefit. Doug Gurr, Amazon VP and UK Country Manager, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will impact more than 37,000 employees across the country, resulting in higher pay for them and their families.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd For comparison, the UK minimum wage for those over 25 is \u00c2\u00a37.83 per hour, or \u00c2\u00a37.38 for those under 25. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction to Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to raise its minimum wage to twice the US minimum: Amazon have also released a Q&amp;A about their pay rise. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Does this apply to Whole Foods and your other subsidiaries? Yes. The new Amazon $15 minimum wage applies to all U.S. employees at Amazon and its subsidiaries. How are you going to work with Congress to raise the federal minimum wage? Our public policy team will work with policymakers in Washington, D.C., to advocate for a higher federal minimum wage. What do you want the federal minimum wage to be raised to? We believe $7.25 is too low. We would look to Congress to decide the parameters of a new, higher federal minimum wage. In another important move, Amazon is going to lobby Congress to raise the Federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour. Jay Carney, Senior Vice President of Amazon Global Corporate Affairs, says: We will be working to gain Congressional support for an increase in the federal minimum wage. The current rate of $7.25 was set nearly a decade ago. We intend to advocate for a minimum wage increase that will have a profound impact on the lives of tens of millions of people and families across this country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new $15/hour minimum wage will apply to all full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal workers in the US. It will begin on November 1st, meaning staff should have a little more cash in their pockets for Thanksgiving and Christmas spending. Newsflash from America: E-commerce giant Amazon is raising its minimum wage for US workers to DOUBLE the US minimum. It will now pay at least $15 per hour, compared to the national floor of $7.25 per hour. Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO (and the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest man), says Amazon has responded to criticism over the way it treats its staff. Bezos is now urging other companies to do the same.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd https://twitter.com/LJKawa/status/1047064119751467009 Back in the markets, European stocks have lost ground today as the optimism over the new US-Mexico-Canada trade deal fizzles out. In London, the FTSE 100 has lost almost 50 points to 7448. Royal Mail shares have dropped 7.8% to their lowest level since the company floated in 2014, after a whopping profits warning yesterday. Oil giants BT and Shell are bucking the trend, though; their shares have risen, matching the higher oil price today. The German DAX and French CAC are both down around 1%, while Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB has sunk lower as the row over the 2019 Italian budget worries investors. The relief following the new NAFTA deal did not last long, points out Fiona Cincotta of City Index. She adds: Expectations that the agreement would somehow translate into the easing of trade tensions with China proved wishful thinking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c President Trump poured cold water over those with a sobering comment. Unlike the markets, US officials believe that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach will eventually wear China down by stifling foreign investment and discouraging companies to use China as part of their production chain, such as in the case of Apple and its iPhones, and forcing the country to agree to the concessions asked by the US. Brexit may make it much harder for British builders to find skilled staff, warns Blane Perrotton of property consultancy and surveyors Naismiths. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the government confirming its plans to make it harder for European workers to come to the UK after Brexit, the construction industry could become an early casualty. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Across the UK, one in 10 builders is an EU national \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this figure rises to a third in London. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With UK construction already struggling from a chronic skills shortage and Brexit sapping investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 confidence, British builders need restrictions on European workers like they need a hole in the head.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail crisis is also hurting UK construction. With scores of stores closing, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less demand for builders to knock up new outlets, argues. Max Jones of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking says this makes it tougher for construction firms to find work: The commercial sub-sector is facing myriad headwinds, with the London market still heavily exposed to Brexit uncertainty and retail suffering an annus horribilis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Against this background, many contractors are betting big on infrastructure, yet there is only so much work to go round. And with some questioning the merit of the current pipeline of megaprojects, it underlines that there is no risk-free part of the market in which to be invested.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders have plenty to worry about, including Brexit: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite the biggest rise in new orders since December 2016, the sector remained in a downbeat mood with business optimism at its second lowest level since the beginning of 2013. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A cause of this malaise pointed to increased cost burdens with both fuel prices on the rise, and acute shortages in raw materials, as supplier delivery times have lengthened to an extent not seen since 2015. The Brexit blot on the landscape was still in evidence as housing activity slowed to a pre-April growth rate and clients hesitated to place orders. Civil engineering was hit the hardest however and under 50 for the second month in a row, which points towards another contraction. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI report suggests British builders are struggling, because clients are too worried about Brexit to commit to new projects. Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit (who wrote the report), explains: Construction companies continued to note that political uncertainty acted a key drag on decision- making, with Brexit worries encouraging a wait-and- see approach to spending among clients. The main areas reported as likely to see a boost in the coming year were construction work related to large-scale energy and transport projects.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: Growth in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building sector has fallen to a six-month low. Data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI (which measures activity in the sector) fell to 52.1 in September, down from 52.9 in August. Civil engineering suffered particularly badly, with growth contracting. Worryingly, business confidence across the sector fell to its second-lowest level in over five years - even though new orders picked up. Markit blames uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union, saying: Construction companies noted that political uncertainty and investor concerns about Brexit had dampened confidence in September. Where a rise in business activity was projected, forthcoming energy and transport projects remained the main areas of optimism. Builders also reporting that they were forced to pay more for fuel (thanks to the rising oil price), and for raw materials such as timber. More to follow.... Rising oil prices aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great news for the car industry. If petrol becomes pricier, it may deter some consumers from buying a new motor. But another issue is casting a shadow over the Paris Motor Show today - Brexit. Dieter Zetsche, the CEO of Daimler, has warned that the risk Britain leaves the EU without a deal is a serious worry. Zetsche told the Motor Show that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Possible scenarios are highly worrying. We have analysed possible scenarios since the (2016 Brexit) referendum to prepare ourselves. In sum, it is an extraordinarily sad development.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Peugeot is also concerned. Its European boss, Maxime Picat, told Reuters that its UK manufacturing could suffer if new trade barriers are set up after Brexit. Picat warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been doing all we can to develop our UK business, restore Vauxhall and Opel profitability, reinvesting in Luton and improving our sites\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 competitiveness in order to help them face up to an uncertain future. But there are limits. Those limits are customs barriers,and the loss of freedom of movement, for people and goods. If we get to that point, we will be obliged to take measures. If we suddenly have to start manufacturing for the UK in the UK, and for Europe in Europe, there will necessarily be an impact on UK production. Back in the UK, London house prices have continued to fall. Prices in the capital dropped by 0.7% in the last three months - the fifth quarterly drop in a row, according to the Nationwide building society. More here: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lots of chatter that oil could be heading back to $100 per barrel - a level last seen in September 2014. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group, for example, thinks the loss of Iranian supplies will keep prices buoyant: Concerns over tighter supply ahead of the Iran embargo are keeping the bulls firmly in control. Iran supplies almost 3% of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daily oil consumption, so any sanctions on Iran will hit the supply side of the equation, and hard. Supply is looking fragile and when you then throw in Venezuela\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declining output, the price looks well supported at $85 with $100 in sight. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Julian Lee agrees that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack on Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy (triggered by his withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal) are partly to blame: The loss of nearly a million barrels a day [from Iran] and the prospect of more to follow, have done more than anything else to revive the possibility of $100 oil. Little wonder Trump has tweeted his frustration at an increasingly powerless OPEC. Most members of that group are already producing as much as they can. Even if they could squeeze out more barrels, doing so would only raise worries about diminishing the cushion of spare capacity to offset any future disruption to supply. Oil at $100 a barrel would be bad news for drivers everywhere \u00e2\u20ac\u201d including those in the U.S. \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and the sanctions on Iran are making it increasingly likely. With the midterm elections looming, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise that the president is trying to deflect blame for outcome of his foreign policy onto foreign oil producers. Oil has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sprung another gusher overnight\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Stephen Innes of trading firm OANDA, as he watches the US crude price hit a fresh four year high. He believes the new USMCA trade deal is also pushing crude prices up: Ultimately the markets remain singularly focused on the prospect of supply disruptions from Iran which is the primary driver of oil prices. And of course, the US/Mexico/Canada trade agreement will have a longer-term positive impact on oil prices in a broader macro context. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets fears that higher oil prices will choke off growth, at a time when trade war fears are also hurting confidence: IMF head Christine Lagarde warned yesterday that the fund was likely to be downgrading its global growth outlook in the coming days, and its hard to argue that an oil price that could be heading towards $90 a barrel at a time when economic activity is slowing, is conducive to a strong growth picture. If anything, it will act as a pinch on consumer spending and could well choke it off altogether if it moves towards $100. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The oil price is on a tear, hitting its highest level in four years, sparking speculation that the world economy could return to the era of $100 per barrel again. Brent crude - sourced from the North Sea - has jumped over $85 per barrel, a level last seen in November 2014. US crude has also hit a four-year high this morning, surging to nearly $76 per barrel. The oil price has now surged by 50% in the last 12 months, driving up transport costs and threatening to drag on global growth. This won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t please Donald Trump, who has been been loudly lobbying Opec to get the oil price down, fearing it will hurt American consumers. But the president must take some responsibility - his sanctions on Iran are one factor driving prices up. Analysts estimate that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s block on Iranian oil exports could remove 1.5 million barrels per day from the global market. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a significant loss, at a time when global demand is rising towards 100 million barrels per day. Oil, after all, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t immune to the law of supply and demand. As Norbert Ruecker, head of commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer, puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oil prices continue to climb, supported by the nearing Iran embargo and related supply concerns. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The supply situation looks fragile indeed, as any additional shortfall such as a deterioration of the situation in Venezuela would tighten oil supplies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking the oil price closely through the day. Also coming up today It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quiet day on the economic front, but we will find out how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders fared last month. Investors will also be watching Italy nervously, as the row with Brussels over its budget deepens. European finance ministers may discuss the situation as they gather for an ECOFIN meeting in Brussels later today.

Fearing a shock that would tip the economy into a multiyear depression and fundamentally alter many of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regional economic and financial relationships, the Syriza government opted for an orthodox approach, even though it had won both the election and the referendum by backing a political agenda that advocated doing the opposite. </p> <p>The hope of many investors \u00e2\u20ac\u201d as well as EU officials, ECB officials and several policy makers in European capitals \u00e2\u20ac\u201d is that the Italian government will perform a similar pivot, even though the immediate default risk is lower.

Sources close to an Italian cabinet meeting told Corriere dell Sera that the government would bow to EU pressure to reduce its budget deficit to 2% of GDP by 2021. This was enough to convince UBS, which stated that it was going to be overweight in two year Italian bonds and that the market now looked cheap for short-dated Italian debt. The bank is still prudently cautious on longer term Italian bonds but fears over a short term default seem to be ebbing.</p> <p>There will be some relief on trading desks in London and New York this afternoon, but if there is anything that is certain, it is the uncertainty of Italian politics. The country could still be downgraded, and it is being run by a coalition that has more than enough scope to fall apart.

                "bodyText":"The clash over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new budget plans have sparked memories of the Greek debt crisis. Withe relations between Rome and Brussels deteriorating, some investors are wondering if we could see a repeat of the drama of 2015, with another populist government promising to challenge the eurozone status quo. But others think not - pointing out that Italy doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the same borrowing needs, or any sign of being locked out of the borrowing markets. Another factor - Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two trillion euro debt is simply too large for Brussels to risk a default. Mohamed A. El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at German investment giant Allianz, says: What ultimately saved Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership in the euro zone a few years ago was the imminent threat of default. Fearing a shock that would tip the economy into a multiyear depression and fundamentally alter many of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regional economic and financial relationships, the Syriza government opted for an orthodox approach, even though it had won both the election and the referendum by backing a political agenda that advocated doing the opposite. The hope of many investors \u00e2\u20ac\u201d as well as EU officials, ECB officials and several policy makers in European capitals \u00e2\u20ac\u201d is that the Italian government will perform a similar pivot, even though the immediate default risk is lower. In doing so, Rome would need to design a more comprehensive program aimed at generating high, inclusive and sustainable growth. Wall Street remains on track for yet another record close tonight. Fiona Cincotta of City Index attributes the rally, in part, to optimism over Italy. She writes: Some traders have been looking past the Brexit and tariff issues which have dominated headlines recently and have seen the iceberg that is the Italian debt situation looming ahead. Fears also seem to be subsiding on news that the Italian government has said it would cut its debt and not go on the spending binge it had previously indicated. Sources close to an Italian cabinet meeting told Corriere dell Sera that the government would bow to EU pressure to reduce its budget deficit to 2% of GDP by 2021. This was enough to convince UBS, which stated that it was going to be overweight in two year Italian bonds and that the market now looked cheap for short-dated Italian debt. The bank is still prudently cautious on longer term Italian bonds but fears over a short term default seem to be ebbing. There will be some relief on trading desks in London and New York this afternoon, but if there is anything that is certain, it is the uncertainty of Italian politics. The country could still be downgraded, and it is being run by a coalition that has more than enough scope to fall apart. Yields on the two year Italian government bond jumped more than 60 basis points in two weeks to around 1.49% on Tuesday, but that should come down somewhat in days to come, barring further fractures in the Italian coalition. Back in the markets, the conciliatory noises from Rome helped shares to close higher in Milan, and beyond. The FTSE MIB index ended the day up 0.85%. Britian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 and the French CAC both finished nearly 0.5% higher, as fears of another eurozone crisis receded (for the moment, anyway). The IMF has also warned that governments haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t done enough to protect themselves from the next downturn. It says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153risks tend to rise during good times, such as the current period of low interest rates and subdued volatility, and those risks can always migrate to new areas.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has warned that the world is still suffering from the 2008 financial crisis. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF warns that the crisis may have had lasting effects on potential growth and inequality, as well as slashing output and hurting productivity. It says: For example, fertility rates have been on a steeper decline in many economies\u00e2\u20ac\u201da development that will drag on the size of the labor force in the future in those countries. Another effect is that net migration (immigration minus emigration) rates among advanced economies declined after the crisis. The Fund also points out that some countries fared better than others: Those in better fiscal shape, with better regulated and supervised banks, and flexible exchange rates generally suffered less damage. Developments in Italy.... The oil price is hovering close to a four-year high today, at $84.55 per barrel. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad news for energy consumers, and drivers. US president Donald Trump has blamed Opec, urging the cartel to boost production. But his Russian counterpart, Valdimir Putin, says Trump must take responsibility. Bloomberg has the details: Russian President Vladimir Putin said his American counterpart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Iran sanctions are largely to blame for current high oil prices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153President Trump considers that the price is high; he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly right, but let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s be honest,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Putin said at the Russian Energy Week conference in Moscow on Wednesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald, if you want to find the culprit for the rise in prices, you need to look in the mirror.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The US stock market has opened higher, amid optimism that the Italian budget row might be resolved. This has driven the Dow Jones industrial average up to a new all-time high, gaining 135 points or 0.5% to 26,909. Investors are welcoming economy minister Tria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge that the Italian government will seek to reduce the deficit over the next few years, says Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA. He adds: In the near-term, concerns about Italy are primarily related to spending and the impact on its already bloated debts but in the longer-term, they also reflect the very real risk that the public could become more eurosceptic and talk of referendums could follow. For now, this is likely to be some time away and the fragility of the Italian banking sector and still large holdings of Italian bonds make investors very nervous. Over in Paris, European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici has welcomed the news that Italy appears to be revising its borrowing plans. He told Reuters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good signal that the trajectory has been revised because it shows that the Italian authorities are hearing the concerns and remarks from their partners and the European Commission.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But, he also cautioned that Rome could still breach EU rules on structural deficits next year, if it borrows as much as 2.4% of GDP to balance its books. Deputy Italian PM Matteo Salvani has also said that the government will publish its multi-year budget later today. Italian bonds are continuing to rally, following economy minister Giovanni Tria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge that its deficit will fall in 2020 and 2021 (after rising in 2019). The yield on Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year debt has now dropped to just 3.3%, from over 3.4% when fears over Rome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget were raging yesterday. However, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still close to a four-year high, reflecting concern over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal plans. Emanuele Canegrati of trading firm BP Prime fears that the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts will prove too optimistic, meaning it struggle to hit borrowing targets. Just in: Matteo Salvini, the head of the right-wing League party, has insisted that his government is sticking to its target of a 2.4% budget deficit next year. No mention of 2020 or 2021, though..... Salvani is also insisting that growth will pick up next year -- despite employers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lobby group Confindustria slashing its forecasts today. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is still sharply higher today, on relief that Rome might be backing away from a major clash with Brussels. The FTSE MIB is up 1.3%, led by banking stocks such as Unicredit (+1.4%), and Intesa Sanpaulo (+1.85%). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Associated Press\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget plans: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy minister is backing down on spending plans that would keep the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit at an elevated level for three years. Giovanni Tria said Wednesday in Rome that the deficit to GDP ratio would be gradually reduced after 2019. The remark confirms a report by Corriere della Sera that the 2.4-percent budget deficit in the new spending plan would apply only to next year. The government also released a statement late Tuesday saying that officials were working on a proposal that would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153accelerate the decline in the debt-to-GDP relationship over the course of three years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apparent softening was providing relief to financial markets, where investors are concerned that the planned spike in Italian spending will harm efforts to reduce its debt pile. Boom! Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy Minister Giovanni Tria has let the gatto out of the bag. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmed that the Italian government now plans to cut the budget deficit in 2020 and 2021, after letting it rise in 2019 (probably to 2.4% of national output). Speaking to a group of industrialist in Rome, Tria says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The deficit will increase compared with the previous forecast in 2019, but then there will be a gradual reduction in the following years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That suggests that, as predicted this morning, Rome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is moving away from aiming for a 2.4% deficit per year from 2019 to 2021 -- after pressure from the EU (and from the markets). But that creates a problem. How can the coalition deliver on its pledges without borrowing more? Ferdinando Giugliano of Bloomberg says there is very little room for manoeuvre: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s populist government have good reason to consider breaching EU spending rules. After many years of lacklustre growth, the Italian economy needs a boost. And with a massive national debt around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2 trillion, what damage does a little more borrowing do, especially if it delivers faster growth and more jobs - and eventually a bigger tax take - in future? The danger, though, is that a fight with Brussels worries the markets, pushes up borrowing costs, and dampens investment. Holger Schmieding of Berenberg Bank argues that the push to break EU budget rules could backfire: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs fiscal plans and the behaviour of its key political leaders are probably self-defeating. Yes, Italy has underutilised resources. The economy may well respond for a while to a fiscal stimulus such as the one Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs radical coalition is planning against the advice if its own finance minister. However, picking a noisy fight with Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European partners could stoke euro exit fears and depress economic sentiment by more than the fiscal stimulus could lift investment intentions and consumer spending. On the other hand, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the right-wing Northern League won this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election with their promises to cut taxes, boost welfare spending and push back against EU rules. Being blocked by Brussels won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dampen eurosceptic voices in Italy either.... Newsflash: Deputy Italian PM Luigi Di Maio has been speaking about the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget plans. According to Bloomberg, Di Maio has insisted that his government is sticking with its target of a deficit of 2.4% of GDP in 2019, despite pressure from the EU to bring it down. But, Di Maio is also suggesting that borrowing could be lower in 2020 and 2021, as faster growth would mean the deficit would be a smaller proportion of the economy [that assumes growth picks up, of course]. Di Maio also says the government is committed to key policies, such as a basic income for citizens: Just in: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector grew steadily last month, despite Brexit anxiety. Data firm Markit reports that its services PMI index, which measures activity, dipped to 53.9 in September from 54.3 in August. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Firms reported that new order growth eased off a little last month, amid ongoing political uncertainty. Happily, they still kept hiring staff, with some firms pushing up salaries to attract employees. Unhappily, business confidence is still low, as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looming exit from the EU makes bosses fret about the future. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says the UK economy appears to be expanding at a reasonable rate, despite subdued business optimism. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The service sector continued to report solid steady business growth in September which, alongside news of sustained expansions in both manufacturing and construction, suggests the UK economy expanded by just under 0.4% in the third quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The data therefore add to signs that the economy has enjoyed robust growth since the rocky start to the year, when extreme weather disrupted business. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit worries continue to dominate the outlook, however, keeping business optimism firmly anchored at levels which would normally be indicative of an imminent slowdown. Thu LanNguyen, a FX strategist at Commerzbank, has warned that the market recovery may not last (via Reuters): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That the Italian government is trying to appease its EU partners can be seen as a step in the right direction and therefore justifies some euro-positive reaction. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The devil is in the details. The euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery will only continue if the new fiscal plans are also feasible. Disappointing news from Italy -- employers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lobby group Confindustria has cut its growth forecasts. Confindustria now expects GDP to only rise by 0.9% in 2019, down from 1.1% previously. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather less than the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official target of 1.6%. Confindustria blamed America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade wars, and the turmoil in emerging markets such as Argentina and Italy. If they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right, then it will be harder for Rome to keep within its deficit targets. Back in the City, Aston Martin has made an underwhelming debut on the stock exchange. The luxury carmaker floated its shares at \u00c2\u00a319 this morning, valuing it at \u00c2\u00a34.3bn. It was even invited to ring the opening bell in London, with a few swanky models parked outside the exchange too. The company will have been hoping for the traditional \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIPO pop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. But instead, shares soon made a screeching turn downwards, hitting just \u00c2\u00a317.75. This means Aston Martin isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on track to burst into the FTSE 100, as had been rumoured. At one stage, the company had hoped to float its shares at over \u00c2\u00a322. Neil Wilson of Markets.com suggests the City is taking a sober view of its prospects. The strike price may be a disappointment for the owners \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a long way short of the \u00c2\u00a322.50 talked about previously as the top of the range. But this is a fairer valuation when you compare with peers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c notably Ferrari \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and therefore this price could offer an in for longer term investors that the higher valuation would not have afforded. After days of losses, Italian government bonds are looking a little perkier too. The yield (or interest rate) on Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year debt has dropped back to 3.33%, from a four-year high of 3.46% overnight. That suggests investors see the debt as less risky. Shorter-term Italian debt is also rallying, even though the Italian cabinet meeting hasnt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 actually happened yet, so nothing is agreed... Italian bank shares have jumped by 3% in Milan. Traders are welcoming the news that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government may be bowing to EU pressure, and trimming its planned budget deficit. This has lifted the Italian FTSE MIB index by over 1% in early trading. The euro has risen by 0.3% in early trading against the US dollar, to $1.158, having hit a six-week low on Tuesday. Reuters is also reporting that Italy is planning to rein in its deficit plans, following pressure from the EC: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government targets for the budget deficit to fall to 2.2% of gross domestic product in 2020 and to 2% in 2021 from an expected 2.4 percent next year, a government source from the right-wing League party said on Wednesday. The 2020-2021 numbers were first reported by daily Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said late on Tuesday that Rome aimed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153accelerate the decline in the debt-GDP ratio in a consistent fashion over a three-year period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, without giving any numbers. The coalition last week said it planned to run a deficit of 2.4% of GDP over the next three years, tripling the previous target, unnerving markets and prompting criticism from European Commission officials. Conte is due to meet with key ministers to discuss the budget targets for 2019-2021 at around 1100 GMT on Wednesday,another government source added. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Is peace breaking out between Rome and Brussels in the budget row that has spooked the markets? There are reports from Italy this morning that its populist government is giving some ground, in the dispute over its spending plans. Italian PM Giuseppe Conte is holding a cabinet meeting with ministers later today to discuss the situation. According to Corriere della Sera, ministers are considering a new plan under which its budget deficit would drop to 2.2% of GDP in 2020, and 2% in 2021. As Bloomberg puts it: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government will bow to European Union pressure to reduce its budget deficit to 2 percent of gross domestic product in 2021, reversing plans to maintain a bigger shortfall for the next three years, Corriere della Sera reported, citing a Cabinet meeting Previously, Rome had been gunning for a 2.4% deficit over the next three years, which would have breached Brussels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fiscal rules and triggered an almighty row with the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-largest member. This (reported) climbdown comes after several days of market jitteriness, in which Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government bonds have weakened. On Tuesday, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year borrowing costs hit a four-year high. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even been chatter about exiting the euro and returning to the lira (although as Greece discovered this is easier said than done). Italy needs to send its draft budget plan to the European Commission by the middle of October. Yesterday, deputy prime minister Luigi Di Maio insisted that the government wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yield \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one millimetre\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the dispute, as it presses on with its spending plans, so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cabinet meeting could be lively. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking events in Italy through the day.... Also coming up today The International Monetary Fund releases details of its latest assessment of the world economy. The latest Purchasing Managers Index reports are expected to show that UK and eurozone service sector firms grew steadily last month. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: Having seen manufacturing beat expectations and construction slip back, the focus will be on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK services number to round off Q3 and a decent economic performance for the quarter. Thus far for Q3 services activity came in at 54.3 for July and 53.5 in August. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s September number is expected to show a slight decline to 54, which would be pretty much in line with the average, and point to another fairly decent expansion. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also services PMI day for Spain, Italy, France and Germany and here the numbers are slightly better than the manufacturing numbers we saw on Monday. For Spain and Italy expectations are for improvements to 52.9 and 52.8 respectively, while France and Germany numbers are expected to be confirmed at 54.3 and 56.5, the same as last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flash estimates.

                "bodyText":"And finally, Wall Street has closed firmly in the red. The sharp rises in government bond yields drove the markets lower, although shares did claw their way back from earlier lows. Marketwatch explains: The Dow finished down by about 200 points, or 0.8%, to 27,627, but had been down by as many as 357 points, or 1.3% at session lows. Still, Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline for the blue-chip gauge amounted to its worst since July 11, according to FactSet data. Goodnight! GW The scene on Wall Street today: Wall Street is on track for its worst day in several months. The Dow Jones industrial average is currently down 325 points or 1.2% at 26,504 points. Quite a bump, given it hit a record high yesterday. Mark DeCambre of Marketwatch says: A drop of that severity would mark the blue-chip benchmark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst one-day decline since about May 29, according to FactSet data. He too blames bond volatility: The slump comes as the 10-year Treasury yield has punched up to seven-year highs at 3.21%, causing investors in stocks to reassess the comparative appeal of equities, considered risky assets, against so-called risk-free government debt. After a bad day, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 1oo closed down 91 points or 1.2%, at 7418. The French CAC also suffered, losing 1.5%. The sell off on Wall Street is gathering pace too: Fiona Cincotta of City Index confirms that rising bond yields (as prices fall) has rattled stock markets: Bond yields are rising and the stock markets are getting worried. With the US economy powering ahead and the Federal Reserve all but certain to raise interest rates in December and then next year US Treasury yields started rising at great speed this week. Although all the factors like strong economic data and the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy signals have been in place for a while now, the absence of trade disputes whiplash and the first signs of worry that US stocks are overbought came together and triggered Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s U-turn in US stocks Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister has been forced to defend his country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bank performance today after lenders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shares nosedived on fears of bad loans this week. Addressing parliament Euclid Tsakalotos said Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high stock of non-performing loans was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153totally manageable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The government, he said was in constant discussion about the best ways of dealing with bad debt holdings amid fears that banks are not stabilising fast enough. His comments follow an eye-popping sell off of bank shares. On Wednesday the FTSE Athex banks index dropped by as much as 18 percent, with Piraeus Bank shares reeling to their lowest level ever after its CEO let slip in an interview that the lender was considering issuing debt to boost capital. If that weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad enough any desire that Athens may have had to return to international borrowing markets after years depending on bailout funds also seems to have been nipped in the bud with spreads on Greek bonds deemed too high to make a market foray in the coming months. After exiting its third and final bailout in August, the leftist led government was hoping the country would return to markets this year. Bond markets have woken up to the strength of the US economy, and the likelihood of several more rate rises in the coming quarters. So says Will Hobbs of Barclays Smart Investor, who adds that investors shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic, despite shares, bonds and many currencies falling today: We suspect the fact that the bond market is taking what amounts to a more positive view on the prospects for US economic growth is a positive for the world economy, emerging markets included. With this in mind, we actually added to emerging market equities this week in our tactical portfolio, taking profit on our long held overweight position in US stocks. We still cannot see the next global recession on the horizon. Our main indicators are telling us quite clearly that for the next 6 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 12 months, portfolios should still be focused on stocks, in both emerging and developed worlds, over high quality corporate and government bonds. The run into Christmas will no doubt give us plenty of jarring political and economic headlines to digest, but our view remains that it is the continuing health of the US and global economy that matters most for capital markets. A broad based sell-off swept across Europe today, says David Madden of CMC Markets, triggered by falling bond prices. The prospect of four rate hikes from the Federal Reserve in the next 12 months, is driving up US government bond yields. Traders are worried that EM counties will be hit by higher borrowing costs, and in turn it could damage their economies. The Indian rupee has reached another record low, and the Turkish lira is weaker too as investors are fearful we could be heading for an EM crisis. Global stock markets are a sea of red ink today, as investors fret about heavy losses in the bond market. Shares are down across Europe, and have also opened sharply lower in America. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is flirting with a triple-digit loss, as the drop in car sales adds to the gloomy mood in the City. Bond prices are also in retreat, triggered by a big fall in US Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on Wednesday, as investors anticipate hikes in US interest rates to calm its economy. Pierre Veyret of ActivTrades says the U.S. bonds sell-off has spooked investors on all continents. An important sell-off in U.S. Government bonds took place on Wednesday evening, after stronger-than-expected data on both non-manufacturing and private sectors took most of investors by surprise. This morning, European traders went back to their desk to see a significant drop during the Asian session. Newsflash from America: US factory orders have posted their fastest rise in almost a year. Manufacturing orders rose by 2.3% in August, faster than expected, led by a rise in aircraft sales. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the strongest gain since September 2017, and another sign that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is looking strong, despite the trade war with China. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Press Association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Demand for new cars fell by around 20% in September, according to an industry body. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said around 339,000 new cars were registered during what is normally one of the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strongest months due to the release of new number plates. Diesel and petrol registrations were down year-on-year, with a modest rise for alternatively fuelled cars such as pure electrics and hybrids. The SMMT said the decline was mainly due to changes to the way new cars are tested, with tougher emissions regulations introduced in the European Union. The organisation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive Mike Hawes told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This year we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had the first major change in the way you test vehicles - the first change in about 30 years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That has led to some major challenges in terms of supply because you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to change the entire European model range, put them through the test, and that takes a considerable amount of time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some manufacturers have had short supply which has meant sales have been down.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mr Hawes added that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153demand is down a bit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd due to a drop in business and consumer confidence due to uncertainty over Brexit. The EY Item Club believe Brexit worries and weak consumer confidence are weighing on car sales - even setting aside the disruption caused by the new emission test regime. They say: Private sales could be hampered by consumer purchasing power, which is only improving slowly. Meanwhile, consumer confidence is still relatively fragile with consumers cautious about making major purchases. Indeed consumer confidence fell in September according to the GfK measure. Furthermore, recently higher petrol and diesel prices are hardly the best news for the automotive sector, although they do increase interest in more fuel efficient cars and alternatively fuelled vehicles. Businesses may also be cautious in their car purchases amid significant economic and Brexit uncertainties. Some businesses may choose to delay replacing their vehicles, until the outlook becomes clearer. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the UK car industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mensis horribilis: UK sales of new cars plunged by a fifth in September as new emissions tests caused delivery backlogs, while waning appetite for diesel cars and weaker consumer confidence weighed on demand. A total of 338,834 new cars were sold last month, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), down 20.5% compared with the same month last year. September is traditionally a bumper month for sales as consumers rush to buy cars with new number plates. However, the SMMT said new and more rigorous emissions testing rules created supply problems and a backlog of deliveries as car manufacturerssuffered delays in getting their cars approved.... More here: Last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car sales slump is the worst in a decade. The SMMT tells us that the last time UK car registrations fell by 20% or more in any September was during the recession in September 2008 (when they shrank by 21.2%). The last time sales fell by over 20% in ANY month was October 2010 (-22.2%), partly because sales in October 2009 had been boosted by a vehicle scrappage scheme. Bank bosses are also fretting about the impact of a no-deal Brexit. Ross McEwan, CEO of Royal Bank of Scotland, claimed today that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bad Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could tip the UK into a recession. He warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are assuming 1-1.5% growth for next year, but if we get a bad Brexit then that could be zero or negative, and that would affect our profitability and our share price.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The UK government still owns more than 60% of RBS, following its rescue a decade ago. Its share price is already languishing way below the break-even level. Thanks to September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump, UK car sales have shrunk by 7% during 2018. UK consumers and businesses have bought 1.91 million new vehicles since the start of the year, compared to 2.06 million at the same time a year ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to the 20% contraction in September - usually a big month for new car sales due to the number place change. But the decline goes deeper too, and highlights how consumer and business confidence is fragile. Ana Nicholls, automotive analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts that sales will bottom out next year, IF a chaotic Brexit is avoided: The EIU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core forecast is still that the UK will get an EU trade deal in 2021, after a transition period. If that happens, then the current drop in UK car sales should level out in 2019, with some modest growth in 2020-22 that should help to tide the industry over any disruption. But the risks of a no-deal Brexit have risen in the past month, and that could make conditions in the auto industry much more difficult.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sunderland Central MP Julie Elliott, who represents many Nissan workers, is concerned by the slump in car sales - and Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning about a no-deal Brexit. Elliott (who supports the Best For Britain campaign to stop Brexit) says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The warnings from the motor industry could not be clearer - a bad deal will damage large parts of the economy, risk jobs and create huge business uncertainty. Brexit fantasy is crashing head-first into reality. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have said consistently for many years that we need a decent trade deal to protect the Nissan plant in Sunderland and the tens of thousands of jobs that depend on that plant. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Theresa May should urgently drop her ludicrous red lines on Brexit, and listen to businesses who are clearly spelling out that they need certainty when it comes to Customs arrangements.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just car dealers who are struggling to find buyers. UK furniture group DFS has reported a 50% tumble in profits for the last year today. It blamed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exceptional downturn in market demand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over the summer (partly because it was too hot to go furniture shopping). DFS (no stranger to a sale) also warned that Brexit uncertainty is hurting consumers. Overall we expect the market to remain subdued into 2019, constrained by political risk and weak consumer sentiment... The group continues to face a particularly uncertain UK consumer market in the run up to Brexit in March next year. Chris Brook-Carter, managing director of Retail Week, says the drop in car sales is a worrying economic signal: Alex Buttle, director, car buying comparison website Motorway.co.uk, says the 20% plunge in car sales is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153astonishing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He fears that Brexit uncertainly will hurt the industry in the months ahead: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are now entering a crucial and unprecedented period for the car industry, as the next new number plate will be March 2019 when the UK is due to leave the EU. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to be a rollercoaster ride for new car sales figures for the foreseeable future, but it feels like we have just plunged into a deep canyon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit will start to weigh much heavier on the shoulders of the car industry over the coming months, particularly if a deal isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t thrashed out with the EU. And either way, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really know how consumers are going to react. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If already fragile consumer confidence is fractured by a no-deal scenario, then we are likely to see many big ticket purchases like new cars put on hold. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The car industry, just like any other business sector, needs certainty, and Brexit squabbles mean we are way off finding any sense of that at the moment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car sales shocker will have sent a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153collective ouch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd echoing through the industry, says Ian Gilmartin, Head of Retail &amp; Wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking: He adds: With car manufacturers focused on ensuring they are in line with new regulations and given the reluctance of buyers to commit to big purchases, in part due to Brexit uncertainty, it does look likely that as year-end approaches we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be down on 2017 for full-year sales.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Disappointingly, even electric cars got caught up in the September malaise on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecourts. Sales of alternatively fuelled vehicles only rose by 3.9% year-on-year to 23,507, having been rising by over 20% since January. Diesel sales took a major thump, though, down 42% year-on-year to 98,191 from 170,733 in September 2017. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been firmly out of fashion since the VW emissions scandal showed that diesel cars were rather more polluting than claimed. Ian Plummer, Auto Trader director, points out that Brexit uncertainty has also hurt the car industry this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance was a matter of basic economics; there simply weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough cars on forecourts that met the new WLTP standards for retailers to sell.... \u00e2\u20ac\u01532018 has been very challenging for both retailers and manufacturers, with the fuel debate and Brexit anxieties denting consumer confidence, and inflationary pressure on exchange rates, hitting profits. In another blow for Volkswagen, sales of its Audi brand slumped by 53% in the UK last month. Other major carmakers also found September challenging, amid the struggle to meet new emissions tests. Nissan sales slumped by 41%, casting another shadow over the carmaker just hours after it warned about the impact of Brexit this morning. Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales fell by 16% (slightly better than average), while Honda dropped 26%, but BMW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales only dipped by 11%. Vauxhall did creditably, with sales only down 7%, while Toyota sales were flat. Sean Kemple, Director of Sales at Close Brothers Motor Finance, says ignorance about these new EU emission tests have hurt the car sector: The lack of knowledge around the new legislation has proven detrimental to sales. Dealers who traditionally reap the rewards of the new number plates struggled to stay buoyant as motorists held off buying for now. Digging into the SMMT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, we can see that sales of Volkswagen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plunged by 55% in September. VW only sold 16,283 cars last month, down from 36,332 a year earlier. This cut its market share to just 4.8% from 8.5% (when it was second only to Ford). VW cars are usually popular with British motorists - but both the Golf and the Polo tumbled out of the best sellers chart last month: This may show that VW has been struggling to comply with the new emission tests. Last month, Auto Trader reported that several German carmakers had stopped taking orders for plug-in hybrid cars as they focused on getting petrol and diesel models compliant with the WLTP examination. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, says car sale across Europe have been hit by the new emissions tests brought in to clean up the industry. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the industry given barely a year to reapprove the entire European model line-up, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen bottlenecks and a squeeze on supply. These are exceptional circumstances with similar declines seen in other major European markets. The good news is that, as backlogs ease, consumers and businesses can look forward to a raft of exciting high-tech cars and a market keen to recover lost momentum.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Why did emissions tests cause such gloom at Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car dealers last month? Well, the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure is a longer, tougher examination of a new car. Brought in after the Volkswagen emission-cheating scandal, it is meant to show motorists how much fuel a car actually uses, and how much pollutants are pumped out. So what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the problem? Every model sold by car manufacturers now has to be tested, leading to bottlenecks at testing centres. If a model hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been tested, it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be sold. This seems to have led to a surge in sales in August, as manufacturers and vendors tried to shift cars before WLTP came into effect. What did the new tests show? Cars are less efficient, and more polluting, than previously admitted. That may have prompted some manufacturers to suspend sales while they tweak their models\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 performance. As Autotrader explained earlier this week: While the actual amount of fuel cars burn (and the volume of pollutants they emit) when driven on the road by motorists hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed, the new criteria mean that during official efficiency assessments, higher readings are recorded. This has led to worse on-paper fuel economy figures for almost every new car on sale in the UK, and higher recorded CO2 emissions, too. Experts estimate measured CO2 emissions have risen between 13 and 22 per cent under WLTP tests when compared to NEDC assessments, for example. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Official: UK car sales crashed by over a fifth last month. New figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that 338,834 new vehicles were registered in September, a fall of 87,000. As flagged up earlier, the SMMT is blaming new tougher emissions tests, which left some manufacturers struggling to keep up. It says there were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexceptional\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 circumstances for the decline: September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s large decline follows an unusually high August and a turbulent first eight months of the year as the market responded to a raft of upheavals, from confusion over diesel policy to VED changes and, latterly, transition to the new WLTP emissions standards. The slump was wide-ranging. Sales to private buyers slumped by 20.1%, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfleet sales\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dropped by 22%, while purchases by businesses dropped by 6,3% The SMMT says: UK new car market falls -20.5% in September to 338,834 units as regulatory changes impact supply. Volumes down across all sectors, as testing backlogs affect consumer, fleet and business deliveries. Industry welcomes tough new certification test, with even greater range of new-tech cars on way. More to follow.... The Danske money-laundering scandal, which rocked Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector last month, has taken another twist. The bank has revealed the US Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation into the revelations that \u00e2\u201a\u00ac200bn from various dubious sources passed though Danske\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small Estonian operation. Danske says it is co-operating (hard not to, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have thought). Interim chief executive, Jesper Nielsen, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are co-operating with the authorities investigating us as a result of the case. However, it is too early to speculate on any outcome of the investigations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The FT reckons Danske, Denmark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest bank, could be hit with a large fine by the DoJ. In other car news, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nissan has warned that a no-deal Brexit would cause major disruption to its huge manufacturing operation in the north-east of England. It says: Today we are among those companies with major investments in the UK who are still waiting for clarity on what the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU will look like. As a sudden change from those rules to the rules of the World Trading Organization will have serious implications for British industry, we urge UK and EU negotiators to work collaboratively towards an orderly balanced Brexit that will continue to encourage mutually beneficial trade.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The statement was released as the Guardian published a Long Read about Nissan today. My colleague David Conn has visited its Sunderland plant, and learned about how the firms \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjust-in-time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 supply chain would be hamstrung by new trade barriers with Europe. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a worrying time for staff too, Conn explains: In the referendum, 61% of Sunderland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voters chose leave. When I visited the plant recently, I talked to several workers as they came off a shift. Most had voted leave. One young man, 24, who, like the others I spoke to, did not want to be named, said he had voted remain because he preferred stability and he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thought we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re fine as we are\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but that older workers around him had voted leave. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They said that they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see a change from before and after we joined the EU, and some said they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the EU making rules for us.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd An older man, 55, pointed to one of the huge sheds behind us and said, like others, that Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s multi-million pound investment in it shows the Sunderland plant is secure. He said he had voted leave to stop immigration, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EU interference\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and because the north-east gets \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bugger all money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the EU. More here: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an example of how the new car emissions tests have led to disruption: The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sean Farrington has pulled together a range of reasons for the slide in car sales: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. September has been the cruellest month for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry. New sales figures due at 9am are expected to show that new registrations tumbled by roughly a fifth last month, adding to the pain in an industry already gripped by Brexit anxiety. September is usually a bumper month for car sales, as motorists splash out on a new plate to impress the neighbours. But preliminary industry data show that demand was 20% lower than in September 2017. So what went wrong? Industry experts are blaming the introduction of new emissions tests, designed to better show how much pollution a car pumps out. Some manufacturers have struggled to get their vehicles approved in time, forcing sales to be suspended. As Reuters puts it: On September 1, Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle TestProcedure (WLTP) came into force in the European Union, which led some brands to incentivise sales in August, pulling forward demand. Certain automakers have been unable to recertify all of their models in time, also disrupting sales in September, which is a key selling month in Britain as one of only two occasions when a new licence plate series is introduced. But, such a sharp decline may also show that consumer confidence is subdued, with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU just six months away. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have more details when the figures are released in about an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. Also coming up today Traders are edgy today as the US dollar soars against its rival currencies. American bond prices have dropped sharply, driving up the interest rate (or yield) on the debt. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, says the selloff in US Treasury bills was the biggest story in the markets last night: This time it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t only the rate-sensitive two-year yields that marched higher. Yields across the curve all saw significant spikes with the 10-year rates jumping above 3.2% for the first time since May 2011, while the longer term 30-year yields traded at the highest level since 2014 reaching 3.37% at the time of writing. Why the bond selloff? Because with US growth looking strong, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very strong feeling that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates again in December. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for the dollar, but bad for bond prices; hitting shares in Asia, and likely to push Europe down too. Plus, the tug-of-war between Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government and the EU will be rumbling on.

                "bodyText":"The day has been dominated by the news that Unilever is abandoning its plans to move its headquarters from London to Rotterdam, bowing down to pressure from institutional investors. The maker of Marmite, Persil and Ben &amp; Jerry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ice cream said it is now considering its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153next steps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Many questions remain, not least what the remarkable climb down means for Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive Paul Polman, and its chairman Marijn Dekkers. The move was welcomed here in the UK, but not so in the Netherlands. European markets remain a sea of red. The FTSE 100 is down 1.1% or 85 points at 7,333. Investors have been concerned about the sell-off in the bond market, as traders factor in faster rate rises by the Fed. Trading on Wall Street is subdued after some mixed US jobs data. Non-farm payrolls came in weaker than expected at 134,000, partly because of Hurricane Florence, but the unemployment rate fell to 3.7% - the weakest since 1969. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thank you for all your comments and please join us again on Monday. US markets are open and this is how it looks: Dow Jones: +0.05% at 26,640 S&amp;P 500: +0.02% at 2,902 Nasdaq: -0.07% at 7,874 The dollar has fallen after the jobs data, helping the pound up 0.5% at $1.3082. Two minutes until the opening bell on Wall Street. Here is our full story on the US jobs report from the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics editor, Larry Elliott: While job creation in the US slowed in September, the unemployment rate fell to a near 49-year low of 3.7%, down from 3.9% in August. Economists were forecasting a smaller dip to 3.8%. Michael Pearce, US economist at Capital Economics says the Federal Reserve will press on with rate hikes despite the weaker non-farm payrolls number: The weaker 134,000 gain in payrolls in September may partly reflect some hit from Hurricane Florence and with large upward revisions to previous months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 gains, plus a fall in the unemployment rate to the lowest level since 1969, there is little in this report to stop the Fed continuing to raise interest rates gradually. US futures rose briefly when the US payrolls figure came in lower than expected but have since dipped back into the red. Bond yields also fell briefly but are now rising again. The yield on 30-year US government bonds has hit a fresh four-year high of 3.396%. The dollar index - measuring the US currency against a basket of others - is flat at 95.75. The US Labor department says the weaker-than-expected figures are partly explained by Hurricane Florence, which affected trade in bars, restaurants and hotels. Hurricane Florence affected parts of the East Coast during the September reference periods for the establishment and household surveys. Employment in leisure and hospitality was little changed over the month (-17,000). Prior to September, employment in the industry had been on a modest upward trend. Some of the weakness in this industry in September may reflect the impact of Hurricane Florence. Breaking: A fairly big downside surprise in non-farm payrolls, which came in at 134,000 in September compared with expectations for 185,000. The figure for August was revised up to 270,000 from 201,000. Annual earnings growth came in at 2.8%, as expected, and down from 2.9% in August. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US non-farm payrolls day, and investors await the figures as keenly as ever. Economists polled by Reuters are predicting 185k for September, up from 204k last month. Average earnings are expected to come in at 2.8%, a touch lower than last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.9%. Rachel Reeves, Labour MP and chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committee, makes the point that Unilever announced the plans to move its headquarters from London after fending off a takeover approach from America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kraft Heinz early last year: Whatever the arguments made for incorporating into the Netherlands, there was a real suspicion that, in the wake of the hostile bid from Kraft Heinz, part of the motive for the move was that UK rules too easily allow takeovers. As a committee, we will want to consider looking at the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s white paper on foreign takeovers to see whether the new regime should include additional safeguards. European markets are a sea of red this morning, as rising US bond yields, pressure on emerging markets, and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rising debts weigh on confidence. FTSE 100: -0.6% at 7,375 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.6% at 12,169 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.4% at 5,387 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -1% at 20,413 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.4% at 9,281 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.5% at 378 David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, says US bond yields could rise further - piling more pressure on emerging markets - if the non-farm payrolls report comes in stronger than expected at 1.30pm (BST): Stocks are firmly in the red as investors are worried about rising US government bond yields, emerging market economies, and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political situation. The rise in US yields could put additional pressure on emerging economies, and the US non-farm payrolls report later today could drive yields even higher if we see a positive update. The Italian government are holding their nerve and are determined to disobey Brussels, and pursue increased government spending in a bid to boost economic activity. The political rumbling regarding Italy might spark another round of the Italian debt crisis. The business secretary, Greg Clark, gives his reaction to Unilever: Interesting reference to the industrial strategy, which a year on from the announcement is still without the independent watchdog required to get it up and running: Royal London Asset Management (which has 0.7% stake in Unilever, worth roughly \u00c2\u00a3360m) was one of the public opponents to Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans and has responded to the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to scrap them: We welcome the decision the board of Unilever has taken. They have listened to shareholder concerns and responded in a constructive way. As a high quality company with a talented management team, we are pleased we and other UK investors can now share in the future growth of the company. We look forward to continued engagement with Unilever on the next steps. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to back track on plans to move its HQ to Rotterdam shows the power of institutional investors and puts pressure on the board. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s climbdown from Unilever over a plan which would have necessitated its exit from the FTSE 100 is an example of the power institutional investors can wield when they act in concert with one another. This brings into the question the credibility of Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insistence that the vast majority of shareholders were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfully supportive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of its proposals ahead of the vote deadline in the UK and the Netherlands later this month. Abandoning its dual UK-Dutch stock market listing and moving its HQ to Rotterdam would have made Unilever, one of the London market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading lights, ineligible for the FTSE and many institutions complained they would have been forced sellers of the shares. The episode looks to have been badly mis-managed and the position of chief executive Paul Polman and the rest of the board is likely to come under severe scrutiny. The Investment Association, a trade body representing UK fund managers, says there was no reason for UK shareholders to vote in favour of Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move to Rotterdam, and has welcomed the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to scrap the plans. The feedback from many of our members has been that there was no compelling reason for Plc shareholders to accept the proposed simplification in this form. They did not believe it would be in the long-term interests of their clients, and would have resulted in many shareholders being forced to sell their shares. We welcome the fact that Unilever has listened to the feedback from their shareholders and not pushed ahead with their plans. We look forward to engaging with the company on their future plans. The Dutch employers organisation VNO-NCW is blaming Brexit for Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision: The website DutchNews.nl quotes the organisation: [We are sorry that] such an important decision has become swept up in the turbulent political developments in the UK. It is also an indication of what Brexit means, a hard fight for corporate locations. Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to keep its headquarters in London is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153huge blow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bit of a shocker.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reaction from the Netherlands: The UK is happily celebrating Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to abandon plans to move its headquarters from London to Rotterdam. But the mood in the Netherlands is likely to be less cheery, particularly as Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte was working on plans to scrap a dividend tax in what was seen as a bid to attract Unilever. Reuters has this report: Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal of plans to move its headquarters to Rotterdam looked likely on Friday to trigger political fallout for Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte over his unpopular proposal to scrap a withholding tax on dividends. Unilever said it had given up on moving to Rotterdam for now under pressure from shareholders at its British arm, who worried about the future tax treatment of Dutch dividends. Rutte, who worked for Unilever from 1992-2002 before entering politics, had yet to respond to the news early on Friday. But he will be bracing for a barrage of questions at his weekly press conference later in the day over whether the 15% dividend tax - earmarked for removal in theory to attract foreign investment - will now be retained after all. While doubts have grown in recent weeks among dual-listed Unilever investors over the wisdom of the move to a sole HQ in the Netherlands, Rutte has been fighting an increasingly lonely battle in favour of scrapping the tax. Halifax is reporting a 1.4% fall in UK house prices in September, the sharpest monthly fall since April. It followed a 0.2% fall in August, and defied expectations of a 0.2% rise. The average price of a UK home was \u00c2\u00a3225,995. On an annual basis, prices were 2.5% higher. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic, cautions that Halifax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house price index tends to be volatile. Halifax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data is very noisy, so we doubt September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data signal that the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increase in Bank rate in August has pushed the housing market over the edge. Sustained falls in house prices at a national level aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t likely. Even so, the combination of rising mortgage rates and heightened economic uncertainty will weigh on demand over the next six months, ensuring that year-over-year growth in house prices barely exceeds zero. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has welcomed Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to keep its headquarters in the capital city. He says that despite Brexit, London will always be one of the best places to base a business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great news that Unilever has chosen to keep its HQ in London and abandoned plans to move it to Rotterdam. Despite Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appalling mishandling of the Brexit negotiations, the capital will always be one of the best cities in the world in which to do business. As Unilever works out its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153next steps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it is not yet clear where the unravelled plans leave the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman and chief executive. Shares in Unilever have opened a touch higher, after the FTSE 100 company announced it would not press ahead with plans to abandon its dual listing. Its fair to say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a muted reaction, with shares now up just 0.1% at \u00c2\u00a340.78. The decision to abandon the plans for a move to Rotterdam will be a major blow to Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Paul Polman, and the wider board. The plan was going to go to two polls - one in the Netherlands on 25 October, requiring the support of 50% of voting shareholders, and one in the UK on 26 October, requiring 75% support. The London vote was always going to be the tricky one. Unilever acknowledged the lack of support in their statement this morning: We have had an extensive period of engagement with shareholders and have received widespread support for the principle behind simplification. However, we recognise that the proposal has not received support from a significant group of shareholders and therefore consider it appropriate to withdraw. Unions had also come out against Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned move, arguing that it was vital for the maker of Ben &amp; Jerry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ice cream and other companies to stay in the UK. Unite national officer Rhys McCarthy said: Investors understand the need for great British-based companies like Unilever to retain their headquarters in the UK. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak takeover rules which put short-termism ahead of the long term are clearly a major factor in Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed move following a failed hostile takeover bid, as is the swirling uncertainty around Brexit. Ministers need to get a grip on Brexit and toughen takeover rules to stop more firms like Unilever seeking to flee overseas. A raft of shareholders had publicly come out in opposition to Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to abandon its dual governance structure and switch its headquarters from London to Rotterdam. UK investors including Aviva Investors, Columbia Threadneedle, L&amp;G, M&amp;G, Royal London and Schroders had all stated they would vote against the plans. One of the main points of opposition was that Unilever would likely be ejected from the FTSE 100 - having been an original constituent in 1984 - and the FSTE All-share. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Breaking news: Unilever has abandoned plans to move its headquarters from London to Rotterdam, after finally bowing to investor pressure. It means the consumer giant will remain listed on the FTSE 100 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of the most contentious points in its planned move. Announcing the decision, which will be a major blow for the board, Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman Marijn Dekkers, said they will now consider the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153next steps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Unilever has built a long track record of consistent and competitive performance. The board continues to believe that simplifying our dual-headed structure would, over time, provide opportunities to further accelerate value creation and serve the best long-term interests of Unilever. The board will now consider its next steps and will continue to engage with our shareholders. We will proceed with the plan to cancel the NV preference shares, further strengthening our corporate governance. More on Unilever soon.

Green accounting attempts to outline how environmental degradation can be measured against economic growth. This endeavor is not so easy, however, as environmental damage can be hard to measure and furthermore gdp is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the environment is (often, not always) best thought of as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stock.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Nordhaus developed (with co-authors) the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICE_model\">Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy Model</a>, a pioneering effort to develop a general approach to estimating the costs of climate change. Subsequent efforts, such as the London IPCC group, have built directly on Nordhaus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work in this area. The EPA still uses a variant of this model. The model was based on earlier work by Nordhaus himself in the 1970s, and he refined it over time in a series of books and articles, culminating in several books in the 1990s. Here is <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.719.7069&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">his well-cited piece</a>, with Mendelsohn and Shaw, on how climate change will affect global agriculture.</p> <p>Nordhaus also was an early advocate of a carbon tax and furthermore he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/11/us/brothers-work-different-angles-in-taking-on-climate-change.html?hp\">wrote part of the Clean Air Act</a>, the part that gave the government the right to regulate hitherto-unmentioned pollutants in the future.

Taking twice as long to double may not sound so bad, but remember the difference between using just the white squares or all the squares on the chessboard. Or consider what happens over the course of a century. A doubling time of 20 years means doubling 5 times in a century, which produces an increase by a factor of 32.

Nordhaus</strong>, Yale University, New Haven, USA</p> <p><em>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153for integrating climate change into long-run macroeconomic analysis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</em></p> <p>and</p> <p><strong>Paul M. Romer</strong>, NYU Stern School of Business, New York, USA</p> <p><em>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153for integrating technological innovations into long-run macroeconomic analysis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</em></p> <p><strong>William D. Nordhaus and Paul M. Romer have designed methods for addressing some of our time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most basic and pressing questions about how we create long-term sustained and sustainable economic growth.</strong><br></p> <p>At its heart, economics deals with the management of scarce resources. Nature dictates the main constraints on economic growth and our knowledge determines how well we deal with these constraints. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Laureates William Nordhaus and Paul Romer have significantly broadened the scope of economic analysis by constructing models that explain how the market economy interacts with nature and knowledge.</p> <p><em>Technological change</em> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Romer demonstrates how knowledge can function as a driver of long-term economic growth. When annual economic growth of a few per cent accumulates over decades, it transforms people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lives. Previous macroeconomic research had emphasised technological innovation as the primary driver of economic growth, but had not modelled how economic decisions and market conditions determine the creation of new technologies. Paul Romer solved this problem by demonstrating how economic forces govern the willingness of firms to produce new ideas and innovations.</p> <p>Romer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solution, which was published in 1990, laid the foundation of what is now called <em>endogenous growth theory</em>. The theory is both conceptual and practical, as it explains how ideas are different to other goods and require specific conditions to thrive in a market. Romer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theory has generated vast amounts of new research into the regulations and policies that encourage new ideas and long-term prosperity.</p> <p><em>Climate change</em> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Nordhaus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 findings deal with interactions between society and nature. Nordhaus decided to work on this topic in the 1970s, as scientists had become increasingly worried about the combustion of fossil fuel resulting in a warmer climate. In the mid-1990s, he became the first person to create an <em>integrated assessment model</em>, i.e. a quantitative model that describes the global interplay between the economy and the climate. His model integrates theories and empirical results from physics, chemistry and economics. Nordhaus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 model is now widely spread and is used to simulate how the economy and the climate co-evolve. It is used to examine the consequences of climate policy interventions, for example carbon taxes.</p> <p>The contributions of Paul Romer and William Nordhaus are methodological, providing us with fundamental insights into the causes and consequences of technological innovation and climate change. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Laureates do not deliver conclusive answers, but their findings have brought us considerably closer to answering the question of how we can achieve sustained and sustainable global economic growth.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5bbb2aa9e4b0b8830be6b960\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-10-08T10:07:39.598Z\">11.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nordhaus and Romer feel like worthy winners.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/oct/08/nobel-prize-2018-sveriges-riksbank-in-economic-sciences-awarded-live-updates?page=with:block-5bbb1344e4b0494d8052c68c#block-5bbb1344e4b0494d8052c68c\">As mentioned earlier</a>, William Nordhaus has been a pioneer on the vital issue of climate change - using models to show that policymakers are failing to measure the true impact of global warming.</p> <p>Nordhaus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DICE computer model has made a huge difference.

That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the Nobel season for another year. Thanks for following our coverage. Congratulations to all the winners, and better luck next time to everyone else. Former UK prime minister Gordon Brown may have smiled at Romer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success. Back in the 1990s, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brown gave a famous speech on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Post Neo-classical Endogenous Growth Theory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It was cowritten with Ed Balls, then his youngish assistant (later shadow chancellor, then Strictly Come Dancing star). The speech was later mocked by right-winger Michael Heseltine, with the side-splitting pun that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcit wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Brown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, it was Balls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Ho ho ho. But Brown and Balls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 point, that growth relies on investment, technological progress, and innovation, remains true and important today. Gordon Brown being sneered at when he gave a speech as shadow chancellor mentioning endogenous growth theory. Paul Romer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success comes nine months after he quit the World Bank, where he was chief economist, under a dark cloud. Romer had clashed with World Bank staff on several issues, including the worthiness of the methodology used in its reports. At one point, he demanded they use the word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 less frequently, saying it was a lever to get political points across. His term ended abruptly after he claimed that Bank staff had manipulated the data in its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Doing Business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rankings, suggesting that Chile had been unfairly pushed down the rankings. PSA: If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a world expert, and your phone rings early one October morning, try picking up the receiver.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clip of Paul Romer talking about his award, and the work behind it. Economics professor Tyler Cowen is doing a great job collating information about the winners, and explaining their work is influential and important. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour of his work on William Nordhaus: Nordhaus is professor at Yale, and most of all he is known for his work on climate change models, and his connection to various concepts of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153green accounting.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd To the best of my knowledge, Nordhaus started working on green accounting in 1972, when he published with James Tobin (also a Laureate) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is Growth Obsolete?\u00e2\u20ac\u0153, which raised the key question of sustainability. Green accounting attempts to outline how environmental degradation can be measured against economic growth. This endeavor is not so easy, however, as environmental damage can be hard to measure and furthermore gdp is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the environment is (often, not always) best thought of as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stock.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nordhaus developed (with co-authors) the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy Model, a pioneering effort to develop a general approach to estimating the costs of climate change. Subsequent efforts, such as the London IPCC group, have built directly on Nordhaus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work in this area. The EPA still uses a variant of this model. The model was based on earlier work by Nordhaus himself in the 1970s, and he refined it over time in a series of books and articles, culminating in several books in the 1990s. Here is his well-cited piece, with Mendelsohn and Shaw, on how climate change will affect global agriculture. Nordhaus also was an early advocate of a carbon tax and furthermore he wrote part of the Clean Air Act, the part that gave the government the right to regulate hitherto-unmentioned pollutants in the future. The Obama administration, in its later attempts to regulate climate, cited this provision. And on Paul Romer, Tyler explains: Romer has been a central figure behind the notion of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153charter cities,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd namely an economic region but with external or possibly foreign governance, so as to enforce the rule of law and spur economic growth. The charter cities idea comes rather naturally out of Romer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work on the economics of growth. Think of Romer as asking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153which is the non-rival public good which can be extended at very low cost?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and wondering if that might be law. Here is his famous TED talk on charter cities. Here is an interview with Romer on charter cities. He was originally slated to work with the Honduran government on charter cities, though he dropped out of the project in 2012. Here is Paul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s account of what happened. Amihai Glazer and I once wrote a comment on Romer, on his article with Barro on ski-lift pricing, which Glazer and I saw as closely connected to Buchanan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theory of clubs. Romer later credited this comment with inducing him to rethink what the notion of rivalry really means in economics, and leading to his two best-known pieces on economic growth; see the David Warsh book for more detail. Like myself, Romer is an avid fan of the guitarist Clarence White, and several times we have traded favorite Clarence White videos by email. Romer believes (correctly) that the role of Clarence White in the success of the Byrds is very much underrated, and furthermore he is a big fan of White\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early work with the Kentucky Colonels. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy explanation of Paul Romer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work on endogenous growth: Associated Press agrees that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s award is timely, as the UN calls for fresh action on climate change: William Nordhaus in the 1990s became the first person to create a model that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153describes the global interplay between the economy and the climate,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the academy said. He showed that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the most efficient remedy for problems caused by greenhouse gases is a global scheme of universally imposed carbon taxes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The prize comes just a day after an international panel of scientists issued a report detailing how Earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weather, health and ecosystems would be in better shape if the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaders could somehow limit future human-caused warming to just 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit (a half degree Celsius) from now, instead of the globally agreed-upon goal of 1.8 degrees F (1 degree C) Nordhaus has argued that climate change should be considered a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153global public good,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd like public health and international trade, and regulated accordingly, but not through a command-and-control approach. Instead, by agreeing on a global price for burning carbon that reflects its whole cost, this primary cause of rising temperatures could be traded and taxed, putting market forces to work on the problem. Harvard economist Gernot Wagner says that both winners have made huge strides towards tackling climate change. Nordhaus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pioneering cost-benefit models for global warming, and Romer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work on how well-regulated markets can spur technological development and sustainable economic progress, and ultimately faster growth. Paul Romer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website is creaking under the strain! The Nobel Prize committee have created a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPopular Science\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 backgrounder, for anyone trying to get up to speed on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s winners. It explains how Bill Nordhaus and Paul Romer developed tools to show how market economy affects nature and knowledge, dating back several decades. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Nordhaus became the first person to design simple, but dynamic and quantitative models of the global economic-climate system, now called integrated assessment models (IAMs). His tools allow us to simulate how the economy and climate would co-evolve in the future under alternative assumptions about the workings of nature and the market economy, including relevant policies. His models address questions about the desirability of different global scenarios and specific policy interventions. And on market imperfections.. Romer showed that unregulated markets will produce technological change, but tend to underprovide R&amp;D and the new goods created by it. Addressing this under-provision requires well-designed government interventions, such as R&amp;D subsidies and patent regulation. His analysis says that such policies are vital to long-run growth, not just within a country but globally. Nobel laureate Paul Romer has been tweeting. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flagged up an article explaining why he is optimistic that climate change can be tackled, with firm action. It says: The practical insight is that there are two very different types of optimism. Complacent optimism is the feeling of a child waiting for presents. Conditional optimism is the feeling of a child who is thinking about building a treehouse. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If I get some wood and nails and persuade some other kids to help do the work, we can end up with something really cool.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd What the theory of endogenous technological progress supports is conditional optimism, not complacent optimism. Instead of suggesting that we can relax because policy choices don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter, it suggests to the contrary that policy choices are even more important than traditional theory suggests. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also flagged up a second article, that explains how small changes in economic growth can have a powerful long-term impact. For example: A rough guide to the doubling time for any rate of growth is to divide it into 70. For example, if something grows at 7% per year, you can infer that it doubles every 10 years because 70 / 7 = 10. If it grows at 3.5% per year, it takes 20 years to double. Taking twice as long to double may not sound so bad, but remember the difference between using just the white squares or all the squares on the chessboard. Or consider what happens over the course of a century. A doubling time of 20 years means doubling 5 times in a century, which produces an increase by a factor of 32. Doubling 10 times produces an increase by a factor of 1024. David Pendelbury, scientific manager at Clarivate Analytics (who draw up the list of Nobel frontrunners based on academic citations), agrees that these are worthy winners: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a crowning achievement for William D. Nordhaus, Sterling Professor of Economics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, and Paul Michael Romer, New York University Stern School of Business, and Hoover Institution, Stanford, California, to be recognized by 2018 Nobel Prize in Economics. We named both as Citation Laureates in 2009 and 2005 respectively, due to an exceptionally high level of citations to their works by the research community. Professor Justin Wolfers of the University of Michigan says Romer and Nordhaus are worthy winners, for asking the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig questions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 about economics and the world we live in. Reaction is starting to flood in. Oxford University researcher Max Roser says Nordhaus and Romer are a great choice: Two researchers who dedicated their lives to study the big transitions in human history by taking a very long run view on how we got to now and where we are heading. Congratulations to both of them. You probably wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put William Nordhaus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s climate change work in the same boat as Paul Romer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work on heathy, sustainable economic growth. But the committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences insist that these two macroeconomists have more in common than first appears. Committee member Per Krusell, a Swedish macroeconomist, says that both men are really part of the same agenda, thinking about \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclong-run, global\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 issues. Krussell adds that Romer and Nordhaus have a similar view about economic policy, and market failure, even though superficially they may look different. Q: Did you expect to win the award? Apparently not! Paul Romer reveals that he ignored two phone calls today because he assumed they were spam calls. Fortunately the committee got through in the end.... Paul Romer adds that optimism is a vital ingredient to tackling hard problems such as climate change. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One problem today is that people think protecting the environment will be so costly and so hard that they want to ignore the problem and pretend it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist. Humans are capable of amazing accomplishments if we set our minds to it. Paul Romer is on the phone now, sounding understandably bouncy. Asked about the IPCC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning on climate change, Romer says that the world can fix the problem, if we start now. He also argues that dire warnings that the future of the planet is in doubt don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help. As Romer puts it: Once we start to try to reduce carbon emissions, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be surprised that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as hard as we anticipated. The danger with very alarming forecasts is that it will make people feel apathetic and hopeless. It is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153totally doable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, even now, to start bringing down carbon emissions...while also improving standards of living and sustaining growth, Romer says. If we do the right thing, everything can keep going better. but it is time to do the right thing, Romer adds. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has decided to award the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2018 to William D. Nordhaus, Yale University, New Haven, USA \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for integrating climate change into long-run macroeconomic analysis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and Paul M. Romer, NYU Stern School of Business, New York, USA \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for integrating technological innovations into long-run macroeconomic analysis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. William D. Nordhaus and Paul M. Romer have designed methods for addressing some of our time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most basic and pressing questions about how we create long-term sustained and sustainable economic growth. At its heart, economics deals with the management of scarce resources. Nature dictates the main constraints on economic growth and our knowledge determines how well we deal with these constraints. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Laureates William Nordhaus and Paul Romer have significantly broadened the scope of economic analysis by constructing models that explain how the market economy interacts with nature and knowledge. Technological change \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Romer demonstrates how knowledge can function as a driver of long-term economic growth. When annual economic growth of a few per cent accumulates over decades, it transforms people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lives. Previous macroeconomic research had emphasised technological innovation as the primary driver of economic growth, but had not modelled how economic decisions and market conditions determine the creation of new technologies. Paul Romer solved this problem by demonstrating how economic forces govern the willingness of firms to produce new ideas and innovations. Romer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solution, which was published in 1990, laid the foundation of what is now called endogenous growth theory. The theory is both conceptual and practical, as it explains how ideas are different to other goods and require specific conditions to thrive in a market. Romer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theory has generated vast amounts of new research into the regulations and policies that encourage new ideas and long-term prosperity. Climate change \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Nordhaus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 findings deal with interactions between society and nature. Nordhaus decided to work on this topic in the 1970s, as scientists had become increasingly worried about the combustion of fossil fuel resulting in a warmer climate. In the mid-1990s, he became the first person to create an integrated assessment model, i.e. a quantitative model that describes the global interplay between the economy and the climate. His model integrates theories and empirical results from physics, chemistry and economics. Nordhaus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 model is now widely spread and is used to simulate how the economy and the climate co-evolve. It is used to examine the consequences of climate policy interventions, for example carbon taxes. The contributions of Paul Romer and William Nordhaus are methodological, providing us with fundamental insights into the causes and consequences of technological innovation and climate change. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Laureates do not deliver conclusive answers, but their findings have brought us considerably closer to answering the question of how we can achieve sustained and sustainable global economic growth. Nordhaus and Romer feel like worthy winners. As mentioned earlier, William Nordhaus has been a pioneer on the vital issue of climate change - using models to show that policymakers are failing to measure the true impact of global warming. Nordhaus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DICE computer model has made a huge difference. It: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153integrates in an end-to-end fashion the economics, carbon cycle, climate science, and impacts in a highly aggregated model that allows a weighing of the costs and benefits of taking steps to slow greenhouse warming. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s both important and urgent, on a day when the UN is warning there is just 12 years to limit climate change catastrophe. The Endogenous Growth Theory, meanwhile, shows how growth is generated by internal rather than external factors. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important - it means that governments can make a real difference to the lives of their people through economic policy - from investment and education to fighting monopolies and protecting IP rights - rather than throwing their hands up and blaming factors beyond their control. Once again, none of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading female economists have been recognised. Commiserations to Esther Duflo, Anne Osborn Krueger, Claudia Goldin, Janet Currie, et al, and good luck for next year. William Nordhaus is being recognised for his work on the damage caused by climate change. Paul Romer has examined how economists can achieve a healthy rate of economic growth. The models that Nordhaus and Romer have created have helped with the development of economic growth, and with combatting climate change, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hearing. They have taken macroeconomics to a global scale, to tackle some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest problems, the Nobel Prize committee say. The winners are William Nordhaus for his work on climate economics, and Paul Romer for his work on the endogenous growth theory. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prize is be awarded for innovation, climate and economic growth...... Here we go.... Usually the committee try to contact the winner (s) before the official announcement, so maybe they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re struggling to get through. This can be a problem if the prize is going to someone in America, for example, where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still rather early (approaching 3am in California). Sounds like there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small delay.... The live feed is now working, so you can hear the scraping of chairs and nervous coughing in the Royal Swedish Academy. (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve embedded it in the top of this blog too). Here are some facts about today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prize: Number of Laureates in Economic Sciences 79 individuals have been awarded 1969-2017 (List of all Laureates in Economic Sciences) Average age The average age of all Laureates* in Economic Sciences between 1969 and 2017 is 67 years. All Nobel Laureates listed by age Youngest Laureate in Economic Sciences To date, the youngest Laureate in Economic Sciences is Kenneth J. Arrow, who was 51 years old when he was awarded in 1972. Oldest Laureate in Economic Sciences The oldest Laureate in Economic Sciences to date is Leonid Hurwicz, who was 90 years old when he was awarded in 2007. He is also the oldest Laureate to be awarded in all Prize categories. Female Laureates in Economic Sciences Elinor Ostrom was the first female Laureate in Economic Sciences. Elinor Ostrom was awarded the Prize in 2009. More here.... Tension is rising in Stockholm as journalists await the news.... As well as the glory, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s winner will also receive a financial windfall of 9 million Swedish kronor. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s roughly \u00c2\u00a3750,000, or $1m. If there are two or three laureates, they share the cash. Just half an hour to go... Those of us who propped up the bottom of the class can take heart from these words from last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s winner, Richard Thaler: This (unscientific) Twitter poll suggests Esther Duflo would be a popular choice, if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to double the number of female winners to two. Andreas Wallstr\u00c3\u00b6m of Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nordea Markets also believes she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the running.... Her\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another prediction, from Francesco Trebbi, professor of economics at the University of British Columbia: The endogenous growth theory argue that most economic growth is generated from within a system as a direct result of internal processes, such as capital investment, investing in human capital, protecting intellectual property rights. US economics professor Tyler Cowen has predicted that it might be Duflo and Banerjee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s year..... But given his forecasting record is as bad as mine, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a given. Cowen says: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never once gotten it right, at least not for exact timing, so my apologies to anyone I pick (sorry Bill Baumol!). Nonetheless this year I am in for Esther Duflo and Abihijit Banerjee, possibly with Michael Kremer, for randomized control trials in development economics. Maybe they are too young, as Tim Harford points out, so my back-up pick remains an environmental prize for Bill Nordhaus, Partha Dasgupta, and Marty Weitzman. Perhaps a climate economist, such as William Nordhaus, could win this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s award. Nordhaus, a Yale University professor, has conducted key research into the economics of climate change, showing that mankind is ignoring the catastrophic cost of inaction. His Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE) model showed the costs and benefits of taking steps to slow greenhouse warming. Shamefully, only one woman has ever won the Nobel prize for economics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Elinor Ostrom back in 2009. That could change today. Esther Duflo, the French-American economist, is in the running for her work on developing economies, including using randomized control trials to discover which anti-poverty initiatives work, and why. Duflo is professor of Poverty Alleviation and Development Economics at MIT. With her partner Abhijit Banerjee, she has argued for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153radical rethinking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of how people in the poorest parts of the world actually live and act. As the FT put it: Duflo and Banerjee are students of detail. Is it better to give people mosquito nets or make them pay? What is the best method of getting children into schools, and ensuring that they learn? Should you encourage immunisation by dispatching clinics to villages or reward parents with bags of rice? Or both? Or neither? Duflo has already won a clutch of awards, including The John Bates Clark Medal (known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmini Nobel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122). She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only 45, though, so this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s award could be too soon for her (but you never know\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) Another option is Anne Osborn Krueger -- the US economist who coined the term \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrent-seeking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to describe the act of manipulating the social or political environment in which economic activities occur, rather than by creating new wealth. Or how about Harvard economist Claudia Goldin, for her work studying the gender pay gap? She has argued that women are paid less than men because they seek jobs with more flexible hours or remote-work options, and in some professions there is a high penalty for taking any time out of the labour market. Or Princeton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Janet Currie? She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an expert on healthcare issues such as early intervention programs, programs to expand health insurance and improve health care, public housing, and food and nutrition programs. Predicting Nobel winners is a tricky task, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no reason not to give it a go. Every year, researchers at Clarivate Analytics chew their way though the Web of Science citation index to calculate whose work has been cited particularly often, making them good candidates for a Nobel. Here are their top predictions for this year: Manuel Arellano, CEMFI, Madrid, Spain, and Stephen R. Bond, Oxford University, UK, for contributions to panel data analysis, especially the Arellano-Bond estimator. This method exploits time patterns in panel data to estimate the economic response to a change in a policy or other variable, while controlling for permanent unobserved confounding variation. Wesley M. Cohen, Duke University, Durham, NC, and Daniel A. Levinthal, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, for their introduction and development of the concept of absorptive capacity (i.e., the ability of firms to evaluate, assimilate, and apply external knowledge) and its contribution to advancing our understanding of the innovative performance of firms, industries and nations. David M. Kreps, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, for contributions to dynamic economic phenomena, in choice theory, finance, game theory, and organization theory. Good morning. Top economists across the globe will be watching their phones nervously today, or setting their alarm clocks a little earlier than usual. Because, around 10.45am UK time, someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to win the biggest prize in economics science. The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t one of the original ones, of course. The money doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come from the Nobel family profits from armaments trade, nor is it one of the original awards endowed by Alfred Nobel. Instead, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the creation of the Swedish central bank, designed to bring some glamour and recognition to the oft-criticised sphere of economics. So, anyone complaining that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnot a real Nobel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 can stay behind after class and clean the erasers. The prize has recognised some of the biggest names and brightest ideas, since Ragnar Frisch and Jan Tinbergen shared the first award in 1969. Since then, John Hicks, Friedrich Hayek, James Tobin, John Nash, Joe Stiglitz and Paul Krugman have all received that precious phone call from Sweden. Last year the prize went to U.S. academic Richard Thaler, who helped popularise the idea of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nudging\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd people towards doing what was best for them. Other recent winners include Angus Deaton, for his work on inequality, and Jean Tirole for his analysis of monopolies and how to fight them. Personally, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never quite got over 2013, when Eugene Fama (father of the efficient market hypothesis) shared the award with Robert Shiller (who proved that markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very efficient after all). This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s winner, or winners, will be announced sometime after 10.45am UK time (11.45am in Stockholm).",

                "bodyText":"Global stock markets staged a sharp sell-off on Monday amid growing concerns over a budget showdown between Italy and the EU and the prospect of weaker growth in the Chinese economy. Italian borrowing costs jumped and the euro dropped on foreign exchanges as the war of words between Rome and Brussels escalated, while shares on Wall Street and other major international markets declined amid growing concerns over the US-China trade war. Italian bond yields jumped by as much as 30 basis points to the highest levels since early 2014 after the Italian deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, attacked the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the economics commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, as enemies of Europe. Speaking at a news conference with the French far-right leader Marine Le Pen, he said the country would not cave to pressure from the financial markets or retreat from its plan for government spending. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are against the enemies of Europe \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Juncker and Moscovici \u00e2\u20ac\u201d shut away in the Brussels bunker,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Brussels has told Italy it is concerned over the plan because it would mean the nation running a larger budget deficit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the gap between income from taxes and government spending \u00e2\u20ac\u201c than previously planned for the next three years. Rome is to submit its draft budget to the commission, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive arm, which will check whether it is in line with EU rules by 15 October. The euro fell almost 0.5% against the dollar, while the Italian stock market dropped by 2.4%. The FTSE 100 closed down more than 1% at 7,233.33 while other markets around Europe also recorded losses.

                "bodyText":"The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 800 points, its worst drop in eight months, led by sharp declines in technology stocks. The sharp sell-off was even starker at the tech-heavy Nasdaq exchange, home to Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and others. The Nasdaq fell over 4%. Wednesday marked the fifth consecutive daily decline for the S&amp;P 500, the longest losing streak since November 2016. Just a week ago stock markets set another record high, a fact that was trumpeted by Donald Trump. But after years of growth, investors appear to be spooked by rising bond yields that have been drawing some out of the stock market. Fears of further falls led others to sell their holdings. The best-performing stocks over the past year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which include the so-called Faang companies of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u00e2\u20ac\u201c took some of the biggest losses Wednesday. Amazon lost 6.2% and Netflix gave back 8.4%. Fears of escalating tensions with China over trade also contributed to the fall. On Monday the International Monetary Fund warned that the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasingly protectionist trade policies would hit global growth. Trump blamed the slide on the policies of the Fed, which has raised rates three times this year. In comments before a rally in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, the president said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the Fed has gone crazy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Investors in Asia Pacific were braced for heavy losses when trading begins in the region on Thursday.

In the UK, the FTSE 100 entered correction territory \u00e2\u20ac\u201c falling 10% from its peak in May - after Wall Street suffered its biggest drop in eight months on Wednesday. Why are markets falling? The sell-off is being fuelled by mounting investor concern over rising US interest rates, which could curtail growth in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest economy and have a damaging knock-on effect for global growth. The yield, or interest payment to investors, on two-year US government bonds hit the highest level since 2008, in a sign of the rising borrowing costs for companies and consumers. Donald Trump also raised eyebrows among investors by branding the US Federal Reserve \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crazy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for planning further rate rises. The US economy is booming, propelled further by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts earlier this year, which has prompted the US central bank to raise interest rates to keep a lid on inflation. Many economists are however now starting to warn that the economy is reaching a peak ahead of a slowdown next year. Raising interest rates further could exacerbate that slowdown, although the increases may be necessary to curb additional inflation from rising oil prices and higher import costs in the US from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade tariffs. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund has downgraded its forecast for global growth forecast and warned that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war with China and Europe was partly to blame for the revision. Is this the start of a deeper sell-off? The omens are not good. Overall global debt, in both the public and private sectors, has rocketed by 60% in the decade since the financial crisis to reach an all-time high of $182tn (\u00c2\u00a3139tn). The boom in borrowing comes after central banks around the world slashed their interest rates close to zero during the financial crisis in an attempt to stop the last recession turning into another great depression. Although it worked in the short term, the debt mountain created since has primed a tinderbox for an even bigger meltdown. Whether this happens or not depends on how quickly borrowing costs rise and how well the world economy adapts. What are the reasons for optimism? Fears over rising interest rates are nothing new. Stock markets had a bad run over the same concerns in February, before rallying back towards record highs over the course of the summer. Economists say the solid, positive fundamentals of the US economy have not changed, such as the lowest unemployment rate since 1969. That strength could be confirmed in the next few weeks in third-quarter earnings updates from the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest companies. What other problems are lurking? Despite the reasons for optimism, there are a handful of risks to the global economy that could further derail financial markets. Slowing growth in China could act as a drag on the global economy, given its status as one of the biggest buyers of goods from elsewhere around the world, while the country is also at risk from a massive buildup of debt that could trigger a financial crisis. Emerging markets have seen their currencies plunge against a strengthening dollar, while investors have become concerned that these developing nations may be unable to repay loans taken out in the US national currency. Many, including Argentina, are now likely to fall into recession. The populist Italian government is also engaged in a standoff with the EU over its budget plans, which has the potential to unsettle the wider eurozone.

And in case you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re wondering what all this is about, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in good company ... the US economist Paul Krugman doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a clue either. Some reaction to the Australian housing market numbers, which are quite bad. Less lending = lower house prices as one tweeter neatly up sums. But at least the number of first-time buyers is the highest for six years. The bank hearings have wound up in Canberra. In final questions, ANZ chief Shayne Elliott said fewer customers used physical banks to do their business and so ANZ plans on closing about 12 of its 650 or so branches. That follows a trend, Elliott says, which had been set over the last couple of years, with 30 to 50 branches being closed a year. Elliott now heads to his meetings with bank customers who have come to Canberra to discuss their issues with him. Next Friday, Andrew Thorburn, the head of NAB, will face the committee. The positive moves in the Chinese markets come despite the Singapore central bank announcing a tightening of monetary policy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign of the times. Singapore, which manages policy through exchange rate settings rather than interest rates, noted that it expected steady growth despite the possibility of trade tensions disrupting the global outlook. Monetary Authority of Singapore said: In 2019, trade frictions between some major economies and the uncertainty they pose could weigh more discernibly on global economic activity. Barring a significant setback in global growth, the Singapore economy should expand at a pace close to potential in 2019. The Chinese markets have opened up. Hong Kong has managed a gain of 0.5% while the Shanghai Composite is up 0.16%. As far as Australia is concerned, the RBA says the economy is at risk from external shocks and says the incipient US-China trade war or a slowdown in growth in China could trigger a domestic problem. Australia would be sensitive to a sharp contraction in global growth or dislocation in global financial markets because of the importance of trade and capital inflows. A worsening in external conditions could see a downturn in the domestic economy, reduced availability and higher cost of offshore funding and falls in asset prices, with a resulting deterioration in the performance of borrowers and lenders. As for the housing market, it says it has turned a little and says it could be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a positive development for financial stability\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, it could also be bad news for people who have borrowed too much and find themselves in negative equity as lending requirements tighten and house prices fall. Some existing borrowers may find they do not meet new lending standards and so have difficulty refinancing. Similarly, while most borrowers with loans transitioning from interest-only to principal and interest payments are well placed to meet the higher payments, a small share could struggle. The Reserve Bank of Australia has issued its financial stability review today. It says the rise in US interest rates blamed for the current market volatility are not causing much disruption. But it says that some risks are emerging as the Fed moves away from the low-interest environment: The extended period of low-interest rates has seen some financial stability risks emerge. Notably compensation for risk is very low with asset prices in a range of markets at high levels, underpinned by low long-term interest rates. Household, corporate and sovereign debt has also risen to high levels in some jurisdictions. For emerging market economies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially those with structural or cyclical vulnerabilities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are concerns about the implications of a tightening in financial conditions in the advanced economies. Those housing finance figures are not great news for Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks, which have built their huge profitability in recent years on some heroic mortgage lending. The financial sector of the ASX 200 is down 0.77% today in a market off 0.25% overall. Things go from bad to worse in the Australian housing market. Figures just released by the bureau of statistics show that total dwelling finance dropped by 2.1% in August to just over $30bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much worse than the -1% expected and a big drop on the 0.4% increase in July. Another big fall in investor lending. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down -1.2%. On the currency markets, the yen has continued to hold up against the dollar at 112 to the greenback. A stronger yen is usually not so good for the Nikkei, which is a stronghold of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big exporters. The Aussie dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a key proxy for emrging markets in the Asia Pacific region \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has also fought back during the big stock selloff, going from around US70.5 to US71.27 this morning. The Nikkei has dropped a modest amount this morning. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re currently off by 0.22%, or 50 points, at 22,541 points. The Kospi in Seoul is up 0.47%. Sydney is now down only 0.15%. Elliott also admits that ANZ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits have been hit by the aftermath of the commission, explaining that the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s return on equity has fallen from 17-18% to 11% in the past few years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ANZ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profitability is dramatically lower than it was,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. Labor MP Matt Keogh has scored a direct hit against ANZ boss Shayne Elliott bringing applause from the audience in Canberra, which includes people from the Bank Reform Now group. It came after the bank boss seemed to suggest that money being paid out as compensation to customers belonged to investors (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said). But Keogh said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it should have been in the customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pocket the whole time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to which Elliott puts his hands up: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I accept that I misspoke there, fair point. The bulk of the money is not refunds actually, the bulk of the money is actually the cost of going back and finding and recalculating the money and doing the data search - that was the piece I was talking about, the cost of remediation, the work, costs significant amounts of money, that is what I was referring to \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but you are quite right, the refund money obviously belongs to customers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In commodities, gold has benefited from falling stocks as investors seek familiar safe havens for their money. Business Insider tells us that on Thursday gold had its best day since Brexit. Talking of Brexit, just a quick diversion here which readers might find depressing or amusing, or perhaps a bit of both. The UK transport department has announced that part of the M26 motorway in Kent will be closed while work is carried out on figuring out how to turn it into a truck park in the event of Brexit causing huge delays at the Channel ports and tunnel. You couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make it up, as they say. More from Amy in Canberra. Shayne Elliott says he has met some ANZ customers who felt abused by the bank, and was personally answering emails from customers. He also gives his personal email to the committee and asks people to contact him directly with their concerns. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shayne.Elliott@anz.com The committee members, including Liberal MP Trevor Evans, are giving personal cases to Elliott and asking about those customers who still say they are not receiving responses from the bank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every case is unique and they should expect a response,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Elliott said, who is appearing before the committee for the fourth time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I give my commitment that I will be personally involved in the response from the bank.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He says he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always be the person who speaks directly with the customer, but he makes the commitment that he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will stay on top\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of responding to customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns. But he also says, in terms of time frames, some of the matters are exceptionally complicated, mentioning one case which goes back to 1992. But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with more customers this afternoon - including the case Evans just raised. ANZ chief Shayne Elliott is getting his grilling from a parliamentary committee. My colleague in Canberra, Amy Remeikis is watching and says that Elliott has told the committee that renumeration had absolutely been part of the ANZ culture - which follows on from Commissioner Kenneth Hayne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interim report which found \u00e2\u20ac\u0153greed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had led to a lot of the misconduct issues. Elliott said there had been changes, and he admits, again, that he was wrong to have dismissed the need for a royal commission, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153given what has been uncovered so far.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ANZ has engaged in misconduct and conduct falling below community standards and expectations. It is completely unacceptable that we have caused financial harm and emotional distress to our customers. He also said there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no pride\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd being the subject of regulator Asic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122sfocus and that it caused reputational damage and was seen as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153major fail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fear\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong word\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when it came to Asic, but the bank \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certainly respects Asic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Overall, he wants you to know that the bank has changed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The bank needs to be able to generate capital so we can fulfil our social obligations, but we need to get that balance right and we clearly failed at that in the past, and we are moving away from that. As I said, revenue, and the generic terms for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsales\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been part of the group score card in the last three years, so we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have that same middle layer, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmiddle management have a sales target, but the juniors don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have that today. But we can certainly improve and I agree that we need to do more work in getting that balance right. Not a bad start for the ASX after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big moves. Losses are easing back already but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early days. Volatility could be the name of the game today. Jonathen Chan, market analyst, CMC Markets, thinks so, and flags today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data (see below) as key set points:. Futures markets are pointing to a mixed start for Asia Pacific equities. Regional markets may fluctuate in a similar fashion to the overnight action in the US markets. In particular, the Australia housing finance data due this morning may influence the banking sectors, as well the appearance of senior executives at the royal commission inquiry. The Shanghai stock markets may have a chance to rebound if the trade balance data due this afternoon illustrates growth, or potentially lesser impact from the trade war. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off. The ASX 200 has slipped 47 points or 0.8% at the open. I should say that the Australian stock market opens in Sydney at 10am local time (00.00BST) followed by Tokyo and Seoul an hour later. Then at 02.30GMT trading starts in Hong Kong and Shanghai. And in Australia this morning it is the turn of ANZ bank boss Shayne Elliott to face questioning by MPs in the wake of the damaging revelations of the banking royal commission. The inquiry has exposed a widespread culture of greed in an industry once revered for having avoided the worst ravages of the global financial crisis. Matt Comyn, the boss of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank Commonwealth, was jeered from the public gallery during his apperance yesterday. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re reading outside Australia and you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t followed the course of the commission, here is an excellent wrap of the preliminary findings. Aside from what happens on the markets, there is a lot of data being released today which will keep us busy. At 11.30 Sydney time (01.30BST) we have Australian mortgage lending figures for August which will speak to the state of the housing market. In July they were up 0.4% but the market forecast is -1%. The Reserve Bank of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability review comes at the same time which could contain commentary on the markets. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also expecting China trade data later which could shed some light on the state of the Chinese economy. When Europe awakes, we will get industrial production figures for the eurozone. One of the biggest talking points of the past 24 hours has been Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about the Federal Reserve and interest rate hikes. The president has described the Fed as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of control\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because he thinks it is increasing borrowing costs too quickly and putting pressure on the economy. Greg McKenna, the independent Australian market strategist, has this salient point: President Trump has captured the narrative by blaming the Fed for all these market ructions. But the reality is the economy his policies have overheated does need more rate hikes. Markets know that he knows that, but the Fed is the perfect foil in the run-up to the mid-terms. The New Zealand stock market is up and running. A bit like how they are among the very the first to celebrate New Year, the Kiwis are first out of the blocks for finance. The benchmark NZX-50 index is currently down about 1% after dropping 3.64% yesterday. Remarkably, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still positive for the year, unlike most others. If you need a more in-depth catch up on a dramatic day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading on Wall Street, you can read the wrap by my colleague Dominic Rushe here. Good morning to everyone in Australia and Asia, and good evening to everyone else. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m Martin Farrer and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m taking over the blogging reins from the the indefatigable Graeme Wearden. The news from here is that more falls are expected in markets across the region, but so far not as dramatic as yesterday. The ASX in Sydney is seen falling 1.1% with around the same mark expected for the Nikkei in Tokyo. But who knows where they might end up if the dramatic swings in the Dow Jones today are anything to go by. What we do know for sure is that the Aussie dollar has had a good crisis. Like Usman Khawaja, it is has risen to task and climbed nearly 1% in the past 24 hours to stand at US71.2c. A quick recap Wall Street has suffered its second day of heavy losses, as the global stock market correction continues. The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen by 2.1%, or 545 points, on top of Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 830-point tumble. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq indices also weakened sharply again. The sell-off followed a bruising session in Europe. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 slumped by almost 2% into a correction, down 10% since its peak, while European stocks languished at a 21-month low. Italy lurched into a bear market. Earlier, Asia-Pacific markets suffered sharp losses too, with China down over 5% and Japan losing almost 4%. Traders fear fresh losses on Friday, with Australia called down another 1.1%. Economists have blamed a series of factors for the selloff, from trade war angst to rising US government borrowing costs. Neil Wilson of Markets.com argued there are five key factors: Rising bond yields \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the sharp rally last week was the cue for a sustained period of declines which culminated in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Now we have a lot of momentum \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the breadth of the decline \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we could see things get worse before rallying. China and trade \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we thought that Nafta was important but really the fear is that we see the Sino-US tensions get worse. Comments around currency manipulation have not helped risk sentiment. No resolution can be expected until after the mid-terms. Fears around luxury stocks and comments from LVMH on Chinese demand have raised some concerns around earnings. Italy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ongoing Rome-Brussels spat is keeping European investors in a risk-off stance. Fresh valuation concerns heading into earnings season A deepening row between the White House and the US Federal Reserve is also looming over the markets. Donald Trump has unleashed a series of attacks on the Fed, blaming its interest rate policy for spooking the markets. On Thursday Trump said he was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdisappointed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in Fed chair Jay Powell, but insisted he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t intend to fire him, Apprentice-style. The president explained that the strong dollar was driving shares down: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a correction that I think is caused by the Fed and interest rates. The dollar is very strong, very powerful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it causes difficulty doing business. IMF chief Christine Lagarde rode to Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence, insisting that the Fed was doing a good job. But still, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the central bank is making a mistake has raised the pressure building on the Fed. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m now handing over to my colleague Martin Farrer who will cover developments in the Asia Pacific markets. Markets will be opening in Australia in less than three hours, followed by Tokyo and Seoul an hour after that. Traders throughout the region are braced for another rough ride. Some $50bn was wiped off values in Australia on Thursday as the benchmark ASX 200 plunged 2.74%, its worst day since February. It is set to fall 1.1% at the opening on Friday, according to futures trading. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack(s) on Fed chair Jay Powell make the front of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Times: US and European stock markets have been a veritable sea of electronic ink today, following the overnight rout in Asia. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the damage...... Phew! Traders in New York can finally catch their breath, after another rough day. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing to celebrate -- instead, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staring at big losses for the second day running. The Dow has closed down 2.1%, or 545 points lower, at 25,052, on top of Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 830-point slide. The S&amp;P 500 provisionally closed 2.06% lower, while the Nasdaq lost around 1.2%. Unless something remarkable happens in the last 10 minutes, Wall Street is going to end the day deep in the red. The Dow is having another wobble, now down 485 points at 25,119 Another twist! The Washington Post is now reporting that President Trump will meet with President Xi at the G20 meeting of world leaders next month. This is lifting Wall Street off its lows, on hopes that relations between Washington and Beijing might be melting. Things have been worse, though... The S&amp;P 500 index has had a bad day too, currently down almost 2% as market volatility spikes. Some photos from in and around Wall Street today: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the market mayhem: The City has felt the full impact of a sell-off in global financial markets with shares in the FTSE 100 index of leading companies now more than 10% below their record peak in May. On a second day of turbulence, aftershocks from panic-selling on Wall Street rippled through Asian and European bourses as dealers took fright at trade tensions, the prospect of higher inflation and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to put pressure on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank over interest rates. The FTSE 100 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the index of UK blue-chip shares \u00e2\u20ac\u201c closed almost 2% lower after dropping 138.81 points to 7006.93. After a closing peak of 7877 in late May, the FTSE has now lost more than 10% of its value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the definition of a market correction. Boom! The Nasdaq has tallen into correction territory, a journey which Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 travelled a few hours ago. The tech-focused index has shed 2% today, or 151 points, to 6,892. That meaning it has lost more than 10% since its record high of 7,700 at the start of this month! Nearly every one of the 30 companies which make up the Dow has lost ground today. Pharmaceuticals firm Pfizer, fast food chain McDonalds, and energy companies Chevron and Exxon are among the big fallers. Make that 500 points off the Dow! The sell-off is accelerating as we head towards the final hour of trading. Oh dear, the Dow is taking another leg downwards in afternoon trading. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now shed 424 points, or 1.66%, 25,174 points. That means the Dow has lost more than 1,200 points since the start of trading yesterday - a reminder that what went up can come down rather abruptly.... Fast FT points out that mining stocks have had a particularly bad 2018: That partly reflects concerns over economic growth prospects, especially if a protracted trade war rumbles on. More drama in the markets, this time involving Turkey: Donald Trump regularly hailed the stock market boom as a sign that he was dong a good job. Now shares are falling, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s determined to pin the blame on the Federal Reserve. Bloomberg suspects the president has a motive.... Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticisms mark a stunning departure from the practices of his recent predecessors. Presidents for more than two decades had avoided public comments on the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest-rate policies as a way of demonstrating respect for the institution\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence. For a president who has frequently invoked rising stock prices as affirmation for his economic policies, criticism of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policies lays ground for shifting blame elsewhere if the market slide continues. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s escalating his attacks on the Fed with less than a month to go before elections that will determine whether Republicans maintain control of Congress. More here: Trading on Wall Street remains choppy. The Dow is back in the red, down around 115 points (or -0.45%), while the tech-focused Nasdaq index is now slightly higher... Jay Powell, incidentally, was Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick to run the Fed. The president could have reappointed Janet Yellen, Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predecessor, but instead he favoured a change (even though Yellen had done a good job helping to heal the economy from the financial crisis). Jay Powell may regret ever agreeing to become Fed chair! Donald Trump has unleashed another attack on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker, reiterating that he thinks the Federal Reserve is making a mistake. And once again, Trump is breaching the concept that central banks such as the Fed are independent (which is meant to reassure investors). Speaking as Wall Street wobbles today, Trump said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a correction that I think is caused by the Fed and interest rates. The dollar is very strong, very powerful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it causes difficulty doing business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked if he might sack the Fed chair, Trump replied: No, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to fire him. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just disappointed. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the big picture tonight, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not pretty: The braver, or riskier, among you may see today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses as a buying opportunity. I certainly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give investment advice. But Trevor Greetham of Royal London Asset Managment believes there are bargains out there: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not surprising to see a sharp rise in volatility given the negative cross currents for markets. Global growth is slowing, US interest rates are rising and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war rhetoric is hotting up ahead of next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s midterm elections. Longer term, we expect the economic expansion to continue into 2019 and this should ultimately propel stock markets higher. Investors should note that US tax cuts and spending increases are still feeding through, interest rates elsewhere in the world are very low and China is easing policy to offset trade war fears. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our multi asset funds have been defensively positioned since the early summer but we have started to buy equities on weakness after our investor sentiment gauge hit its most pessimistic reading since April. As another old saying goes, investors should be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After a day of hectic selling, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue chip index has ended the day deep in the red. The blue chip FTSE 100 index has shed almost 2% today, sending it solidly into a correction (10% below its all-time high of 7093 back in May). It has closed 138 points lower at 7,006, its lowest level since April. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no brighter across the channel either, where markets have ended at a 21-month low. Ouch! Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main stock index seems to have plunged into a BEAR market - meaning it has fallen by 20% from its recent peak. That shows how worried investors are about its government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget plans, and the row with the EU over fiscal targets. European stocks market are also suffering deeper losses as the closing bell looms. The Stoxx 600 index of top European companies is now down 2%, as shares get another mauling. So much for the recovery! The New York stock market has turned south again. The Dow is now down 336 points, or 1.3%, at 25,262 points, adding to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 830-point tumble. The broader S&amp;P 500 is also down 1.3%, while the Nasdaq has shed 1%. So far today, the market has opened lower, recovered, and now taken another leg down. This zig-zag trading shows nervousness and volatility is high. Issues such as the US-China trade wars, Brexit and the Italian budget row are all weighing on markets. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool argues that this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153financial market turmoil is (long) overdue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He has sent over this chart, from Policyuncertainty.com, which shows how uncertainty has risenL Profess Milas explains: Global policy uncertainty has hit its highest level for more than 18 months now. In fact, September 2018 saw global policy uncertainty at a level comparable to what we saw during the Referendum vote!!! The chart measures policy uncertainty in 18 countries that account for more than 70% of global GDP. Based on this plot information, I am surprised market reaction did not happen in late September or the very first days of October! Hello... Larry Kudlow, the US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economic advisor, seems to have suggested that Donald Trump could meet with China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Xi soon. Speaking on CNBC, Kudlow indicated that talks could take place at the G20 summit in November. However, it seems that nothing is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconcrete\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t count on a breakthrough in the trade war yet.... If such Wall Street is gyrating, as investors struggle to decide whether to stick or twist. The Dow has now shaken off its early malaise, and is now up 50 points or 0.2%. It could be a testing day.... Stuart Clark, manager at Quilter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s WealthSelect, reckons automatic trading systems helped to fuel Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. The sell-off really gained momentum quickly, especially toward the end of trading. That can be a tell-tale sign that algorithm based strategies are kicking in and chasing a trend, which can fuel a rally or a sell-off. While that can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be ignored, it is important to remember that reflects high volume, short-term trading and isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily a reflection of the fundamental case for any given stock.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treasury secretary has called for calm. Speaking at the IMF meeting in Bali, Stephen Mnuchin steered away from the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of the Federal Reserve. Instead, Mnuchin suggested that Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off was a fairly normal event. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets go up. Markets go down. I see this as a normal correction.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off was bad, but it was hardly horrific. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some context: The S&amp;P 500 index, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq, have also dipped into the red in very early trading.... The New York stock exchange has reopened, after suffering its biggest loss in eight months yesterday. And the Dow has opened..... LOWER, dropping by around 100 points in the opening moments. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic too much, though - it usually takes several minutes before trading is fully underway. Hold onto your hats... Wall Street is about to open for trading. Will Hobbs, head of investment strategy at Barclays Smart Investor, reckons investors should \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstay calm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 today, rather than panicking. He argues that the world economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the brink of a recession, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no reason to dump your portfolio: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Isolating the causes of sharp falls in stock markets is always a hazardous game. The reality is that such drops, as gut churning as they tend to be, are best seen as part and parcel of investing in capital markets. For long term investors, the rising trend is of course more important to focus on than the bumps in the road. For those trying to more actively trade the economic cycle, the key question is whether such volatility speaks of a darker economic turn for the US and world economy, a recession even. For our part we still cannot see the next recession on the horizon in the indicators that we look at. Recessions can, of course, rain from clear blue economic skies, so humility is always appropriate. This is particularly the case as we enter a period where US interest rates approach levels where, if still some distance from asphyxiate, are certainly no longer accommodative for the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most important capitalist economy. After a nasty pummelling, European stock markets are trying to climb off the mat. The FTSE 100 has clawed back some losses, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker-than-expected US inflation data. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still having a bad day, though, currently down 91 points at 7054. Investors are pondering whether today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off is the start of a downturn, or a buying opportunity.... Newsflash: Donald Trump has renewed his attack on the US Federal Reserve. Speaking to Fox News this morning, the president repeated his claim that the Fed has been too aggressive with its interest rate hikes. Trump said the Fed was getting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a little bit too cute,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re making a big mistake.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More news: the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit has risen. Some 214,000 US citizens filed an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinitial claim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for jobless help last week, up from 207,000. That could be another reason for the Fed to keep its hand off the trigger.. NEWSFLASH: US inflation didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise as fast as expected last month. This might bring some relief to the troubled markets. Core inflation (which strips out volatile items like oil and food) only rose by 0.1% in September, versus forecasts of a 0.2% rise. The means that annual core inflation was unchanged, at 2.2%. The headline inflation measure, the Consumer Prices Index, is also weaker than expected. It dropped to 2.3% year-on-year, down from 2.7%. Why does this matter? Because core inflation is a key measure used by the Federal Reserve when setting interest rates. So if prices aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rising as fast as feared, the Fed might be more reluctant to raise rates aggressively. And that might act as a balm to anxious investors around the globe..... Time for a quick recap. World stock markets are suffering one of their biggest slumps in months, after a shock slide on Wall Street on Wednesday. A wave of selling has sent Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 into correction territory, meaning it has lost most than 10% from its recent record high. It is currently down 113 points, or 1.6%, with house-builders and financial companies leading the rout. There are losses across Europe too; the French CAC is down 1.5% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has lost 0.9%. Photos of the sell-off are here. Investors across the globe have been shaken by the losses in New York yesterday - the shock sent Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei down almost 4%, while China tumbled over 5% to a four-year low. The VIX \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfear index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which tracks anxiety in the markets, has spiked. Analysts are blaming various factors, including the US-China trade war, recent rises in US borrowing costs, and the prospect of several more American interest rate rises. Technology stocks, and luxury goods makers, have been hit hard. The sight of Donald Trump blurring the lines around central bank independence, branding the Federal Reserve \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccrazy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped the mood. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top emerging nations have also weighed in, warning that trade wars are hurting their economies. Wall Street could suffer further losses when trading begins in around 80 minutes. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says: While U.S. President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s renewed criticism of the Federal Reserve for hiking interest rates played a role behind the steep selloff, there were other key factors brewing in the background. It is becoming clear that global equity markets are facing a perfect storm of headwinds such as rising U.S. bond yields, U.S.-China trade disputes, global growth concerns and prospects of higher U.S. interest rates. For as long as these themes remain, appetite for stocks are likely to diminish further consequently fueling speculation over the bull party coming to an end. Asian stocks fell sharply during early trade to close in the red while European shares slumped this morning. With the negative sentiment from Asian and European markets deterring investors from riskier assets, Wall Street is at threat of trading lower this afternoon. The oil price has also been dragged down today. Brent crude has sled $1.5 per barrel, or almost 2%, to $81.57. That reflects concerns that trade wars and higher US interest rates could hurt global growth. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of the head of the IMF defending America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker against Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the Federal Reserve has \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgone crazy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Tech has been the golden child for markets this year. But now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being disowned by investors, who rushed to ditch internet giants like Amazon (down 6% yesterday), Apple (which dropped 4.8%) Netflix (which shed 8%). One theory is that people are taking profits - there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a temptation to cash in your winning stocks when you see shares diving. Another theory is that tech firms will suffer particularly badly from a full-blown trade war, which looks increasingly likely unless Washington and Beijing start mending fences. Thirdly, some technology stocks are highly-leveraged, having issued large amounts of debt to fund their growth. So if US interest rates keep rising, their borrowing costs could become rather higher. Even crypto-currencies are being caught up in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Bitcoin has shed 5% today to trade around $6,200 at present, down $300 today. Here some photos showing how the stock sell-off has ripped around the world. It started in New York yesterday when a late slump wiped 3% off the value of the US stock market, while tech stocks suffered particularly badly. This set Asia up for a fall - with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main indices losing over 3.5% Australia was also pulled into the mire; its S&amp;P/ASX index shed 2.7%, led by energy and technology companies. Cue more pain in China, where stocks slumped by over 5%. This dragged the market down to its lowest level since 2014, as traders worried that the economy is suffering from the trade war with America. European investors then picked up the baton, and conducted a selling operation of their own. Heavy losses on all the main exchanges has wiped almost 2% off the Stoxx 600 index, down to to lowest level since the end of 2016. And with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 still down over 100 points, and in correction territory (10% below its record high), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a bad morning in the City. Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, says investors have been speculating for weeks that a correction was coming - and now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve talked ourselves into a sell-off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Miah pins the blame on trade war fears, and the prospect of higher US borrowing costs: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sell-off has been gathering strength for about two weeks now lead by the Asian markets as concerns were raised about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate, but fingers will also point at the hike in tariffs between the US and China and the impending trade wars. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But for us and many other analysts, a market sell-off was always going to be most likely as a result of the rising interest rate environment, especially in the US. We had the much expected hike in September from the US Federal Reserve now taking interest rates to 2.25% with the expectation that the policy makers will keep in their path of steady rate hikes as the US economy strengthened. But with unemployment recently hitting 3.7%, and as signs slack in the economy and with the labour market disappearing, there is the expectation that prices and inflation could start running ahead of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations. As a result, the policymakers may now think about increasing rates at a faster pace than anticipated. Over in New York, financial workers will be rising early and inspecting the damage across the global markets. Wall Street got an early taste of the rout, of course, when the Dow plunged by over 800 points in late trading on Wednesday. US traders can now see that the shockwave rippled to Asia, sending major indices down by 3%, and then Europe, where the Stoxx 600 is down 1.8% now. And the bad news is that New York is expected to suffer fresh losses today. The futures market suggests the Dow will fall by another 1%, when trading begins again, in three and a half hours time. Just in: A group of leading developing countries are calling for an end to the trade wars that have gripped the global economy this year. The G24, which includes China, India, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, say the global trading system should be reformed, not smashed up. In a statement issued in Bali, alongside the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting his week, the G24 warn that emerging markets are suffering: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trade uncertainties and financial and monetary conditions compound rising debt vulnerabilities. Improving debt sustainability depends on a supportive external trade and financial environment, timely contingency financing and the adequate flow of concessional financing for low income countries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in the UK, a new Bank of England survey shows that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s harder to get access to credit, as lenders tighten up: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no relief in the City. After two hours of bruising trading, the FTSE 100 sinking deeper into correction territory, down 123 points or 1.7% at 7022. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says investors have been perturbed by New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3% slump yesterday. Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plunge on Wall Street came as a shock and global markets are now readjusting. Sellers shaved 830 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average and 4% of Nasdaq with big tech names like Amazon, Intel and Microsoft bearing the brunt of the decline. The picture is not looking much better this morning. The Nikkei and the Shanghai Composite closed over 4% and 5.7% lower respectively, the FTSE started the day with a 1.19% decline and continued to sink from there. She also explains how the recent rise in US bond yields - because investors expect higher inflation and interest rates - is now hurting stocks: The plunge in US stock markets comes after a long run of almost undisrupted gains on Wall Street which were bound to come up for a correction. The strong US economic background that has supported share prices this year is now working against that same market. Rising interest rates are fuelling concerns that higher borrowing costs will erode the margins of US companies and with the domestic labour market at its strongest in nearly 50 years, wage pressures are filtering into companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 costs. The 10-year Treasury yield is used as a reference price for mortgages, car loans and other consumer debt and a spike in those yields is hitting industries like car makers and house builders that are exposed to consumer borrowing. The VIX volatility index has hit its highest level since April, following the hefty losses seen in the markets in recent days. The number of contracts for trading the VIX has also jumped, showing that traders expect the current market volatility to continue. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management blames the Wall Street sell-off on Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to impose tariffs on Chinese goods: US equities seem to be (finally) reflecting the cost of US President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade taxes. Around 80% of global trade involves multinational (generally listed) companies. A bit less than half of S&amp;P earnings come from outside the US. However, listed companies are only 25% of the US economy. Equities are at greater risk than the economy if trade is taxed aggressively. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a taste of the mood on the trading floors today: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has closed at its lowest level in almost four years, as the trade war with America continues to bite. The Shanghai composite index ended the day down 5.2% its heftiest rout in over two years. Trading screens were a sea of green, not red, though (as red is a lucky colour, it is used to show rising prices in China) Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off has dragged the FTSE 100 index into a correction! The blue-chip index has now lost more than 10% of its value since May, when it traded at an all-time high of 7,903 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a blow to anyone whose invested money in UK stocks in recent months. Neil Wilson of Markets.com has helpfully drawn up a list of the key factors behind the sell-off: Rising bond yields \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the sharp rally last week was the cue for a sustained period of declines which culminated in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Now we have a lot of momentum \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the breadth of the decline \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we could see things get worse before rallying. China and trade \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we thought that Nafta was important but really the fear is that we see the Sino-US tensions get worse. Comments around currency manipulation have not helped risk sentiment. No resolution can be expected until after the mid-terms. Fears around luxury stocks and comments from LVMH on Chinese demand have raised some concerns around earnings. Italy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ongoing Rome-Brussels spat is keeping European investors in a risk-off stance. Fresh valuation concerns heading into earnings season Yikes! World stock markets have slumped to their lowest level since February. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to data provider MSCI, whose \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcall country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index has careered down to an eight-month low this morning. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thanks to the triple-whammy of losses in Wall Street, the rout on Asia, and this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heavy early losses in Europe. Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says some frightened investors are ditching stocks: European stocks are the latest casualty in the global sell-off that has rattled markets over the last 24 hours, as investors worry about the potential for a sharper correction on the back of rising bond yields. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been something of a bloodbath overnight, as investors saw what occurred in the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite there being no clear catalyst for such a move - and dashed for the exits as fears grow that global risks are mounting and the bill is coming due. While people are naturally pointing to the bond market to explain the sudden panic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c most notably Trump who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been laying the groundwork for blaming the Fed for the last couple of months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I wonder whether the underlying risk in the markets for some time has left market primed for a correction and investors have simply fled at the first sign of danger. Paras Anand, head of asset management for Asia Pacific at Fidelity International, argues the sell-off in America isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a shock: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sharp sell-off in the US has likely caught no one by surprise. If anything, investors have been wondering how, in the face of tighter monetary policy, a contracting labour market and rising oil prices, the US has continued to be so resilient. Ouch! European stock markets have plunged to their lowest level in 20 month. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the largest shares in the region, has slumped by 1.6% today to its lowest level since the start of February 2017. Every sector is taking a chilly bath: Eurozone stocks are being dragged down the row between Rome and Brussels over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new budget, on top of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other concerns. Housebuilders and financial stocks are among the big fallers in London this morning: Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index has hit a new six-month low at the start of trading. The wave of selling that began in Wall Street last night, and swept through Asia today, has now reached the City. The Footsie has shed 113 points, or 1.58%. That takes it down to 7032 points, its lowest level since early April. Nearly every share has fallen. One rare exception being gold miner Randgold (as traders scramble for safe-haven assets). David Madden of CMC Markets says: The prospect of higher interest rates has left trader worried, as it means higher borrowing costs for companies and individuals. Homebuilders are under pressure as mortgage rates are likely to increase. Retailers are suffering for the same reason. Investors in Asia are reeling after a rather brutal day in the markets. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai index is now down over 6%, as worries over the US trade war intensify. Chinese stocks have now lost more than a fifth of their value this year. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets fears that the sell-off will continue: This slump is not going to be over that easily as Asia have already borne the burnt of this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war, which is fuelled with nothing but uncertainty. The Chinese markets are already in the bear territory so I expect the U.S. markets to continue to face the selling pressure. Boom! Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has waded in. Speaking at the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting in Bali, Lagarde insisted that it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153legitimate and necessary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the Federal Reserve to be raising interest rates. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a rebuke to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the Fed is going crazy. Touching on the slide in the markets, Lagarde pointed out that US stocks have hit record levels recently - suggesting that a correction should be expected. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is fair to observe and all people are observing that the US equity market and stock markets in general have been extremely high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The FT has more details. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, argues that Trump must take some of the blame for the market losses: While I agree with President Trump that Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff is the fault of the Fed, he should be reminded that the trade war he started with China and re-imposing sanctions on Iran is also to blame. His actions helped building inflationary pressures and the Fed cannot stand still when it sees the economy overheating. A steeper selloff in equity markets will probably lead to a pause in hiking rates, but the Fed will be more concerned about the overall economy performance than just equity prices. The widening rift between the US and China is driving shares down, says J.P. Morgan Asset Management global market strategist Marcella Chow: Headlines around the broadening US-China conflict also continue to worsen as the U.S. arrested and extradited a Chinese official in Belgium to face espionage charges. There are concerns over a 3Q earnings rise following recent profit warnings and weak reports. In particular, Fastenal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO said the trade war with China is raising material costs that will crimp profit margins and hurt US consumers, and French luxury goods maker LVMH confirmed Chinese border guards are more actively searching travelers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 suitcases for undeclared goods added to fears of a slowdown in spending by Chinese consumers. Charles Ripley, senior strategist at Allianz Investment Management, blames the prospect of higher interest rates: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equity selloff is a reaction from investors finally realizing we are in a higher interest-rate environment, and given the elevated level of stocks, market participants were likely looking for a reason to sell. Higher interest rates typically bring on tighter financial conditions which could dampen growth going forward and equity markets are reacting to that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ari Shrage, chief executive of Aliya Capital, agrees: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is much more interest-rate related than anything going on specifically with tech. Interest rates are moving higher, so stocks that are the most expensive typically are the ones that roll over. Steven Friedman, senior economist at BNP Paribas Asset Management, points to recent falls in the value of US government debt (or Treasury Bills). That has pushed up the yield on these bonds - a sign that investors expect inflation and interest rates to rise The rise in Treasury yields has been the primary catalyst for the sell-off in equities, since higher yields suggest a lower present value of future dividend streams, assuming an unchanged economic outlook. It is also possible that equity investors are growing concerned that the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s projected rate path will choke off the expansion.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning from London. World stock markets are sliding today as the anxiety that has been building in recent days explodes into a wave of selling. Shares have fallen sharply across Asia, after Wall Street suffered their worst sell off in eight months overnight, wiping 800 points, or 3%, off the Dow Jones industrial average. The rout has sent Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei into a tailspin, shedding 4%. Stocks in Hong Kong are down 3.8%, and there are chunky losses in Australia (-2.8%) and South Korea (4%) too. My colleague Martin Farrer explains from Australia: A jittery, volatile week on global financial markets has burst into a frenzy of selling, triggered by heavy losses on Wall Street and comments by Donald Trump describing US interest rate hikes as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crazy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit of a bloodbath,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ed Campbell, senior portfolio manager at QMA, the asset management branch of Prudential Financial in New York. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s primarily the cumulative effect of interest rate moves over the past five days and news reports about trade impacting companies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European markets had already endured a bad week, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about to get worse. Traders are predicting that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 will plunge to a new six-month low this morning, perhaps shedding more than 100 points. The rout is being fuelled by concerns that US interest rates are heading higher, as the Federal Reserve tries to keep a lid on American inflation. Donald Trump added to the pressure overnight, branding the Fed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccrazy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for planning to keep raising interest rates in the months ahead. Trump told reporters in Pennsylvania that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Fed has gone crazy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No, I think the Fed is making a mistake. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re so tight.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a correction we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been waiting for, for a long time, but I really disagree with what the Fed is doing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The president neglected to mention that its his relaxed fiscal policy, and recent tax cuts, are one factor pushing Federal Reserve governors to hike. Worries over the US trade war with China (another Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcachievement\u00e2\u20ac\u2122), are also worrying investors, after the IMF slashed its growth forecasts earlier this week. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale says Wall Street has finally caught up with events: For much of 2018, the US economy has been oblivious to a turn in the global economic cycle, and the US equity market has been unaffected as emerging market equities and currencies have come under pressure. This week has seen the S&amp;P, and the Nasdaq, sit up and pay attention to what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on. The President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of the Fed adds colour, but no real substance to the situation. Later today we get new US inflation figures, which could also move the markets. If price pressures keep mounting, the Fed will feel that it needs to keep raising borrowing costs, despite chuntering from the White House.

Should the UK and EU agree on a new customs union arrangement with the EU this will eliminate tariffs but does not mean no customs administration and paperwork. There will highly likely still be a requirement to file a declaration that the goods are in UK or EU free circulation and provide a customs value and classification for those goods. This is not frictionless trade as some would no doubt envisage. It offers a trading arrangement for customs purposes that is closer to a free trade agreement without delivering any of the wider benefits.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/11/second-kent-motorway-is-possible-post-brexit-lorry-park\">Kent motorway to shut as work begins on possible post-Brexit lorry park</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bernardine Adkins, head of EU trade and competition law, Gowling WLG, is more scathing about the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The guidance published today is pure fantasy.

                "bodyText":"Phew! After some rocky days, the New York stock market has ended the day higher. The Dow Jones industrial average has closed 287 points higher at 25,339, a gain of 1.15%. The wider S&amp;P 500 has risen by 1.4%, while the Nasdaq jumped by 2.3%. A sense of calm seems to have returned to the markets, with investors suspecting that this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses have created some bargains As Laura Kane, head of Americas thematic investing at UBS Global Wealth Management, puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Generally what we were seeing is more momentum and technology names selling off. Now buyers are coming back to say some of these are babies that were thrown out with the bath water. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had the pullback, valuations look attractive. But lets not forget what a bad few days it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been. The three main US stock indices have all suffered their worst week since March, with the Dow shedding 4.2%, the S&amp;P losing 4.1% and the Nasdaq off 3.7%. Opinion is split over whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s merely a healthy correction, or the start of a major sell-off. Given Europe managed to fall again today, there may be more drama ahead. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get a better feeling next week. Until then, goodnight! GW With less than 10 minutes to go, Wall Street is on track to end firmly higher. Traders on the floor of Wall Street look a little cheerier today, as they watched shares rise rather than slide... Wall Street traders are licking their wounds tonight after a bruising few days, which has knocked 5% off the Dow. That sharp decline, after a series of record highs of late, is making some investors reassess the health of the markets. But did the fall go too far? Some analysts are predicting better times ahead, at least in the short term. As Marketwatch puts it: Late-Thursday stock trading was characterized by powerful gyrations amounting to hundreds of points that took place within minutes. The Journal reported the Dow tumbled about 240 points in the final 90 minutes of trade, representing about half of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. However, some technical analysts make the case that the market has reached an oversold condition, where further declines may not be justified. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re certainly expecting a bounce in the short term,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wrote Justin Waltes, co-founder of research firm Bespoke Investment Group, in a Thursday report. However, he warned that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the longer term that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re more concerned about now given the technical breakdown we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen. Expect a rally soon, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go loading up on cyclicals with the expectation that the pain is over once we bounce. There is likely more volatility to come in the weeks ahead.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in the UK, the chairman of cake and cafe chain Patisserie Valerie has dipped, deep, into his pocket to keep it afloat. Entrepreneur Luke Johnson (whose future columns for the Sunday Times are eagerly awaited) is putting \u00c2\u00a320m into the company, as a loan. This follows the alleged \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fraudulent activity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd revealed this week that has left the business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future in serious doubt. At least two of its shops closed today, and finance director Chris Martin was arrested. Technology, consumer goods and basic materials companies are all pushing the Dow higher today. Credit card firm Visa is the top riser, up 3.6%, followed by Walgreen Boots (+3%), then three tech firms - Cisco, Microsoft and Apple all up around 2%. But energy firms Chevron and Exxon are lagging, down over 1% each. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the number of US oil rigs has jumped, according to new figures today, suggesting suppliers are trying to boost output. Wall Street is still managing to rally, though. Just. The Dow is currently up 90 points, or 0.37%, on track for its first gain after six days of losses. Tech stocks are recovering, pushing the Nasdaq up by 109 points or 1.5%. European stock markets have suffered their worst week in eight months. After jumping in early trading, shares dipped through the afternoon as traders became edgier again. Most indices have ended the day in the red, again, meaning the Stoxx 600 index of top European companies has lost 4.8% this week. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the worst weekly performance sine February, when it lost 5.1%. Reuters says: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a rotten trend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Europe, a trader complained, noting that U.S. shares have outperformed their European peers since the beginning of the year with the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal cuts boosting earnings. Europe lags far behind the United States in terms of earnings growth, and stronger results will be critical in luring back some of the billions that have been pulled out of European stocks this year. The rally in London\u001f has petered out. The FTSE 100 has closed 11 points lower at 6995.91, a dip of 0.16%. That takes it to a new six-month low, and deeper into a correction. Still, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a rather smaller loss than on in recent days. The European stock market rally is running out of steam! After a strong start, the major indices are heading back to earth as the closing bell approaches. The FTSE 100 is now up only 9 points, or 0.1%. Germany and France are also subsiding. David Madden of CMC Markets thinks traders are keen to protect themselves from any more volatility on Wall Street tonight (where stocks are still higher) The equity markets got off to a strong start following a mixed session in Asia, but now the gains are evaporating as we approach the close. Traders are keen to square up their books ahead of the weekend. The global equity rout originated in the US, and the moves continue to be US driven, and European dealers are keen to cash in their holdings as Wall Street still has several hours more trading left. The pound has lost ground today, as traders continue to watch Brexit developments nervously. The UK government is currently trying to reassure sceptical MPs, and ministers, over a proposed backstop arrangement that could effectively keep the whole UK inside the customs union. Downing Street insists that it would never agree to an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcindefinite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 backstop, in an attempt to placate Brexit-supporting MPs who insist on a clean break with the EU. But with time running out, the pound has lost half a cent against the US dollar to $1.318. Ursula Johnston, head of customs, Gowling WLG, warns that such an arrangement may not would actually deliver frictionless trade. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a crucial issue, as the government begins work on turning motorways in Kent into parking lots for lorries after Brexit... She explains: The UK newspapers are filled today with reports of Theresa May closing in on a deal with the EU whereby the whole of the UK would remain in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, or, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd customs union with the EU for an indefinite period. This is on the face of it promising news for those that would like the UK to keep the closest possible trading ties with the EU without being a member of the Single Market. The concept of a UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c EU customs union seems to offer the holy grail of frictionless trade and providing a workable solution to the Irish border conundrum. However what has not been clarified, as yet, is whether the UK would remain part of the Customs Union and trade with the EU-27 as it does today i.e. no customs administrative requirements or whether the UK will form a new customs union with the EU. Should the UK and EU agree on a new customs union arrangement with the EU this will eliminate tariffs but does not mean no customs administration and paperwork. There will highly likely still be a requirement to file a declaration that the goods are in UK or EU free circulation and provide a customs value and classification for those goods. This is not frictionless trade as some would no doubt envisage. It offers a trading arrangement for customs purposes that is closer to a free trade agreement without delivering any of the wider benefits. Bernardine Adkins, head of EU trade and competition law, Gowling WLG, is more scathing about the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans: The guidance published today is pure fantasy. The government say that they will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seek to bring into force bilateral UK-third country agreements from exit day, or as soon as possible thereafter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There is no mention that the UK is currently unable to negotiate bilateral deals, so there is absolutely no possibility of bilateral agreements being in place on exit day. Worse still \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcas soon as possible thereafter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will be the time it takes to negotiate deals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is at least 5 years if not longer. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at least 5 years in which UK businesses will face increased costs for customs clearance and compliance. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guidance on free trade agreements is telling. It grossly underestimates the time it takes to negotiate free trade deals, and glibly notes that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthere may be practical changes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to how current users of EU free trade agreements will deal with third countries. Importantly, however, the government has dropped its fantastical stance of simply rolling over EU free trade agreements on exit day. The problem is that there is no viable option to avoid increased tariffs or other impediments to trade in a no deal scenario. Ding Ding! The opening bell of Wall Street is ringing out, setting us up for a strong open. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 1.5%, or over 360 points. That follows two days of big losses that wiped out almost 1,400 points. The S&amp;P 500 is also up around 1.5%. The tech-focused Nasdaq index is rallying hard too, up almost 2.5%. After six days of losses, New York is trying to end this week on the front foot. Financial stocks are among the top risers, after decent results from JP Morgan, Citi and Wells Fargo earlier today. Stephen Mnuchin has also played down the suggestion that China could dump its holdings of US government debt. He claimed such a move would be costly for Beijing, and that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be plenty of other buyers anyway. More soothing words, this time from US treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin. Asked about the markets, Mnuchin told CNBC that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153markets tend to go too far in both directions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - suggesting he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not too worried about this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Mnuchin also insisted that the US economy was in good shape. arguing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fundamentals are still very strong. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The U.S. economy is strong. U.S. earnings are strong. I see this as just a natural correction after the markets were up a lot.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Unlike his boss, Mnuchin didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame the Federal Reserve for the sell-off. Asked about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of Fed chair Jerome Powell, Mnuchin replied: I think Jay is doing a good job. Maybe all is forgiven, now shares are are going up again.... Financial titan JP Morgan has given the markets a boost, by releasing stronger financial results than expected. JP Morgan earned $2.34 per share in the last quarter, beating forecasts of $2.25 per share. Revenues were 5% higher too, at $27.8bn, suggesting Wall Street is managing to navigate the choppy waters of 2018. Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153JPMorgan Chase delivered strong results this quarter with top-line growth in each of our businesses, demonstrating the power of our platform. The U.S. and the global economy continue to show strength, despite increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties, which at some point in the future may have negative effects on the economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wall Street traders have woken up in a better mood .... Stock markets in emerging economies are recovering some ground today, after suffering their biggest fall in two years on Thursday. The MSCI index of developing market stocks has jumped by 2.2% today, led by Taiwan (up 2.4%), India (+2.1%), the Philippines (+1.75%) and South Korea (+1.5%). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters take: Those moves tracked a general improvement in appetite for risk among investors globally, with developed world stock markets recovering after a dramatic two-day slide on Wall Street. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing a bit of a rebound in EM stock markets today...we saw a similar occurrence earlier this year when U.S.stocks came under pressure and that automatically improved, and that might be what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing this time around as well,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. US tech stocks may have a better day too... Wall Street is expected to rally when trading begins in four hours. Dow futures are showing a 350 point gain, which would claw back a chunk of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 545-point losses. Fiona Cincotta of City Index thinks the worst is over, for now anyway.... The global selloff seems to have come to an end and the market is picking up the pieces after the hurricane. The tally: the Dow has lost 1,400 points in two days, Brent Crude is back down at $81 and the dollar is trading at 1.1579 against the euro. Key indices have fallen below their 200-day moving averages and are beginning to look oversold but the underlying economic reasons for a rise in interest rates that had triggered the spike in bond yields and the selloff in equities is still in place. For the moment though, European markets are back in the black and the recovery in Dow futures indicates a stronger start on Wall Street later today. Investors should be wary before diving back into the market today, argues Peter Dixon of Commerzbank. He writes: The sharp correction in stock markets in the last couple of days should be seen as a warning shot against the market complacency which has been one of the predominant themes of the last 12 months. Indeed, measures of equity volatility continue to suggest that investors are underpricing risk. We pointed out at the start of the year that equity investors appeared to be increasingly reluctant bulls and were driven more by the FOMO factor (fear of missing out) than the fundamentals, and advised investors to take risk off the table. Dixon points out that shares still look pricy, even though the Footsie has shed almost 10% since the start of the year. Having enjoyed a great run since March 2009, with global equities having generated returns of 300%, it is difficult to imagine that there is much more juice to be squeezed out of the lemon. On a conventional valuation basis, long-term P/E ratios suggest that equities are extremely expensive. The cyclically adjusted P/E (CAPE) popularised by Robert Shiller suggests that the S&amp;P500 has only once been more overvalued than it is today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the late-1990s tech boom \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on a dataset going back 130 years: Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery, stock markets are heading for their worst week since February, Reuters points out. The markets are breathing a sigh of relief this morning, says Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, Head of Investment at interactive investor. But while some investors are piling back into shares, others are being more cautious. Trade wars, rising interest rates and slowing growth have been front and centre in terms of big macro reasons for the rout, but the reality is that investors need to be asking whether valuations can be justified by company profits or have markets got ahead of themselves? The start of the US earnings season sees JP Morgan, Wells Fargo and Citibank all reporting today, and good results could provide the catalyst that sees markets recover their recent losses, while disappointing numbers are likely to jeopardise any positive sentiment. Newsflash: stricken UK cafe chain Patisserie Valerie has told the City that its finance chief was arrested last night. This follows the discovery earlier this week of a \u00c2\u00a320m black hole in the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance, sheet, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153accounting irregularities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The company told shareholders that: The Company has been made aware that Chris Marsh, who is currently suspended from his role as Company Finance Director, was arrested by the police last night and has been released on bail. Further updates will be released in due course as appropriate. Yesterday, Patisserie Valerie warned that it needs \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an immediate injection of capital\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to survive. It also revealed earlier this week that it faces a winding-up order from HMRC over an unpaid tax bill of more than \u00c2\u00a31m that was filed in the high court in mid-September but which the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s directors had been unaware of. In another sign of easing tensions, the Vix volatility index has dropped this morning. The VIX is now hovering at 21.74% this morning, down from Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eight-month high of 25% yesterday. Reports that the leaders of US and China could hold fresh talks over trade next month are also helping the markets shake off their losses. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: The Washington Post reported Trump and Xi agreeing to a side-lines meet at next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G20 summit, fuelling hopes for a trade war truce to offset rising bond yields mounting pressure on the US economy. Global markets have calmed down overnight, says Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale. His morning note to clients is titled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A day off for the horsemen of the apocalypse?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, suggesting he expects less drama today... European trading is underway, and markets are bouncing back from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slumps. The FTSE 100 is sitting up in bed and taking some soup. The blue-chip index has gained 30 points at the open, or 0.4%, taking it back to 7035. However, that still means it has suffered a correction (down more than 10% since May). The German market is looking perkier too - the Dax has gained 1.2% at the open. France is up 1%, while Spain is 0.9% higher. Confidence may be returning to the markets, after some panicky moments earlier this week. But is it a proper recovery, or just a classic \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdead cat bounce\u00e2\u20ac\u2122? Neil Wilson of Markets.com sees reasons for optimism: The breadth and depth of the decline in the US market is a concern and suggest earnings and valuations are a factor. In addition to the yield narrative, in many ways this selloff could reflect real angst about the third-quarter earnings season and what outlook is painted by corporates on earnings calls. ... However, on the fundamentals the reasons to be positive remain in place. The fact that the US inflationary pressures are not running out of control continue to suggest this is a picture of good news and fundamental strength. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a cheerier end to the week in Asia. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark index, the Shanghai Composite, has jumped by 1% - a recent performance, until you remember it slumped by 5% on Thursday. Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng index is 2% higher, while Japan and Australia have stabilised. Stephen Innes of trading group OANDA reckons traders need the weekend to recuperate, after some draining days: This market is exhausted from all after the most significant sell-off in global equities since February. Its large shake out the landscape remains no less uncertain and while the current narrative is likely to rage on until Novembers G20 summit at least, prudence suggesting keeping one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s powder dry on this recovering Friday and live to fight another day after yesterday most unpleasant experiences. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After two days of heavy losses, the financial markets are catching their breath and assessing the situation today. Asian markets have rallied a little overnight, and traders are predicting a bounce-back in Europe this morning too. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a lot of anxiety in the City today, after investors watched the FTSE 100 lurch down by 2% into a correction yesterday. That set up Wall Street for another big slump last night; the Dow lost another 545 points, taking its two-day losses to over 1,300 points, or 5%. Anxiety over US interest rates, the trade war between America and China, and signs that the world economy is slowing are all being blamed. Plus, Donald Trump is adding to the uncertainty by firing a series of pot-shots at the Federal Reserve, who he blames for fuelling the sell-off. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liveblog, covering all the drama from Europe, to the US and then Asia: David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, says investors remain nervous..... while also wondering if this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turmoil is actually a buying opportunity. It was a choppy day yesterday as traders remained cautious about the prospect of higher interest rates in the US, mounting political pressure in Italy, and deteriorating global trading relationships. We saw huge swings in European and US stock markets as traders were battling with the age old emotions of fear and greed. Traders love to snap up relatively cheap stocks, but sharp moves to the downside have left some traders worried this could be the beginning of a major decline. Stocks in Europe and the US finished the day firmly in the red. On the economic front, we get a new healthcheck on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories today, plus a new measure of US confidence. Plus it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the start of the bank reporting season, with Citi, JP Morgan, and Wells Fargo all reporting results. That could well move the markets....

Europe then had a wobbly session, before the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 managed to close nearly 0.5% higher. Brexit remained a worry, as UK PM Theresa May warned that she can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept Brussels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 proposal for a backstop for Northern Ireland. The US market failed to sparkle, after the latest US retail sales figures were weaker than expected - only growing by 0.1% in September. There was no big sell-off in New York, but the main indices did end the day lower. The tech sector remained under pressure, due to its exposure to global growth, and its vulnerability to disruption from a trade war. Hardware maker Cisco Systems was the biggest faller on the Dow, down 2.2%, followed by Apple (-2.1%), Visa (2%) and Microsoft (-1.8%). The disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey also loomed over the markets.

And on the fiscal side, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit has jumped to $779bn, thanks to a burst of spending. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all from us today. Goodnight. So much for the rally! A late swirl of selling has sent Wall Street into the red at the closing bell. The Dow shed 89 points, or 0.35%, back down to 25,250. The Nasdaq had a worse day, losing 1%.

America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit jumped by over $100bn in the last fiscal year, to nearly $780bn. Higher defence and social security spending helped to drive up the deficit, even though the economy grew strongly too. Marketwatch has the details: The U.S. recorded a $779 billion deficit in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, an increase of $113 billion, as spending climbed while revenue remained nearly flat, the Treasury Department announced Monday. Outlays grew by $127 billion, or 3.2%, while government receipts rose 0.4%, or $14 billion. Compared to GDP, the deficit rose to 3.9%, up by 0.4 percentage points. In September alone, the U.S. recorded a surplus of $119.1 billion. UK defence firm BAE Systems saw its shares fall today, as traders pondered the implications of the Khashoggi case. Earlier, Donald Trump told reporters that the Saudi king had firmly denied being responsible for the journalist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappearance - indeed, Trump suggested that rogue elements could be to blame (inside the Saudi consulate in Ankara?). Trump has now dispatched his Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, to the Middle East to investigate. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says the Saudi tensions loomed over the City: Ironically, it was UK defence giant BAE Systems that bore the brunt of the dispute, trading down 3.46% on the day, as a conflict with the oil producing country could threaten its \u00c2\u00a310 billion deal for 48 Typhoon jets. The oil market was surprisingly placid about rising political tensions with Brent crude trading up 0.35% and WTI up 0.39%. Instead some investment went into gold and gold shares, notably Rangold and Anglo American. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market also had a better day, with the DAX gaining 90 points or 0.8%. France ended slightly lower, though. A day that started with blustery rain and deep puddles in the City of London has ended with a modest recovery. The FTSE 100 has nudged its way back over the 7,000 point mark, gaining 33 points or 0.45% to finish at 7,029. This means the Footsie has avoided setting another six-month closing low, as looked possible this morning. Wall Street is attempting to push higher, and add to Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery. The Dow is now up 84 points, or 0.3%, while the Nasdaq is coming off its lows. Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market sell-off was partly due to worries that the global economy is slowing. And Capital Economics has added to those concerns, by predicting that the next recession could be closer than previously thought. Neil Shearing, their chief economist, believes it will be triggered in America, as the Federal Reserve raises rates to calm inflation (as Donald Trump has warned). Shearin\u001cg writes: The next global downturn is likely to come much sooner than the current consensus anticipates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c indeed, we think that world GDP growth is already peaking in this cycle and that it will slow relatively sharply in 2019-20. The downturn itself is likely to be led by the US, where higher interest rates will begin to weigh on rate-sensitive sectors of the economy, and China, which is undergoing a structural slowdown. And while we anticipate that the next global downturn will be relatively short and mild compared to previous cycles, there is a long and growing list of threats that mean there is a significant risk of a sharper adjustment. The newswires are reporting that Janet Yellen, the former chair of the US Federal Reserve, has criticised Donald Trump for his attacks on her predecessor, Jerome Powell. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal has the details: Yellen also cited the danger that the US economy is running too hot, and also cautioned that the US trade dispute with China could hurt the global economy. Back in New York, the sell-off is gathering momentum. The Nasdaq tech index is now down 1%. Pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca has frozen investment in the UK until it knows what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening with Brexit, according to the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman. Leif Johansson told French newspaper Le Monde that the UK-Swedish firm has activated its contingency plans. It is now stockpiling medicines at national borders and has duplicated some of its UK operations in Sweden. Johansson, whose company has operations in Cambridge and Macclesfield, adds: We have also stopped investing in the UK. More here. The chimes of the opening bell are ringing out across Wall Street, teeing up a fresh week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading. Traders are edgy following the worst week since March, and in the face of rising tensions around Saudi Arabia. And...shares are dipping in early trading. The Dow Jones industrial average has shed 20 points, or 0.1%, while the Nasdaq is 0.3% lower. Big tech stocks, including Facebook, Netflix and Amazon, are among the big fallers: Back in London, the FTSE 100 has struggled back from his morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s six-month low. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now up 19 points , or 0.3%, at 7015. But the FTSE 250 index, which contains smaller UK companies, is having a worse day. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down 199 points, or 1%, at 18,774, partly due to those nasty profit warnings from SuperDry and ConvaTec this morning. The weak US retail sales growth in September has surprised City economics and investors - here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some early reaction: Just in: Americans spent less in restaurants and malls than expected last month. US retail sales only rose by 0.1% in September, much weaker than the 0.6% growth which economists had expected. This is partly due to a 1.8% fall in spending at restaurants and bars, the biggest drop since December 2016. That wiped out a 0.8% surge in car purchases. Clothing sales rose by 0.5%, while online and mail-order shopping jumped by 1.1%. Such a big drop in spending in bars and eateries could worry economists - it may signal that US consumers are cutting back. However, it could also be due to one-off factors, such as the hurricanes which hit the US last month. Two more top US executives have pulled out of Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDavos in the desert\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 event, over the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi. Blackstone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stephen Schwarzman and BlackRock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Larry Fink have both withdraw from the high-profile Saudi Arabian investment conference taking place later this month (with a shrinking guest list). Over the weekend, the CEO of JP Morgan and the chairman of Ford both cancelled, as the furore over Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappearance intensified. Other top bosses are still weighing up their next move -- but I suspect we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re reaching where attending the event is more controversial than finding a previous engagement in the diary (or even subsequent one...) Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, has called for Britain to rethink its relationship with Riyadh too: We should not be in league with a brutal dictatorship that beheads its own citizens for standing up for their rights, which rains down airstrikes on civilian areas in Yemen with no concern for innocent children, and that thinks it can assassinate dissident journalists in other countries with impunity. We must apply the same standards to countries such as Saudi Arabia, Israel and Egypt that we apply to Iran, Russia and Syria. Where any of them abuse human rights and breach international humanitarian law, we must be prepared to call it out in the same measure, rather than treating it as one rule for our supposed friends and another for our supposed enemies. Just in: Bank of America has beaten Wall Street forecasts, which might calm some investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 nerves. The second-largest US bank make profits of 66 cents per share in the last quarter, ahead of the 62 cents expected by analysts. Revenues grew by 4%, as Bank of America benefitted from higher interest rates and recent US tax cuts. Chief executive officer Brian Moynihan sounds upbeat, declaring: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Responsible growth, backed by a solid U.S. economy and a healthy U.S. consumer, combined to deliver the highest quarterly pre-tax earnings in our company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More UK retail gloom: Fashion accessories retailer Claire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is considering a raft of store closures in the UK, according to a report on the Press Association. The US stock market is expected to lose ground when trading begins in three hours. The futures market is indicating the Dow Jones industrial average will shed 106 points, or 0.4%, at the open. New retail sales figures (at 1.30pm UK time) and financial results from Bank of America could both move the markets. The main Asian stock markets have all closed in the red today. Japan fell by almost 1.8%, Hong Kong lost 1.5%, Shanghai shed 1.4% and Australia finished 1% lower (our earlier summary has more details) The oil price is pushing higher this morning, amid rising tensions between Saudi and the US over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Brent crude has risen 1% to $81.25 per barrel, back towards the four-year high set earlier this month. Bloomberg is reporting that the Saudi King has ordered an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153internal probe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd into the Khashoggi - who is presumed to have been murdered after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. On Saturday, US president Donald Trump vowed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsevere punishment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 if it was confirmed that the Saudi regime had killed Khashoggi. This was a hardening of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original position, that he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to risk investment and jobs over the case. Saudi Arabia, though, denies being involved -- and has now vowed to retaliate if sanctions are imposed. In theory, Saudi could hurt America badly by cutting crude production -- in a repeat of the 1970s oil shock. That would send transport costs soaring, drive inflation higher, and hurt growth. Saudi is the biggest single producer in the Opec cartel, producing over 10 million barrels today (global demand is 100 barrels/day), so it could have a major impact on prices. However, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an argument that rival suppliers, such as the US shale industry, could step in to fill a production shortfall. Ouch. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchange has now overcome its technical issues, and traders are sending shares lower. The DAX has dipped by 20 points, or 0.18%, to 11,503 points, a new 20-month low. The gold price has jumped by 1% today to $1,231 per ounce. Bullion is benefiting from a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flight to safety\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as nervous investors look for a safer place for their money, says Stephen Innes of trading firm OANDA: While the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s version of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Red October \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 makes it way into the South China Sea, echoes of Octobers past are reverberating throughout global capital markets as risk off continues to linger with equity market look ever so fragile. The US Treasury is set to release the semi-annual FX report. While China doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t meet the historical criteria to be named a currency manipulator who is to say, President Trump, my not rewrite the requirements so that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inclusion in the future is assured? Geopolitical embers are smouldering, threatening to ignite the middle east powder over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The UK FTSE 100 has just hit a new six-month low, as its early gains fizzle out. The blue-chip index of leading sharews in London is now down 27 points at 6968. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest level since the end of March, adding to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. This follows the weak trading in Asia (where Japan lost 1.8% and China fell 1.4%). Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a noticeable lack of bargain hunters on Monday morning as last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound in select parts of the market fails to extend into the new working week. The FTSE 100 was down 0.1% in early trading at 6,988 with investors clearly lacking confidence to snap up stocks whose share prices were badly damaged in last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market sell-off. The biggest riser is gold producer Randgold \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a traditional \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsafe-haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in troubled times, with other \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdefensive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stocks such as British American Tobacco and BT Group also in demand. Engineering firms such as Melrose and BAE are among the big fallers: Pakistan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has made a bad start to the new week, falling over 2% in early trading. That follows a 4% tumble last week, as investors fretted about Pakistan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic outlook. Prime Minister Imran Khan is seeking an emergency bailout from the International Monetary Fund, who may demand tough austerity measures in return. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchange has been hit by a technical glitch that has prevented trading getting underway. The Financial Times explains: The opening of trade in Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market, the primary trading venue for German equities, was delayed on Monday by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153technical problems\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Xetrastock exchange, one of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest, faced issues with its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trading infrastructure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which meant the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trading start will not take place according to the usual trading schedule.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So, we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see how the German DAX is faring yet.... As feared, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no recovery in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market this morning. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the largest European companies, has dropped by another 0.4% to a fresh 22-month low. With traders reluctant to take risks, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a jittery feel in the trading floors again. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says: The Swiss franc and yen are stronger. Hard Brexit risks are mounting, global political risks are ever-present and equities and bond yields are lower ex-Italy. The breakdown in Brexit talks, the disappearance of dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the demise of the CSU in Bavarian elections, the impasse over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget and the worried tone coming from the IMF/World Bank meetings in Bali all combine to give financial markets an uncomfortable feel this morning. Shares in UK fashion group SuperDry have plunged by 20% after it shocked the City with a profits warning. SuperDry says that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unseasonably hot weather conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the UK, Continental Europe and on the East Coast of America has hit demand for its autumn ranges, and wipe \u00c2\u00a310m off profits. In another blow, the company is taking an \u00c2\u00a38m hit on foreign exchange costs, after discovering that its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hedging mechanisms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have not protected it from volatility in the currency markets. Investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed - sending SuperDry shares sliding from \u00c2\u00a310.15 to just \u00c2\u00a38.12. At the start of the year they were worth \u00c2\u00a320. Astonishingly, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not enough to make SuperDry the worst-performing stock today. That \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchonour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 goes to medical equipment maker ConvaTec, whose shares have lurched 30% lower. The colostomy and wound bag manufacturer has slashed its profit forecasts, due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153challenging market dynamics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and its CEO is retiring. In London, the FTSE 100 index has opened 20 points higher (+0.3%), as traders try to put last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses behind them. Artjom Hatsaturjants at City firm Accendo Markets says the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness is helping multinational companies: The muted open comes after a negative start to the week in Asia, where concerns over rising US interest rates continued weighing on equities. Brexit negotiations suffered another setback over the weekend, as PM Theresa May rejected key EU proposals over the Irish border, dealing a blow to negotiations to avert a hard Brexit. This has sent the GBP [the pound] sharply lower ahead of an EU leaders summit on Wednesday, helping FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international names. After another day of losses, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has sunk to its lowest closing level in almost four years. CHINA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122S SHANGHAI COMPOSITE INDEX CLOSES DOWN 1.49% TO 2568.1 CHINA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122S CSI 300 INDEX FALLS 1.4% TO 3,126.45 AT CLOSE A cocktail of risks are weighing on the markets, says Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group: Concerns over higher US borrowing costs were the catalyst for last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heavy sell off. However, there were plenty of other risk factors which were also dampening sentiment. Those risk factors, including US- Sino trade tensions, Brexit, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget proposal and now increased political tensions between the US and Saudi Arabia, are set to keep pressure on risk appetite this week. Good morning from a wet and grisly London. Last week wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a pretty one for the City - the FTSE 100 fell steadily to a six-month low, while European stock sank to their lowest in 21 months. And as the rain tips down, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little sign of optimism in the markets today. Germany traders have been rattled by yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bavarian state parliament election, which saw the ruling Christian Social Union lose its majority. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another blow to Angela Merkel (whose CDU party are partners with the CSU) There are tensions in Italy too, where the government is expected to approve its new budget, despite complaints from Brussels that it will breach EU fiscal rules. Yesterday, Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte announced the budget would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a change of gear for Italy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Conte suggests Europe would soften its view, once Rome has explained its growth strategy to them.... But until that happens, investors will fear another episode in the eurozone debt crisis. Spread-betting firm IG predicts fresh losses in Frankfurt and Milan today: The losses continue to mount up on financial markets amid uncertainty across the world about trade, rising US interest rates and now a potential clash between the US and Saudi Arabia over the fate of missing journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The Saudi tension has sent the price of oil up and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also been a rough night for the pound ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crunch Brexit summit with sterling slipping. The yen meanwhile has strengthened a touch against the dollar. Stock markets fell in Asia overnight led by the Nikkei in Japan. It is off 1.85% (not helped by the rising yen). Seoul -0.7%, the Hang Seng -1.24% and Shanghai is off 0.83%. The ASX200 in Sydney closed down 0.99%. Futures trade suggests a flat start later today for the FTSE100 while the Dax30 in Germany is seen dropping 0.25%. Wall Street is tipped to fall too. The pound is down 0.3% to $1.31 and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.135. Brent crude is up 1.25% amid Saudi tensions. JP Morgan and Ford bosses have joined the boycott of the Future Investment Intiative conference in Riyadh next week in the wake of the Khashoggi affair. China says it faces \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncertainties\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plenty of room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for fiscal manoeuvre if thin gs get sticky. Which they nevertheless say they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. The US dollar rose against the euro and other currencies. These included the Aussie dollar, a proxy for emerging market sentiment, which slipped to US71.06c from US71.26c on Friday. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m signing off now. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been an interesting day but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to hand over to Graeme Wearden in London. Thanks for joining us. It will be fascinating to see where the price of oil goes this week. Brent futures have risen 1.255 today to $81.5 a barrel and that could rise to $100 according to one analyst. Kazuhiko Fuji, senior fellow at the Japanese government thinktank, the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry, said: Oil prices could rise to $100 on worries about Saudi Arabia. People had thought the Saudis will make up for fall in Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output. If they are starting to use oil as their weapon, that will be a whole new chapter. Apologies - I jumpped the gun on the Aussie market. The final settlemtn pushed it deeper into the red to end down 58.6 points, or 0.99%, at 5837.1 points. Sears, the venerable US retailer, has gone into administration. It has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, according to a filing in a New York court, Reuters reports. The filing says Sears, which once dominated US retailing in the golden age of catalogues, has assets in the range of $1bn to 10bn and liabilities in the range of $10bn to $50bn. The ASX200 is done for the day. It finishes down 46 points, or 0.79%, at 5,849 points. Saudi Arabia has threatened to retaliate against the world economy if western nations impose sanctions or similar if it emerges that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security forces murdered the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But what form could Saudi action take? Our business reporter Rob Davies has been looking at the issues and his main points are The Saudis have the obvious power to push up oil prices. it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest producer and reducing output would see prices rise, possibly causing a devastating oil shock to the world economy. Second, the Saudis support thousands of US jobs through their extensive arms imports. Loss of those contracts would damage Donald Trump and he has already flagged that he doesnn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to jeopradise those deals for companies such as Boeing and Lockheed. Saudi funds are also important to planned US infrastructure development. And it is a key strategic ally in the Middle East On the other side of the ledger, the Saudis are relying on western companies to reform the kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stagnant economy and diversify it away from oil. The growing boycott of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh (now including JP Morgan and Ford) shows possible leverage. it will be a blow to Prince Mohammed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prestige if more high-profile names pull out. You can read Rob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full piece here: We seem to have hit a fairly quiet spot in the trading day. The ASX200 in Sydney is down around 1% and is due to close in a few minutes. The Nikkei hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t moved from the -1.5% mark for a couple of hours. Ditto the Kospi (-0.5%) and the Hang Seng ( -0.1%). The CSI300 in Shanghai is probably the biggest mover, sliding from positive territory a couple of hours ago to now being off 0.8%. Talking of China, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth revisiting comments by the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank governor at the close of the IMF meeting in Bali on Sunday. Yi Gang said China still had plenty of room for adjustment in interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) in the face of any negative impact from trade tensions with the United States. He admitted China faced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tremendous uncertainties\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but was seeking a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153constructive solution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the current trade tensions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We still have plenty of monetary policy instruments in terms of interest rate policy, in terms of RRR. We have plenty of room for adjustment, just in case we need it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yi said, indicating that Beijing feels it has plenty of ammunition to fire up the economy if needed. He added that he expected GDP to print at least 6.5% on Friday. Chris Weston of Pepperstone in Melbourne has weighed with some commentary, saying things could quite ugly on stock markets if data out of China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c inflation, GDP and retail sales \u00e2\u20ac\u201c disappoints later in the week. After last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s volatility shock to markets, we start the week on a negative tone, with broad weakenss through Asia and the ASX 200 falling out of bed. The weekend news flow has centred on a lack of progress in the Brexit negotiations, a deterioration in Saudi/US relations, which have resulted in a 1.1% rally in crude, and the loss of majority for the CSU party in the German regional elections. Here are the latest scores, courtesy of IC Markets (although I think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve missed the minus sign off the Hang Seng price): Summing up nicely, Masayuki Kubota, chief strategist at Rakuten Securities says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say the shock is over.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound is set for a volatile few days as the wrangling over Brexit intensifies ahead of the meeting of European leaders starting on Wednesday night. It sits at $1.31 at the moment after losing 0.3% today. The key issue is how to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The EU wants the North to remain essentially bound by EU customs rules but that is facing pushback from Brexiters. Theresa May is hoping a temporary \u00e2\u20ac\u0153backstop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd can be put in place where the whole country remains in the customs deal for the time being. (There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good explainer here from Daniel Boffey, or Brussels correspondent.) Meanwhile, former foreign secretary and would-be Tory leader, Boris Johnson, has sounded off again in his Telegraph column. He says the backstop idea should be rejected completely and says the EU is treating the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with contempt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: In presuming to change the constitutional arrangements of the United Kingdom, the EU is treating us with naked contempt. Like some chess player triumphantly forking our king and our queen, the EU commission is offering the UK government what appears to be a binary choice. It is a choice between the break-up of this country, or the subjugation of this country, between separation or submission. So seems like a good moment to run this brilliant picture of UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and other foreign ministers in the maze at his country retreat Chevening this weekend. Still with Australia and interesting to note that Shane Oliver, the high-profile chief economist at AMP, has suggested that he might have to revise downwards his forecasts on house prices. He tweeted on Saturday that the auction results weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good but his forecast of a peak to trough fall of 15% out to 2020 remained in place. But he told the AFR that he might hve to rethink that forecast on the downside. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The risks are skewing to greater than 5% declines per year, which is what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been assuming,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told the Financial Review on Sunday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am thinking about revising down again.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In Australia the ASX200 has had a torrid morning. At one point it was down more than 1.5% but it has recovered at bit and is now at 5,829, a fall of 66 points or 1.1%. The financial sector has been battered amid concern about the impact of the royal commission on the big four and the amount of compensation they will have to pay. Commonwealth is the worst performing, down more than 2%. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the question of the impact from a deteriorating housing market. According to the AFR this morning, less than half of properties at auction this weekend were sold. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bad outcome during what should be one of the busiest times of the year. Agents are blaming lack of credit for buyers pulling out. The Chinese trading day has kicked off. The Hang Seng is down nearly 1% while the Shanghai Composite is up a fraction. Another major factor in stock market losses this week has been the prospect of a full-blown US-China trade war. But calls for calm from leaders gathered at the IMF conference in Bali last week seem to have fallen on deaf ears. The Chinese currency fell again against the dollar today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now at 6.92. That is sure to rattle Washington where there is a widespread view that beijing manipulates the currency to benefit exporters. In Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IMF communique, members agreed to debate ways to improve the World Trade Organization so it can better address trade disputes and that countries would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153refrain from competitive devaluations and will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The latter point address concern that China will allow the yuan to depreciate in order to make its exports more competitive to cope with any downside from US tariffs. Hmm ... While the Ssudi government has come out fighting on the prospect of US sanctions in the Khashoggi case, the boss of the Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya satellite news network has gone a few steps further. Turki Aldakhil paints an apocalyptic picture of world affairs if the US tries to get tough on the Saudis. He says the kingdom would respond by slashing oil output and would team up with Russia and stop buying US arms. The US would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stabbing itself to death\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Imposing any type of sanctions on Saudi Arabia by the West will cause the kingdom to resort to other options, US President Donald Trump had said a few days ago, and that Russia and China are ready to fulfill Riyadh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s military needs among others. No one can deny that repercussions of these sanctions will include a Russian military base in Tabuk, northwest of Saudi Arabia, in the heated four corners of Syria, Israel, Lebanon and Iraq. At a time where Hamas and Hezbollah have turned from enemies into friends, getting this close to Russia will lead to a closeness to Iran and maybe even a reconciliation with it. The list of marquee speakers at the Future Investment Intiative conference in Saudi Arabia next week makes interesting reading because a few of them have now said they will not be going. Jamie Dimon has pulled out along with the boss of Uber and the editor of the Economist, Zanny Minton-Beddoes, while US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin is under pressure not to go. Watch this space for more. The rise in oil prices is gathering pace too. Brent futures are up 1.3% to $81.54 a barrel. The sellers are gaining the upper hand in stock markets around Asia Pacific today. Hong Kong and China open later this morning. But this is how it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looking so far: The Nikkei is now down 1.56%, or 353 points at 22,341 The Kospi is off 12 points, or 0.55% at 2,150 The ASX200 is down 62 points at 5,833, a fall of 1.07% so far Bill Ford, the chief executive of Ford, has become the latest high-profile business leader to pull out of the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh later this month, Reuters reports. He joins JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon in announcing his withdrawal on Sunday. Neither cited a reason but it is suspected that the diplomatic standoff over the Khashoggi affair would be high on the list. Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, Viacom boss Bob Bakish and billionaire Steve Case, one of the founders of AOL, have also said they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be going to the event dubbed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Davos in the desert\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Reuters said. Bloomberg and CNN have also pulled out of covering the event. Read the full story on the growing row by our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour: Trading is under way in Japan and Korea. The Nikkei is off 1% and the Kospi is down 0.5% in Seoul. That seems par for the course today given the poor start in Sydney, where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now off 0.89% for the day. The question is whether the markets can bounce back or they are dragged lower by a compound of problems ... The price of Brent crude has risen this morning to $80.5 a barrel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surely connected to the Saudi issue, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth looking again at what the kingdom has said about possibly retaliating to external pressure over the Khashoggi affair. A statement from Riyadh on Sunday said: The kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats and attempts to undermine it, whether through economic sanctions, political pressure or repeating false accusations. The kingdom also affirms that if it is [targeted by] any action, it will respond with greater action. Crucially, the statement also pointed out that the oil-rich kingdom \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plays an effective and vital role in the world economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That has to be an implicit threat to cut oil production and push up the price of a barrel, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it? The standoff between Saudi Arabia and just about everyone else in the world over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi looks like intensifying. The Saudis have promised pushback if Donald Trump carries out his threat of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153severe Punishment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if the kingdom is found to have disposed of Khashoggi, as alleged by Turkey. Now, Reuters report that JP Morgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon has cancelled plans to attend a Saudi Arabian investor conference later this month. The bank did not give any more details for Dimon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision not to attend the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, and did not comment on whether concerns about the disappearance of Khashoggi were a factor. In currencies, the US dollar has gained a bit today. That means the Aussie dollar is down slightly at US71.07 while the yen has slipped to 112.2. The pound is at $1.31. The benchmark ASX200 has slipped around 1% in the first few minutes. The banks, as usual of late, have been sold with the financial sector down 1.47%. Same for resources which are down more than 1% but utilities are off 2%. More commentary on the Australian market from Michael McCarthy at CMC Markets. His thrust is that this week sees a lot of data from China including lending, retail sales and GDP which should give us a picture of where the superpower is heading, ie is it in good enough shape to survive a trade-war inspired downturn? There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also inflation and trade data from Japan, retail sales in the UK and in the US, retail sales, housing numbers and Fed minutes. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what Michael says: Australian investors face a challenge at this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening. Despite positive moves for US shares and buoyant industrial commodities SPI futures were belted at the New York close, suffering a 51 point loss for the session. The first hour of trading may indicate whether this was an error or the beginning of further underperformance for Australian shares. Greg McKenna, the independent market strategist, says the markets narrative has been hijacked by the Saudi pushback and Brexit but reckons it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a close call on what direction things will take. This is what he says in his morning note: Much water to flow here especially for the Pound and oil prices. Looking back to Friday though and while stocks in the US rallied into the close it was a messy day and hardly a convincing bounce. Is it the bottom? Many think so and the medium-term charts recovered to hold channel bottoms. But we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian business live blog. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re firing up a bit earlier than usual today because it looks like being an interesting session in Asia Pacific markets. In Australia, the ASX200 has dropped 51 points after opening a few minutes, or just under 1%. The Nikkei in Japan in expected to fall 0.83% and the Hang Seng will also dip slightly. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CSI300 is set for a bounce though. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only part of the picture today though because Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to disrupt the global economy will likely send the oil price higher today. Stocks on the Saudi market fell on Sunday. Meanwhile, the Brexit talks in the UK remain very tense with questions about whether Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government can seal a deal on its backstop solution for the Irish border. Senior members of her Tory party are threatening to rebel over the matter and that has seen the pound drop substantially. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s buying $1.309 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down more than 1% on Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. A forecast showing that the UK economy is going to have its worst year since the financial crisis hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped.",

This could happen as early as the 9<sup>th</sup> of November when the ONS will report its first GDP estimate for 2018 Q3.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5bc5aec6e4b0d2200667b0ef\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-10-16T09:34:47.845Z\">10.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Government: Wages are on the up</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Alok Sharma, </strong>minister of state for employment, has welcomed the jump in pay growth, saying:<strong> </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am particularly encouraged that wages continue to be on the up, outpacing inflation for the seventh month in a row and regular pay is up 3.1% on the year.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153And with unemployment at its lowest since the 1970s, since 2010 there are more people with the security of a job, more people with a regular salary, and more people able to support their families - and that is thanks to action this Government has taken to build an economy that works for everyone.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AlokSharma_RDG/status/1052118383163035648\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Employment?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Employment</a> figures just out from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ONS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ONS</a> - unemployment continues to be at a 43 year low, youth unemployment at a record low and halved since 2010 and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/wages?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#wages</a> continue to outpace inflation for 7th month in a row. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Conservatives?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Conservatives</a> policies working and supporting people into work</p>&mdash; Alok Sharma (@AlokSharma_RDG) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlokSharma_RDG/status/1052118383163035648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 16, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-10-16T10:03:40.092Z\">at 11.03am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5bc5ae56e4b0d2200667b0ed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-10-16T09:26:10.269Z\">10.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Mike Jakeman, senior economist at PwC, agrees that workers have the upper hand in pay negotiations:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Employers are having to offer better financial packages to workers to retain their staff.

                "bodyText":"Boom! Wall Street has surged more than 2%, racking up its biggest one-day gains since March. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 547 points to end the day at 25,798, a gain of 2.17%. The S&amp;P 500 gained 2.16%, while a solid tech stock rally swept the Nasdaq 2.9% higher. As covered earlier, optimism in New York was boosted by strong results by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, and Johnson &amp; Johnson. New of a record number of vacancies across US firms, and a jump in industrial production, also calmed some of the anxiety that has been building in the markets. And no sooner had Wall Street closed, than Netflix was reporting results -- and impressing traders. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today... Wall Street may also be taking heart from the latest US employment data. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s JOLTS report shows that the number of job openings in the U.S. reached another all-time high of 7.1 million in August. The Labor Department also reported that American workers voluntarily quit their jobs at a rate of 2.4% in August, matching July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 17-year high. No lack of optimism on Wall Street right now. The Dow is up 471 points, which would be its best day since late March if we blew the final whistle now. Amid the optimism today, a note of caution rings out. Investors are their least optimistic about global economic prospects since the financial crisis broke out. Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest global fund manager survey found that 38% of investors think that global economic growth will decelerate in the next 12 months, the highest percentage since November 2008. That may explain why last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off caught hold (it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain why stocks are back up today, though!) European stock markets also ended the day strongly, with the main indices all sharply higher. Italy led the way, despite hints that Brussels will reject its 2019 budget, teeing up a deeper row with the new government in Rome. Wall Street is rallying because investors are focusing on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upbeat earnings\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Marketwatch. We covered earlier that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had outperformed expectations. That has boosted confidence in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate sector Johnson &amp; Johnson, the pharmaceuticals group, also did well in the last quarter, partly thank to strong sales of cancer drugs and a pick-up at its baby care business. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: Earnings per share: $2.05, adjusted, vs. $2.03 expected Revenue: $20.3 billion vs. $20.05 billion expected This all boost confidence in corporate earnings, and suggests that economic demand is still robust. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally is showing some stamina. The Dow is now up by 408 points, or 1.6%, at 25,661 points, and on track for its best day in several months. Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx sums up the day\u001d: With confidence lifted by a pair of strong earnings updates from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the Dow Jones showed signs of getting its mojo back after the bell. The US index surged 280 points as the session got underway, rocketing above 25500 having neared 25100 on Monday. These gains helped feed into the European markets, with the DAX and CAC both shooting up 1%. This despite the unresolved budget issues between Italy and the EU. Not content with sparring with Theresa May and her Brexit negotiators, Jean-Claude Juncker has suggested that the Italian government have a slim chance of getting their controversial budget approved, with the President of the European Commission claiming the EU would \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrevolt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 it Italy got its own way. While its peers raced off into the distance, the FTSE was left panting behind, only able to add 20 or so points as the day went on. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the pound, ignoring the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, rose around half a percent against both the dollar and the euro, boosted by a better than forecast, 9 year high wage growth reading. There are plenty more chances for the FTSE to get its revenge, however, not only with Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation and Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales data, but the impending, hugely important mid-week summit between EU leaders. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index has closed 30 points higher at 7059, as today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wave of optimism sends shares up. However, the rally was held back by currency effects - the strengthening pound pulls down the value of multinational companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 earnings. US stocks are pushing higher too! The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow have both gained 1.5%, as Wall Street tries to recover some of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4% slide. European stocks are romping higher in late trading, sending the Stoxx 600 index of the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest companies up 1.5%. Goldman and Morgan Stanley are giving the markets a lift, agrees Michael Hewson of CMC Markets. He reckons recent US interest rate hikes are helping the banks, but also making life tougher for retailers: Morgan Stanley posted Q3 profits of $1.17c a share, well above estimates of $1.03c, while Goldman Sachs also blew past expectations coming in at $6.28c a share, $0.90c above consensus. There was some weak spots on the fixed income side, however by and large the numbers painted a fairly positive outlook. These sorts of numbers should be expected given the higher interest rate environment and higher fees from M&amp;A, however we also need to see similar sorts of activity in areas that reflect consumer discretionary spending, which could be impacted by higher rates. On the retail front things are a little more concerning, given this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news from Sears, while this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement from Wal-Mart could also be a cause for concern. The company downgraded its earnings outlook for 2019 citing the impact of higher costs in absorbing its acquisition of India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Flipkart for $16bn. It also warned that sales growth in its e-commerce division would be 5% lower in 2019 than this year, with growth of 35% expected, below this years expected 40% rise. The rally is back on! Shares have opened higher on Wall Street, as investors try to put last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turmoil behind them. The Dow has jumped by 233 points, or 0.9%, with the Nasdaq streaking 1.2% higher. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent results from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs seem to be shoring up confidence in New York. European markets are pushing higher too, as traders regain their risk appetite (for the moment, anyway...) Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not get carried away, though.... oh too late! In another boost to confidence, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories have expanded their output for the fourth month in a row. US industrial production rose by 0.3% in September, boosted by gains in manufacturing and mining, beating forecasts of 0.2% growth. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down on August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.4%. The Federal Reserve also said manufacturing output increased 0.2% in September after rising 0.3% in August. Britain is getting a new \u00c2\u00a350 note, but the big question is who should be on it? Speculation is bubbling away today about which famous Brit should appear on the back of the note, which will be made out of flexible plastic polymer [the Queen has a monopoly on the front]. Ladbrokes have issued odds, putting former Labour PM Clement Attlee and Crimean war heroine Mary Seacole as joint favourites: Noor Inayat Khan is another strong candidate. She served in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Special Operations Executive as a wireless operator in occupied France in the second world war, before being captured, shackled for months, and later killed at Dachau concentration camp. As the Mirror reported back in August: She had become the first female radio operator to infiltrate occupied Paris, posthumously awarded the Croix de Guerre and the George Cross. But Noor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story has been largely overlooked, becoming a footnote in history. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t until 2012 that a memorial bust of Noor went up in London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gordon Square \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not only the first statue to an Indian woman in Britain, but the first to any Muslim. She was one of only three women in Winston Churchill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secret army, the Special Operations Executive (SOE), to be awarded the George Cross, and the other two \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Violette Szabo and Odette Hallowes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have had films made about their lives. A petition has been set up to promote Inayat Khan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s backing too: Writer Emily Poole has some other good suggestions for the Bank of England to consider: Those results from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are giving the markets a much-needed boost. Wall Street is now expected to open higher, with the Dow Jones industrial average called 150 points or 0.6% higher. Europe is already catching a bid, with almost all the main indices pushing higher. The only laggard is Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100, which is being pulled down by the stronger pound. Also just in: one of Goldman Sachs key trading divisions has just suffered a chunky drop in takings. Net revenues at Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) operation shrank by 10% year-on-year to $1.31bn in the last quarter, its latest financial results show. Goldman pins the blame on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an environment characterised by low client activity amid low levels of volatility.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Investment banking did better, with net revenues rising by 10% year-on-year to $1.98bn. So overall, profits beat forecasts. David Solomon, Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new CEO (and a career investment banker) says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We delivered solid results in the third quarter driven by contributions from across our diversified client franchise. Year-to-date earnings per share is the highest in our history and year-to-date return on equity is the highest in nine years, notwithstanding our continued investment in growth opportunities. We remain well positioned to continue delivering for our clients and shareholders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some early reaction: Just in: Profits at Wall Street bank Morgan Stanley have jumped by 19%. MS posted earnings of $2.11bn in the last quarter, or $1.17 per share. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 93 cents per share last year, and up from forecasts of $1.01 per share. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equity trading desk, bond traders, and investment banking division all posted higher-than-expected earnings, despite market jitteriness. Chief executive James Gorman says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We produced strong results across the franchise. Despite the seasonal summer slowdown in the third quarter, we reported solid revenue and earnings growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some early reaction: Sterling has jumped by half a cent this morning, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpectedly strong wage growth. This has pushed the pound up to $1.321, recovering last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit-induced losses. Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Asset Management, explains why: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wages in the UK are growing at a rate not seen since January 2009. Average earnings, excluding bonuses, rose 3.1% in the three months to August. Unsurprisingly unemployment stayed at its low of 4%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interesting that productivity, however, remains less robust and any pick up could lead to some concerns about inflation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is all a continuation of the current trend, but it does reinforce the fact that there are bright spots in the UK economy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely that interest rate expectations will change as a result of the data, particularly with the overhang of Brexit. Markets are unlikely to be significantly impacted by this, given broader concerns, but sterling will gain some support.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Faster earnings growth might encourage the Bank of England to raise interest rates sooner, to prevent inflation being pushed up. Higher interest rates make it more profitable to hold sterling, thus the pound goes up. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see the BoE tightening policy quickly, at least until Brexit is resolved: While the jump in nominal pay growth to 3.1% is encouraging, what really matters is real pay -- how much workers take home after adjusting for inflation. And on that measure, earnings are rising at the fastest since 2016. Good news, but less dramatic than the headline number. Also, one month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay rise doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make up for 10 years of weak earnings growth. British workers are still earning less than before the 2008 financial crisis, once you adjust for inflation. The Resolution Foundation have the details: Pawel Adrjan, chief economist at jobs site Indeed.com, reports that the number of job vacancies is still rising. That suggests firms need to keep paying workers more, to attract them. The pick-up in wage growth to 3.1% per annum with unemployment holding at 4% are extremely good news, say Costas Milas and Mike Ellington of the University of Liverpool. They believe it shows Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is growing faster than official data suggest: Notice that the pickup in wage growth has not put upward pressure on the unemployment rate. This is consistent with our view that the UK economy can afford paying higher wages because it is growing better than currently thought. Indeed, our latest LSE blog suggests that since the EU Referendum vote the UK economy has over-performed by 0.5% per annum based on monthly GDP evidence compared to what the traditional quarterly GDP data suggests. Consequently, we are taking the view that the ONS will revise upwards its quarterly GDP growth sooner than later. This could happen as early as the 9th of November when the ONS will report its first GDP estimate for 2018 Q3. Alok Sharma, minister of state for employment, has welcomed the jump in pay growth, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am particularly encouraged that wages continue to be on the up, outpacing inflation for the seventh month in a row and regular pay is up 3.1% on the year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And with unemployment at its lowest since the 1970s, since 2010 there are more people with the security of a job, more people with a regular salary, and more people able to support their families - and that is thanks to action this Government has taken to build an economy that works for everyone.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mike Jakeman, senior economist at PwC, agrees that workers have the upper hand in pay negotiations: Employers are having to offer better financial packages to workers to retain their staff. Employees remain in short supply: unemployment remained at the very low level of 4%, as low as it has been since the mid-1970s. It is still a little too soon to be sure that worker scarcity will continue to drive wage growth upwards over a longer period, but initial signs are encouraging. The British Chambers of Commerce has struck a cautious note, warning that pay rises depend on rising productivity: Dr. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor for EY ITEM Club, believes UK earnings are back on an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upward track\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerned that the number of people in work has dipped -- perhaps a sign that Brexit is hitting the jobs market. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take: The labour market showed signs of losing momentum as employment fell 5,000 in the three months to August. Nevertheless, unemployment dropped by 47,000 as the inactivity rate rose. This kept the unemployment rate down at a 43-year low of 4.0%. Employment fell marginally despite the economy picking up over the summer. GDP was up 0.7% on a three-month/three-month basis in August The loss of momentum in the labour market may well be at least partly caused by employers finding it harder to find suitable candidates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in some cases significantly influenced by fewer workers coming from the EU. There is certainly evidence of this in a number of surveys (including from the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regional agents and the purchasing managers). Indeed, it is notable that despite reduced employment growth, the number of vacancies was an elevated 832,000 in the three months to August Pay growth is looking perkier, buoying hopes that jobs market tightness may finally be feeding through to a pick-up in pay Regular earnings growth climbed to 3.1% in the three months to August, the best for nearly a decade. It held up relatively well at 3.1% in August after spiking to 3.2% in July. Growth in private sector regular pay was stable at 3.3% in August itself. Total earnings growth rose to 2.7% in the 3 months to August Geraint Johnes, professor of economics at Lancaster University Management School, has crunched through today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data. He encouraged that real pay (nominal pay minus inflation) is growing, and has also spotted that more people are getting full-time jobs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest labour market statistics provide mixed news. Employment has fallen slightly in the latest 3 month period, but unemployment has also fallen \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by some 47000 and the unemployment rate now stands at 4.0%. The numbers of economically inactive people rose by some 103000. Large falls in employment are recorded amongst part-time employees (55000) and full-time self-employed workers (35000). At the same time, the number of full-time employees rose by some 87000. Taken together, these statistics reflect the continuing restoration of normality to the labour market, with more workers now employed in secure full-time jobs, and fewer in less secure part-time jobs and self-employment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Total pay (on the preferred 3 month measure) rose by some 2.7% in August, while regular pay (again on the preferred 3 month measure) rose by 3.1%. This is the first increase of more than 3% in this indicator in ten years. With CPI inflation [including housing costs] at 2.4% in August, these data indicate some long overdue growth in real pay.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Although wages are up, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment rate has dropped a little. That may show that the jobs boom is fading, after a strong run. In June-August, there were 32.39 million people in work. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 289,000 more than a year ago, but around 5,000 fewer than in March to May 2018. The number of people classed as unemployment dropped again, though. The Office for National Statistics explains: The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 years who were in work) was 75.5%, lower than for March to May 2018 (75.7%) but higher than for a year earlier (75.1%). There were 1.36 million unemployed people (people not in work but seeking and available to work), 47,000 fewer than for March to May 2018 and 79,000 fewer than for a year earlier. It appears that British workers are finally benefitting from the scarcity of labour and demanding more for their services. Philip Smeaton, chief investment officer at wealth management firm Sanlam UK, explains: Wages keep on going from strength to strength, as competition for workers is finally feeding through to pay. The Bank of England will be keeping a watchful eye on any upwards pressure this puts on inflation, but it should also help support the consumer and their ability to handle higher interest rates should bank need to increase interest rates. However, until the outcome of Brexit becomes clearer, rates are likely to be placed on hold.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The bad news is that CPI inflation was 2.7% in August, taking a chunk out of workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pay packets. That was up from 2.5% in July (the mid-point for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs data), suggesting price pressure are building. But still, at least real wages are growing. BREAKING: Britain is finally getting a pay rise. Basic pay jumped by 3.1% per year in the three months to August, the fastest rate since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 2.9% a month ago. Total pay (including bonuses) rose by 2.7% during the quarter, up from 2.6%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fastest growth since February. In another boost, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate has stuck at 4.0%, the joint lowest since December 1974 to February 1975, according to the Office for National Statistics. More to follow! Merlin Entertainment, the firm behind Legoland and Alton knows all about roller coasters. Unfortunately, its investors are getting a stomach-churning ride this morning. Shares in the company have slid by 8%, after its latest financial results failed to impress the City. On the upside, Merlin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like-for-like revenue have grown by 1.4% this year, and it opened two new parks -- Peppa Pig World of Play in Shanghai, and The Bear Grylls Adventure in Birmingham. But shareholders aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pleased to hear that like-for-like growth at Legoland was flat. Merlin also slipped in a warning that cost pressures are building, partly due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tighter labour markets in a number of regions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. In other words, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s having to pay its staff more to recruit and retain them. Good news for the workers! Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says: The market may be concerned by the caveat that the cost environment remains challenging amid tighter global labour markets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A growing number of governments with more restrictive policies on immigration and, in the UK, the Brexit process are limiting freedom of movement and this issue could continue to affect large-scale employers of lower wage workers such as Merlin.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Global investors are a little less anxious than yesterday, reports Kit Juckes of Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale. Risk sentiment is slightly stronger this morning, Asian equities mixed rather than a sea of red, bond yields generally a bit higher. The Italian budget has been sent to Brussels for consideration, which is positive, while Mi Barnier has headed to Brussels to report on the lack of Brexit progress, which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t positive but isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t new news. The Saudi stock market is down 2% this morning, as Riyadh comes under growing pressure over the disappearance and apparent murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. According to CNN, Saudi Arabia is preparing to say that Khashoggi was killed during \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an interrogation that went wrong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, after he entered the Saudi consulate in Ankara two weeks ago. Donald Trump has dispatched U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to meet with the Saudi royal family to discuss the situation. Analysts suggest that the international outcry over Khashoggi, a Washington Post journalist, could hit international investment into the country, especially as several top bosses are now shunning its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDavos in the desert\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 investment conference. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says trading is confused and cautious this week. Asian equity markets fell on Monday and continued to be dragged lower on Tuesday, despite at a slower pace. European stocks recovered slightly but appetite to risk remained limited as a cautious mood continued to dominate U.S. markets flipping between gains and losses throughout most of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session to end the day in red as Technology selloffs dominated the overnight trading session. There still seems to be lot of uncertainty in global financial markets after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steep selling. The S&amp;P 500 closed below its 200-days moving average on Monday, a signal that won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be liked by trend-following investors. A failure to return above this average today may encourage further bears to join the crowd. European stock markets have opened cautiously, as City traders await today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK jobs data. 2018 is turning into a year to forget for Chinese investors: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we discover whether Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market is holding up, in the face of Brexit deadlock and global trade war. New unemployment figures are expected to show that the jobless rate remained at just 4%, the lowest in around 43 years. But crucially, economist want to see wages outpacing inflation again. Last month, basic pay growth jumped to 2.9% per year - the fastest in over three years, while total pay growth was 2.6% higher. Similar figures are expected today (for the three months to August). Strong pay growth would suggest that workers were finally getting the upper hand over bosses, and taking advantage of the tight labour market. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says the unemployment report will give the City a welcome distraction from the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiations with the EU (and itself). Brexit developments are expected to remain the key driver of the pound; however, for a few fleeting minutes traders will turn their attention to UK jobs data. Unemployment is forecast to remain constant in August at 4%. Weekly earnings are expected to remain steady at 2.9% in the 3 months to August. It will take a significant beat to the upside to inject some optimism into the pound. On the other hand, any weakness in the figures could drag on the pound given the downside risks of Brexit already making the pound sensitive. Also coming up today The financial markets remain edgy following last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Over in Asia, Chinas Shanghai composite index has dropped by almost 1%, but Australia has gained 0.5% while Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei is up 1.2%. Traders are still anxious that we could see further losses, after Wall Street endured its biggest fall since March last week. Fears over US interest rate moves, trade, the oil price and the health of the global economy all abound. Stephen Innes of trading firm OANDA explains: Regional markets are trading more positively this morning as overall regional volatilities are falling. A weaker US dollar profile is helping to cool depreciation pressure on the Yuan as overextended shorts are getting pared. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t confuse this recovery with anything other than consolidation amidst a protracted downtrend in Asia equities. Traders are looking to sell upticks given that intraday volatility can ignite on the drop of a dime. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government has submitted its 2019 budget plans to the European Union, teeing up a likely clash over its spending plans. The budget includes running a deficit of 2.4% of GDP - higher than the EU target - plus lowering the retirement age and giving more help to poorer families. Plus, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will be reporting financial results. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK unemployment data 10am BST: ZEW survey of German business confidence 2.15pm BST: US industrial production figures",

                "bodyText":"And finally, the New York stock exchange had finished in the red. The Dow shed 90 points, or 0.36%, taking a bite out of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 547-point rally. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq were only slightly lower, though. Sentiment was slightly dampened by confirmation that the Fed expects to press on with interest rate hikes, even if it slows the economy. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Goodnight. GW President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s repeated complaints about rising interest rates appear to be having no impact on policy so far, says CNN. Andreas Johnson, US Economist at Nordic bank SEB, expects the Fed to raise rates three more times in the next eight months, before slowing down: The minutes from the September meeting state that almost all participants saw little change in their assessment of the outlook. The minutes indicate that the Fed is prepared to press on with rate hikes for now and most participants seem to agree that the fed funds rate should be pushed above the neutral level. However, there is disagreement about the level to which the policy rate should be hiked. We are sticking to our forecast of another hike in December followed by two additional hikes in 2019 (March and June) and one hike in 2020. Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E*Trade, agrees that the Fed is resisting Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pressure. He says (via Sky News): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For now, the Fed has made it clear that they are focused on their agenda despite rising presidential pressure on their rate decisions,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dilemma -- US inflation hit a six-year high this summer, bolstering the case for rate hikes. But it has been dipping since.... Marc-Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Fongern of MAF Global Forex says the Federal Reserve remains focused on its mandate: CNBC also reckon the president won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be happy that the Fed is sticking to its guns on future interest rate hikes: Federal Reserve officials remain convinced that continuing to gradually increase interest rates is the best formula to preserve a steady economy, according to minutes released Wednesday of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent policy meeting. That may not please President Donald Trump, who has been vocal in his criticism of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions. A summary of the Sept. 25-26 Federal Open Market Committee session reflected both confidence in the rate of economic growth and some hesitancy over the impact that tariffs might have on the future path. Some cartoon-based reaction: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no response to the Fed minutes from the White House yet. But yesterday, Donald Trump said the Fed was his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153biggest threat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, because it was raising rates too fast. So we can probably guess his reaction.... Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics has read the minutes, and says: Overall, nothing here to change our view that the Fed will persist with its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gradual approach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of hiking by 25bp each quarter. That is until mid-2019, when we expect a drop in GDP growth to below-potential to force the Fed to the sidelines. You can read the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s September meeting online here. They show that the Fed expects to press on with interest rate rises in the coming months, despite Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vocal concerns that it is tightening too fast: This is the key section (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve bolded up the main points): With regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting, participants generally anticipated that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would most likely be consistent with a sustained economic expansion, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near 2 percent over the medium term. This gradual approach would balance the risk of tightening monetary policy too quickly, which could lead to an abrupt slowing in the economy and inflation moving below the Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s objective, against the risk of moving too slowly, which could engender inflation persistently above the objective and possibly contribute to a buildup of financial imbalances. Participants offered their views about how much additional policy firming would likely be required for the Committee to sustainably achieve its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. A few participants expected that policy would need to become modestly restrictive for a time and a number judged that it would be necessary to temporarily raise the federal funds rate above their assessments of its longer-run level in order to reduce the risk of a sustained overshooting of the Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2 percent inflation objective or the risk posed by significant financial imbalances. A couple of participants indicated that they would not favor adopting a restrictive policy stance in the absence of clear signs of an overheating economy and rising inflation. Shares in New York have dipped since the Federal Reserve minutes hit the wires. Traders have noted that the Fed is planning to press on with interest rate hikes, which could weaken growth and push up unemployment. The Dow is now down 100 points at 25,697, a drop of 0.4%. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no explicit mention of Donald Trump or the White House in the minutes of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last meeting. But the US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts, and his deepening trade spat with China, are clearly a concern. The minutes warn that a trade war could hurt growth: Some participants commented that trade policy developments remained a source of uncertainty for the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. The Fed is also concerned about tensions in the emerging markets, due to the strong dollar: The divergence between domestic and foreign economic growth prospects and monetary policies was cited as presenting a downside risk because of the potential for further strengthening of the U.S. dollar; some participants noted that financial stresses in a few EMEs could pose additional risks if they were to spread more broadly through the global economy and financial markets. They also fear that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts could make the economy run to hot: With regard to upside risks, participants variously noted that high consumer confidence, accommodative financial conditions, or greater-than- expected effects of fiscal stimulus could lead to stronger-than-expected economic outcomes. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Financial Times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 take on the Fed minutes that were just released: Federal Reserve policymakers said they will forge ahead with further rises in interest rates, with some talking of pushing borrowing costs into restrictive territory, as the central bank seeks to prevent inflation from overshooting its target. Despite outspoken criticism of rate rises from President Donald Trump, a number of Fed policymakers said in their September meeting that they thought it may become necessary to temporarily boost rates above levels they expect in the longer run. This would prevent inflation from getting too hot and ward off risks of financial excesses, the central bankers said. Newsflash: The Federal Reserve has discussed raising American borrowing costs to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrestrictive levels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The minutes of last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed meeting show that officials discussed how much higher interest rates could go. Several members of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate-setting Open Market Committee indicated that rates could rise higher, to a point above the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcneutral\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 level (where they would neither stimulate or restrict economic growth). The minutes say: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A few participants expected that policy would need to become modestly restrictive for a time and a number judged that it would be necessary to temporarily raise the federal funds rate above their assessments of its longer-run level.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that the Fed is prepared to choke off growth, in order to keep inflation in check and avoid financial risks growing to dangerous levels. But it may also fuel criticism that the Fed is being too aggressive - as Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed. The minutes also show that Fed officials expect rates to continue rising gradually, from their current level of 2-2.25%. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, points out that tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed minutes were written before the markets wobbled last week. As such, they may be less useful than investors would like: The dollar was trading higher ahead as the release of the FOMC minutes moved into the spotlight. Given all that has happened since the meeting, there is a high chance that the minutes are in fact out of date. That said, traders will still scrutinize them closely for any hints as to when the next rate rise will be (December) and what the Fed has in store for 2019. Wall Street is now clawing back some of those early losses. The Dow is still down, but only 28 points or 0.1%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are flat. Traders are waiting for the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s September meeting (where it raised interest rates) to be released in an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. They may shed new light on the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for further rate hikes, and whether policymakers are worried about criticism from the White House. Steve Webb of Royal London Asset Management has called on the government to clarify how the UK pension \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctriple lock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 actually works. As I covered earlier, there was confusion over which month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings figures would be used to set pension increases in 2019. At one stage yesterday, journalists and Royal London itself were told that August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures would be used, before a u-turn this morning (once it was clear that wages, not inflation, would be the key). Webb argues that ministers are wrong to plump for July (when wages rose by 2.6%), rather than August (when they gained 2.7%), even though July has been used in the past. Webb, who was once pensions minister, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is annoying that such uncertainty exists and we need DWP to give clarity on what figures it uses to calculate the triple lock. We calculate that using July figures instead of August leaves pensioners \u00c2\u00a3100m worse off. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make sense that out of date data should be used.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something new to worry about - the Bank of England fears that too much money is being lent to indebted companies, often at high interest rates (reflecting its riskiness): European stocks markets have closed in the red, with the French CAC and German DAX both down around 0.5%. Auto makers had a bad day, after figures showed a 24% tumble in EU car sales last month (as manufacturers struggled to meet new emissions rules). In London the FTSE 100 had a better day, down just 4 points. Shares in US housebuilders are having a bad day, after disappointing construction data. The number of new housing projects dropped by 5.3% in September. Hurricane disruption is partly to blame, but this is a bigger fall than expected. Construction activity in the South fell by the most in nearly three years, probably due to Hurricane Florence. Back on Wall Street, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off is gathering more pace. The Dow is now down 220 points or 0.8% at 25,577, handing back a chunk of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big rally. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the latest UK inflation figures: UK inflation dropped further than expected last month as the falling price of meat and chocolate helped reduce some of the pressure on cash-strapped British consumers. The Office for National Statistics said the consumer price index (CPI) fell to 2.4% in September from 2.7% the previous month, confounding City analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts for a more modest reduction to 2.6%. Combined with the pay growth figures for British workers, which showed average weekly earnings rising at the fastest rate in almost a decade, the latest snapshot for UK inflation suggests pressure on households is beginning to fade two years on from the EU referendum. The latest figures are also likely to dissuade the Bank of England from raising interest rates before Britain formally leaves the EU in five months time as it suggests inflation is gradually returning to the 2% target set for the central bank without the need for higher borrowing costs. The ONS said the largest downward contribution to inflation, which measures the rising cost of living, was thanks to food and non-alcoholic drink prices dropping by 0.1% between August and September. Meat and chocolate prices provided most of the downward contribution. Ferry prices also fell from a surprisingly high summer peak, while the cost of going to the theatre dropped compared to an increase a year ago. More here: Netflix is defying the downward gravitational pull of Wall Street. Shares in the streaming service have jumped by 6.5% since the opening bell, after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong results showing a jump in new subscribers and profits in the last quarter (its Q3). Chris Ford, manager of the Smith &amp; Williamson Artificial Intelligence Fund, says Netflix has shaken off the memory of disappointing results three month ago (for Q2). Ford writes that Netflix shares now look good value: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite posting a weaker-than-expected set of figures in Q2, we believe the numbers for this quarter show Netflix has the guile and ingenuity that one would expect from a company of its stature. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Q2\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers were below Street estimates, but Netflix took a conscious and sensible decision to take a step back from releasing new content and the latest seasons of its most popular shows as it correctly predicted that the FIFA World Cup would impact sales and viewership. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In Q3 we have seen Netflix return to doing what it does best, retaining its current subscribers through its high-quality series, and enticing new ones by using its proprietary algorithms to target specific content to specific users in specific regions. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results are important as they are indicative of how Netflix is positioning itself for future growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We continue to believe that Netflix remains an attractive proposition globally, especially in light of the recent market volatility which saw its share price fall to a multi-month low.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Consumer goods, technology, mining and industrial companies are all dropping in New York. IBM is the biggest faller on the Dow (now down 6.6%), followed by Home Depot (-2.5%). Shares in New York are dipping at the start of trading. The main indices have opened lower, with the Dow falling around 100 point at the open. IBM is having a bad start, tumbling 6.5% after disappointing Wall Street with a bigger-than-expected drop in profits last night. Property partner at Pinsent Masons, Kevin Boa, says a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcperfect storm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of problems combined to drive UK house price inflation down. They includes: Interest rates increases, government policy changes that have shrunk the buy to let market, Brexit upheaval and the reduction in EU and overseas buyers, particularly in London all contribute to this decline. Despite this, there remains a huge undersupply of housing which will only become more acute over time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in the markets, Wall Street is expected to open cautiously in just over an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. The Dow is being called down 100 or so points, having surged by almost 550 yesterday, in the biggest one-day rally in seven months. Policymakers at the Bank of England will be relieved to see UK inflation dropping last month. Weakening price pressures take pressure off the BoE to consider raising interest rates any time soon. So with Brexit approaching a crescendo, the Bank can sit tight, even though wages are rising. Joel Dungate, Investment Analyst at Redmayne Bentley, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The figure came a day after encouraging wage growth figures, which showed pay rose by 3.1% in the three months to August, the fastest pace in nearly a decade. This is positive news for consumers, as it should, in theory, increase their spending power. This, in turn, is good news for the UK economy which relies heavily on consumer spending. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The inflation figure will also come as a relief to the Bank of England, which will be under less pressure to raise rates in the near future. It now appears increasingly unlikely that the central bank will raise rates again before the terms of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit deal with the EU are clarified. On the other hand, if the trend of real wage growth continues, then we might expect rising inflation in the longer term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Heads-up: Gatehouse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s savings products are actually more generous than I wrote earlier (I accidentally used an old chart). Their one-year fixed savings account has an expected profit of 1.9%, while the five-year fixed account is 2.68%. The TUC are urging the government to end the freeze on working-age benefits, and raise them in line with inflation again. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although prices are rising, support for working families is still frozen. Too many households can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make ends meet without being forced into the red. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If Theresa May is serious about her claim that austerity is over, then the government must reverse unfair cuts to working age benefits.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Alex Collinson, the TUC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy and campaigns support officer, shows how the cap has pushed down the value of benefits. That freeze affecting a range of benefits including tax credits, child benefit, jobseeker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allowance. The IFS has calculated that freezing these benefits in cash terms has saved the government billions, and cost many poor households hundreds of pounds per year. In other news, UK house prices growth has fallen to its lowest level in five years - but still faster than inflation. The Office for National Statistics reports that average house price growth dropped to 3.2% per year in August, down from 3.4% in July. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the slowest increase since August 2013. The ONS blamed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sustained slowdown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the south and east of England, with prices dropping by 0.2% per year in London. The average UK house now costs \u00c2\u00a3233,000, although London prices are still much pricier, at an average of \u00c2\u00a3486,000. The Triple Lock confusion has been resolved! The Department for Work and Pensions have told us that the government will used July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings figures when setting pension increases. That means the state pension should rise by 2.6% next year (as we originally thought). Although wages are rising faster than the cost of living, the same isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t true of saving rates. Even the best one-year fixed term bank accounts listed on Money Supermarket are only offering around 2% per year, below September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate. Charles Haresnape, CEO at Gatehouse Bank - the Shariah-compliant challenger bank \u00e2\u20ac\u201c says savers face a struggle: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Savers will be relieved that inflation has finally fallen after three successive rises. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, despite this good news, the truth is that in the current low interest rate environment savings struggle to keep pace with the rising cost of living. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Savers need to make their money work as hard as possible. The savviest will be looking to the rates offered by smaller banks - including those with ethical philosophies - which typically pay higher rates, to try and combat the very worst effects of inflation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gatehouse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own 1 Year Fixed Term Deposit account offers a profit of 1.9% per year, rising to 2.68% per year on a five-year fixed (updated). Important point: Confusion is swirling about which earnings figure the government will use to set the Triple Lock for state pensions next year. In the past, it has used annual total wage growth for the quarter to July, which was 2.6%. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some speculation that it might actually use August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data (published yesterday), which showed total wages up by 2.7%. Apparently the Department of Work and Pensions told Royal London Asset Management yesterday that they would use the August number, which would be a departure from previous policy [according to this House of Commons briefing paper]. That 0.1 percentage point only actually means 20p per week to pensioners, we reckon. But in total, that adds up to \u00c2\u00a3100m per year, according to RL\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Steve Webb (a former pensions minister). We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve asked the DWP for clarification on this point. Officials are huddled in a meeting as I type..... Tom Selby, senior analyst at AJ Bell, says pensioners should welcome the Triple Lock (despite the confusion over exactly which earnings figure will be used): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures will provide a welcome income boost to millions of people currently in receipt of the state pension. Those who get the flat-rate amount will see their annual payment increase by over \u00c2\u00a3220 in April next year, a smaller increase compared to last year but still not to be sniffed at. With inflation returning to the economy, the value of protection against rising prices is not to be underestimated. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the context of the triple-lock, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting the guarantee will cost the Government nothing compared to the earnings and inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdouble-lock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 some have proposed. It is only in a low inflation, low earnings environment that the promise begins to bite. British retailers are gritting their teeth at the prospect of even higher business rates. They are due to rise next year in line with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation reading, meaning an extra \u00c2\u00a3180m total bill according to the British Retail Consortium. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, argues the current system is simply unfair. She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These figures confirm that the retail industry, which is under significant pressure from public policy and a consumer and technology-led transformation, will face yet another eye-watering rise in business rates next April. The burden of the current business rates system, which is in urgent need of reform, is leading to store closures and hindering the successful reinvention of the retail industry. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ministers need to act to address this \u00c2\u00a3180m increase in retailers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 already unsustainable business rates bill, along with other public policy burdens which retailers are struggling to absorb the cost of. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need a freeze in the business rates multiplier until the next revaluation to help save shops, protect jobs, and future-proof retail, and to give the Government time to work with industry to reform the business tax system and make it fit for purpose in the 21st century.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Any inflation is bad news if your benefits are capped: The Resolution Foundation thinktank agree that households should welcome today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation data (even though it shows energy bills are rising). Resolution are hopeful that real wages will accelerate in the coming months: At 2.4%, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CPI inflation has fallen to a three-month low. It hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been lower since March 2017. Thanks to the Triple Lock, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state pension will rise by \u00c2\u00a34.25 per week next year (assuming the government doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ditch it). Financial expert Paul Lewis has all the details: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what it means for pensioners, and those saving for a pension: Expected figures for 2019: Weekly state pension: \u00c2\u00a3168.60 Annual State pension: \u00c2\u00a38,767.20 The Lifetime Allowance will go up in line with the CPI increase to: \u00c2\u00a31,054,800 Some instant reaction to the fall in UK inflation: (CPIH, another inflation measure, adjusted for housing costs. CPI, though, is used to set pensions and business rates) Falling inflation is good news for households across the UK. Yesterday we learned that basic pay jumped by 3.1% per year in the three months to August, the fastest growth since the financial crisis. Cheaper food and drink helped to pull inflation down last month. However, higher energy prices did have an upward impact on inflation. The Office for National Statistics says: The largest downward contribution to the change in the CPIH 12-month rate came from food and non-alcoholic beverages, where prices fell by 0.1% between August and September 2018 compared with a rise of 0.8% between the same two months a year ago. The main effects came from meat where prices fell, between August and September, this year but rose a year ago and from chocolate. Transport also had a downward effect, with passenger transport fares showing larger price falls between August and September 2018 than between the same two months a year ago. The largest effect came from sea fares with a smaller downward effect from air fares. As explained earlier, this inflation rate will also dictate pension entitlement increases across the state sector. It means: Teachers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Pension \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Increases of CPI + 1.6% = +4% NHS Pension \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Increases of CPI + 1.5 % = +3.9% Police Pension \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Increases of CPI + 1.25% = +3.65% Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate fell to 2.4% in September, weaker than expected, and down from 2.7% in August. That means the State Pensions will rise by 2.6% under the Triple Lock next April, because average earnings in the last year (+2.6%) have grown faster than inflation. More to follow! In other news, IMF chief Christine Lagarde has become the latest big name to pull out of Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big investment conference. This follows the international outcry over the disappearance and apparent murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. A Fund spokesperson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Managing Director\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previously scheduled trip to the Middle East region is being deferred.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A swathe of business chiefs have also withdrawn, including Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan Chas, BlackRock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Larry Fink and Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga. Donald Trump, though, has come to the Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence, accepting denials that those at the top were involved at all. Over in the City, the pound has dipped a little to $1.316 as traders watch for Brexit developments. Theresa May is heading to a crunch meeting with fellow EU leaders tonight, where she will try to make progress on the sticky issue of the Irish backstop. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little hope of a major breakthrough, with many cabinet ministers insisting that the backstop should be time-limited and not split Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Konstantinos Anthis, Head of Research at ADSS, points out that the pound hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been too badly hit by the Brexit deadlock: UK Prime Minister Theresa May is heading to Brussels today with no breakthrough related to the Brexit talks in her bags and will instead ask the EU leaders to keep working towards a solution. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interesting however is that even though we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen no progress, the pound is trading with a positive bias since the beginning of the week. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only one way to read this: everyone who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bearish regarding a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit is already short sterling and the only ones dipping their toes in the market are the short-term speculators hoping for a positive resolution. Former Who singer Roger Daltrey has weighed in too. Rather than hoping to die before he gets old, Daltrey now hopes to see Britain out of the EU - with its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgravy train\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdemocratic deficit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - as soon as possible.... Investment service Hargreaves Lansdown have released a very useful note on public sector pensions. It shows how today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation reading will affect millions of state sector employees, by determining how much goes into their pension pot each year. Since 2015 Public Sector Pensions have moved to using Career Average Earnings as opposed to final salary pensions. This basically means that each year members \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 their accrued pension and this is uprated in-line with the previous September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation. Some pensions increase this cumulative accrued benefit by more than inflation, so for three key sectors it means: Teachers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Pension \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Increases of CPI + 1.6% NHS Pension \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Increases of CPI + 1.5 % Police Pension \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Increases of CPI + 1.25% So if inflation was 2.7% in September 2017, the increase for pensions being accrued would be 4.3% on the Teachers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Pension, 4.2% for those in the NHS and 3.95% for the Police Pension Scheme. Those increases outstrip rises in actual earnings in recent years, due to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity programme. Nathan Long, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says an imbalance is building: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWith inflation outstripping wage growth, there is a risk that public sector workers could find their overall pay distorted towards their life after work. Saving for a pension is important, but so too is having enough to put food on the table and pay the bills. Continued periods of goods going up more in price than the rise in wages could create even bigger challenges.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Millions of UK pensioners and public sector workers, and thousands of businesses around the country, will be affected by new inflation figures being released today September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer prices index will show how the cost of living rose last month. But crucially, it will be used to determine Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state pension \u00e2\u20ac\u0153triple lock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It will also determine increases in public sector pensions for teachers, NHS workers and the police. The Triple Lock is a pledge that pensions will increase each April in line with wages, earnings, or 2.5%, whichever is higher. City economists predict that CPI will have risen by 2.6% per year in September, with guesstimates varying from 2.4% up to 2.8%. So with average earnings rising by 2.6%, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation reading will determine just how much Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state pension will rise by in April 2019. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently \u00c2\u00a3164.35 per week (equivalent to \u00c2\u00a38,546.20 per year). The Triple Lock does have its critics -- the Conservative Party proposed dropping the 2.5% floor in the last election, while the International Monetary Fund thinks it is too expensive. But others argue that pensioners deserve a decent increase, and to be protected from the ravages of inflation. But Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard-pressed companies will hit in the pocket by a large jump in inflation, as CPI is used to set business rates. Press Association explains: Business rates - which essentially serve as specific property taxes for resident businesses - could go up by as much as 819.23 million in England if the headline rate of inflation remains unchanged at 2.7%, according to real estate advisor Altus Group. It said 209.76 million would be paid by the ailing retail sector, which has seen a number of players go bust in recent month amid higher costs and lower consumer spending. So there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be a lot of interest when the Consumer Price Index figures are released, along with a new survey of UK house prices. Also coming up today Investors are in a cheerier mood, after Wall Street posted its strongest gains in almost seven months last night. The Dow surged by almost 550 points, as the markets shook off last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worries: Netflix brought more cheer after the closing bell, by reporting a big jump in subscribers. Later today we get the minutes of the US Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last meeting, when it raised interest rates to 2.25%. Following that meeting, Donald Trump launched several attacks on the Fed for being too aggressive. Last night, he made a fresh assault, claiming that the central bank was his biggest threat, adding: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going too fast. Because, you looked at the last inflation numbers, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re very low. So much for central bank independence....

                "bodyText":"A big splosh of electronic red ink has hit European stocks at the close of trading today, and Wall Street is lower too. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has ended 27 points lower, or 0.4%, at 7,026, with this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop in retail sales doing little for sentiment. Mining stocks also got dented, following China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble to a four-year low overnight. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX fell around 1%, while Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB had a poor day, down almost 2%, as the EU signalled it would reject Rome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget. Wall Street is also back in the red, as the optimism in evidence earlier this week fades. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the damage: Investors also noted the WTO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that a full-blooded trade war would eliminate millions of jobs, and take a chunk off global growth. Fiona Cincotta of City Index fears over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy weighed on stocks: The UK mining sector has been falling across the session, as concerns are growing over the health of the Chinese economy. Chinese stocks fell heavily overnight as a toxic combination of factors saw the CSI 300 drop 2.2% to its lowest close in 31 months. Miners could be in for another difficult session on Friday, as China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP is expected to decline to 6.6% in Q3, down from 6.7% in Q2. This will be the weakest level of growth in almost a decade for China, and the first indication of the impact of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade tariffs on the economy. Given that the full scale of the impact of the ongoing trade war is not expected to be seen until Q4 and 2019, a surprise to the down side for Q3 GDP is going to sound loud alarm bells for investors. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been a thrilling day in the markets, alas. After the wild volatility of last week, trading seems to have calmed down. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Connor Campbell of SpreadEx\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: A mixed, muted session became slightly more negative after the US open, as Wednesday night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed meeting minutes came into play. In the record of September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s get-together the central bank signalled \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfurther gradual increases\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to interest rates, ignoring the repeated criticisms made by Donald Trump without ever mentioning the President by name (the comments came before the market freak-out seen in October). This, relatively gently, reignited the markets concerns about such a course, with the Dow Jones dropping between 70 and 140 points as the bell rang on Wall Street. This failed to make a floaty set of European indices follow the same narrative. The CAC managed to rise 0.2%, while the DAX reversed its initial gains to sink 0.3%. The FTSE added 20 points able to eke out some growth as sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline compensated for the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commodity losses. The City of London is getting a new guest - Fearless Girl. The defiant sculpture has proved highly popular since appearing on Wall Street, and she could soon take a holiday outside the London stock exchange instead. The Evening Standard reports: New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fearless Girl sculpture is coming to London. Hailed as a symbol of female resilience, it has been seen by millions of people in New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial district and is likely to be placed outside the London stock exchange. Members of the City of London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Culture, Heritage and Libraries Committee are expected to approve the plan for the 4ft (1.3 metre) high bronze, which weighs 110kg, to go on show for six months from March. The artwork, showing a young girl with her fists on her hips, became an over night sensation when it was placed opposite a large sculpture of a charging bull near Wall Street. So take your daughters. And your sons! As predicted, shares in New York have fallen into the red in early trading. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by over 0.6%, or 160 points, as the prospect of further interest rate hikes continues to worry Wall Street.... Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkish Fed minutes, indicating further rate hikes in the coming quarters, have depressed sentiment in New York. Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM, explains: One of the most interesting takeaways from the minutes released by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is a suggestion from the Federal Reserve that it could raise interest rates beyond market expectations. This would of course come across as disappointing to President Trump, but would also be considered as positive news for Dollar buyers as it stresses the Federal Reserve is completely independent from the White House. British businesses are watching the lack of progress over Brexit with increasing alarm. Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI Director-General, has warned that jobs are already at risk, and urged both sides to agree a withdrawal deal pronto. She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 patience was already threadbare and is nearing an end. The need for compromise on both sides to agree the Withdrawal Agreement and secure the transition period is long overdue. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The risk of no deal is already biting hard. With each week that passes, firms are accelerating their contingency planning, diverting investment and costing jobs. And many firms, especially smaller businesses, simply have no time to prepare. All efforts should focus on securing transition to relieve pressure on firms, protecting people, wages and living standards across Europe. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If extending the transition period makes the Withdrawal Agreement easier to agree it should be welcomed. Securing the transition period remains the top priority for business to protect jobs and investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, Theresa May still opposes the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Irish backstop agreement, and many pro-Brexit MPs are unhappy about potentially extending the Withdrawal Agreement. So businesses face more uncertainty.... Shares fell in New York yesterday, after the latest minutes from the Federal Reserve showed further rate hikes are likely. Traders don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a bounceback today, though, with the main indices all a little lower in pre-market trading. Just in: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market remains remarkably strong, as companies shake off any trade war worries. The number of US citizens filing new claims for unemployment benefit fell last week, new data show, to just 210,000. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 215,000 in the previous seven days, and not far from a 49-year low [202,000, set last month] The number of Americans receiving jobless support for more than one week (the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccontinuing claims\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 figure) has hit a new low. At just 1.64 million, its the lowest since August 1973. Overnight, the US found a new way to hurt Chinese companies. The White House said it was pulling out of a United Nations treaty that offered low rates for foreign postal deliveries of small packages in the US. That could make it much pricier for Chinese firms to send goods to America. Stephen Innes of trading firm OANDA says this helped drive Chinese stocks down to a four-year low today: Fragile doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t describe just how delicate Asia investor sentiment is as any sliver of optimism from US earnings gave way to that reality that trade tension and geopolitical unrest continues to gurgle... To make matters worse, President Trump has found in the US postal service, a way to cripple China e-commerce which sent mainland equities into the tank. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pub industry is fighting its own battle against rising taxes, which it blames for forcing locals to close. Six publicans, including former model Jodie Kidd, have dropped off a petition at Downing Street today, calling for a cut in beer duty in this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget. Organised by the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Long Live the Local\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd campaign, it warns that 12% of pubs could close in the next five years unless the chancellor cuts the duty (currently three times the EU average). Kidd, who runs The Half Moon, Kirdford, says another rise in beer duty would cripple the industry: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Local pubs like my own bring people together and are at the heart of communities. However, mounting financial pressures mean that for many it is already a struggle just to keep their doors open. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am at Downing Street today to deliver the Long Live the Local petition because, along with 105,000 other people, I believe the Chancellor must act now to protect our local pubs. Chancellor Philip Hammond is currently scrambling around, trying to find ways to raise revenue so he can meet Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to end austerity. So he may not be amenable to cutting the levy. However, pubs could certainly use some help - with supermarkets under-cutting them on price, and an increasing number of young people shunning alcohol. Heads-up for UK travellers: Cypriot airline Cobalt cancelled all its flights and indefinitely suspended operations, after failing to agree a new funding package. So if you were due to fly Cobalt from, say, Heathrow, Stansted, Gatwick and Manchester, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no point heading to the airport. More here: Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pizza hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been caught up in the retail slowdown. The fast food chain has reported a 6.1% jump in sales in the UK and Ireland in July-September. David Wild, Chief Executive Officer, says the sizzling summer weather didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help (is it ever too hot for pizza, though?!) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our businesses continue to trade well, despite the evident uncertainty among UK consumers, and hot weather across Europe for much of the quarter. Shares have jumped 7.5%, after Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reiterated its profit guidance and announced a new \u00c2\u00a325m share buyback programme. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor Larry Elliott on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales figures: A strong summer for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retailers came to an abrupt end in September as weaker demand for food dragged down spending overall. The latest snapshot of spending from the Office for National Statistics showed that the volume of sales for shops and online businesses dropped by 0.8% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a bigger monthly fall than analysts had been expecting. September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall was not enough to outweigh rising activity in July and August, leaving sales for the quarter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a better guide to the underlying trend than one month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up by 1.2%. Although consumers have only recently started to see their wages rise faster than prices, the ONS said the quantity of goods bought last month was 3% up on the same month a year earlier. All sectors apart from department stores, which underwent the collapse and partial rescue of House of Fraser in the past year, achieved growth. More here: Andrew Westbrook, head of retail at audit, tax and consulting firm RSM, reckons some retailers have been slashing prices, to shift stocks: There continue to be signs of distress on the high street, with deep discounting evident in some stores. The big rise in the sales of watches and jewellery over the last three months may be linked to discounting on big ticket items in an attempt to reduce stock levels. For many retailers, the run-up to the all-important Christmas season when stock can be converted to cash can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come soon enough. This chart shows how retail sales growth has been levelling off recently (the blue line, which gives a better picture than the more volatile monthly stats): Ian Gilmartin, Head of Retail &amp; Wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, says UK retailers are in a gruelling scrap: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still tough out there for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retailers, so solid 3% growth compared with last September is welcome news, despite being slightly below expectations. Every sale continues to be hard-won and retailers are having to find creative ways to lure customers through their doors and onto their websites, but it seems from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data that they are persuading the public to keep spending. Although the dip in food sales from August is eye-catching, it was expected given the exceptional performance achieved over the summer and shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause undue concern. He also singles out Brexit as a key worry: Any growth is significant given the plethora of challenges facing retailers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they are being hit from all sides, with business rates, the continued weakness of sterling and persisting uncertainty around Brexit combining to thwart investment and push up costs. Retail CEOs will be hoping to see some white smoke from Westminster and Brussels as soon as possible, and for solid assurances that they will be able to maintain their existing supply chains and frictionless trading arrangements with EU partners and consumers. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Channel 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Helia Ebrahimi on the retail sales figures: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also shows the impact of inflation, particularly at petrol stations where fuel is a lot pricier than a year ago: The sharp drop in retail sales last month shows that consumers are being squeezed, argues Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International. She explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK retail sales numbers confirm what we all fear about the state of the high street, with the latest figures showing a decline in sales of 0.8% in September compared to August 2018. The drop in sales in September is a reflection not only of clouds starting to form in the sky, but also our pockets. Food stores were the largest fallers contributing to this decline, with sales falling by 0.6%. Uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is one factor, she adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While some retailers may be pinning their hopes on the recent news that consumers are likely to see a boost to their pay packets after this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data revealed that our earnings growth is currently outstripping inflation, UK consumers are unlikely to be splashing out just yet given the current climate of uncertainty around the Brexit negotiations. Unlike most common colds we are suffering at this time of year; UK households are still unable to shake off the prolonged symptoms of inflation and poor wage growth since the Brexit vote. With no breakthrough at last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU leaders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 meeting, and mounting political pressure at home, that uncertainty hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lifted yet.... Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK retail sales figures are a concern: Retail sales fell 0.8% in September as shoppers cut back on spending after a bumper summer. Food sales suffered their biggest monthly drop in three years. The monthly data is notoriously volatile, but the year-on-year figure of 3.0% undershot economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts of a 3.6% rise, and September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop dragged the three-month number down to 1.2%, the third fall in a row. It looks like consumer spending \u00e2\u20ac\u201c along with the weather \u00e2\u20ac\u201c peaked in early summer and has been declining ever since. Where we go from here is highly uncertain. Brexit is hitting consumer confidence hard, but on the plus side wage growth has hit a decade high while inflation is falling. So consumers look likely to have more spending power \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the issue is whether they choose to use it, or keep their powder dry until more clarity over Brexit emerges. Philipp Gutzwiller, head of consumer at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, says shoppers cut back last month, after a summer splurge. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After a summer of spending boosted by the long, hot weather, September saw shoppers tighten their belts to catch up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a result, retailers have had to redouble their efforts, focusing on either steep discounts or creating the theatre that makes going shopping an experience consumers can actually enjoy. Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA agrees that the retail sales report is disappointing; James Hughes of Axitrader says the summer spending burst couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last.... One month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data can be volatile, of course. On a three-month basis, the quantity bought in retail sales increased by 1.2% ONS Head of Retail Sales Rhian Murphy said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Retail continued to grow in the three months to September with jewellery shops and online stores seeing particularly strong sales. This was despite a stark slowdown in food sales in September, following a bumper summer.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: UK retail sales shrank by 0.8% in September, a bigger fall than expected. The Office for National Statistics reports that customers bought less food after a strong August. The ONS says: In September 2018, the quantity bought declined by 0.8% when compared with August 2018, due mainly to a large fall of 1.5% in food stores; the largest decline in food store sales since October 2015. Economists had only expected retail sales to dip by 0.4% month-on-month. On an annual basis, retail sales in September were 3% higher than a year earlier (or 3.2% higher if you strip out petrol sales). More to follow... It was another rough trading session in China today. Nearly every stock fell, as today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3% slump means the Shanghai index has lost almost 25% of its value this year alone. Bloomberg says that some speculative traders are being forced to put up more more money to cover their losses. This leads to more selling, and thus more losses, in a destructive cycle also seen in the 1929 crash. Chinese shares extended the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deepest slump and the yuan touched its weakest level in almost two years, testing the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to maintain market calm as risks mount for Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. Fears of widespread margin calls fuelled a 3 percent tumble in the Shanghai Composite Index, which sank to a nearly four-year low as more than 13 stocks fell for each that rose Shares in Europe have opened a little higher, despite the WTO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war gloom. The FTSE 100 has gained 19 points, or 0.3%, 7,073. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC and the German DAX are both up around 0.45%. Multinational European companies are benefiting from the stronger dollar (a weaker euro makes their US earnings more valuable). The Chinese yuan is also weakening this morning, hitting its lowest level since January 2017 Yesterday, the US Treasury resisted labelling China a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccurrency manipulator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, in a new report on the foreign exchange policies of major US trading partners. President Donald Trump has previously accused China of keeping its currency weak to make exports more competitive, but the Treasury has now shied away from taking action. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complaints were ironic, though, that Beijing has actually been intervening to prevent the yuan falling too much. Today, the yuan has dipped to 6.9422. Many other currencies are also dropping against the US dollar this morning, after last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkish Fed minutes. A weaker currency could help Chinese firms swallow tariffs on their sales to the US..... Roberto Azevedo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning of the perils of a trade war will have resonated in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchanges today. Shares are sliding sharply AGAIN today, as traders fear that the dispute with America will escalate further. The Shanghai composite index has just closed, down 3%, at its lowest level since November 2014. How bad would a full-blown breakdown of trade relations be? According to WTO chief Roberto Azevedo, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a complete breakdown in international trade cooperation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd would drive tariffs higher, knocking up to 17% off global trade growth. That worst-case scenario could knock 1.9% off overall global economic growth, WTO economists reckon. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Trade wars are on investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds this morning, after the World Trade Organisation fired a broadside at the US and China over their deepening dispute. Roberto Azevedo, WTO director-general, told an audience in London that we are facing a crisis in global trade. Calling for a cease-fire in the current trade ware, Azevedo warned that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Without action to ease tensions and recommit to cooperation in trade, we could see serious harm done to the multilateral trading system. The long term economic consequences of this could be severe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Currently, the US imposes tariffs on $250bn of Chinese imports, as it tries to force Beijing to change its trade policies. Instead, China has retaliated with its own tariffs. Azevedo says a political solution is needed, before \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious harm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is incurred by the multilateral trading system. Potentially, it could force millions of people to seek new jobs, he explained: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These effects would cause significant disruptions for workers, firms, and communities as they adjust to this new reality. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Potentially millions of workers would need to find new jobs; firms would be looking for new products and markets; and communities for new sources of growth. Also coming up New UK retail sales data are expected to show Brits cut back last month. Retail spending is expected to have fallen by 0.4% last month. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Once again groceries are expected to continue to do well, whilst non-essential items continue to disappoint. After a strong summer of spending from the UK consumer, and a surprise to the upside in August, there is a good chance the UK consumer is reining in their spending ahead of the Christmas period. The City is bracing for further US interest rate rises in future months, after the Federal Reserve signalled it intends to keep hiking - despite Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism.

                "bodyText":"Before we close up for the today, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a look at markets across Europe, where the FTSE continues to outperform: FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,045 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.5% at 11,530 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.9% at 5,073 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.7% at 18,956 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.1% at 8,901 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.3% at 361 While the mood among investors is distinctly subdued, the news this morning that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 6.5% in the third quarter - the slowest rate since the financial crisis - has not prompted a major sell-off. In the UK, figures showed the government borrowed \u00c2\u00a34.1bn in September, less than the \u00c2\u00a34.5bn predicted by economists and \u00c2\u00a3800m than a year earlier. It was the lowest September borrowing figure since 2007, and potentially hands the chancellor more room for budget giveaways on 29 October. The big news this afternoon is that Nick Clegg is joining Facebook as head of global policy and communications. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find all the latest updates on the story here: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. Thank you for all the comments, and have a good weekend. As the shock news of Nick Clegg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Facebook appointment was breaking, the Treasury put out a response to this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lower than expected borrowing numbers. Does it provide any clues to what might be in the budget a week on Monday? If anything it suggests Philip Hammond is not prepared to splash the cash, despite a falling deficit this year. A Treasury spokesperson said: This is the lowest half-year borrowing for 16 years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c showing the strong progress we have made in fixing our public finances. But, at over 85% of GDP last year, our debt remains too high. Our balanced approach is getting debt falling while supporting our vital public services, keeping taxes low and investing in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. Twitter is reacting to the news that Facebook has hired Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader who lost his seat at the 2017 general election: Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newest recruit is none other than Nick Clegg, the former Deputy Prime Minister. According to the FT, he will join the social media giant as head its global affairs and communications team and will move to Silicon Valley in January. It follows months of wooing by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, who told Clegg,51, he would have a leading role in shaping the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy. As Theresa May returns from Brussels with no Brexit deal, to major divisions in her own party and a people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote march on Saturday, big business is also keeping up the pressure. In the latest intervention, the president of Japanese car maker Toyota has said a no-deal Brexit should be avoided \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at all costs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Noting the failure to agree a deal this week, Akio Toyoda said: Apprehension is therefore growing that a withdrawal without agreement may become a reality. It is necessary that an unimpaired trade environment between the United Kingdom and the European Union be maintained and that the automobile industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activities remain predicated on shared standards, including those regulating vehicle certification. Toyota employs about 2,600 people at its manufacturing plant in Derbyshire, and a further 600 in Deeside. Read the full story here: He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the chief executive of a FTSE 100 housebuilder and his huge \u00c2\u00a375m bonus payout - the biggest of any UK listed company - attracted widespread criticism earlier in the year. Yet Jeff Fairburn was lost for words when Spencer Stokes, a BBC journalist for Look North in Yorkshire, asked him about it during an interview. Asked if he has regrets about the furore surrounding his massive payout, Fairburn hesitates, before being interrupted by a press officer who is off camera. As Stokes persists with the line of questioning, Fairburn says: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather not talk about that, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been well covered actually. Are there any lessons to be learned, it was the biggest bonus in the country, Stokes asks. At which point Fairburn walks off camera and says: I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really unfortunate actually that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done that. Watch it here: The latest figures on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances have reinforced expectations that the Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independent forecaster will revise down borrowing for 2018-19. At the time of the Spring Statement in March, the Office for Budget Responsibility was forecasting borrowing to fall to \u00c2\u00a337.1bn from \u00c2\u00a345.2bn in 2017-18. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC: While there could be some catch-up in public spending later in the year, we still expect public borrowing in 2018/19 as a whole to be only around \u00c2\u00a330 billion, which would be around \u00c2\u00a37 billion less than the OBR forecast back in March. However, we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too excited about budget giveaways, Hawksworth adds: This borrowing undershoot should give the chancellor a little extra wiggle room for his budget, but it will not be enough on its own to cover the cost of announced increases in spending on the NHS, let alone other priority areas where there is pressure to bring austerity to an end. The budget is therefore still likely to require some tough choices between net tax rises, higher borrowing in the medium term and allowing austerity to continue in parts of the public sector. The chancellor Philip Hammond may well have a spring in his step this morning, after the latest official figures show government borrowing fell more than expected in September. Borrowing was \u00c2\u00a34.1bn last month, less than the \u00c2\u00a34.5bn predicted by economists and \u00c2\u00a3800m than a year earlier according to the Office for National Statistics. It was the lowest borrowing for the month of September since 2007 - shortly before the financial crisis hit. It means that halfway through the fiscal year, borrowing stands at \u00c2\u00a319.9bn - \u00c2\u00a310.7bn less than in the same period in 2017 and the lowest year-to-date for 16 years. It is the last set of data before Hammond presents his budget on 29 October. With Theresa May already declaring an end to austerity, could this be the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moment to pull a rabbit out of the hat with a surprise spending giveaway? Improvement in the public finances in September was driven by higher VAT and income tax receipts, and national insurance contributions. Not all businesses are reaping the benefits of consumer demand in China. New Look, the value high street fashion retailer, is exiting China, closing all 120 stores with the loss of more than 700 jobs. Corporate results this morning help to put into context slowing growth in China, where swelling middle classes continue to drive demand for luxury goods. The French spirits company, Remy Cointreau, reported stronger-than-expected second quarter sales, helped by robust demand for its premium cognac in China. Sales for the three months to 30 September were \u00e2\u201a\u00ac330m, a like-for like rise of 9.1%. Meanwhile, the Intercontinental Hotels Group said it would pay $500 million to shareholders in a special dividend as it reported a 1% rise in revenue per available room for the third quarter, driven by strong demand in China. Investors across Europe are subdued as the week draws to a close. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mixed picture, with the FTSE outperforming its peers. On the flip side, the FTSE MIB is firmly in the red in Italy, where budget concerns continue to weigh on investor minds and are dragging down banking shares. The latest scores: FTSE 100: 0.3% at 7,047 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: flat at 11,588 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.1% at 5,111 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -1.1% at 18,876 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.5% at 8,847 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: flat at 362 Putting China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures in context, Neil Wilson at markets.com says growth of 6.5% is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a nice problem to have\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Growth of 6.5% rather than 6.6% is a pretty nice problem to have but the trade war with the US, higher debt levels and a depreciating currency remain a concern. Any bounce in Chinese stocks needs to be seen in the context of the three-year collapse in equities. One of the weaker spots in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy was industrial production, with growth slowing to 5.8% year-on-year in September, from 6.1% in August. Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon, says: The slowdown makes sense in the context of the sharp downtrend in the manufacturing PMIs in recent months. The breakdowns available at this stage offer little sign of green shoots. In particular, cement production is falling again, though this could reflect environmental curbs, rather than suggesting that the construction sector is back in the doldrums, after its recent positive contribution. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 6.5% in the third quarter according to official figures published this morning. It was the slowest rate since the depths of the financial crisis in the first quarter of 2009, and slightly below economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts of 6.6% growth. It followed growth of 6.7% in the second quarter, and the slowdown of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy is expected to continue as the effects of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war with the US are increasingly felt. Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, gives his take: Official GDP growth slowed last quarter consistent with broader evidence that the economy is cooling. There are some early signs in the September data that policy support is starting to gain traction, but we think more easing will still be needed in order to stabilise growth. Looking ahead, we doubt the latest pick-up in infrastructure spending will be enough to prevent the economy from cooling further in the coming quarters. Policy easing has yet to reverse the downward trajectory in broad credit growth, a key headwind to the economy, and front-loading by US importers means that the impact of tariffs has yet to be felt. We anticipate a further loosening of both monetary and fiscal policy in the coming months, which should put a floor under growth by about the middle of 2019. Also coming up today, UK public finance figures for September at 9.30am BST will provide insight into how much spending room the chancellor, Philip Hammond, might have ahead of his budget on 29 October.

                "bodyText":"And finally, European stock markets have ended the day in the red. The early optimism, following China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best day in a couple of years, burned off by the close of trading. The FTSE 100 ended 7 points lower at 7,042, a drop of just 0.1%. But Italy shed 0.6%, as traders braced for the EU to demand a budget rewrite tomorrow. Giuseppe Conte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to avoid an Italexit wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to spark a rally. France also lost 0.6%, while Spain was down almost 1%. Over in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average has lost 131 points by lunchtime, a drop of 0.5%. However the Nasdaq tech index is up almost 0.4%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Goodnight! GW The pound is still suffering the Brexit blues, down almost one cent tonight. Sterling held onto its losses, as prime minister Theresa May urged MPs to hold their nerve, as 95% of the deal with the EU was in place. The news that her DUP partners might rebel over the remaining 5%, though, has worried the City. Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, says: The Pound is down 0.8% on the day, dropping below the $1.30 psychological level for the first time since early October, following news that the Democratic Unionist Party, a key partner in parliament to the government of PM Theresa May, will back a proposal by rebel Tory MP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to legislate in order to block an eventual post-Brexit Irish border back-stop agreement with the EU. The new development makes a no-deal Brexit scenario more likely and sterling is struggling to find support, as the markets move to price-in the new development. At least one European neighbour is agitating for the EU to reject Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget, points out the Financial Times: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget policy was sharply criticised by Sebastian Kurz, Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chancellor, who said on Monday that Brussels should reject Rome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans unless there was a rethink. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Austria is not prepared to stand behind the debts of other states while those states are actively contributing to market uncertainty,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Mr Kurz. The EU \u00e2\u20ac\u0153must show it has learnt from the Greek crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he said. Austria holds the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rotating presidency. Hartwig L\u00c3\u00b6ger, Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, said Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s populist debt policy would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taking the EU hostage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if Brussels did not act. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refusal to change its budget plans for 2019 mean a clash with the EU later this week seems inevitable. Brussels is expected to tell Rome that its planned structural deficit is too large, and demand a rewrite. My colleage Angela Giuffrida watched Conte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference earlier, and explains: Italy refused to compromise on its economic targets, sending a letter to Brussels on Monday explaining why it will raise its deficit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the gap between government spending and income \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to 2.4% of GDP. The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, told reporters in Rome that the government was not being led by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bunch of hotheads\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that the increased borrowing was needed to ensure that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grows. Conte said the government, made up of a coalition of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the far-right League, would need \u00e2\u201a\u00ac17bn (\u00c2\u00a315bn) to fund election campaign promises including tax cuts, a universal basic income and pension reforms. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We studied this for a long time and concluded that if we had continued on the same road, Italy would have entered into a recession,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Conte said. Investors are still jittery about Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget, despite the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to calm the situation today. Dan Smith, Investment Analyst at Thomas Miller Investment, explains: With the Italian government taking an uncompromising stance to its budget thus far, the events this week could provide the litmus test for the European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to police national budgets. It remains a tough balancing act for Brussels; push too hard and risk strengthening eurosceptic sentiment in Italy, but too lenient a stance risks a counter reaction from other European members that comply with the rules. Investor sentiment around Italian assets has deteriorated in recent weeks and with debt rating agencies issuing downgrades (with more set to come), we are at a particularly precarious moment. The developments in Italy today have brought smiles to the faces of Greek officials across the Ionian sea. Italian prime minister Conte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge not to quit the eurozone was a reminder of the Greek crisis three years earlier. Market turmoil in Italy has hit Greek bank shares hard in recent weeks. The governor of the Bank of Greece, Yiannis Stournaras, blamed the dramatic drop in the share prices of Greek lenders to events in the neighbouring nation. Even worse for a country that has pinned its hopes on returning to international borrowing markets after exiting its third and final bailout programme in August, Greek bond yields have followed the trajectory of Italy bonds. This has highlighted Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 continued, and acute, vulnerability to what Stournaras described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exogenous factors ... in Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s neighbouring countries in particular.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A senior Greek finance ministry official said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our priority has been decoupling the situation there and here ... Greece is not Italy and should not be perceived as such abroad.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Wall Street rally is fizzling out too.. Not so fast! Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has lost its early gains, sending the FTSE MIB down 0.6%. Bank shares are dropping -- perhaps investors are worrying about how much Italian government debt they own.... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s green on the boards as Wall Street opens: With the Chinese market surging by 4%, and Europe also higher, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a positive start to the week. David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, says the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bullish sentiment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from China has spilled over. Dealers are cautiously optimistic as questions still hang over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial health. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have downgraded Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating to one notch above junk status, but the agency lifted its outlook to stable from negative, so investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afraid of another downgrade in the near-term. Just in, Supermarket group Wm Morrison has lost a legal battle against thousands of supermarket staff whose personal details were posted on the internet. Morrisons now faces a potentially \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vast\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd compensation payout, after losing a court of appeal case today, Press Association says. The case was brought after the payroll data of around 100,000 employees was leaked on the internet, including names, addresses, and bank account details. This potentially exposed Morrisons staff to identity theft and fraud. Andrew Skelton, the internal auditor who leaked the information, was jailed for eight years in 2015. Wall Street is expected to follow Asia and Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead by rising when trading begins in 25 minutes: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest take on Italy: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s populist government promised it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let its budget deficit widen further than currently planned and called for dialogue with the European Union to address their differences. In a letter to the European Commission published Monday, Finance Minister Giovanni Tria said the government is ready to act to ensure it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exceed the 2.4 percent target for 2019. He said he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aware that his spending plans don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comply with EU rules and he wants \u00e2\u20ac\u0153constructive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd talks with officials in Brussels. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, speaking in Rome, said the deficit target should be seen as an upper limit and it could still be narrower. The decision to increase spending was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153difficult though necessary,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tria said in his letter. He cited slow economic growth and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153difficult economic situation the poorest segments of the Italian society are facing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in the City, the pound has dropped back below $1.30 for the first time in over two weeks. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fall of 0.65%, or nearly one cent. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because Theresa May has a fresh Brexit hurdle to struggle over. The DUP, who are propping the government up, are reportedly planning to block the Northern Ireland Brexit backstop.... In his Politics Live blog, Andy Sparrow says this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t entirely shock (the DUP are opposed to anything that splits Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK), but it does ratchet up the pressure on Downing Street. Boom! Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister has insisted that his country will not follow Britain out of the European Union. Harking back to George Bush (senior) 30 years ago, Giuseppe Conte told reporters in Rome to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153read my lips\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Italy will not exit the eurozone despite the dispute over its budget plans, he declared. Reuters has more details: Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte defended on Monday Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget, which has fallen foul of the European Commission, saying the failure of previous efforts to stimulate the economy meant a new approach was needed. In a wide-ranging news conference, Conte said he wanted constructive dialogue with the Commission over the contested fiscal package, and predicted that growth would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153take off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd once government reforms were implemented. He pledged that next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit would not exceed 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and dismissed any suggestion that Italy might have to abandon the euro currency or leave the European Union. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcread my lips\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pledge may be a hostage to fortune, though. Bush famously promised not to impose new taxes before winning the presidential election in 1988, but later agreed to a budget which raised taxes after the US deficit widened. That u-turn was roasted in the media - the front page of the New York Post declared \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Read my lips... I lied!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It probably helped to cost Bush the 1992 election to Bill Clinton. Economics students at Liverpool University are studying the Italian situation today, and make an important point. Italy may be relieved to still have an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinvestment-grade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 credit rating, but that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remove the dangerous feedback loop between the banking sector and the government... They say: Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to downgrade Italy to one level above junk status has, so far, not triggered panic. In fact, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs wend down. There is a good reason for this. Investors are relieved to see Italy avoiding a junk status because Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is considered more conservative (in the sense that it gives more inferior ratings) than other Rating Agencies. Since Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has not relegated Italy to junk status, it is more likely than not that other Rating Agencies won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t push Italy to the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjunk abyss\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. On the negative side, however, the downgrade should serve as a (disturbing) reminder of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdangerous embrace\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 between Italy and its banks: Italian government debt accounts for as much as 19% of the assets of Italian banks, compared with 12% exposure of Portuguese banks to domestic debt and (only) 6.4% exposure of Greek banks to domestic debt. So any further stress to Italian yields will be transmitted immediately to Italian banks which will then increase the risk of severe contagion effects to Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s periphery... And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the third-year class, who are studying Financial Crises and Defaults, with professor Costas Milas: Giuseppe Conte has told reporters in Italy that growth will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153take off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd once his government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax and spending plans are implemented [unless Brussels demands a rewrite...]. Defending the deficit plans, the PM says that this extra borrowing will be used to fund investments. Technically, the budget includes the cost of various election campaign promises made by the two parties who form Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new coalition - including a universal basic income, tax cuts and pension reforms. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little argument that Italy does need a growth spurt, having underperformed its rivals since the financial crisis. Prime minister Conte has also promised that Italy certainly won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run a deficit over 2.4% of GDP next year. It might even be lower.... Just in: Italy is attempted to calm the dispute with the European Commission over its tax and spending plans. In a letter to the EC, economy minister Giovanni Tria says the Italian government is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153conscious\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that its 2019 budget isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in line with Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stability pact, because its structural deficit [2.4%] will exceed the EU target [2%]. This is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard but necessary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd decision, he says, showing that Rome is sticking to its plans. But...in a bid to ease the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collective blood pressure, Tria says Italy doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t intent to swell its structural deficit any further in 2020 and 2021, and pledged to hold \u00e2\u20ac\u0153constructive and loyal dialogue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with Brussels. Significantly, Tria also promises to take \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all necessary measures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt and deficit levels don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hit Rome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s targets [the 2019 budget is based on some rather optimistic growth forecasts] The letter also reiterates the Italy is committed to remaining in the eurozone, and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to put financial stability at risk. Prime minister Giuseppe Conte is also defending the budget: Sterling has lost ground this morning, as the UK government limbers up for yet another crunch week for Brexit. The weekend papers were full of warnings that Theresa May has just days to save her premiership (something of a recurring theme for the embattled PM, of course). She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no closer to finding a Brexit deal that can win the support of her cabinet, let alone the UK parliament. The tone of the debate continues to plumb the depths, with one unnamed MP claiming that May should \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbring her own noose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to a meeting of backbench MPs this week. Rightly, that has caused outrage in Westminster. May is expected to tell the House of Commons today that the Brexit deal is 95% agreed. Unfortunately for her, that 5% include the Irish backstop, which is threatening to blow the faultlines in the cabinet wide open. And Brexit, like an aircraft, won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fly if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only 95% complete. So traders are piling out of the pound, sending it down half a cent to $1.302. Just in: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has warned that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has endured a rough quarter. The Bundesbank believes that growth may have stalled in the last three months, partly due to lower car production as auto makers struggle to embrace tough new emission tests. In its monthly report on the German economy, it says: Although the economic upswing in Germany is essentially still intact, it may have come to a temporary halt in the third quarter of 2018. According to the Bundesbank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest Monthly Report, this was mainly due to a substantial fall in production by car manufacturers. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new motor vehicle emissions certification system was brought in after the Volkswagen test-rigging scandal. Some manufacturers have hit serious problems meeting the new rules, forcing them to suspend production of some models while they get certified (a bottleneck at the testers hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped either). Those Chinese stimulus hopes are also pushing commodity prices up this morning. Copper has jumped to a one-week high, after president Xi tried to reassure China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies that he was behind them. Reuters has the details: Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange was up 1.2% at $6,292 a tonne. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The news from China is encouraging for metals,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Eugen Weinberg, analyst at Commerzbank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Measures that add liquidity will help in the short to medium term, but it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t solve the problem of indebtedness, a problem for some years now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Italian government bonds are strengthening this morning, on hopes that a full-blown battle with Brussels can be avoided. Deputy prime minister Luigi Di Maio, who leads the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, has insisted today that his government will not leave the euro. It is expected to publish a letter later today, outlining its response to the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns over its 2019 budget. Rome is sticking to its plan to run a deficit of 2.4% of GDP next year, breaching the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget rules. But the markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem worried that Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgraded Italy last week to Baa3, one notch above Junk. There is some relief that Italy still has an investment-grade rating - just!. So Italian bond prices are rising, pulling down the interest rate (or yield) on its debt. Many analysts expect the EU will instruct Rome to redraw its budget, with a smaller deficit. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici argued today that Italy must stick to EU rules, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you are an EU member and a member of the single currency, of the euro zone, you must respect a number of joint rules. Yes, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same Moscovici who ran the French finance ministry when France, errr, overshot EU budget targets. More airlines are likely to collapse in the next few months, as the rising oil price hits earnings. So claims Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary this morning, as he reported a 7% drop in profits in the last six months. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary told Bloomberg TV that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the doo-doo has hit the fan\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd recently, with crude prices having risen from $57 per barrel to over $80 in the last year. Rising fuel costs have dragged down Cypriot carrier Cobalt last week, the Danish carrier Primera Air and the Swiss airline SkyWork in the last two months. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary admitted that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153frankly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he hopes more rivals will disappear this winter, adding that Ryanair is better hedged against rising oil prices. On Brexit, O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary predicted that Britain will avoid a no-deal hard Brexit, by agreeing a 21-month transition programme. In a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worse-case\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd scenario, UK airlines might be blocked from landing in the EU in the days immediately after Brexit, he added. But that prospect of seeing planes grounded would force the UK to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstumble\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 into a transition deal, otherwise the government would fall, he predicted. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war, and the wider economic slowdown in China, are creating a real headache for policymakers. While a stimulus package might boost growth, it could also undermine Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to limit risky borrowing and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeleverage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the economy. This is creating a lot of anxiety among the Chinese leadership, according to Xu Jianwei, senior China economist at French bank Natixis. He says (via the South China Morning Post): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top priorities for this year was deleveraging, but that policy has shifted gradually because there are more serious problems. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If deleveraging continues, many Chinese companies may die in the process. But if deleveraging slows down, the financial risks will continue to pile up. So regulators are for sure very worried, and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they have found a particularly good way out of it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European stock markets have begun the new week with small gains, helped by the rally in China. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is 10 points highers, while Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB has jumped by almost 1%. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has closed for the day, with its biggest surge in three years. The CSI300 index ended the day 4.3% higher at 3,270, its biggest rise in almost three years, thanks to the flurry of reassuring noises from Chinese politicians and officials. The Shanghai Composite index, another benchmark, leapt by 4.1% - its biggest one-day gain since March 2016. President Xi Jinping pledge to always support private firms helped fuel the rally, says Yang Hai, an analyst at Kaiyuan Securities, who believes the market will rebound further - especially with tax cuts on the horizon. The Chinese government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153verbal support for the economy and markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has created a risk-friendly mood to start the week, says Kit Juckes of Societe Generale: Reassurance from the Chinese leadership that they will support the economy have triggered the biggest one-day increase in equity indices since 2015 and has given markets everywhere a risk-friendly bias to start the week. A top Chinese central bank official has hinted that Beijing could unleash hefty tax cuts to keep its economy on the road. Ma Jun, advisor to the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China, declared that tax cuts in 2019 could be worth over 1% of gross domestic product (GDP). Ma also declared that the Chinese financial sector would support businesses -- backing up presidents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge. He said PBOC would encourage banks not to discriminate against private firms, in favour of state-owned ones. The government will also roll out a guarantee fund to support private enterprises, he added. Craig Erlam of foreign exchange firm OANDA says Chinese traders have welcomed Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to protect the corporate sector: President Xi added his name to the list of those vowing to support private firms over the weekend, giving investors reason to pile back in to battered Chinese stocks. The Shanghai Composite had fallen more than 30% from its peak this year prior to Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, which has been the clearest sign so far that tariffs are biting. The tariffs may not yet be taking their toll on the trade data but as long as the stock market continues to take a beating and growth stalls \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as the data last week showed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Trump will be confident that the measures are effective and continue to threaten to double down until he wins concessions. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a long way to go in this particular trade spat it would seem. Every sector on the Chinese stock market has rallied hard today, thanks to president Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to support businesses. Healthcare and technology stocks led the way: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. 2018 has been a grim year for China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investors, but perhaps things are finally looking up. The Chinese stock market has surged by over 4% today, on track for its best day since 2015, after President Xi Jinping vowed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unwavering\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd support for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector. In a clear hint that Beijing will do more to protect China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, Xi insisted that his government was standing behind its business leaders. In a letter to private entrepreneurs, the Communist leader pledged: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any words and practices that negate and weaken the private economy are wrong. Supporting the development of private enterprises is the Party Central Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consistent policy. Other Chinese officials have also been making supportive noises. On Saturday, vice premier Liu He held a meeting with top officials to discuss financial stability in the face of the trade war with America. He later said that China must move faster to implement measures to encourage the healthy development of the economy. These comments are seen as evidence that China could ease fiscal policy and cut taxes to support its economy, after seeing growth slow to its lowest rate in 10 years last week. Chinese investors have leapt into action, driving the blue chip CSI300 index up by over 4.3% in late trading. The Shanghai Composite index is up 4%, on track for its best day since March 2016. Other Asia-Pacific markets are also rallying, on hopes that a big Chinese stimulus package would support growth in the region. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Asian shares bounced higher on Monday, as Chinese stocks extended their rebound for a second straight session, pulling European futures higher in the process. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge of support for the economy is overshadowing geopolitical concerns over Saudi Arabia, Italy and Brexit. Also coming up today Italian stocks may be under pressure, after ratings agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgraded Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating on Friday night. On the upside, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s left Italy with a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rating, meaning another downgrade isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imminent. The move came as Rome prepares to see its 2019 Budget rejected by the European Union for breaching borrowing targets. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much in the economic calendar, but budget airline Ryanair and diamond producer Petra Diamonds are reporting results.",

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Richard Partington on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market action: Wall Street and European stock markets followed Asian shares lower on Tuesday, as investors around the world took fright at the increasingly fractious global geopolitical outlook. Investors are growing increasingly worried about a cocktail of risks that could act as a significant drag on the world economy. Potential headwinds include the trade dispute between the US and China, rising US interest rates, the fallout from the death of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the budget dispute between the EU and Italy. Oliver Jones, a markets economist at the research firm Capital Economics, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Worries about problems in the US, and to some extent in the past few days China, have proved contagious.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Goodnight! Despite that late revival, the New York stock exchange has closed in the red. But things aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as bad as they looked earlier. The Dow has closed down 126 points, a drop of 0.5%, which means it clawed back most of its early losses. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still plenty of anxiety on the trading floors, following the big losses in Asia and Europe today. The EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refusal to accept Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget led to an unedifying confrontation between European commissioner Pierre Moscovici and an Italian MEP. My colleague Daniel Boffey has the details: Pierre Moscovici, the commissioner for economic and financial affairs, said the commission would hold talks with Rome with an open mind. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The opinion adopted today by the commission should come as no surprise to anyone, as the Italian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s draft budget represents a clear and intentional deviation from the commitments made by Italy last July,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, our door is not closing. We wish to continue our constructive dialogue with the Italian authorities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As Moscovici was leaving the press conference, an MEP for the League party, Angelo Ciocca, grabbed the commissioner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s notes and hit them with his shoe. He later tweeted that he had slammed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with a sole made in Italy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mountain of lies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Moscovici later responded that Ciocca had no respect for his function as a parliamentarian. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clip of the incident: Hello.... The US stock market is continuing to recover from its early lows. The Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now just 0.2% lower, or 60-odd points, having been 400+ down at the start of trading. October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning into a most volatile month in the markets.... Mike O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Rourke, chief Market strategist at JonesTrading, is also concerned by Caterpillar and 3M\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings. He told Marketwatch: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Caterpillar citing rising costs shows that the trade war is hitting home. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrials like Caterpillar that struggle when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at a cyclical top.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in New York, shares are climbing off their lowest points... but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still in the red. The Dow is currently 273 points lower at 25,038, down 1%. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are both 1.2% lower. Caterpillar (-7%) and 3M i(-4.5%) are both dragging the Dow down, following their results and guidance. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says Caterpillar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning of higher costs have shown the perils of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel tariffs and the trade war with China. These figures bring home loud and clear the ramification of the brewing trade war and come at a time when traders are starting to realise that the chances of a US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sino trade deal being achieved are diminishing. This US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sino trade spat is here to stay and that is frightening for the outlook of companies. Costs are increasing and fears that tighter trade conditions will slow global growth is making even the most level-headed trader nervous. When Caterpillar, a bellwether for economic activity starts to struggle, the smart money is seeing that as a signal to sell out of riskier assets. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip stock index has been skittled to its lowest level since March, amid another jittery day in the markets. The FTSE 100 has closed down 87 points, or 1.25%, at 6,955, a seven-month closing low. There are losses across Europe too, as the row between the EC and Rome over its 2019 budget intensifies. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell almost 0.9%, the French CAC lost 1.7% and the DAX shipped 2.1%. Worries over the US-China trade war hurt the markets (following Caterpiller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning of rising prices), while the Khashoggi murder also fuelled geopolitical worries. Brexit isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly helping the mood either, with investor confidence weak and factory orders down (as covered this morning). Day One of the Saudi Future Investment Initiative has been roundly overshadowed by the latest developments in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. One attendee has got in touch with some observations: 1. Apparently there are 3,000 attendees. I was advised that the original number was 3,500, so it seems 500 chose not to turn up. The event is taking place in the massive convention centre alongside the Ritz Carlton. Hotel. 2. Interesting to note that the first comment at the opening was drawing focus on the Kashoggi affair. The speaker articulated the fact that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrible event that happened\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is clearly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not in our Saudi DNA or the way we are. We decry what has happened and also want to thank the attendees that have come to Riyadh for the F.I.I. From abroad - your presence here is welcome and most appreciated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This overt recognition and expression of Saudi contrition and reinforcing the fact that the Saudi government is clearly distancing itself from the events in Istanbul. 3. Very strong police and security presence in place and in view across the city and a clear \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sanitized zone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd established around the venue and certainly pertaining to access into and within the convention venue. 4. It seems, when looking around the vast auditorium that the majority of the audience are Saudis and people from the Middle East. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest on the situation: October has been a bad month for equities, points out Neil Wilson of Markets.com. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153US equity markets turned sharply lower as investors turned chicken to the tune of some very risk-off mood music. However with earnings growth still very strong the valuations may start to look very attractive. US markets opened down around 2%, dipping to three months lows as they followed the selloff in Europe this morning which has shown no signs of abating. It of course early in the US session to make great pronouncements and these prices are moving a lot but the general tone is not good. October is turning out to be another bad one: The S&amp;P500 is on course for worst month since Sep 2011, while Nasdaq set for its worst since 2008, the Dow its shakiest since Aug 2015. The sell-off on Wall Street is accelerating. The Nasdaq is now down 2.5%, meaning it could slide into correction territory. The Dow has been lurching around too, dragged down by Caterpillar (which has tumbled by almost 10% today). Back in the US, motorbike manufacturer Harley-Davidson has reported a slump in sales to American consumers -- just months after Donald Trump pushed for a boycott. Retail sales in the United States fell 13.3% year-on-year in the last quarter, Harley said. Back in August, the US president blasted Harley for saying it would move some production overseas. Harley is being hit hard by the tit-for-tat tariffs imposed between the US and China, and the EU. This is pushing up import costs, and making motorbikes made in America less competitive. Chief Financial Officer John Olin told shareholders that the bill would run to over $40m \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our expectations for the impact of recently enacted tariffs includes incremental costs of approximately $15 million to $20 million for steel and aluminum and approximately $25 million for EU tariffs. Additionally, China increased its tariffs volume on foreign motorcycles produced in the United States by 25 percentage points and the U.S. has increased tariffs on certain products imported from China. We believe this will increase our 2018 cost by approximately $3 million. In total we now expect to incur approximately $43 million to $48 million of increased costs related to the tariffs during 2018.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Italian government has hit back, warning that it will not change its 2019 budget despite the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demand for a rewrite. Prime minister Giuseppe Conte has told Bloomberg that his government could tweak its fiscal plans, but not aim for a smaller deficit. Conte said he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cannot accept\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd dropping some of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending plans, warning that. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any B plan. I said that the deficit at 2.4 percent of GDP is the cap. I can say this will be our cap.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Italy is planning to boost its spending next year to meet the election pledges made by its two coalition partners, the far-right anti-immigrants League party, and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement. Promises such as tax cuts, a universal basic income and pension reforms will cost around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac17bn (\u00c2\u00a315bn). That creates a larger structural deficit, which is the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concern, but Rome argues it will also spur growth. If Italy doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t revise its budget, then the EC could launch an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Excessive Deficit Procedure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd against it. That could result in a large fine, and closer scrutiny of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax and spending plans. That could also worsen relations between the two sides, potentially alarming the markets or fuelling eurosceptic feelings. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici hopes that a compromise can be found.... This is why the EC has a problem with Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tax and spending plans: Newsflash: The European Commission has rejected Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget, and demanded a rewrite. As many analysts had predicted, Brussels has concluded that the Italian tax and spending plans breach EU guidelines. It is now giving Rome three weeks to submit a revised plan, with a smaller deficit for next year. This is the first time the Commission has rejected a member state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget, since being given the power during the eurozone crisis. Commission Vice President for the Euro Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters in Brussels that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today, for the first time, the Commission is obliged to request a euro area country to revise its draft budget plan,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we see no alternative than to request the Italian government to do so. We have adopted an opinion giving Italy a maximum of three weeks to provide a revised Draft Budgetary Plan for 2019. Dombrovskis added that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clarifications\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd submitted by Italy yesterday had not addressed the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Italian Government is openly and consciously going against the commitments it made. Boom! Global stock markets have slumped to their lowest level in over a year. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses in America, Europe and Asia have dragged the MSCI All-Country World Index to levels last seen in September 2017. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, says Caterpillar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results have added to the swirling cocktail of risks pulling shares down today. Caterpillar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third quarter earnings beat forecasts with progress across most end markets. But the tone of the report made clear earnings momentum was not the main story in the quarter. The impression was compounded by 2018 earnings forecasts remaining untouched, for the first time since two straight quarterly upgrades. Technology companies and banks are leading today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off in New York, as October continues to prove a volatile month. Ouch! The New York stock exchange has opened sharply lower. The Dow Jones industrial average fell by 430 points at the start of trading, a drop of 1.7%. That took the index back down to around 24,890 points -- around 2,000 points less than three weeks ago. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a grotty picture; Caterpillar has tanked by over 7%, after warning shareholders today that price pressures are rising, as tariffs take a bite out of profits. The S&amp;P 500 has dropped to its lowest level since July. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the drop in UK factory orders: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some cheerier news, as the Harry Potter phenomenon continues to boost Bloomsbury: A reminder of the big sell-off in Asia overnight: European stock markets are still deep in the red, as traders grimace and anticipate the start of trading in New York. In London, the FTSE 100 is now down 77 points at 6965, a drop of 1.1%, which would be its lowest closing point in seven months. This won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help investor confidence to claw its way back from the lows reported earlier. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stoxx 600 is still languishing at a 22-month low, with Germany down 1.8% and Italy losing 1.1%. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, blames renewed anxiety over China - which triggered the selloff in Asia overnight. Hopes that we may see a Chinese-led recovery have been dashed for the time being. After a strong two-day rally, Chinese stocks fell back sharply overnight [-2.2%]. As a result, the losses for European indices sharply increased at the open this morning while US index futures also fell across the board. Chinese equities, which had been hit the hardest this year, rebounded at the end of last week and start of this in part because of the Chinese government promising to provide more stimulus to stabilize its economy and offset the impact of US tariffs hurting its exports. In addition, there was some speculation that the US and China were going to put aside their trade spat and come to an agreement of some sort at the G20 meeting in Argentina next month, where US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were likely to meet. However, those hopes were dashed when White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow accused China of doing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nothing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to defuse the trade tensions. Marketwatch says Caterpillar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prediction of further rising prices (partly thanks to tariffs) has spooked investors: Though Caterpillar narrowly beat expectations for profit and warnings in the quarter, the outlook for more rising costs spooked investors. Caterpillar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares fell 5.9% in premarket trading on Tuesday. Caterpillar said it would raise prices 1% to 4% world-wide next year on most machines and engines to offset some of the higher costs. Other manufacturers have also said they are passing on higher costs by raising prices. Defence group Lockheed Martin may have bucked the gloom, by posting strong results and hiking its sales forecast for the rest of the year. Increased demand for its F-35 fighter plane helped to drive Lockheed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net sales up to $14.3bn in the last quarter, up from $12.3bn a year earlier. Earnings per share jumped to $5.14, up from $3.32 12 months ago. Lockheed Martin chairman, president and chief executive Marillyn Hewson says: Our team achieved another quarter of strong growth leading us to improve our expectations for our full-year financial results.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hold onto your hats! The Dow is now expected to tumble by 400 points, or more than 1.5%, at the open - partly due to those results from Caterpillar and 3M. In another blow, US conglomerate 3M has also posted underwhelming results. The group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial sales were flat in the last quarter, while healthcare sales fell 2.8%, consumer sales fell 3.4% and electronics and energy dropped by 4.8%. However, total sales grew 7.0 percent in Safety and Graphics. 3M also trimmed its earnings outlook for 2018. Shares have slumped by over 7%. Caterpillar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results also show that consumers are paying the price of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade disputes: NEWSFLASH: Caterpillar, the construction equipment giant, has just reported results -- and Wall Street isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy. Caterpillar has warned that it is facing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153supply chain challenges across the industry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Raw material costs have also jumped, it warns, partly due to increased steel prices and other tariffs introduced since Donald Trump was elected. It says: Manufacturing costs were higher due to increased material and freight costs. Material costs were higher primarily due to increases in steel prices and tariffs. Freight costs were unfavorable primarily due to supply chain inefficiencies as the industry continues to respond to strong global demand. Caterpillar says that recently imposed tariffs cost it around $40m in the last quarter, a concrete sign that the trade war is hurting US companies. On the upside, Caterpillar narrowly beat profit expectations in the last three months. It made $2.88 per share, ahead of forecasts of $2.72, while revenues jumped by 18% year-on-year to $13.5bn. Caterpillar CEO Jim Umpleby says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was the best third-quarter profit per share in our company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history. Our global team continues to do excellent work focusing on our customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 success and executing our strategy for profitable growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares have fallen by over 6% in pre-market trading. In further gloomy news, UK manufacturers have reported the sharp fall in orders since the EU referendum. The CBI, which represents Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bosses, reports that new orders at UK factories fell at the fastest pace in three years in the last quarter. Firms are also more pessimistic about business prospect, particularly about their chances of selling goods abroad. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a sobering set of figures demanding immediate action at home and abroad. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Planned investment is being scaled back in the face of deepening Brexit uncertainty, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vital that the Chancellor incentivises manufacturers to spend in areas that will help them become more productive. Using the upcoming Budget to increase the Annual Investment Allowance, alongside a wider review, could help the UK become more competitive with its global peers. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details from the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial trends report: 10% of firms said they were more optimistic about the general business situation than three months ago and 25% were less optimistic, giving a rounded balance of -16%, the fastest decline since July 2016. Optimism about export prospects for the year ahead deteriorated at the fastest pace since 2012 (-15% down from -2% in July). 27% of firms said the volume of output over the past three months was up and 14% said it was down, giving a balance of +13%, up from +11% in the quarter to September. 21% of businesses reported an increase in new orders, and 28% reported a decrease, giving a rounded balance of -6%, the weakest balance since October 2015. Domestic orders (-10%) and export orders both fell (-8%), a weaker reading than in the previous quarter (+8% and +21% respectively). No wonder the FTSE 100 is falling. UK investor morale has hit its lowest level in at least 23 years, according to financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown. Its Investor Confidence Index has fallen to 53 this month, from 58 in October - its lowest level since it began in 1993. It has averaged 92 over the last decade, but just 69 over the last 12 months. Brexit is the top issue worrying investors, while wider global instability is another concern pushing the index down: If this index is right, it means the City is more downbeat than during the 2008 financial crisis. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says the constant drip-feed of Brexit news has drenched investors in gloom: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcInvestors are in grim mood, as time is running out on Brexit negotiations with little progress on show. Sentiment was dented by the financial crisis, but not to the extent we are seeing today. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perhaps because the crisis unfolded in an unscheduled fashion, while the timeline on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the EU is there for all to see. A looming early Budget and a stormy October on the markets will do little to settle nerves. These are challenging times for investors who are faced with a significant known unknown in the form of Brexit. In such circumstances, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth falling back on the basics of investing. That means taking a long term perspective, keeping diversified, and drip feeding money into the markets to take advantage of any dips.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Over in Ankara, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president has told its parliament that the murder of Jamal Khashoggi was a premeditated and meticulously planned political assassination. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an vowed to pursue the investigation into Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death, calling on Riyadh to hand over those responsible. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a link to our liveblog. Importantly, Erdo\u00c4\u0178an appeared to absolve the Saudi leader while not mentioning crown prince Mohammad Bin Salman, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I do not doubt the sincerity of King Salman. That being said, independent investigation needs to be carried out. This is a political killing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Erdo\u00c4\u0178an did not release any significant new details about the killing. So the Saudi stock market has shaken off its early slump, and is now up on the day. Here are the best and worst performers on the FTSE 100 today, as the index wallows at a seven-month low. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has slid to a new seven-month low, as world stock markets extend today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. The Footsie is now down 82 points at 6,959, its lowest level since the end of March this year. The smaller FTSE 250, which contains medium-sized companies, has slumped by 1.8% or 350 points.. The slump is being led by technology stocks, miners, energy firms and industrial companies. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx blames a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153poisonous brewing cauldron of geopolitical and economic issues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [which sounds even scarier than this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthick blanket of risk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122] Ingredients bobbing in the cauldron include.... The unresolved US-China trade war (and fears about the latter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy), the US withdrawal from the INF Treaty, the Khasohoggi-related friction between the West and Saudi Arabia, Brexit (all of it, but specifically the rising chances of a no deal divorce), and, perhaps most pertinent to Tuesday, the ongoing EU-Italy budget dispute. A calamitous cavalcade of market concerns, of such seriousness that it is a surprise the global indices ever manage to edge into the green. The futures market is indicating a bad start on Wall Street later today. The Dow is now expected to drop by over 1%. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology company Dyson has decided to build its first electric car in Singapore. The company has chosen Singapore over the UK, as it prepares to get the vehicle on the road in 2021. The electric car is being designed and tested at Hullavington Airfield in Wiltshire, in western England, but will be manufactured almost 7,000 miles away. Dyson says it chose Singapore due to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153international nature\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of its operations. It already employs around 1,100 people in Singapore, where it makes electric motors. Jim Rowan, CEO of Dyson says: Our existing footprint and team in Singapore, combined with the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significant advanced manufacturing expertise, made it a frontrunner. Singapore also offers access to high-growth markets as well as an extensive supply chain and a highly skilled workforce. Singapore has a comparatively high cost base, but also great technology expertise and focus. It is therefore the right place to make high quality technology loaded machines, and the right place to make our electric vehicle. Fifteen years ago, Dyson was criticised for moving washing machines production from Wiltshire to Malaysia. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision feels like another blow to UK manufacturing. Dyson, though, points out that its total UK headcount has increased by 2.5 times over the last five years to 4,800. It is currently spending \u00c2\u00a3200m on new buildings and testing facilities at Hullavington. In a letter to staff, Rowan says: Dyson is truly global in its development, delivery and realisation of technology. This decision is good news for the exceptional teams we have in both the UK and Singapore. Saudi Arabia still expects to sign tens of billions of dollar of deals at its investment conference, despite those high-profile withdrawals following Jamal Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death. Reuters explains: Saudi Arabia brushed off an outcry over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and went ahead on Tuesday with an investment conference boycotted by Western political figures, leading international bankers and company executives. Speaking at the opening session, prominent Saudi businesswoman Lubna Olayan said the killing of the Washington Post columnist was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153alien to our culture\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and voiced confidence that the kingdom will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153emerge stronger\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Saudi Arabia, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest oil exporter, is expected to sign deals worth more than $50 billion in the oil, gas, industries and infrastructure sectors on the opening day with companies including Trafigura, Total, Hyundai, Norinco, Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes. Hundreds of bankers and company executives joined officials at a palatial Riyadh hotel for the Future Investment Initiative, an annual event designed to help attract billions of dollars of foreign capital as part of reforms to end Saudi dependence on oil exports. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re live-blogging president Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Jamal Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death, here: WSJ reporter Rory Jones says the Saudi investment conference is underway - despite scores of big names pulling out. My colleague Rob Davies points out that a string of big names have resisted the chance to mix with crown prince MbS: The high-profile pull-outs from the FII include JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jamie Dimon, the head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, Glencore chairman Tony Hayward and many more \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boss, Dara Khosrowshahi, despite the PIF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $3.5bn investment in his company. Separately, Richard Branson has suspended the Gulf state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $1bn investment in his space project, Virgin Galactic. Rarely have so many business leaders been seen running in the same direction, in this case away from Saudi Arabia at speed. All of this deals considerable damage to the public profile of a man who was meant to be the standard-bearer for reform and modernisation. When MBS was in California on his tour, he hired out most of the Four Seasons hotel in Beverly Hills, enjoying lunches with Rupert Murdoch, rubbing shoulders in Silicon Valley with the likes of Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg and schmoozing film stars. Plenty of other executives have shown up, though: In another blow to Saudi Arabia, Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son has abandoned plans to speak at its Future Investment Initiative (FII), which started today. Michael Amon of the Wall Street Journal reports that Son may still be present, but he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be on the stage. Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has also dropped in early trading, down 1.2%. Traders will be worrying about Riyadh growing isolation following Jamal Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s murder, and the prospect of Turkey releasing the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153naked truth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the killing later today. Yesterday Donald Trump said he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy with the response from Saudi Arabia, telling reporters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am not satisfied with what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to get to the bottom of it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury secretary, Stephen Mnuchin, has cancelled his appearance at Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment conference - but he did met with crown prince Mohammed bin Salman yesterday. MBS - who had billed himself as a social and economic reformer - had built close ties with Washington, particularly with Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Now, though, he facing intense pressure over the Khashoggi case, with many analysts concluding that he authorised the killing. Several of his close aides have been arrested or dismissed. Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman, Tony Sayegh, has tweeted about the meeting: Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets points out that the US stock market fell yesterday, helping to trigger today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses in Asia and now Europe. The negative opens come after Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally cooled, retracing Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jump amid fresh fears about global trade, geopolitical tensions and the US midterm elections. Wall Street added to downbeat sentiment with banks and financials leading the slide as worries mount over the strength of earnings from the remainder of corporates set to report. Boom! As feared, European stock markets have slumped to their lowest point in almost two years. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX dropped 1.35% in early trading, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX both lost 1%, and Italy has shed 0.8%. This has hauled the Euro Stoxx 600 index down to its lowest point since December 2016. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets fears it will be a tough day, possibly dominated by worries about Italy. Geopolitical tensions, Italian budget woes and the ongoing standoff between the European Commission and Italy are making investors nervous. Given that there is no solution about the trade war between the US and China stand is making things a bit more arduous today. We need to have a solution to the Italian budget. Investors are going to keep a close eye on the European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision today about the Italian budget. The commission may end up doing something which is unprecedented- it may ask Italy to revise and resubmit its budget. It is widely expected that the commission is going to have a negative opinion about the budget, but the question is if Italy will be ready to comply with the request? The Italian banking sector could be the primary trade here because if the Italian bond spread touched the 400 basis points, it is going to create a lot of trouble for the sector. The bond spread has already touched a five-year high of 341 basis points on Friday. Ouch. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip stock index has fallen close to an eight-month low at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 is down 51 points, or 0.8%, at 6991, close to its lowest level since April Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff has pushed stocks across Asia to the brink of a bear market (more than 20 percent off their recent highs. MSCI Asia Pacific Index has dropped to its lowest since May 2017, with losses across the region. Bloomberg has the details: Among the steepest decreases were in Japan, Hong Kong and China, where shares had had the biggest jump in more than two years Monday. Global equities as measured by the MSCI World Index face their worst month since August 2015. S&amp;P 500 Index futures declined 1% and Euro Stoxx 50 contracts opened more than 1% lower, indicating the rout will spread to U.S. and European markets. The yen gained and gold ticked higher. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Pessimism is gripping the global markets this morning, as investors fret about a clutch of economic and geopolitical issues. The budget row between Italy and the EU, Brexit, the brutal killing of Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi, and America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces nuclear treaty with Russia are all creating angst on the trading floors today. The lack of progress in the US-China trade dispute isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helping either. Asian markets have already been hit, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Topix index sliding by 2.6% and Hong Kong losing 3%. China, which surged by over 4% yesterday on hopes of a government stimulus, has handed back half those gains today. Markets remain shrouded in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a thick blanket of risk today\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as investors fear shares could take a tumble, says Stephen Innes, head of Asia-Pacific trading for foreign exchange firm OANDA. The US dollar outperformed on Monday on the back of Italy and Brexit risk while the mere utterance of a protracted equity correction remains a highly sensitive topic that investors fear could morph from a wall of worry into a towering wall of pain. Risk aversion continues to permeate every pocket of the markets whether triggered by President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest tweets on immigration or the blustery headwinds from Riyadh to Rome; markets remain shrouded in a thick blanket of risk. European market are expected to take a jolt when trading begins shortly. Traders will be watching to see if Brussels orders Rome to rewrite its 2019 budget, which currently contains a deficit target of 2.4% of GDP. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is due to release more details about Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death in the Saudi consulate at Istanbul, in a speech later today. With international condemnation mounting, Saudi have now called the killing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tremendous mistake\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and launched an investigation. Riyadh is also pushing on with a major investment summit, starting today, but many business leaders have already pulled out. IG predict that the FTSE 100 will drop close to a seven-month low, while European markets could hit levels last seen in late 2016.

                "bodyText":"Time to wrap up: The US stock market has suffered another day of big losses, as investors worry about the state of the economy, trade wars, and possible interest rate rises. The Dow shed more than 600 points, wiping out all its gains for 2018, while the Nasdaq dropped into a correction. Analysts warned that further losses are possible, as fear grips the markets. Manufacturers warned that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade wars are pushing up their costs. Tariffs are making raw materials and imports more expensive, eating into profits. However two companies - Boeing and Tesla - bucked the trend with forecast-beating results. European companies have suffered a worrying slowdown in growth this month. Trade wars may be to blame here too, with manufacturers suffering a drop in orders. Brexit angst is weighing on the pound. Sterling fell to a seven week low, below $1.29, as Theresa May struggles to reach an agreement on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transition deal. Goodnight! Tesla has addressed a lot of criticism with its results tonight, says Alan Boyle of Geekwire. He writes: Tesla shares jumped more than 10 percent in after-hours trading today after the controversial electric-car company posted a surprisingly positive quarterly report, including a profit rather than a loss. Adjusted net income for the third quarter amounted to $312 million, which translated into earnings of $2.90 a share. Analysts had expected a loss of around 19 cents per share. Total revenue hit $6.8 billion, exceeding expectations of $6.3 billion. And Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cash on hand increased by $731 million, even though Tesla repaid $82.5 million in bonds during the quarter. That cash position could take some of the pressure off Tesla, which had been burning through its reserves by the billions during what CEO Elon Musk called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153production hell\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Model 3 electric car. Analysts had worried that Tesla would have to borrow more money to stay afloat. But Tesla said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153our cash position should remain at least flat in spite of our plan to repay $230 million of convertible notes in cash\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd during the current quarter. Shares in Tesla have surged 12% in after-hours trading. Investors are scrambling to grab a stake in the company following its surprise move to profitability. Amid the gloom tonight, electric car company Tesla has stunned the markets with much better results than expected. Elon Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s company made a profit of $312m in the last quarter, surprising analysts who expected another loss. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its first profit in two years. Revenues hit a record, at $6.82 billion, beating expectations of $6.33bn. After a long struggle to meet production targets for its Model 3, and Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well-known run-ins with regulators, has Tesla finally turned the corner? Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, believes it has. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Production numbers earlier this month meant we already knew Tesla could churn out the cars, the question was whether it could it do it profitably, and even more importantly, could Musk wean the company off a constant flow of cash from investors. To say Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s answer is emphatic is an understatement. Gross margins on the Model 3 are above even the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own lofty expectations and its position as the 5th most popular car by volume in the US suggests it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drawing in a wide range of customers despite its comparatively high price point. Drivers will pay more for Musk it would seem. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important because the premium end alone won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deliver the impressive growth Tesla needs in the coming years to justify its premium valuation. Normally we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d tell investors to avoid reading too deeply into a single quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers, but this quarter really counted at Tesla. Reading deeply is something of pleasure today.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a scent of fear in the air in the markets tonight, according to Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. Zaccarelli says (via Reuters) that there may be more turmoil ahead: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At this point it seems selling is begetting selling. The VIX [volatility index] has doubled in the last couple of weeks. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit more fear in the air and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing the acceleration of growth to value. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It looks like more panic and fear as the selling has continued to roll.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now Marketwatch sums up today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wall Street wobble: Stocks ended sharply lower Wednesday, as losses accelerated into the close and put both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 into the red for the year, and the Nasdaq into correction territory. Upbeat results from Boeing Co. were credited with briefly pushing the Dow higher in early morning trading, before investors took an increasingly defensive stance, fleeing for the relative safety of utilities and consumer nondurable shares. Another day, another big loss on Wall Street! The Dow Jones industrial average managed to lose 608 points by the close, meaning it has lost all its gains for 2018. It closed 2.4% lower at 24,583. Technology shares, such as Microsoft (-5%) and Intel (-4.6%), fell sharply, while construction equipment group Caterpillar shed another 5.8%. In another blow, the Nasdaq index slumped by over 4%, putting it into correction territory (more than 10% off its recent high). Investors seem to again be gripped by worries about global trade, geopolitical tensions, and the state of the US economy -- with new home sales slowing, and manufacturers warning that cost pressure are going up. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s row with the Federal Reserve over future interest rate rises, and the ongoing Brexit deadlock, can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have helped the mood either. Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies and solutions at Voya Investment Management in New York, explained: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big global risk-off trade. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had some headwinds, higher interest rates affecting housing, tariffs causing input costs for manufacturers to go up, which makes earnings look not as stellar ... but that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean the whole economy is rolling over,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Those weak home sales figures haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped the mood in New York. The Dow is having another down day, currently off 221 points (-0.9%) at 24,969. Fiona Cincotta of City Index sees nervousness on the trading floors: Despite clawing back heavy losses on turnaround Tuesday, Wall Street has once again opened on the back foot. With a long list of risk factors, including Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing tensions with Brussels, Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increased isolation over Jamal Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s killing, global growth worries and some earnings disappointments investors are struggling to find reasons to buy in. The Federal Reserve may ignore Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complaints, but they should heed the latest US housing data. New home sales fell to an annual rate of just 553,000 in September, 13.2% less than a year ago, and the weakest rate since December 2016. That could suggest the housing market is cooling - perhaps in response to recent Fed rate hikes which have made borrowing more expensive. A late sell-off has sent most European markets into the red tonight. At the close of trading, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX was down 0.7% while the French CAC shed 0.3%. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker than expected PMI reports rather dampened the mood (and the Euro!) Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB had yet another bad day, losing 1.7% as the clash with Brussels over its 2019 budget rages. Markets had been higher this morning, but it seems that investors didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trust the recovery - especially with so many risks (Italy, Brexit, Saudi Arabia) to think about. In London, the FTSE 100 has closed 7 points higher, as the weaker pound propped up shares. Some snap reaction: The Bank of Canada has hiked borrowing costs, taking its benchmark interest rate up to 1.75%, from 1.5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largely as expected, but shows that the Federal Reserve isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only central bank moving away from crisis-era policies. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies are still growing, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also facing tough price pressures. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest healthcheck from data firm Markit, just released. It shows US output growth hitting a three-month high, encouraging firms to take on more staff. However, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also having to pay more for raw materials, and imports, as Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade wars kick in. Chris Williamson of Markit explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The domestic economy remained the main driver of demand, with exports stagnating amid growing signs of trade being subdued by tariffs. Tariffs also drove a further marked rise in prices, exacerbating an upward trend in price pressures borne out of robust domestic demand. Just in: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel industry has been hit by a surge in imports from overseas. The steel tariffs imposed by Donald Trump seem to have had a knock-on effect, with metals that was destined for America ending up in Europe instead. According to European steel association Euroferi, imports from Turkey have increased by 57% this year, while those from Russia are up 56%. Trump impose a 50% tariff on Turkish steel, as part of a diplomatic row with Ankara, making it very uncompetitive. That had a knock-on effect on Russia, which sells a chunk of its steel to Turkey (which is now swimming in the stuff). Ding ding goes the opening bell in New York....and the markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t doing very much. The Dow has risen by 0.3%, or 71 points, to 25,262 in early trading, with Boeing gaining 3%. European stock markets are pushing higher, as Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent results brings some cheer to the trading floors. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is up 80-odd points, recovering yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses, and the other indices are also looking healthier. By hiking its profit forecasts, Boeing has brought some confidence that corporate earnings - and economic growth - is holding up well. European multinational companies are also getting a currency boost. With the euro and pound dropping against the dollar today, their overseas earnings are more valuable. Abi Oladimeji, Chief Investment Officer at Thomas Miller Investment, thinks investors should be cautious, though: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The current double-digit pace of earnings growth (expected to be circa 20% in Q3) is clearly unsustainable and this will create a headwind in the months ahead. For this reason, as well as the ongoing elevated levels of political and policy uncertainty in key regions of the world, we retain a cautious outlook on equities for now and await better opportunities to add to holdings. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 take on Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong results today. Boeing topped analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts for quarterly profit on Wednesday and raised its forecasts for annual profit as it continued to benefit from a boom in global air travel and demand for airplanes. Shares of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest planemaker were up 3.1 percent at $361 in premarket trading, helping brighten the mood on Wall Street after a handful of shaky results outlooks on Tuesday from U.S. manufacturers hurt by concerns over global trade. Soaring demand from commercial airlines has driven another surge in revenues for Boeing over the past year, pushing shares in the company up by roughly a third over the past 12 months. Those moves have been dented somewhat by a combination of the trade worries, this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greater market volatility and a series of recurring charges for its KC-46 tanker program. More here. (Sonic) Boom! Aircraft maker Boeing has posted strong results and raised its forecast for earnings this year. In a boost to morale on Wall Street, Boeing posted earnings of $3.58 per share, beating forecasts of $3.47 per share. With plane sales looking robust, the company now expects to make $14.90-$15.10 per share this financial year, up from $14.30-$14.50 per share. This optimism has sent Boeing shares up by 4% in pre-market trading. That might be enough to push the Dow higher at the open, in an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness today is partly because the dollar is strengthening against a basket of currencies. The dollar index has hit a nine-week high today, as the greenback rallied across the board. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spot a particular reason why. But it may suggest investors expect the Federal Reserve will ignore Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest attack on Jay Powell, and raise interest rates in December. Newsflash: The pound has hit a new six-week low, as Brexit anxiety swirls to new heights. Sterling has fallen by three quarters of a cent today to $1.291, its weakest point since 10th September. The sell-off comes as Theresa May struggles to reach an agreement on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transition deal. Yesterday, she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the whole cabinet onside, making traders wonder how she will get an agreement through parliament. My colleague Dan Sabbagh explains: No 10 sources conceded that the discussion, which came a day before the prime minister was due to plead for support from Tory MPs at a meeting of the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1922 Committee, was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153impassioned\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Others characterised it as a row. A group of ministers, including Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary; Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury; and Michael Gove, the agriculture secretary, were among half a dozen who emphasised their concern over imposing a time limit on any backstop, which is designed to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. Later today, the PM will meet with Conservative MPs to plead for their support. That could be another stormy session, after some anonymous MPs unpleasantly told the Sunday papers that she should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bring her own noose\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the 1922 committee meeting. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Audit Office (the government watchdog) has piled more pressure on, saying a no-deal Brexit could undermine security at the UK border and increase delays. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest attack on Fed chair Jerome Powell hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cheered Wall Street. The New York stock exchange is expected to open lower in a few hours, with the Dow called down 0.8%. European stock markets are actually up this morning, with the FTSE 100 gaining 50 points or 0.7%. Craig Erlam of foreign exchange firm OANDA says there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a huge amount of anxiety in the markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd today, partly due to anxiety over US interest rate hikes. The US has been late to the game when it comes to the stock market sell-off, having been sheltered by last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re wasting no time in playing catch-up, with the S&amp;P and Dow both fast closing in on 10% declines from the peak in a matter of weeks, while the Nasdaq has already ticked that box. Trump has been quick to point the finger of blame at the Fed, with the President desperately not wanting to be associated with a stock market sell-off in the run up to the mid-term elections. Especially when he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spent the last two years taking credit for the colossal gains. Rising interest rates has clearly been a factor in the loss of confidence in the stock market in recent weeks, with trade wars, Brexit, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget issues and the Khashoggi murder also being important contributing factors. Some good jobs news amid the gloom: car rental chain Enterprise are taking on 800 new graduate trainees. The roles are scattered across Enterprise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 470 branches across the UK. Do well, and you could be assistant manager within a year, they say. More details here. Back in the UK, new mortgage approvals have fallen to a six-month low. Industry figures show that 38,505 home loans were approved in September, down from 39,241 in August, and 6.7% less than a year ago. This may show that the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise, in August, has chilled the housing market. UK Finance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director of personal finance, Eric Leenders, suggests people raced to get new mortgages before the BoE rate hike: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The mortgage market softened slightly in September, following strong remortgaging activity in the months preceding the recent base rate rise.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit uncertainty may be another factor, of course. As Stephen Pegge, UK Finance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director for commercial finance, puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Economic uncertainty continues to impact on businesses\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 appetite for finance as overall lending remains slightly below the same period last year. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak eurozone PMI report has hurt the euro. The euro has fallen by half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.141, as investors fear that the eurozone is weakening. If so, it could make it harder for the European Central Bank to normalise monetary policy and raise interest rates above their record low of zero (a level Donald Trump can only dream of....) Mike Dolan of Reuters shows how German firms are particularly downbeat, according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI report. Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics says European carmakers are struggling to meet new tougher emissions rules (which has also hurt car sales recently). Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Williamson fears the eurozone economy could be heading for choppier waters: Newsflash: Eurozone corporate growth is stumbling this month, as tariffs and trade wars hit economic demand. Data firm Markit reports that business growth is the slowest for over two years, while optimism has hit a four-year low in October. Firms reported a slowdown in exports, particularly in manufacturing, where new export orders for goods decreased for the first time since June 2013. This has pulled Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Flash Eurozone PMI Composite Output Index down to 52.7, a 25 month low, down from 54.1 in September. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Germany, the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy, was hit particularly hard. Factory output rose by the smallest in almost four years, while service sector growth was the slowest since May. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says the eurozone appears to be slowing as the economic outlook darkens. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The pace of Eurozone economic growth slipped markedly lower in October, with the PMI setting the scene for a disappointing end to the year. The survey is indicative of GDP growth waning to 0.3% in the fourth quarter, and forward-looking indicators, such as measures of future expectations and new business inflows, suggest further momentum could be lost in coming months. The slowdown is being led by a drop in exports, linked in turn by many survey respondents to trade wars and tariffs, which appears to have darkened the global economic environment and led to increased risk aversion. It is therefore not surprising to see the slowdown broadening out across the economy, hitting the service sector. Paul Donovan of UBS isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by this latest attack on the Federal Reserve. He told clients that the real risk comes from trade wars or excessive tax cuts, not monetary policy. US President Trump has suggested the Fed is the greatest threat to the US economy. An economist would suggest recessions arise from overheating (caused by deficit financed tax cuts, perhaps), or policy error (disrupting supply chains on which an economy depends, perhaps). Zero real rates with full employment are probably not a (restrictive) policy error. The big question is whether Donald Trump could reprise his days on The Apprentice, and tell Jerome Powell that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re fired\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And the answer? Probably not. The Federal Reserve Act only permits the President to remove a Governor \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for cause\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and no chairman has ever been fired. But we live in interesting times. Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada says you can hardly sack a Fed chair for raising borrowing costs. Overnight Trump stepped up criticism of Powell, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153every time we do something great, he raises the interest rates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that it is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153biggest risk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the US economy, despite this being the slowest ever Fed tightening cycle. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t answer what would make him try and replace the Fed chair. By law he can only fire governors \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for cause\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and raising interest rates can hardly be considered a cause \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whether Congress would stop him perhaps depends on whether Democrats manage to take the house. David Madden of CMC Markets points out that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent tax cuts are also putting pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates: President Trump attacked Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, for hiking interest rates. Mr Trump is ignoring the fact that his tax cuts helped spur on US economic growth, which warrant higher rates. I fear Donald Trump is on shaky ground when he complains that the Fed blessed president Obama with record low interest rates, but hiked on his watch. When Obama took office, America had fallen into a deep recession as the financial crisis raged. This forced the Fed to slash borrowing costs to stimulate growth. Today, the US economy is running at its fastest pace since 2014 - something Trump isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bashful about taking credit for. US inflation hit 2.7% in August, over the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target, and policymakers fear that rising prices could get out of hand, unless borrowing costs rise. As CNN puts it: Obama took office after the Great Recession began in December 2007. The Federal Reserve at that time put historically low interest rates in place, and took other measures besides, in an effort to inject money into the faltering economy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Donald Trump may want to Make America Great Again, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also showing a talent for making the markets nervous. Overnight, the president has launched a new barrage at America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, accusing it of being too trigger-happy when raising US interest rates. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump intensified his criticism of the Federal Reserve and its chairman Jerome Powell, for hiking borrowing costs. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all terribly unfair, the president griped, saying: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just saying this: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very unhappy with the Fed because Obama had zero interest rates. Every time we do something great, he raises the interest rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In another jibe, the president added that Powell \u00e2\u20ac\u0153almost looks like he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happy raising interest rates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, even though it could threaten EU economic growth. And when asked if he regretted making Powell America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker last year, Trump replied: Too early to tell, but maybe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd These comments are totally at odds with the principle of central bank independence. The Fed is meant to be free to change monetary policy to manage inflation and employment without worrying about a blast from the White House. So far this year the Fed has raised interest rates three times; Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attacks sound like an attempt to ward off a fourth hike in December. Reaction to follow... Also coming up today Stocks may be volatile again today, as October continues to be a testing time for investors. Asia-Pacific markets have risen today after Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting Europe to open higher - after the FTSE 100 hit a seven-month low last night. Italy will be in focus, after being given three weeks to resubmit its 2019 budget for EU approval. Rome insists there is no Plan B, though, so further clashes seem inevitable. Traders will also be watching for a new healthcheck on the eurozone economy, the latest UK mortgage figures, plus a likely interest rate hike by the Bank of Canada.

                "bodyText":"Shares in Asia Pacific have plunged into bear market territory and wiped billions off the values of companies as one analyst warned that the losses could be a harbinger of a wholesale \u00e2\u20ac\u0153capitulation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. After the worst day for tech stocks on Wall Street for seven years, markets were in retreat from Sydney to Shanghai as concerns about the global economy and rising borrowing costs were compounded by local factors. In Australia the benchmark ASX200 closed down 164 points or 2.8% as it suffered its fifth straight day of losses. In Japan the Nikkei was off 3.2% and has now dropped around 13% from a 27-year peak of 24,448.07 touched in early October. A broad indicator of shares in the region \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the MSCI Asia Pacific index \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has now fallen 20.3% from the year-to-date high set on 29 January, representing an official bear market. The Vix \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fear\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd index, which measures volatility across the market, has spiked sharply this week and was up 21% overnight. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t thought that selling would be this steep. This sell-off makes us think the market may be set for capitulation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Shoji Hirakawa, chief global strategist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center. The contagion spread into the European trading session. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 fell to a seven-month low in early trading, down over 70 points at 6885. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What makes the latest volatility more troubling is that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been difficult to identify one specific cause,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Kerry Craig, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, adding: There are many symptoms but no one can diagnose the illness. Geopolitics, rising bond U.S. bond yields, a more hawkish looking U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed), slowing Chinese growth, a strong U.S. dollar and the already well known problems in some emerging economies have all contributed to the market unease. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank decided it had seen enough and intervened for the fifth day running by injecting 100bn yuan ($14bn) into open market operations. It brings the total for the past five days to 540bn yuan, or $77bn and aims to head off a liquidity squeeze. Chinese stock markets have struggled under the weight of a slowdown in the economy and fears about US tariffs on Chinese goods. The Shanghai Composite index slumped 2.5% in the first minutes of trade before paring losses to 1.3%. In Hong Kong the market was off 1.8%. The gloomy mood was spread across the region, with South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market entering a bear market after growth in the third quarter came in at a lower-than-expected 2%. The export-driven economy is seen as a good indicator of the health of global trade so the poor figures saw stocks on the Kospi index fall 2.4%. The US dollar continued to gain strength heaping pressure on sterling, which fell to $1.289, the euro (down slightly at $1.14) and the Australian dollar which was buying US70.7c. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fear is palpable in stock markets at the moment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greg McKenna, an independent markets strategist in Australia, said on Thursday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This could get much worse before it gets better. Collapses happen after falls. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the danger.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nervous selloff comes after US stocks fell overnight, where a rout in technology stocks saw the largest daily decline on the Nasdaq since 2011. The falls confirmed a correction for the Nasdaq and erased the Dow and S&amp;P 500\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains for the year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Weak US housing data, mixed corporate earnings results, trade war fears and concerns regarding a slowing global economy all contributed to the sell-off,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sydney-based Rivkin Securities said on Thursday. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sector was one of the worst hit. The embattled wealth management firm AMP was the worst performer on the market as its shares fell nearly 25%. Energy, resources and technology stocks were also affected as the dive continued the ASX\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst month in more than three years. The market is now down more than 8% for October \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and 10% since August \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning it is officially in correction territory.

                "bodyText":"Disgraced wealth manager AMP has endured one of its worst days in its 169-year history, with its share price haemorrhaging as investors desert it in droves in the wake of the banking royal commission. The once-proud insurer, which opened its doors in 1849, lost nearly a quarter of the value of its stock on Thursday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c plummeting 24.47% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after it revealed investors had shifted $1.5bn out of its wealth management business in the September quarter alone, and announced plans to sell its life insurance arm. The torrid losses for AMP came amid a world-wide selloff on Thursday, with shares in the Asia Pacific plunging into bear market territory, wiping billions off the values of companies, after a rout in technology shares saw the largest daily decline on the Nasdaq in the United States since 2011. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark ASX 200 index suffered its fifth straight day of losses, closing down 164.9 points or 2.8%, ensuring all its gains from the past 12 months were erased. Concerns about rising US borrowing costs and a slackening in global growth have fueled the selloff but Nick Twidale, chief operating officer for Rakuten Securities in Australia, said the situation could get worse before it gets better. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Until we see something tangible to change investor sentiment then I think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got more downside coming for global stock markets, growth expectations and risk assets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said But AMP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continuing annus horribilis took the spotlight, sparked by an admission of how damaging the banking royal commission has been for its reputation. It told the stock exchange its wealth management business saw net cash outflows of $1.5bn between July and September, up from $243m in the corresponding period last year, due to weaker inflows and elevated levels of outflows in part \u00e2\u20ac\u0153following AMP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearances at the royal commission\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. AMP executives endured a series of humiliations at the commission hearings this year, including revelations that AMP charged fees for no service and levied fees on customers who had already died. It also saw the departure of chair Catherine Brenner, chief executive Craig Meller and three directors. Acting chief executive Mike Wilkins said it appeared clients were moving their money into industry super funds. By 4pm the shares were changing hands for $2.50, a fall of 24.47%, which is huge for an $8bn company. AMP also said it had decided to divest its Australian and New Zealand wealth protection and mature businesses, via a sale to Resolution Life, for total proceeds of $3.3bn. It also intended to divest its New Zealand wealth management and advice businesses via initial public offering (IPO) in 2019, subject to market conditions and regulatory approval. It said the exit from Australian and New Zealand wealth protection would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significantly simplify\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd AMP and allow it to concentrate on its higher growth businesses of wealth management, AMP Capital and AMP Bank. The horrors on the stock market came as Fitch ratings agency affirmed Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s triple A credit rating with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd outlook. The agency said Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rating was underpinned by an effective policymaking framework that had supported 27 consecutive years of GDP growth, and was supported by the federal government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credible commitment to fiscal consolidation. Wayne Byres, the chairman of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra), appeared before a senate estimates hearing in Canberra. He told senators that Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fundamentally sound\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with risk-based capital ratios of major financial institutions at their highest level in 20 years. However, he said the banking royal commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of Apra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regulatory approach had forced Apra to think deeply, and it was now reviewing its practices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The royal commission noted that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not utilised court-based sanctions,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Byres said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a supervision-led agency our priorities have traditionally been prevention, rectification, and then sanction.

So far the U.S. earnings season has been decent, with approximately 30% of the S&amp;P 500 companies by market capitalization having reported and 83% of those having beaten analyst\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations for earnings.</p> <p>The anxiety now in markets stems from whether this is the peak in earnings and growth, as higher input costs from rising wages, the impact of tariffs and higher funding costs start to impinge on corporate margins. The problems in the U.S. market are having knock-on effects on global equities, and the rising U.S. dollar is exacerbating difficulties for emerging markets and Asia. However, the global economy is still growing and corporate earnings are still positive. They may not grow as fast or be as positive from here on out, but these are still reasons to favour risk assets and equities.</p> <p>Markets are likely to remain jittery for the rest of the year. The upcoming G20 meeting is not likely to result in a resolution of the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. Both sides are caught in a case of political brinkmanship.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5bd16d42e4b05b9fcceaff77\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-10-25T07:26:36.657Z\">8.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>There are heavy losses in Europe too.</strong></p> <p>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX index has fallen by 0.8%, to its lowest level since December 2016.</p> <p>France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC hit its lowest level since March 2017, down another 0.4% in early trading.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5bd16f97e4b0521246c58e0d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-10-25T07:25:28.648Z\">8.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the best and worst performing shares on the FTSE 100 this morning.

                "bodyText":"Alphabet also missed Wall Street forecasts. The company behind Google posted revenue of $33.74bn in the last quarter, missing estimates of $34.05 billion. Still, Alphabet also reported net profit of $9.19 billion, or $13.06 per share, up from $9.57 per share a year ago. eMarketer analyst Monica Peart says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing a larger than expected slowdown in Google properties\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 revenue, representing its core search business. This is likely related to the ramp-up in competition from Amazon, as consumers increasingly turn to the ecommerce giant for their product searches.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight! GW Amazon has taken a bite out of Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new-found optimism tonight, by missing analyst expectations: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Amazon.com Inc. reported sales that missed analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 estimates, and issued a disappointing revenue forecast for the busy holiday quarter, suggesting the online marketplace may be reaching a saturation point in the U.S. Revenue gained 29 percent to $56.6 billion in the third quarter, the e-commerce giant said Thursday in a statement. Analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 projected $57.1 billion. Sales will be from $66.5 billion to $72.5 billion in the current period, falling short of analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 average estimate of $73.8 billion. Shares declined as much as 6.5 percent in extended trading. Ut-oh... Amazon and Alphabet have just released results as the echo of the closing bell fade. And Wall Street is NOT happy..... Intel has smashed earnings forecasts, though: Breaking: After Wipeout Wednesday, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Turnaround Thursday. October has maintained its run of wild swings tonight, as Wall Street bounces back. The Dow Jones industrial average has closed 401 points higher, a gain of 1.6%, at 24,984. Technology, industrials companies and banks led the rally. Microsoft closed 6% higher, while Intel gained 4.8%. With tech stocks romping ahead, the Nasdaq has posted its biggest one-day jump in seven months. The Nasdaq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery is even punchier than the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The tech-focused index has leapt by 3%, with just a few minutes to go. Tesla, Twitter and Microsoft have all done their bit, with forecast-beating results in the last 24 hours. The rebound has legs! With just 30 minutes to go, the Dow is up an impressive 490 points, or 2%, at 25,073. That means its recovered a large chunk of the Wednesday wobble. Traders in New York must be dizzy! The Dow is holding onto its gains. With two hours to go, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 380 points at 24,963, up 1.5%. Microsoft is leading the charge, up 5.7% after impressive results last night. Intel (+5%) and VISA (+3.45%) are close behind. The ongoing market turbulence hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deterred US company Yeti from floating on the stock market today. Yeti makes high end coolers and outdoor gear, popular with outdoor types like hunters and surfers, and pitmasters who spend time tending barbecues (important work!). Their kit isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cheap. The Tundra 125 cooler retails at $549 -- for that, you get enough space for 73 cans or dozens of hot dogs, hamburger patties and cold cuts. Yeti floated at $18 per share -- so far, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve slipped by 7% to $16.80. Not a great start - still, a yeti makes a change from all those Wall Street bears. After tumbling in early trading, European stock markets have recovered to end the day higher. In London, the FTSE 100 has climbed back over the 7,000 point mark, ending up 41 points at 7,004. It would be higher, but for WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB had a good day, gaining 1.8% after Mario Dragji said he was confident that the deadlock over Rome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget plans would be resolved. The French CAC gained 1.6%, and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX rose 1%, as traders welcomed the rally in New York. On Wall Street, the Dow is now up 350 points - trying to put Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shocker behind it. Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble into a bear market overnight is still a concern, though, as market volatility remains high. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses could be a buying opportunity...... Wall Street started on the front foot with tech stocks on the rise after falling sharply in the previous session. Upbeat results from Microsoft and Telsa have gone some way to calming investor nerves after disappointments from Caterpillar and 3M earlier in the week. Whilst a slew of risk factors have hit traders confidence hard this month, investors will be looking searching for the bottom of this recent shake out. So far market shake out\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this year have been buying opportunities and whilst we are still in a bull market, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see why this one should be any different right now. Neil MacKinnon, Global Macro Strategist at VTB Capital, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council meeting came at a tricky time for the ECB. The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to hold current interest rate levels at 0% takes place at a time of a cyclical slowdown in the Eurozone economies, as well as persistently subdued core CPI inflation. Business growth is at its slowest in two years and companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of future growth have slipped to the lowest in four years. The Italian budget drama is also high on the agenda and the stand-off between Rome and Brussels is unlikely to be resolved. Also noteworthy is the risk of a worsening \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdoom-loop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 between Italian banks and their holdings of domestic sovereign debt. Italy is not Greece and Rome will react badly if the ECB resorts to its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcenforcement tools\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of closing down bond purchases and turning off the liquidity tap for the Italian banking system.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some expert reaction to the European Central Bank press conference today: Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference Draghi chose to strike a relatively hawkish note, while acknowledging somewhat weaker economic momentum as of late. There has been some concern in the market about a number of disappointing data prints this month, including the flash PMIs yesterday, but evidence so far has not been strong enough to change the ECB stance. Anthony Kurukgy, Senior Sales Trader at Foenix Partners Mario Draghi stuck to the script again at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB Press Conference, delivering yet another \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbalanced\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment of the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. The ECB President quelled recent concerns of weaker economic data as merely a slowdown of growth momentum, not a downturn. This aside, the ECB remain committed to ending the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond-buying programme come December. Transitory or not, Draghi and Co. will need to buy themselves more time to distinguish what effect trade wars, Brexit and the recent Italian budget crisis will have on its interest rate hike timeline in 2019. Silvia Dall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Angelo, Senior Economist, Hermes Investment Management The bottom line is that the ECB is on a gradual path of monetary policy normalisation for now, but risks from protectionism, a further slowdown in external demand, domestic political instability, Brexit and volatility in financial markets cast a dark shadow on the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans. Policy uncertainty has increased both externally and domestically: international trade tensions have remained high, there is no solution for the Brexit issue in sight, and the Italian government seems determined to defy the European fiscal rules. The recent turmoil in financial markets is a new addition to the list of downside risks. Marina Mensah-Afoakwah, Senior Economist at the CEBR Between Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget drama and the precarious nature of Brexit, there is a lot that threatens the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stability. For the time being these pressures haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t risen to a level requiring ECB intervention. Time will tell however, as latest figures suggest cracks are beginning to show in the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bounceback on Wall Street means some investors may be snaffling up bargains. Or at least, what they hope are bargains. CNBC explains why traders may be putting their toes into the water again: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The technical picture has turned increasingly bearish this month,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The percentage of S&amp;P 500 companies trading above their 200-day moving averages was down to 37% after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debacle.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He noted, however, that prior similar declines during this bull market have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153marked buying opportunities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yardeni added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If this is still a bull market, as we believe it is, then the latest bearish technicals and October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s swoon should mark the latest buying opportunity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in the markets, shares are rising in New York as traders return to the fray after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alarming late sell-off. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 192 points at the open, or 0.8%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an encouraging start, after Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 608-point slide. The Nasdaq is also recovering, after slumping ingloriously into a correction yesterday, in its worst day since 2011. The strong results from Twitter today, plus Microsoft and Tesla yesterday, may be calming nerves. Tesla has surged by over 8% in early trading, with other carmakers also up (Ford has gained almost 6%). Twitter has leapt by 15%, after beating profit and revenue forecasts today. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early days. Investors will be watching nervously to see if Wall Street can hold onto these gains, or be dragged down again. Mario Draghi warns that there could be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcuneasiness\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the financial markets, unless Britain and the EU make progress towards a Brexit deal. Asked about Brexit at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference, the ECB president says he is confident that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good, common sense solution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will be found. But he also warns that time is running out - if a deal isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reached, banks and other businesses will be forced to trigger their contingency plans. As Draghi puts it: If this lack of a solution continues, and approaches the end date, the the private sector itself will have to prepare on the assumption that it will be a hard Brexit. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where there will be financial uneasiness in markets. Boom! Mario Draghi has admonished politicians, such as Donald Trump, who put pressure on central banks to change their policy. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been asked the pressure on the European Central Bank and the Fed to maintain their stimulus programmes, or do more. Draghi tells reporters in Frankfurt that these attacks threaten central bank independence. He says: Central bank independence is a precious thing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s precious because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s essential for the credibility of the central banks, and credibility is essential for effectiveness. That means giving central banks the independence to deliver their mandates, and to choose which instruments are most effective. If that is eroded, then a central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effectiveness is reduced, he warns. Earlier this week, Trump blasted the Fed for being too keen to raise interest rates, accusing it of threatening the US economy. In Europe, the ECB has faced criticism from Germany, for example, over its stimulus programme and record low interest rates. Draghi suggests that politicians should see the big picture: Actually the legislators themselves, who are often the very same people who are arguing for the central bank to do this or that, should be the first ones to care about monetary policy effectiveness and central banks achieving their goals. Q: What options do you have if the financial markets continue to fall, if economic data worsens, or if relations between Italy and the EC deteriorate further? We still have tools in the toolbox, Draghi replies. He reveals that two speakers at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Governing Council meeting mentioned its TLTRO programme -- which provides cheap financing to eurozone banks. Mario Draghi is fending off several questions about Italy, and whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worried about the rise in its bond yields. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arguing that the spillover impact from Italy onto other countries is limited so far. Q: Are you worried that the spread between Italian and German bonds could continue to widen, perhaps to 400 basis points? Would that cause impairments to Italian banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 balance sheets? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a crystal ball, Draghi snaps back briskly. But yes, there is a linkage betweem Italian sovereign debt and its banks (which hold a lot of it). If they lose value, they are denting into the capital position of the banks. Mario Draghi adds that he is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconfident\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that an agreement between Italy and the European Commission over its budget will be found . [reminder, the EC rejected Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans on Tuesday, but Rome is refusing to rewrite them] Q: What does the ECB think about the clash between Rome and Brussels over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget? Italy is a fiscal discussion, Draghi replies, so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discussed much at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Onto questions.. Q) Did the ECB discuss downgrading their assessment of the eurozone economy today? Mario Draghi speaks at some length, explaining that the governing council agreed that economic momentum has weakened, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not facing a downturn. Various \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcidiosyncratic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reasons are to blame - such as the slowdown in Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car sector as manufacturers get to grips with new emission rules. There are also a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbunch of uncertainties\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, such as the stalemate between the US and China over trade, Brexit, and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 budget. Plus, Draghi adds, growth is returning to potential when it was clearly above potential in 2017. These risks are not considered enough to merit changing our balance of risks, he insists firmly. Draghi ends his statement with his traditional call for eurozone government to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsubstantially step up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 their structural reforms, to take advantage of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus measures. Eurozone states must raise their long-term growth potential, he adds. Over in Frankfurt, ECB president Mario Draghi is explaining today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision. He has singled out protectionism, emerging market vulnerabilities and financial market volatility as important risks to the eurozone recovery. However, overall risks are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbroadly balanced\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, he says. On inflation, the ECB thinks domestic cost pressures are strengthening and broadening, as wage increases feed through to prices. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on those durable goods figures: Newsflash: Orders for durable goods at American firms has fallen for the second month running (if you strip out aircraft and defence sales). Core durable goods orders shrank by 0.1% last month, new data shows, following a 0.2% decline in August. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a small move, of course, but it suggests US manufacturing isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sizzling. Perhaps tariffs are having an effect. Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings beat is going to help drive Wall Street up again, after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late rout. The tech-focused Nasdaq is now forecast to jump by 1.7% when trading begins. The Dow is on track to gain 220 points (or more than a third of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump). Electric carmaker Tesla is also likely to surge, after surprising investors with a return to profitability last night. Microsoft also beat forecasts last night, partly thanks to strong growth at its Azure cloud computing division. Twitter isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only company beating forecasts today. Comcast, which recently won the battle for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sky News, has also impressed investors. Net income jumped by 9% in the last three months, as it attracted more broadband customers. NEWSFLASH: The European Central Bank has (to no-one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise) left eurozone interest rates at their current record lows. That means the headline borrowing rate remains at zero, while banks face a negative interest rate of -0.4% on their deposits at the ECB (to encourage them to lend the money instead). It also makes three important points: The ECB is still \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcanticipating\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 it will end its bond-buying programme in December, after buying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn of securities each month until the end of the year. The ECB reiterated that it expects to leave rates on hold until at least the summer of 2019, to ensure that inflation returns sustainably to its target of just below 2%. It also restated its plan to reinvest the proceeds of bonds bought under its QE stimulus programme. That would avoid the risk of tightening monetary policy too quickly, even if the ECB has stopped printing any more electronic money. Dr Ben Marder, Senior Lecturer in Marketing at University of Edinburgh Business School, is concerned that Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s active user base is shrinking. He thinks that the site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fake News problem is hurting: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald Trump, no matter your opinion of the man, is Twitter gold. His tweets attract vast swathes of traffic to the site and he has no doubt had a positive effect on Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock price in the past few years. This was a mutually beneficial relationship as Twitter was pivotal for Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2016 presidential election success. However, despite Twitter posting higher than expected earnings and revenue in Q3 2018, monthly active users have fallen for a second quarter in a row as the company continues to purge bots and fake accounts. It seems Trump is now biting the hand that used to feed him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Twitter, much like other social media giants are starting to bleed-out from the large thorn in their side which is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Worsening the wound are world-wide governments, including the US who are threatening regulatory action against the tech giants for facilitating the dissemination of fake news. Adding to the many great ironies for Trump, he is largely rumoured to be a not so secret proponent of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfake news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Par exemple..... Twitter is benefitting from a surge in advertising deals, explains Anthony Capano, managing director of Europe for Rakuten Marketing: While Twitter focused its efforts earlier this year on cleaning the platform of fraudulent actors, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that the focus has returned to investing in global opportunities for advertisers. Earlier in Q3 the platform revealed a host of content partnerships including Bloomberg, Sony Music and NBCUniversal that would bring hundreds of hours of livestreams and other videos to the platform in the Asia-Pacific region. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important UK marketers see how relevant these opportunities are to their operation. In Britain alone, as many as 35% of our client transactions are now taking place overseas. Some Silicon Valley early risers are waking up to the news that Twitter did better than expected last quarter: Newsflash: Twitter has smashed Wall Street forecasts with its latest financial results. The social network site grew its earnings to 21 cents per share in the last quarter, well ahead of estimates of 14 cents. Revenues came in at $758, beating forecasts of $702m, thanks to a 29% leap in advertising sales. However, Twitter also revealed that the number of monthly active users fell to 326 million; analysts expected 331.5 million. That may be due to Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to eradicate trolls, and malicious accounts created to pump out fake news and influence elections. Twitter also warned that it expects to keep losing active users in the current quarter. Shares are soaring in pre-market trading, as investors cheer the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings growth. 2018 has been a pretty rough year for the markets, with nearly $7 trillion (!) wiped off stock values since the end of January. So, the 42 trillion dollar question is whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re heading towards a proper, old-fashioned crash... or if these lower prices actually give value. Neil Wilson of Markets.com suggests the long-running bull market hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run out of steam yet. Stocks could rally if the Federal Reserve decides to slow the pace of future interest rate rises - as Donald Trump has been demanding. Wilson writes: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a period of pressure building to the downside as we get more down days than up and the breadth of the decline is important as is the volume. However whilst the recent spike in volatility may be seen as meaning we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re past the peak, there may yet be a few breaths left in this old bull. Valuations - while not going for a song - are a lot more attractive at about 16x forward earnings. Confidence is clearly lacking however and it may require a softening tone from the Fed to assuage concerns on rates. Softer inflation figures would help greatly and the autumn/winter may provide respite on that front. If we go back a couple of weeks we must recall that this selling started on some very hawkish jawboning by Jerome Powell on rates. This may be the start of the age of the Bears but it may equally be just a tantrum. The macro outlook is not great - China, trade, Italy are all weights but for most of 2018 US investors were able to shrug off any global worries. Advertising giant WPP is having a torrid day, as its new boss gets to grips with the business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems. Shares are down 16%, at their lowest level since December 2012, after it missed sales forecasts and slashed its guidance. CEO Mark Read, who replaced industry veteran Sir Martin Sorrell earlier this year, was blunt about WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems, saying: Clearly we have underperformed our competition in the third quarter. We are not going to sugarcoat the reality.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Facebook has been buffeted by the stock market sell-off. Its shares slid by 5% yesterday, and are down 17% this year as the social network giant faces tough questions about extremism and election interference. In another blow, it has just been fined half a million pounds by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s information commissioner for not protecting users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data. This follows the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which exposed how third party developers had been allowed to access user information without sufficient consent. In monetary terms, \u00c2\u00a3500k is barely a mosquito bite on a mammoth company worth $421bn. But it comes with a stern rebuke from information commissioner Elizabeth Denham, who says: Facebook failed to sufficiently protect the privacy of its users before, during and after the unlawful processing of this data. A company of its size and expertise should have known better and it should have done better. After that shaky start, European stocks have now turn positive for the day! Germany, France and Italy have all rebounded from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows, with Italian banks are leading the rally. Even the FTSE 100 is getting a boost, clawing its way back from that seven-month low. One factor - Wall Street is currently expected to rally in a few hours. The Dow futures show a gain of 224 points, following Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 608-point rout. Another factor: One of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition leaders has vowed to step in if a bank or other company needs help. Deputy PM Matteo Salvini, who also leads the right-wing Northern League party, said any help provided would be different from past interventions. Salvini also suggested that investors are too pessimistic about Italy, having driven its bond yields higher in recent weeks. Reuters has more details: Salvini, who is also the leader of the ruling League party, said on the sidelines of a conference in the northern city of Verona that the Italy/Germany bond yield spread would inevitably fall if it followed the real economy. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says investors are nervous about the state of the world. He explains: The chief concerns are the potential negative impacts of higher interest rates, weaker global growth and the knock-on effects of trade tariffs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The FTSE 100 fell 0.7% in early trading on Thursday to 6,912 with pharmaceuticals, insurers and oil companies the biggest contributors to the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei index incurred heavy losses, falling 3.7% in a single session.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in Australia, insurance group AMP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares crashed by 25% today, as it paid the price for past misdeeds. AMP shocked investors by revealing that its wealth management business suffered a $1.5bn asset withdrawal in the last quarter. The company suffered badly from Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Royal Commission into banking, earlier this year. That inquiry exposed that AMB had charge customers who had died, and imposed fees even if it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide a services. More here: Our latest Brexit dashboard shows how consumer spending slowed last month, even before the stock market turmoil hit confidence. Two leading economists argue that the government needs to take bold action, by ending austerity and helping businesses navigate Brexit uncertainty: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubled retail sector is reeling from another blow this morning, as Debenhams outlines plans to shut up to 50 stores. The closure plan puts thousands of jobs at risk, on top of tens of thousands of redundancies at fellow chains such as Toys R Us, Mothercare, Carpetright and Maplin. Debenhams dropped the bad news as it reported a \u00c2\u00a3500m annual loss, partly due the cost of writing off unwanted shop leases and IT systems. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an astonishing amount, for a company only valued at \u00c2\u00a3100m. The closures will take place over the next three to five years, Debs says, as it pulls out of unprofitable stores. Simon Underwood, business recovery partner at accountancy firm Menzies LLP, warns that the days of the traditional department store are numbered. Instead, they will become \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexperimental showrooms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, or places for meetings etc. Underwood adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decision to focus on a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprofitable core\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of stores is a good one. However, the question is whether closing just ten stores now, with a view to reducing store numbers further over the next three to five years will be enough in view of the speed of changes in the marketplace as consumers shift to buying online. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The high street needs support, but some of the ideas being mooted by Government could prove counterproductive. For example, the Chairman of John Lewis, Sir Charlie Mayfield has recently spoken out against the Amazon tax and many bricks and mortar retailers fear that a blanket levy on online sales would be tantamount to hitting the high street when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down, as most of them sell goods online too. German firms are also anxious about the danger that Britain leaves the EU without a deal, says IFO. The row between Italy and the EU over its 2019 budget is another worry, it adds. Just in: business morale in Germany has taken a tumble this month. The German business climate index produced by the IFO institute dropped to 102.8 this month, down from 103.7 in September. Company bosses said business conditions had deteriorated, while their expectations also become gloomier. Geopolitical tensions, such as the trade wars between the US and China, seem to be hurting. Ifo chief Clemens Fuest blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglobal uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the drop in confidence, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Firms were less satisfied with their current business situation and less optimistic about the months ahead. Growing global uncertainty is increasingly taking its toll on the German economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Worryingly, there doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be a single cause for the current sell-off (unlike in 2008, say, or in 2015 when investors fretted about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy). Instead, a cocktail of problems are being blamed, as traders worry that the long bull market in shares may be petering out. Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, says the lack of a single cause for the current volatility is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153troubling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There are many symptoms but no one can diagnose the illness. Geopolitics, rising bond U.S. bond yields, a more hawkish looking U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed), slowing Chinese growth, a strong U.S. dollar and the already well known problems in some emerging economies have all contributed to the market unease. The focus for investors had been on corporate earnings. Against all the macro headwinds, the micro factor of strong U.S. corporate earnings had been enough to insulate the market. So far the U.S. earnings season has been decent, with approximately 30% of the S&amp;P 500 companies by market capitalization having reported and 83% of those having beaten analyst\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations for earnings. The anxiety now in markets stems from whether this is the peak in earnings and growth, as higher input costs from rising wages, the impact of tariffs and higher funding costs start to impinge on corporate margins. The problems in the U.S. market are having knock-on effects on global equities, and the rising U.S. dollar is exacerbating difficulties for emerging markets and Asia. However, the global economy is still growing and corporate earnings are still positive. They may not grow as fast or be as positive from here on out, but these are still reasons to favour risk assets and equities. Markets are likely to remain jittery for the rest of the year. The upcoming G20 meeting is not likely to result in a resolution of the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. Both sides are caught in a case of political brinkmanship. There are heavy losses in Europe too. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX index has fallen by 0.8%, to its lowest level since December 2016. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC hit its lowest level since March 2017, down another 0.4% in early trading. Here are the best and worst performing shares on the FTSE 100 this morning. Utilities, precious metal miners, and other defensive stocks are in - most other companies are out! Boom! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has hit a seven-month low at the start of trading in London. The blue-chip index has fallen by 75 points to 6887, a drop of over 1%, its lowest level since late March. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now lost around 8% of its value in the last four weeks, as the market sell-off has gathered pace. Advertising giant WPP are leading the selloff, slumping by 18% after reporting that revenues 1.5% fell in the last quarter. Consumer goods producers, technology companies, miners and energy firms are also in the red, as Europe picks up the sell-off baton from Asia. Some context: Stephen Innis of foreign exchange firm OANDA fears that the US stock markets are on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153verge of crumbling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, after last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late rout. If people are struggling to find a driver I suggest, they wake up and smell the coffee. The catalysts are nothing new -- Tariffs, Italy, Brexit, Saudi Arabia. But with the towering pillars of market strength, the US equity markets, is looking ever so fragile and on the verge of crumbling. The air is so thick with a sense of foreboding that you can cut it with a dull butter knife. Maybe there are too many things going sideways clouding investor judgement, but things could turn nasty in a heartbeat. With risk sentiment tanking, we could be facing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the early stages of a protracted equity market meltdown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he adds. Yesterday was the worst day for tech stocks on Wall Street for seven years, dragging the Nasdaq into bear-market territory and wiping out the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2018 gains. And today, markets were in retreat from Sydney to Shanghai, my colleague Martin Farrer reports: In Australia the benchmark ASX200 closed down 164 points or 2.8% as it suffered its fifth straight day of losses. In Japan the Nikkei was off 3.7% and has now dropped around 13% from a 27-year peak of 24,448.07 touched in early October. A broad indicator of shares in the region \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the MSCI Asia Pacific index \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has now fallen 20.3% from the year-to-date high set on 29 January, representing an official bear market. The Vix \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fear\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd index, which measures volatility across the market, has spiked sharply this week and was up 21% overnight. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t thought that selling would be this steep. This sell-off makes us think the market may be set for capitulation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Shoji Hirakawa, chief global strategist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The sell-off in global stock markets is accelerating today, as stocks keep sliding across the globe. Asian stock markets have plunged into bear market territory, meaning they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve shed 20% of their value since their highs in January. Fears over the health of the global economy, future US interest rate rises, Jamal Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s murder, and America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war with China are all being blamed as investors try to grab the nearest tin hat to ride out the storm. Some disappointing corporate results this week - including from industry bellwether Caterpillar - have also dampened the mood, and raised fears that growth is slowing. After a very bruising session, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei has tumbled by 3.7%, while Australia has lost 2.8%. China suffered fresh losses too, taking it deeper into its own bear market. Analysts are worried that the sell-off has further to run, and could turn into a full-blown collapse. As Greg McKenna, an independent markets strategist in Australia, put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fear is palpable in stock markets at the moment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This could get much worse before it gets better. Collapses happen after falls. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the danger.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That follows another rocky session on Wall Street, where the Dow slumped by another 600 points (-2.4%). That wipes out all its gains for this year, as a wave of worry swept the trading floors. Optimism is out, and volatility is back. Bears are prowling the trading floors this morning in Europe too. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is expected to fall, and could hit a new seven-month low. Other European markets are expected to slide too, as the spat between Rome and Brussels over next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget continues. The EU has asked for a new version within three weeks, but Italy is refusing to rewrite its plans. Also coming up The European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council is meeting today to set monetary policy. No change is expected, but Mario Draghi will be quizzed by journalists.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap Global stock markets are on track for their worst month in five years ,after another day of losses. In London, the FTSE 100 has lost nearly 1% to close at its weakest level since March. At one point it hit a 22-month low. The US stock markets is also in the red today. Technology stocks are leading the sell-off, after Amazon and Alphabet underwhelmed Wall Street with their results last night. Investors have not taken much cheer from the latest US GDP report, which showed a slightly faster acceleration in growth than expected. Consumer spending and government spending both boosted growth, but trade was a drag. Asia-Pacific markets also ended the week with another bout of volatility, and fears that contagion was spreading through the markets. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story on the markets, after a turbulent week: Shares in New York are also climbing back from their earlier lows. The Dow is now down just 140 points, or 0.6%, as a degree of calm returns to Wall Street. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 250, an index of smaller companies, also lost almost 1% today: As European traders count their losses and head to the pub, their counterparts on Wall Street have just endured a rough morning Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest damage: Dow Jones industrial average: down 279 points or 1.1% at 24,715 S&amp;P 500: down 43 points or 1.6% at 2,661 Nasdaq: down 153 points or 2.2% at 6,862 Neil Wilson of Markets.com says the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) are doing the damage. He writes: Bloody FAANGs means Halloween comes early in nightmare month for equities. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No respite for equity markets today as the weight of the FAANGs dragged on the wider market and raises a real risk that this selloff is about to turn into a full bear market. The S&amp;P 500 has now dipped into correction territory in little over a month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a steep selloff. Amazon and Alphabet earnings disappointed with less upbeat outlooks casting a cloud over tech stocks in particular. Bear in mind that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still the only real bright spot out there YTD and now it looks as though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s starting to rollover. If FAANGs are rolling over the weaker sector stocks are very vulnerable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Snap off 15% today after reporting another quarter of declining users and offered a pessimistic outlook. Snap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment thesis was always shaky and the truth is it was never going to deliver. Quality like Microsoft and Intel are holding relatively firm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not seen sky high valuations as some of the FAANGs so are seen a bit safer, while both have delivered on earnings. Just in: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has ended the day solidly in the red, at the end of a volatile week. However, the losses aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as bad as earlier in the day, when stocks were languishing at a 22-month low. The FTSE 100 closed 64 points lower, or -0.92%, at 6,939 points. Things looked worse an hour ago, before shares rallied into the closing auction in London. Evraz was the biggest faller, down 6.3%, followed by online supermarket chain Ocada (-5%) and BT (-4.5%). There are losses in Europe: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.94% French CAC: -1.3% Italian FTSE MIB: -0.7% Fiona Cincotta of City Index says: The large-scale volatility that we have seen across the week was certainly not packing away for the weekend early. The bloodbath continued with markets across the globe slamming lower as concerns over US corporate results overshadowed a robust US GDP figure. As shares slide, investors are piling into the safety of government bonds. Debt issued by Germany and America is always attractive on these occasions. So as prices leap, bond yields (the interest on the bond) are dropping. Newsflash: The FTSE 100 just hit its lowest level since December 2016. It fell 152 points, or over 2%, to 6851, as markets end the week on a low. Technology stocks had been a stellar performer earlier this year. But now they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sliding, and dragging the wider markets down, according to David Madden of CMC Markets: The S&amp;P 500 has fallen into correction territory as the decline in stocks intensifies. Amazon and Alphabet shares are in the red after both companies missed on revenue forecasts last night, and Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guidance was also below the consensus estimate. US tech stocks set a series of record-highs throughout the summer, and they were the first to fall in the recent market rout. There is a sense that the tech sector is setting the pace for the rest of the world. The sell-off is gathering pace, again. The S&amp;P 500 index, which covers a broader spread of the US economy than the Dow, is down 2.2%. That puts the S&amp;P 500 into correction territory, more than 10% off its peak in September. The good news for City investors is that this week of pain is almost over. The bad news is that the FTSE 100 is wallowing close its lowest level since December 2016. The blue-chip Footsie index is down 117 points, or almost 1.7%, at 6887. Steel and mining company Evraz is the biggest faller, down 7.6% after mixed production numbers yesterday. WPP has shed another 4.6%, after Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout following a profits warning. Several economists are predicting that the US economy will slow in the quarters ahead, after six months of solid growth. Capital Economics believes tighter monetary policy is already having an impact: At 3.5% annualised, GDP growth remained unusually strong in the third quarter, thanks partly to this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal stimulus, but there are signs that higher interest rates are beginning to have a bigger restraining effect. Once the boost from fiscal stimulus fades next year, we expect economic growth to slow below its potential rate, forcing the Fed to the side-lines by mid-2019. Kay Daniel Neufeld, managing economist of CEBR, believes the trade war with China will also hurt growth. Q3 growth surprised on the upside, showing that the US economy continues to perform with considerable momentum in the second half of the year. However, house-made problems including the deteriorating global trading conditions and the fast pace of monetary tightening spell trouble for the coming quarters.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ouch! The Dow Jones industrial average is now down 400 points, or 1.7%, as the market turmoil continues. Another tech firm, Cisco, is the biggest faller on the Dow (down 2.1%), followed by Home Depot (-1.9%) and American Express (-1.7%). Technology stocks are sliding in New York, particularly those which have disappointed Wall Street. Hard drive maker Western Digital has tumbled by 17%, after reporting a 3% drop in revenues for the last quarter. Profits shrank by 24%. Amazon has slumped by 7.5% after giving disappointing guidance for the holiday period last night. Google parent company Alphabet has shed 3%. This is all weighing on the Nasdaq, of course, which is down over 2%. The bell has rung and stronger-than-expected US growth in Q3 has failed to cheer investors. Opening scores: Dow Jones: -242 points or -1% at 24,742 S&amp;P 500: -39 points or -1.5% at 2,666 Nasdaq: -186 points or -2.5% at 7,132 Three minutes until the opening bell on Wall Street... Balraj Sroya, trader at currency firm Foenix Partners, says the US growth figures are key to both Trump and the Federal Reserve: Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mantra of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMaking America Great Again\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is echoing across the US economy as third quarter GDP growth outpaced market consensus with a print of 3.5%. Consumer spending and businesses increasing their inventories aided the strongest back to back quarters for growth in over two years. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s print was crucial for Trump and the GOP ahead of the Midterm elections as GDP seems to be aligning with the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target for 2018, however it could spark the Fed to consider a more aggressive monetary policy. The detail behind the headline GDP growth figure, published by the US Commerce Department, shows that consumer spending boosted the economy in the third quarter, but net trade was a drag as exports fell but imports rose. The Department said: The increase in real GDP in the third quarter reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures, private inventory investment, state and local government spending, federal government spending, and nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by negative contributions from exports and residential fixed investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased. The deceleration in real GDP growth in the third quarter reflected a downturn in exports and a deceleration in nonresidential fixed investment. Imports increased in the third quarter after decreasing in the second. These movements were partly offset by an upturn in private inventory investment. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said Donald Trump is likely to jump on the US growth figures: We can expect President Trump to wax lyrical about these results in the run up to the congressional midterm elections, adding evidence to his promise on expanding the economy. However, growth has already moderated and will continue to do so in 2019 as the tax cut boost dissipates and inflation tightens its grip as a result of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tit for tat with China. (No Trump tweet about Q3 as yet...) Pre-trading on Wall Street has picked up after the news that US growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter, to 3.5%. US futures are still down before the opening bell, but less so: Dow Jones: -177 points or -0.7% S&amp;P 500: -24 points or -0.9% Nasdaq: -124 points or -1.8% Breaking: The US economy grew by 3.5% in the third quarter, faster than the 3.3% predicted by economists. It was a slowdown compared with the second quarter, when the economy grew by 4.2% on an annual basis. Economists at Investec have taken a step back from this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market mayhem to look at prospects in the months ahead for the global economy. In a month full of uncertainties, a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglass half full\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 approach might be to say that there has been some respite in global trade tensions. However the pause looks to be because the Chinese and US authorities are eyeing more constructive talks after the US mid-terms. Even with this respite, risk assets are currently under pressure amid continuing concerns that the Fed may embark on a more aggressive tightening path, concerns over earnings and equity valuations and as other global political concerns have arisen. Furthermore some signs have emerged that suggest recent protectionist actions have spilt over into confidence and growth. But as yet we do not judge risks related to the above to be substantial enough to shift our world GDP forecasts, particularly given supportive fiscal policy in the US and China. We continue to look for 3.8% world growth this year and 3.7% next. Risks though lie to the downside for 2019. The pound is down 0.3% against the dollar at a two-month low of $1.2784. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly a story of a stronger dollar, which is up against a basket of currencies ahead of the US GDP number at 1.30pm UK time. Another day, another statement from Patisserie Valerie, the troubled cafe and bakery chain which earlier this month discovered a black hole in its accounts and a \u00c2\u00a31m unpaid tax bill that threatened the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse. The latest news is that Chris Marsh, the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance director who was arrested on suspicion of fraud and subsequently bailed, has resigned. Pat Val\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, Patisserie Holdings, issued a brief statement: Patisserie Holdings plc announces that following the suspension of Chris Marsh on 9 October 2018, the company has now accepted his resignation as the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance director with immediate effect, while reserving its position in respect of any potential claims it may have against him. The latest announcement isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite surprising as the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other ones over the past month. Thursdays rebound on Wall Street - with the Dow Jones surging 401 points - is nowhere to be seen today, with global markets on course for their longest losing streak in more than five years. European markets are sharply lower and US futures suggest the Dow could lose another 300-or-so points when the bell goes on Wall Street. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a look at US futures: Dow Jones: -271 points or -1.1% S&amp;P 500: -38 points or -1.4% Nasdaq: -174 points or -2.5% The MSCI all-country index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was earlier down 0.3% and on track for a fifth week of losses - the longest losing streak since May 2013. Royal Bank of Scotland is weighing on the FTSE 100 this morning, with shares down nearly 5%. The bailed-out bank published third-quarter results this morning, and the detail has underwhelmed investors. Attributable profit - the figure which determines the dividend - was up 14% in the three months to the end of September, at \u00c2\u00a3448m, but it was below expectations of \u00c2\u00a3507m. Operating costs also increased as the bank set aside another \u00c2\u00a3200m for payment protection insurance claims. In better news, pre-tax profit rose 10% in the third quarter, to \u00c2\u00a3961m. But that has not been enough for traders, and RBS is among the top FTSE fallers: Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says that hopes appear to have been dashed for a positive end to the week for the FTSE . Any suggestion UK stocks might end the week on a more positive note has been swatted aside after the third quarter sales performance of Amazon and Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company Alphabet disappointed after the market close in the US. Given the technology sector helped lead US indices to fresh highs in 2018 and is so dominant, its performance in the current earning season was always likely to be pivotal to investor sentiment. As if traders didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough to contend with, later today we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get US GDP data for the third quarter. Figures are expected to show the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy grew by 3.3% in the third quarter, on an annual basis. It would be a slowdown from 4.2% in the second quarter. The figures will be published at 1.30pm, UK time. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spread Ex, says the number could weigh on investor moods: Given that the slightest thing sets the markets off at the moment, it is going to be interesting to see how they deal with this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first look at the US third quarter GDP figure. Analysts are expecting a slowdown from 4.2% in Q2 to 3.3% in Q3, a decline that may only cause further problems at the end of a tiring and tricky week. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take a closer look at the markets in Europe, where losses are accelerating this morning: As well as the disappointing results (on some measures) from Amazon and Alphabet, investors are also concerned by a number of other risks. To name a few - the US/China trade war, rising US interest rates, instability in emerging markets, and Brexit. Here is our story on how the market volatility has gripped Asian and Australian markets overnight: Opening bells have rung across Europe and the mood is gloomy: FTSE 100: -0.8% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -1.1% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -1% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.5% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.6% Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.6% David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, explains why Amazon and Alphabet disappointed investors: We heard from tech giants Amazon and Alphabet after the closing bell last night. Amazon topped the earnings per share forecast, but missed on revenue and the guidance. Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent, Alphabet, exceeded estimates on EPS, but undershot the revenue forecast. Both stocks dropped heavily in the post-market session, and in turn sparked selling across major US indices. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re almost at the end of what has been a hugely volatile week for global stock markets. Wall Street bounced back on Thursday, with the Dow Jones surging 401 points, a gain of 1.6%, to close at 24,984. It followed sharp falls on Wednesday, and the turnaround in sentiment was largely down to technology stocks - after positive Twitter and Microsoft results - industrials companies and banks. But sentiment soured when US tech giants Amazon and Alphabet reported disappointing revenues after the closing bell on Wall Street. It was enough to send US futures lower, which in turn triggered a sell-off in Asia where shares hit 20-month lows. Markets across Europe are expected to open sharply lower this morning as the gloomy sentiment spreads across the Atlantic: We will be following the markets and all the latest business news as this volatile week for global markets draws to a close.",

McBride writes that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153when commodity prices began to slide a few years ago, Townsville\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy was dragged down, too ... unemployment rose from 5% in 2013 to 9% in 2016. Property prices sank\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>Except unemployment in Townsville didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t peak in 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it kept going up, reaching an annual average of 11.6% in 2017. It is now back at 9.1%, but consider that in 2013 the unemployment rate in Townsville was 1.4 percentage points lower than the national rate and now it is more than 4 percentage points above it. Not really an example of a place that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stumbled rather than swooned\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>The article also reveals rather unintentionally the issue at the heart of our economy. Yes mining has kept our GDP growing, but the jobs are not flowing as they did previously.</p> <p>In attempting to explain how efficient our mining sector is, McBride notes Rio Tinto\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s use of self-driving trucks and that they \u00e2\u20ac\u0153are 15% cheaper to run than the human operated sort... There are no idle spells between shifts or during breaks, and there is no need to \u00ef\u00ac\u201ay burly men in hard hats up from Perth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Quite \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an efficient economy all without the need for people.</p> <p>The Economist article does at least acknowledge Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s utter lack of a climate change policy under the Liberal party, and also that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153appalling circumstances of many Aboriginals are a national embarrassment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>It also notes that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the right-wing press likes to dwell misleadingly on stories about immigrants and crime. It has stirred up a panic about African gangs in Melbourne, despite scant evidence that any such gangs exist\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. McBride actually paints a more realistic picture of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thriving multicultural society.</p> <p>But there is no mention of the concerns about house prices, housing affordability and our large levels of household debt \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/sep/13/the-housing-boom-is-over-and-we-are-in-huge-danger-o9f-the-economic-tide-turns\">the Reserve Bank has highlighted</a> as a concern should the world economy slow.</p> <p>Yes, Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has done well over the past 25 years, but it seems an odd time to point to the lessons we can show the rest of the world. During the GFC we were indeed the poster boy of how to manage an economy, but ours now, as much as others, is suffering through the new normal of lower growth and flat incomes.</p> <p>Our economy is also more dependent upon fossil fuels than almost any major economy, and yet we continue to do almost the least to reduce our emissions. Of this major economic challenge facing the world and very much this nation, our own Treasury department this week told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/25/australia-urged-to-model-economic-effects-of-15c-and-2c-climate-increases\">the Senate estimates committee</a> it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even doing any modelling on the impact.</p> <p>If anything we can teach the world that short-termism of looking at GDP growth now and ignoring problems bubbling under the surface and looming large on the horizon is the way to go. But I am not sure that is a lesson anyone should wish to learn.</p>",

McBride writes that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153when commodity prices began to slide a few years ago, Townsville\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy was dragged down, too ... unemployment rose from 5% in 2013 to 9% in 2016. Property prices sank\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Except unemployment in Townsville didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t peak in 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it kept going up, reaching an annual average of 11.6% in 2017. It is now back at 9.1%, but consider that in 2013 the unemployment rate in Townsville was 1.4 percentage points lower than the national rate and now it is more than 4 percentage points above it. Not really an example of a place that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stumbled rather than swooned\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The article also reveals rather unintentionally the issue at the heart of our economy. Yes mining has kept our GDP growing, but the jobs are not flowing as they did previously. In attempting to explain how efficient our mining sector is, McBride notes Rio Tinto\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s use of self-driving trucks and that they \u00e2\u20ac\u0153are 15% cheaper to run than the human operated sort... There are no idle spells between shifts or during breaks, and there is no need to \u00ef\u00ac\u201ay burly men in hard hats up from Perth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Quite \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an efficient economy all without the need for people. The Economist article does at least acknowledge Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s utter lack of a climate change policy under the Liberal party, and also that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153appalling circumstances of many Aboriginals are a national embarrassment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It also notes that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the right-wing press likes to dwell misleadingly on stories about immigrants and crime. It has stirred up a panic about African gangs in Melbourne, despite scant evidence that any such gangs exist\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. McBride actually paints a more realistic picture of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thriving multicultural society. But there is no mention of the concerns about house prices, housing affordability and our large levels of household debt \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something that the Reserve Bank has highlighted as a concern should the world economy slow. Yes, Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has done well over the past 25 years, but it seems an odd time to point to the lessons we can show the rest of the world. During the GFC we were indeed the poster boy of how to manage an economy, but ours now, as much as others, is suffering through the new normal of lower growth and flat incomes. Our economy is also more dependent upon fossil fuels than almost any major economy, and yet we continue to do almost the least to reduce our emissions. Of this major economic challenge facing the world and very much this nation, our own Treasury department this week told the Senate estimates committee it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even doing any modelling on the impact. If anything we can teach the world that short-termism of looking at GDP growth now and ignoring problems bubbling under the surface and looming large on the horizon is the way to go. But I am not sure that is a lesson anyone should wish to learn.",

It will come into effect in April 2020 and will raise \u00c2\u00a3400m a year, the chancellor said. Digital tech giants will be taxed 2% on the money they make from UK users.</p> <p>Stella Amiss, head of tax policy at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong words of recent months were no bluff. At home, the confirmation of a new digital services tax was trailed as a step towards levelling the playing field between online retailers and the high street. But it is much more than that. Working out who is taxed and who isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the digital economy is no mean feat when all businesses operate in an increasing technological world.</p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise then that the chancellor has approached this with caution - a narrowly targeted regime, a 2% rate, and an effective implementation date pushed back to 2020. This new tax is well and truly aimed at the tech giants and not the online retailers so will do little to address the woes of bricks and mortar retailers and could well be perceived across the pond as an anti-American measure that could come back to bite us as the UK looks to move to trade talks after the Brexit deadline.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5bd737e8e4b0bda4dc41b9d9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-10-29T16:46:29.408Z\">4.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Duty on beer, cider and spirits has been frozen for a year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while wine wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spared, with duty going up in line with inflation. </p> <p>The Wine and Spirit Trade Association was quick to respond. Its chief executive Miles Beale welcomed the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to freeze duty on spirits, but deplored the increase in wine duty.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The decision by the chancellor to increase wine rates significantly is a hammer blow to this great British industry. It actively undermines a sector that has been hardest hit since the Brexit Referendum and will be thoroughly unwelcome for the 33 million consumers of the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most popular alcoholic drink.</p> <p>This inflationary rise is grossly unfair, unjustified and counter-productive. The UK is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest wine trading nation and, as such, deserves government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support, not punishment.</p> <p>The wine industry is, unfortunately, no stranger to harsh treatment from chancellors. Since 2012 wine overtook beer as the largest contributor to the public purse through duty payments, and no alcoholic drink has paid more to the Treasury since then. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77cc5666ab2d8d318d113aa89914f1734725c572\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77cc5666ab2d8d318d113aa89914f1734725c572/0_127_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bottles of wine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bottles of wine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Regis Duvignau/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-10-29T17:02:09.947Z\">at 5.02pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5bd73274e4b0bda4dc41b978\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-10-29T16:39:26.761Z\">4.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The chancellor has pledged a \u00c2\u00a3675m high street fund and business rates to be cut by a third to help embattled high street retailers.</p> <p>Paul Clement, head of place shaping at property group Savills, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are very pleased that the chancellor has recognised the need to extend an essential lifeline to the British high street.

The SPD, however, remains in an existential crisis which could easily lead to the decision to leave the coalition next year.</p> <p>As historic as today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement is, the approaching end of an era also holds the potential for positive developments. Not so much because new is always better but rather because it could give Merkel the freedom and the tailwind - freed from party ties - to put a final stamp on her legacy, possibly with bolder steps to reform the German economy and the monetary union. </p> <p>Three years of a lame duck government would clearly be harmful, not only for Europe but also for Germany.

It will now be increasingly difficult for her to stay on as Chancellor, and having shown signs of weakness, the wolves may come for her sooner rather than later.</p> <p>Germany has been a cradle of political stability over the last decade, but this now looks to be over. Ms Merkel has been a driving force in Europe, leading the response to major political and economic upheaval like the Eurozone debt crisis. What now remains to be seen is whether her CDU successor has the political will and gravitas on the European stage to hold it together in these testing times.</p> <p>With Brexit imminent and growing controversy around the Italian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending plans, there couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a worse time for Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steady ship to hit choppy waters.

                "bodyText":"It has been a good day for stock markets. In the eurozone, the Dax closed up 1.2% while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC was up 0.4% and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB gained 1.9%. The FTSE 100 index pared some of the gains made before the budget speech when it was up more than 120 points, and closed down 86.76 points at 7026.32, a 1.25% gain. Despite growth upgrades, sterling was little moved by the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech (the growth outlook is still poor by historical standards). The pound slipped a bit more against the dollar, by 0.26% to $1.28, while it remained flat against the euro. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: We got a confident, jocular chancellor and a fair bit of extra cash being splashed around for various departments \u00e2\u20ac\u201c defence, potholes, schools etc. Nothing earth-shatteringly major however. This was a political budget aimed at tackling the Corbyn threat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c end of PFI and a kind of pseudo Google tax. And the elephant in the room was Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it could all change if there is no deal, the odds of which are shortening by the day. We are closing the blog for the day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we will be back tomorrow. Good night. You can read more reaction and analysis on our budget live blog: And here are the key points at a glance: One of the main budget announcements was a new digital services tax, on tech giants such as Google (but not start-ups). It will come into effect in April 2020 and will raise \u00c2\u00a3400m a year, the chancellor said. Digital tech giants will be taxed 2% on the money they make from UK users. Stella Amiss, head of tax policy at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: The chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong words of recent months were no bluff. At home, the confirmation of a new digital services tax was trailed as a step towards levelling the playing field between online retailers and the high street. But it is much more than that. Working out who is taxed and who isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the digital economy is no mean feat when all businesses operate in an increasing technological world. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise then that the chancellor has approached this with caution - a narrowly targeted regime, a 2% rate, and an effective implementation date pushed back to 2020. This new tax is well and truly aimed at the tech giants and not the online retailers so will do little to address the woes of bricks and mortar retailers and could well be perceived across the pond as an anti-American measure that could come back to bite us as the UK looks to move to trade talks after the Brexit deadline. Duty on beer, cider and spirits has been frozen for a year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while wine wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spared, with duty going up in line with inflation. The Wine and Spirit Trade Association was quick to respond. Its chief executive Miles Beale welcomed the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to freeze duty on spirits, but deplored the increase in wine duty. The decision by the chancellor to increase wine rates significantly is a hammer blow to this great British industry. It actively undermines a sector that has been hardest hit since the Brexit Referendum and will be thoroughly unwelcome for the 33 million consumers of the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most popular alcoholic drink. This inflationary rise is grossly unfair, unjustified and counter-productive. The UK is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest wine trading nation and, as such, deserves government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support, not punishment. The wine industry is, unfortunately, no stranger to harsh treatment from chancellors. Since 2012 wine overtook beer as the largest contributor to the public purse through duty payments, and no alcoholic drink has paid more to the Treasury since then. The chancellor has pledged a \u00c2\u00a3675m high street fund and business rates to be cut by a third to help embattled high street retailers. Paul Clement, head of place shaping at property group Savills, says: We are very pleased that the chancellor has recognised the need to extend an essential lifeline to the British high street. Business rate relief alongside a new fund for local authorities to redevelop and transform town centres are just some of the key recommendations made by Savills as part of the evidence submitted to the Housing Communities and Local Government Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (HCLGC) latest government inquiry. Creating places where people want, rather than need to be, can only be achieved through this kind of systemic change. Earlier, Hammond said we are at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pivotal moment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the Brexit talks. If we get it right, there will be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153double Brexit dividend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More investment, currently on hold, will come on stream, and the Treasury will no longer have to hold back money. But the chancellor also said he was increasing the amount of spending for no deal planning to \u00c2\u00a32bn. Markets shrugged off the comments... As to whether the budget commitments are funded whether there is a Brexit deal or not, as No. 10 said today, the chancellor suggested the opposite yesterday. The new UK growth forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, announced by Philip Hammond in his budget speech a few minutes ago, are higher than in March but still dismal. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, tweeted: The speech has had little impact on markets so far. The FTSE 100 index is about 105 points ahead at 7045.42, a 1.5% gain. The pound still 0.2% lower against the dollar at $1.2805, and flat against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1242. In other news, easyJet now expects to be flying electric plans by 2030, pushing back its forecast from 2027, but expressed confidence about a technology that is expected to cut the energy costs of a plane by 30%. The low-cost carrier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive Johan Lundgren told Reuters: We can definitely see a way forward in how we will get this aircraft into the fleet. EasyJet has a partnership with US start-up Wright Electric, which is working on an electric engine for a nine-seater plane that will fly next year, following success with a two-seater, and will also start working on a 50-seater version. The goal is to build battery-propelled aircraft for flights of less than two hours. More importantly, the chancellor has echoed Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the era of austerity is finally coming to an end\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. You can follow the budget speech more closely at our budget live blog: Hammond says the last time a UK budget was presented on a Monday was in 1962, when he was six. He recalls that his parents turned to him and said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Philip, one day that could be you.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And we are off. Philip Hammond has started his budget speech. With the UK budget just a couple of minutes away, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take a quick look at the markets. All the major indices are in the green. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones rose as much as 300 points and is now trading 175 points higher, or 0.7%, at 24,867.62 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c compared with the 27,000 all-time highs at the beginning of the month. The eurozone has shrugged off Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision not to seek re-election as CDU party leader. Markets took comfort from her intention to stay on as chancellor until the next German federal election in 2021. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 1.8% ahead at 11,405.95. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB has rocketed 2.4% as S&amp;P kept Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating unchanged, while the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s battle with the EU over its budget continues. Rome was last week given three weeks to rewrite its draft budget. As for the FTSE, it is trading over 100 points higher at 7051.32, a 1.6% gain. The pound is feeling the pressure of the budget, slipping back under $1.281 against the dollar, down 0.2%. John Flint, the chief executive of HSBC, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank, reckons that the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi is unlikely to hurt Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to attract foreign investors. Flint said this morning: I understand the emotion around the story but it is very difficult to think about disengaging from Saudi Arabia, given its importance to global energy markets. Flint was one of several banking chief executives who pulled out of a major investment conference in Riyadh last week, along with Tidjane Thiam of Credit Suisse, Bill Winters of Standard Chartered and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase. However, Samir Assaf, the head of HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global banking and markets, attended the event. While most western business leaders shunned it, the kingdom managed to get $50bn of deals signed at the investment conference. Flint said: My decision [to pull out] was not an easy decision but I felt it was the right thing to do under the circumstances. But he defended the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to send a less high-profile figure to the conference: We are the biggest foreign bank in Saudi Arabia, so we own 40% of the Saudi British Bank, we have 4,000 employees in the kingdom and we have many customers in the kingdom as well so we have a responsibility to them. Flint hinted at future investment in the Middle East, saying: We are a significant part of the banking system in many parts of the region \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We will build our businesses as the opportunities arise. Here is our full story on the HSBC results, out earlier today. Poland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign minister Jacek Czaputowicz said today that Merkel plays an important role in stabilising the European Union, and expressed support for her to stay on as chancellor. Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision not to seek re-election as CDU party chairwoman which means her fourth term as chancellor will be her last heralds the end of an era in which she has dominated European politics. She became Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chancellor in 2005. The race for a successor to Merkel at the top of the CDU has already started. This morning, three candidates announced their ambitions: Party secretary-general Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer Health minister Jens Spahn Former parliamentary leader when Merkel started as party chair, Friedrich Merz Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany, says the key question is will the new CDU leader move to the political right again or continue Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy of capturing the political centre. Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement remains less of a risk for the German government than the SPD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses in the last elections. The CDU has no interest in Merkel stepping down as chancellor or a snap election before any successor has been able to build up a profile. The SPD, however, remains in an existential crisis which could easily lead to the decision to leave the coalition next year. As historic as today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement is, the approaching end of an era also holds the potential for positive developments. Not so much because new is always better but rather because it could give Merkel the freedom and the tailwind - freed from party ties - to put a final stamp on her legacy, possibly with bolder steps to reform the German economy and the monetary union. Three years of a lame duck government would clearly be harmful, not only for Europe but also for Germany. Somehow, the announced end is typical for the entire era Merkel: unpretentiously pulling the strings. Stefan Koopman, market economist at Rabobank, notes that after the initial shock caused by Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement, the market reaction has been relatively muted as she also said she would like to see her term through to 2021. The CDU is suffering heavy losses in state elections and the opinion polls indicate there is no improvement in sight. It will now be increasingly difficult for her to stay on as Chancellor, and having shown signs of weakness, the wolves may come for her sooner rather than later. Germany has been a cradle of political stability over the last decade, but this now looks to be over. Ms Merkel has been a driving force in Europe, leading the response to major political and economic upheaval like the Eurozone debt crisis. What now remains to be seen is whether her CDU successor has the political will and gravitas on the European stage to hold it together in these testing times. With Brexit imminent and growing controversy around the Italian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending plans, there couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a worse time for Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steady ship to hit choppy waters. This implies more financial market volatility going forward and is another reason to remain bearish about the euro. More on Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to step down as CDU party chair but stay on as Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chancellor until the next national election in 2021. She has argued against splitting the two roles in the past... Her move comes after disastrous regional elections in Hesse and Bavaria for her Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the CSU. Holger Schmieding, economist at Berenberg Bank, says Her first step towards the exit adds to the risk that her coalition partner SPD will walk out of the Berlin coalition in late 2019 upon a mid-term review of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda. If Merkel were to lose her position as chancellor, the most likely outcome would be a CDU/CSU-Green-FDP coalition in Berlin led by somebody else from the CDU or - as a slightly less likely alternative - new elections. Here are the main contenders for the CDU leadership: Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the CDU general secretary, appears to be Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs preferred choice Armin Laschet, prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most populous state, whose experience would make him well suited to lead a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jamaica\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 coalition with the Greens and the FDP Jens Spahn, the more conservative minister for health Friedrich Merz, a conservative who once was Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rival and is reportedly ready to re-enter frontline politics. Other candidates with fewer chances are: Peter Altmaier, the economy minister, Daniel G\u00c3\u00bcnther, the state prime minister of Schleswig Holstein and Julia Kl\u00c3\u00b6ckner, the minister of agriculture. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones climbed about 200 points at the open to 24,922.34, a gain of almost 1%. Wall Street is also expected to rally when trading begins shortly..... European stock markets are pushing higher, as traders try to put the nightmare of October behind then. The FTSE 100 is now up 126 points, or 1.8%, as it bounces back from last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seven-month low. Fiona Cincotta of City Index explains: Strong earnings from banks and positive company news boosted European markets helping them to shrug of the gloom emanating from Asia. HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong results this morning certainly seem to have cheered the City; its shares are now up almost 6%. Markets are up across Europe - bringing some relief to investors, after hitting their lowest levels since December 2016 last week. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX index has jumped by over 2%, led by those car companies. Traders are clearly more excited by Chinese tax cuts than Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political future.... In Milan, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mild jubilation that S&amp;P didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t downgrade Italy on Friday night. Dean Popplewell of trading firm OANDA explains: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year BTP bond yield has fallen to a one-week low this morning, narrowing the gap to the German Bund, on relief that ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s left the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating unchanged. Shares in European carmakers are surging, thanks to a report that China is considering halving the sales tax on most vehicles. The move would help Beijing spur auto sales, as it tries to protect its economy from the chill winds of the US trade war. Bloomberg has more details: The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic planning body submitted a plan to key policymakers to lower the purchase tax to 5 percent for passenger vehicles with engines no bigger than 1.6 liters, according to people familiar with the matter. No decision has been made on implementation, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t public. European car shares have jumped by over 4%, including by Volkswagen (+5.6%), Daimler (+4.6%) and BMW (+4.1%). Elsewhere in the eurozone, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is flying after S&amp;P left the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating unchanged on Friday night. The FTSE MIB has leapt by 2.5%, and Italian government bonds are also rallying. BREAKING: In a major development, Angela Merkel has decided not to stand for re-election as the chair of her CDU party in December. Merkel took her decision after an election drubbing over the weekend, which saw voters in Hesse abandon the CDU in favour of the Green party and the anti-immigrant Alternative f\u00c3\u00bcr Deutschland (AfD). This could trigger a battle to succeed Merkel as Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chancellor, a job she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s held since 2005 (and isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t giving up yet...) Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: German Chancellor Angela Merkel has told leaders of her Christian Democrats (CDU) that she will not seek re-election as party chairwoman at a conference in early December, a senior party source said. Merkel has been CDU chairwoman since 2000 and giving up the role would start a race within the party to succeed her as chancellor. The euro has promptly fallen by 0.4% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.138. Support for the CDU in Hesse fell by 10 percentage points since the last election in 2013 - a major snub by voters. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s left-wing SPD party, who are in coalition with the CDU, also performed badly in Hesse, fuelling speculation that the coalition could collapse. More here: European stock markets are all showing gains this morning. Bank stocks are up, following HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong results, along with healthcare groups and industrial companies. Banking giant HSBC is pulling the London stock market higher, after growing its profits sharply. HSBC shares have leapt by 4% in early trading, after beating City expectations this morning. The bank posted a 16% year-on-year rise in adjusted pre-tax profits to $6.19bn, ahead of its previous forecasts. Revenues rose 8.8% to $13.8bn, as its investment banking and wealth management divisions enjoyed a strong quarter. Three-quarters of HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits came from Asia. This has lifted the FTSE 100 up to 7002 points, up 62 points. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153HSBC may be the second biggest company on the UK stock market, but its profits are predominantly emanating from its historic home in the far east. Three quarters of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits so far this year have come from its Asian operations, leaving the European business trailing in its wake. Profit growth has been broad-based across HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main banking activities, and what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive is that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coming from a rising top line rather than simply cost-cutting, which can only deliver results for so long. Indeed adjusted operating costs have actually ticked up, though that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to support investment in growth opportunities, notably in the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s digital proposition. As an international retail and commercial bank, HSBC is clearly plugged into the global economy, and in particular the fortunes of China and the surrounding area. While in the long term this looks like an ace in the sleeve, investors should expect a bumpy journey, particularly if Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war dents growth in the region.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Last week the US stock markets fell into correction territory, after several heavyweight companies posted disappointing results: David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, says last week was grim: Global stock markets had a terrible time last week as investor sentiment continued to sour. Concerns about higher interest rates in the US, along with political uncertainty in Italy as well as geopolitical concerns played on investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds. Last week, Amazon and Alphabet both released quarterly figures and the revenue components missed market estimates and that added to the decline. The major US indices enjoyed a positive run over the summer, and there was a sense that valuations were lofty, particularly for the tech sector. The S&amp;P 500 is now in correction territory, which means it had fallen more than 10% from the recent peak, and this underlines how large the correction has been. The Shanghai Composite lost over 2% overnight after China confirmed that industrial profit fell for the fifth straight month. Financial blogger Jeroen Blokland says a range of factors have hurt the markets this month. However, that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re facing a repeat of the 2008 crisis. He writes: This chart by Bloomberg shows that global equities have lost almost USD 8 trillion in market cap in October, the worst sell-off since 2008. However, the absolute numbers can be deceptive as the total market capitalization has increased by roughly 50% since start of the financial crisis. But more importantly, while there are definitely a number of factors that are negatively impacting markets (China-US trade war, rising geopolitical risk, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s massive debt pile \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to name just a few), current economic circumstances make it less likely that a crisis like the one in in 2008 will happen now. Of course, things could change quickly, especially if market sentiment remains as depressed as it is now, but this might be a good moment to take a step back and refocus on the fundamentals. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses in China suggest markets have further to fall, warns Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at foreign exchange broker FXTM: The steep sell-off in U.S. equity markets suggests October could be the worst month since the global financial crisis of 2008. Seven trillion dollars have already been wiped from the global market cap, and still there are no signs of bulls returning. Chinese stocks fell today with the CSI 300 declining more than 3% while the Yuan remained trading near a decade low. The Nikkei 225 gave up gains of more than 1% to trade in negative territory. Moving against the trend were stocks in Australia, with the ASX 200 gaining more than 1% supported by the healthcare and telecom sectors. The bears seem well in control of the market and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re many reasons to justify their actions. Whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakening global economic growth, the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, monetary policy tightening, fears of a hard Brexit, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget woes\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and the list goes on. What is more interesting is that investors are even punishing companies that have reported positive earnings surprises. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. October has been a pretty brutal month for the markets. Over the last four weeks, trillions of dollars of value have been wiped off bonds and shares, as nervous investors have sold up. Bloomberg estimates that $8 trillion has been \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclost\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, amid fears over US interest rate hikes, the US-China trade war, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget row and Brexit. That would make October the worst month in a decade, since the collapse of Lehman Brothers. They say: Equities globally have lost almost $8 trillion of value this month, set for the biggest wipeout since the height of the financial crisis a decade ago on concerns ranging from the peak being past for earnings growth to the U.S.-China trade war to the end of central bank quantitative easing. Traders are paring wagers on Fed rate hikes for next year, with markets now expecting fewer than two quarter-point increases in 2019, compared with three that policy makers project. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room for a bit of a downside to go, because I do see this as being largely a structural shift in markets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kyle Rodda, a market analyst at IG Group in Melbourne, said on Bloomberg Television. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sentiment is still to the downside, is still quite bearish and there will be a little while for this correction to play out.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The new week has begun badly in China, where the Shanghai stock market has fallen over 2% today. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a brighter picture in Europe. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 had jumped by 36 points, or 0.5%, after hitting a seven-month low on Friday night. Perhaps the extra hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep has cheered traders up a bit. Also coming up today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget Day in the UK. Chancellor Philip Hammond is expected to announce that the public finances aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as bad as previously thought, clearing the way for more spending on the NHS, help for UK high streets, money to build roads and fix potholes, He could also tighten pension relief limits (taking money from higher earners) and raise income tax personal allowances (handing money back to them). We also get new consumer credit and mortgage approvals figures from the Bank of England The agenda: 9.30am GMT: UK mortgage approvals and consumer credit figures 3.30pm GMT: The Budget speech",

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap Growth in the eurozone has slowed to its lowest level in over four years, as the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery runs out of steam. Eurozone GDP only rose by 0.2% in July-September, down from 0.4% in April-June. Economists say the figures are disappointing, and weaker than expected; they could even precede a wider recession. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate fell to zero, in a blow its new government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to revitalise the economy. France did better, though; its economy grew by 0.4%, thanks to a pick-up in consumer spending and business investment. Barret Kupelian, senior economist at PwC, believes the slowdown could cause the European Central Bank to reconsider ending its asset-purchase stimulus plan in December. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even though these are preliminary figures and are likely to be revised once national authorities release the fuller picture of the quarter, it is now looking unlikely that the Eurozone will reach the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth projections of 2% for 2018. If current trends continue, the ECB could reconsider its future plans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Donald Trump has claimed that the stock market will plunge if his Democratic opponents do well in next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mid-term elections. In the UK, retail sales growth has slowed as consumers cut back after a summer spending splurge. Economists at the IFS have warned that yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK budget represented a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgamble\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with the public finances. The Resolution Foundation have calculated that high earners get the biggest windfall from chancellor Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts: Just in: US consumer confidence remains strong, despite the recent turmoil in the markets. Wall Street has opened cautiously, after a wild day yesterday which saw stocks jump, then plunge in the biggest turnaround in eight months. While the Dow is flat, the technology-focused Nasdaq is in the red as the tech sell-off continues. The broader S&amp;P 500 index has also dipped. Some investment advice from the White House: Fact check: The Dow industrial average is indeed up a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmassive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 35% since November 2016, partly thanks to the sugar-rush of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts and deregulation. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also lost almost 10% of its value in the last four weeks, which is closer to a correction than a pause. Is the sell-off election related? Investors will have noticed that the Democrats have a big poll lead over Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Republicans, a week out from the midterms. If the Democrats win the House of Representative, they could potentially launch impeachment proceedings against the president. But...stock prices also reflect expectations of future profits. And America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade conflict with China has worried investors. So, to be fair, has the prospect of future US interest rate hikes, as Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second tweet points out. Alastair Neame, senior economist at economics consultancy CEBR, is concerned that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has faltered over the summer. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Eurozone growth of 0.2% in Q3 is the slowest rate of expansion since Q2 2014, which indicates that, amongst a range of risks, global trade worries may be having a bigger effect on business confidence than had been expected. With French GDP growth having risen to 0.4%, German growth is now under the spotlight as the currency bloc begins to stagnate.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 German third-quarter GDP is released in mid-November, and Neame fears it could be weak: Despite Germany showing some signs of labour market strength, as unemployment fell to the lowest rate since 1990 (5.1%), the economic outlook is somewhat clouded. The latest business surveys indicate that economic sentiment in Germany has waned as a result of growing global uncertainty. The Ifo business climate index fell for the second consecutive month to 102.8 points in October. Moreover, the decision by Angela Merkel to stand down from her position as head of the Christian Democratic party and not to stand for another term as chancellor in 2021 looks set to add to German business uncertainty. So, with Brexit tensions gripping Europe, and trade wars brewing abroad, CEBR fears the global economy could hit trouble. Cebr estimates that the risk of a global recession in the next two years has risen from a fifth a year ago to a third this autumn. As global business cycles mature, trade conflicts and emerging market crises could combine to tip the world into a downturn exacerbating the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems. Persistent Brexit uncertainty and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade wars are both being blamed for derailing the eurozone recovery, Andy Scott, associate director at independent financial risk management consultancy JCRA, says last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong growth has fizzled out. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Eurozone showed much promise during 2017. It was growing at its fastest pace in years as consumer spending was driving domestic demand. The low value of the Euro supported export growth and monetary stimulus boosted financial conditions. In the second half of 2017 the Eurozone economy grew 2.8% year-on-year; by comparison in the third quarter of this year it managed just 1.7%. The preliminary data on the current quarter points to even weaker growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The data appears to show how Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade measures, a lack of clarity over Brexit and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget dispute have resulted in significant loss of momentum for Eurozone economies, despite domestic conditions remaining favourable. So far, the EU has no real response to the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153America first policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This alongside a significant fiscal stimulus in the form of tax cuts, has materially boosted US economic growth, while global growth is slowing. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump into stagnation has raised fresh fears over its spending plans. Italian government bond prices have weakened this morning, pushing up the yield (or interest rate) on the debt. That shows traders see Italy as a riskier bet, especially if the row over its 2019 budget escalates. That budget assumes growth of 1.5% in 2019 - nearly double what Italy has managed in the last 12 months. Rome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing plans already breach EU rules; if the economy is smaller, then the deficit will be an even larger share of GDP. On the other hand, Italy could argue for a Keynesian fiscal stimulus to jump-start the economy. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not how Brussels sees things. It seems likely that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is being hurt by rising trade protectionism. America slapped tariffs on European steel imports this summer, prompting Brussels to hit back with levies on UA goods. The tit-for-tat tariffs imposed between Washington and Beijing is also hurting global trade. Associated Press explains: Eurostat did not provide details as to why growth slowed so much. They will emerge in an updated estimate in mid-November. But the figures are likely to fuel concerns that trade tensions around the world, notably between the U.S. and China, are having a debilitating impact on global trade. Much of the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth is based on exports, notably from Germany. Nicola Nobile, lead eurozone economist at Oxford Economics, says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transitory factors, particularly in Germany\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is dragging eurozone growth back. That includes a big slowdown at German car makers, who are struggling to adjust to new pollution tests introduced after the Volkswagen emissions scandal. In another blow, economic confidence across Europe has declined. The European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic sentiment index has dropped to 109.8 this month, down from 110.9 in September. Firms reported that the business climate has deteriorated this month, which suggests the eurozone economy is continuing to weaken. The Financial Times says that eurozone growth \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stumbled in the third quarter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, increasing at a far weaker pace than expected. These eurozone growth figures are a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmassive disappointment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, says ING economist Bert Colijn. He writes: Eurozone GDP growth in 3Q came in at just 0.2% and while one-off factors have influenced the number, it does not seem that growth will return to previous rates anytime soon. In Germany, disrupted car production will have dampened GDP growth significantly in the third quarter, weighing on the eurozone average. French GDP growth was stronger than in the first half of the year, mainly led by a consumption growth recovery, although the 0.4% increase did miss analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations. Perhaps more worrying was the stagnation of growth in Italy, which was the first time in four years that the economy did not post growth over a quarter. With budget discussions already tense between Rome and Brussels, this stagnation will only add to concerns. Katharina Uterm\u00c3\u00b6hl, senior economist for Europe at Allianz SE, says this is the weakest growth in four years: Aila Mihr of Danske_Research reckons it could force the European Central Bank to downgrade its growth forecasts. Eurozone growth has now slumped to its slowest rate since the second quarter of 2014. The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual growth rate has also fallen sharply, to 1.7% compared with 2.2% a quarter ago. NEWSFLASH: Growth in the eurozone has halved, to just 0.2% in the last three months. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sharp slowdown compared to the second quarter of 2018, and will fuel fears that the eurozone economy is faltering. Economist had expected growth of around 0.4%, so this is quite disappointing. Growth in the wider European Union also faltered, from 0.5% to 0.3%. The slowdown is partly due to the stagnation in Italy, but the weakness also goes deeper. As France grew by 0.4%, this suggests Germany may have stumbled too (we get German GDP next month) Reaction to follow! Bloomberg says that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian growth report is a blow to Rome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new leadership: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy stalled for the first time in almost four years, putting pressure on the populist government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambitious spending plans. The stagnation in the third quarter followed growth of 0.2 percent in the previous three months and it leaves Italy as the underperformer among the euro area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major economies.... Statistics agency Istat in its preliminary report cited a contraction in industrial sectors for the weak performance. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey was for expansion of 0.2 percent. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is looking for a major boost from its economic program, aiming to increase employment while letting thousands of workers retire earlier. However, the plan includes letting the deficit widen to 2.4 percent of output next year and has run into a firm \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the European Union. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has now lurched into the red, as today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak growth figures shock investors. The FTSE MIB index has fallen by 137 points, or 0.8%, to 18,900 points. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new coalition government only took control of the economy in June, so they must be disappointed that growth has promptly fizzled out. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even chatter that Italy could be flirting with another recession. Italian industry contracted in the last quarter, according to stats body Istat, helping to drag growth down to zero. Domestic demand and net exports were both flat. Agriculture, forestry and fishing, and services all made a positive contribution (but not enough to actually grow the Italian economy). On an annual basis, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy only grew by 0.8% in the last year, down from 1.0%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a thoroughly underwhelming result. BREAKING: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy stagnated in the last quarter, with no growth at all. Italian GDP was flat in the third quarter of 2018, compared with Q2, new figures show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a disappointment -- economists had expected growth of up to 0.2%. This comes as Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s populist government struggles to get its budget plans past Brussels. Rome may argue that such weak growth shows why it must borrow and invest more. But it may also show that consumers and businesses are nervous, lacking the confidence to spend.... Newsflash: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency has dropped to its lowest level in a decade, as Beijing wrestles with its economic slowdown. The yuan has been officially fixed at \u00c2\u00a56.9574 to the US dollar, its cheapest since the financial crisis of 2008. This will make Chinese exports more competitive overseas, helping them overcome America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs. That might fuel claim that China is devaluing its currency. However, Beijing seems to have actually been trying to support the yuan, in the face of concerns that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is slowing. Economist Shaun Richards points out that France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual growth rate has dipped, despite picking up in the last quarter. European stock markets have opened a little higher, as investors take today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s French growth figures in their stride. Royal Bank of Canada predict that German factories dragged eurozone growth down in the last quarter They writes: Our economists are looking for 0.4% growth, quarter-on-quarter, in the eurozone, in line with the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff forecasts. Manufacturing looks set to exert a large drag on activity in Germany this quarter. French consumers spent more on travel over the summer, helping to grow the economy. Transport expenses \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bounced back markedly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Q3, rising by 3.7%, stats body INSEE says. That follows a 2.9% slump in Q2, blamed on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strikes in rail transport\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Unions brought commuter services to a standstill several times this spring, in a row over plans to open the railways up to competition. Takeover News: Asian noodle bar chain Wagamama is being bought by the company behind the Frankie &amp; Benny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Chiquito brands. The Restaurant Group (TRG) is gobbling up Wagamama for a cash payment of \u00c2\u00a3357m, funded by a new \u00c2\u00a3315m rights issue. Andy McCue, CEO of TRG, says: Wagamama is a fantastic brand, with a market leading pan-Asian proposition, which has consistently outperformed the casual dining market in recent years. Central to this success has been a cohesive culture and clear brand values which are focused on making the right choices for customers. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a turnaround for TRG, which suffering from falling sales last year as consumers have cut back. The deal gives Wagamama an enterprise value (including debt) of \u00c2\u00a3559m. Economist and eurozone-watcher Fred Ducrozet says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s French GDP report looks healthy, even though growth wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as fast as hoped: This chart from Nadia Gharbi of Pictet Asset Management shows how domestic spending boosted the economy: French families helped drive growth over the summer, with household consumption jumping by 0.5% in Q3 (following a 0.1% drop in the second quarter). Business investment surged by 1.4%, following a 1.3% rise in Q2 -- indicating that firms have been stumping up for new factories and machinery. Net trade also boosted growth - Imports slowed to +0.3%, while exports rose by 0.7%. However, firms did run down their inventories, suggesting they were deferring some spending. Newsflash: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy accelerated over the summer, but not by as much as expected. French GDP rose by 0.4% in the third quarter of 2018, according to new figures from statistics body INSEE. Consumer spending and business investment pushed growth up. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twice as fast as in April-June, when France only posted measly growth of 0.2%. However, economists polled by Reuters had expected growth of 0.5%. More to follow! Good morning. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about to discover how the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is performing, in the face of economic and political threats at home and abroad. New GDP figures for France, Italy, and the wider euro area for the third quarter of 2018 are released today. Economists predict that eurozone growth remained subdued in the third quarter, buffeted by America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s belligerence over trade war, Brexit uncertainty, and the Italian budget spat - to name just three threats. Economists predict that eurozone growth came in around 0.4% in July-September, matching the modest expansion in April-June. But some in the City fear that growth may have dipped to 0.3% on a quarterly basis. Any growth is better than none, but such a slowdown would be worrying, both for European jobs and prosperity and the wider global economy. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get separate German growth figures today (boo!), but Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy is releasing new unemployment stats. Also coming up The financial markets remain febrile, with traders looking increasingly shell-shocked after a wild October. Yesterday the Dow suffered its biggest intraday swing since February, rocked by rumours that America could impose even more tariffs on China. European markets are expected to dip, after a strong day yesterday.

                "bodyText":"Be gone, October! Wall Street has closed for the day, and the month, with a two-day rally. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 had both gained around 1% as the closing bell rang. The Nasdaq jumped by 2%, driven by the revival in FAANG stocks. Slightly worryingly, the rally did soften in the last few minutes (like a chocolate in the warm hand of a trick-or-treater). And the monthly losses are still alarming. The S&amp;P fell almost 7% in October, its worst month since 2011. The Dow shed 5%, its roughest month since January 2016. The Nasdaq had a real month to forget, down over 9% in its worst month since November 2008. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an up-sum of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading in London, from Fiona Cincotta of City Index: The FTSE rallied for a third straight session on Wednesday despite a stronger pound, jumping 115 points after a dismal October. October is traditionally a difficult month for equities but the FTSE shedding 4.8% is a significantly larger drop than what we would normally expect. How the beginning of November pans out will be interesting. Of the geopolitical issues which have be weighing on the market, namely Brexit, the Italian standoff with Brussels over spending, the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sino trade war or the slowing global, none have been resolved and we also have the US mid-term elections thrown into the mix. Gains were broad based on the FTSE with Standard Chartered a notable riser following impressive results with profits surging 37% on last year. Standard Chartered reported a pre-tax profit of $1.06 billion, up from $774 million a year before and 9% ahead of estimates. By focusing on what is does best \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Asia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the bank has managed to sharpen its competitive edge. Costs have been a concern in previous years, but the bank has shown its capabilities at reigning these in. Next fell following lacklustre results. The bellwether dropped close to 3% after results underwhelmed. The retailer confirmed that in store sales fell further in the third quarter, whilst overall sales grew by 2% thanks to a strong performance in online sales. Back in New York, tech shares are still on a tear - pushing the Nasdaq up by almost 3% today. By my maths, that still leaves the Nasdaq down 8% for the month. Good news: October is over, at least for traders in Europe. Better news: European stock markets have all ended today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session higher, clawing back some of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the closing prices: UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100: UP 92 points or 1.3% at 7,128 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: UP 160 points or 1.4% at 11,447 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: UP 51 points of 2.3% at 5,093 That still means European stocks have lost around 5% of their value this month. Could the worst be over? Possibly, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that nothing has really changed. All the factors blamed for the sell-off - from US interest rate policy to the Italian budget row - are in place. On the other hand, maybe there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relief that the earnings season hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been worse. Neil Wilson of Markets.com has a good take: Earnings are not universally strong and outlooks have betrayed some murkiness. But, on the whole, we have more companies beating earnings estimates than missing, and more than the average. Fundamentals are still strong but there are questions about earnings growth from here. So, if the US-China trade war pushes prices up (inflationary), and US wage growth picks up (also inflationary), does the Federal Reserve keep hiking? Or does it hold off, to protect asset prices? Wilson says: The stock market is telling the Fed to stop raising rates. Janet Yellen has come out to urge the Fed to keep to its course, but the signs are the equity market is highly susceptible to a more aggressive course of hiking. The Fed has been here before \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the question is do we get 1998 Greenspan Fed that listens to the equity market, or 2007/08 Bernanke Fed? October was a horrid month despite the gains of the last two days. We could see seasonal factors support further gains into the year-end but the primary trend could remain bearish.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Dow is holding onto its gains, now up 286 points (+1.15%) at 25,160 points. Wall Street traders are doing their best to end October on a positive note. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent results from GM, and strong ADP jobs figures, seem to be helping. October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s volatility probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spook the Federal Reserve out of raising US interest rates again in December. Capital Economics expect Fed chair Jay Powell will pave the way for a pre-Christmas hike, arguing: Although the Fed is unlikely to make any policy changes at next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, we expect the statement to reiterate the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to continue gradually raising interest rates, with the next move coming in December. With the latest data showing that activity has continued to expand at a rapid pace, hopes that the recent plunge in the stock market will prompt a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPowell put\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 are likely to prove misplaced. The US dollar is also surging today, making gains against emerging market currencies such as the Brazilian real and the Turkish lira. Last night, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg hailed the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcStories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 product as a key future source of growth, and admitted Facebook has reached saturation point in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153developed countries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Facebook missed analyst forecasts for revenue growth (despite pulling in 33% more than a year ago), but smashed forecasts for earnings. Wall Street is giving Facebook the thumbs-up today, with Royal Bank of Canada providing a list of five reasons to be bullish: Facebook stills owns two of the largest media assets in the world (Facebook and Instagram) and the two largest messaging assets in the world (Messenger &amp; WhatsApp); Our checks and management commentary suggest no material change in Marketer views of the attractiveness of Facebook platforms; Monetization of core Facebook and Instagram assets still has material upside potential and Messenger and WhatsApp are beginning early stages of monetization; Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aggressive investments are improving platform security and creating future revenue streams; Even under pressure, Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s producing impressive growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Richard Dickie Hodges, Manager of Nomura Global Dynamic Bond fund, blames US interest rate rise fears for October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market slump. Getting firmly into the Halloween spirit, he writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Federal Reserve remains the biggest, scariest vampire in the markets today. As it sucks the life-blood of investment markets with interest rate rises, the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153risk-free rate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd becomes more attractive, the cost of funding risk rises and all risky assets must adjust to offer higher returns. In other words, they must sell off. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBut our Nosferatu is a complex villain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it cares deeply for its victim. As rates climb, it forces volatility into the stock markets, especially emerging markets with US dollar funding requirements that fear the higher greenback. It is this volatility that may cause the Fed to slow or pause the blood-letting in 2019.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Halloween is a time for fangs, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appropriate that the FAANG stocks are rallying in New York. With Facebook now up 6.8%, Netflix also up 6.8%, Amazon up 4% and Alphabet up over 3.1%, technology stocks are in demand. But this treat comes after a very tricky October, which saw tech stocks slump by around 10% during the month. Microsoft is leading the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally, up 3%, followed by credit card firm VISA (+2.7%), industrial equipment firm Caterpillar (+2.4%) and Apple (+2.1%). There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Happy Halloween spirit on the New York stock exchange, as the final trading day of a brutal October kicks off. The Dow Jones industrial average has leapt by 251 points, or 1%, to 25,125. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on top of Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 400-point leap, and might cheer spirits on Wall Street. But it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fix October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad losses on its own. The Nasdaq index has surged by 1.6%, as technology stocks rally. Facebook shares have jumped by 5%, as investors show they like last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results from the social network giant. General Motors have surged by 6%, after beating profit and revenue estimates today. European markets are still sharply higher, as traders prepare for Wall Street to open.... Global stock markets is up 0.6% already today, thanks to gains in Asia and Europe. The MSCI All Country World Index has risen to 481.03 points, up from 478 last night. But October has still been a pretty horrific month for stocks. The ACWI ended September at 524 points, meaning it has lost over 8% this month. In points terms, this looks like the biggest destruction of value since the financial crisis of 2008. In percentage terms, it looks like the worst month since May 2012 (when the ACWI fell from 328 points to 297, down 9.4%). The US president reckons shares are going up again today... Boom! The FTSE 100 just nudged a new three-week high after a strong morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip index is now up 113 points, or almost 1.67%, at 7153 points, as traders try to shake off their October blues. Mining groups such as Antofagasta and Glencore are among the top risers, along with equipment rental firm Ashtead and banking group Standard Chartered (after its strong results this morning). Retailers are struggling, though, after Next reported slower growth this morning. Remember: The FTSE 100 started the month over 7,500 points, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still down 5% this month alone. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says traders are hoping for peace in the global trade wars: The unspooked celebrations continued on Wednesday, the markets wringing all they can from Donald Trump commenting on Tuesday that a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgreat deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with China is on its way, undoing some of the renewed trade war fears that had hit on Monday night. With basically every major sector in the green \u00e2\u20ac\u201c spare a thought for Next, languishing at the bottom of the index following its latest high street woes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the FTSE could jump more than 100 points as the day progressed. That lifted it above 7150 for the first time in 3 weeks, the index scraping off the top layer of October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses while coming nowhere close to mounting a full on recovery. Another reason for optimism: Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy expanded by 0.1% in August, a better performance than expected. Newsflash: American companies took on staff at a healthy pace this month. US firms created 227,000 new jobs this month, beating expectations of 189,000 fresh hires. Services companies led the way, expanding their payrolls by 189,000 to the total while construction and manufacturing firms both hired 17,000 new workers. That suggests the US economy remains robust, and could mean this Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll (employment report) is strong too. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little early for 2019 market predictions, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll make an exception for this one: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Happy Halloween for carmaker General Motors, which has just smashed Wall Street expectations. GM has also raised expectations for the months ahead, which should cheer US investors. Reuters has the details: General Motors on Wednesday posted far stronger-than-expected quarterly profit and said its full-year earnings forecast would come in at the high end of its forecast due to strong demand in North America. The Detroit automaker reported third-quarter net income of $2.53 billion, or $1.75 a share, compared with a loss last year of $2.98 billion, or $2.03 a share. Last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarter included a charge related to Europe. Excluding one-time items, GM earned $1.87 a share in the third quarter, easily beating the $1.25 analysts polled by Refinitiv estimates had expected. Revenue in the quarter rose 6.4 percent to $35.8 billion, above the $34.85 billion analysts had expected. A quick catch-up on the markets: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100: Up 105 points or 1.5% at 7141, a 3-week high Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stoxx 600: Up 5 points or 1.6% at 361, a nine-day high Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei: Closed 463 points higher at 21,920, up 2.16% China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite index: Closed 35 points higher at 2,602, up 1.35% The latest inflation data has given eurozone policymakers a Halloween headache. Consumer prices across the single-currency bloc rose by 2.2% this month, the fastest rate since 2014, up from 2.1% in September Core inflation, which measures underlying price pressures, jumped to 1.1% from 0.9% a month ago. That suggests the European Central Bank is right to rein in its stimulus plans, and halt bond-buying at the end of 2018. However, we learned yesterday that the eurozone economy slowed sharply over the summer -- which might mean more stimulus is needed. Separately, unemployment rate across the eurozone was unchanged last month at 8.1%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the joint-lowest rate in a decade, but also much higher than America (3.7%) and the UK (4%). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a grim day for UK butchers chain Crawshaw Group. The supplier of sausages, chops, joints and pies is falling into administration. This puts 600 jobs at risk across 54 stores, which could close unless a buyer can be found. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: The Yorkshire-based company, which was founded in 1954, has been talking to investors over the past month but has failed to raise the funds it needed. It expects to appoint administrators later on Wednesday who will then try to find buyers for the business and its assets. Crawshaw has 42 high street stores and 12 factory outlet stores across the Midlands and the north of England. Full marks to the Bond Vigilante\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team at M&amp;G, who have produced some spooktacular charts today. The first shows the remorseless march of US student debt, which has tripled over the last decade. Laura Frost, fixed interest investment specialist at M&amp;G, says this debt burden can undermine the wider economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153US Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell recently warned about the ever-increasing amount of US student debt outstanding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You do stand to see longer-term negative effects on people who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay off their student loans. It hurts their credit rating, it impacts the entire half of their economic life.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Student debt also impacts the overall economy: as graduates seek to repay their loans, they are forced to make concessions to their financial consumption, leading to an ever-growing drag on the economy. They buy fewer goods and services and are delayed in joining the housing ladder, with many choosing (or having) to rent instead. On top of this, student debt sees the highest 90+ day delinquency rate of all US consumer credit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Readers of a nervous disposition should take a deep breath, before looking at the next chart -- the interest rate on longterm US bonds. After falling steadily for decades, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s started going up! Frost explains why it matters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The long-end of the US Treasury market has often been described as a giant anaconda: it draws little attention as it sleeps most of the time, but the minute it wakes up, everybody around shakes. US 30-year bonds don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bite, but their moves can be as poisonous as they basically determine millions of mortgage rates, as well as the price that governments and companies around the world pay for debt. The 30-year Treasury yield has remained within the support and resistance level shown for over 30 years, rallying 6% over the period and giving investors a long bull run. Does the recent breach through this level mean that the anaconda is beginning to stir?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Finally, a picture that might scare Donald Trump - it shows how US central bankers have struggled to maintain full employment, without triggering a recession. Frost explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With US unemployment at rock-bottom levels and the stock market at near record highs, the Fed has begun hiking rates in an attempt to engineer a soft landing: it wants to slow the economy enough to avoid an overheating, but not so much that it causes a recession. How many times over the past 70 years has the Fed successfully managed to do this and return unemployment (green line) back up to its natural level (blue line) without a recession ensuing (vertical bars)? You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be scared after counting\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The slump in Red October has dragged many global stock markets into negative territory for this year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a selection of the best and worst performers in 2018: Bovespa Stock Index (Brazil) +9.7% NASDAQ 100 +6.5% (US) Dow Jones Industrial Average (US) +0.6% S&amp;P 500 +0.3% (US) Nikkei 225 (Japan) -3.7% CAC 40 (Paris) -4.5% FTSE 100 (UK) -7.3% DAX Xetra (Germany) -11.4% Hang Seng (Hong Kong) -16.5% SSE Composite (China) -22.3% But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still time for a turnaround. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says: The markets are racing ahead following a very good session last night in the US where the S&amp;P, Nasdaq and Dow Jones all posted gains in excess of 1.5%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now the turn of European and Asian stocks to join the rally with the FTSE 100 shooting up 1.5% in early trading on Wednesday and Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei 225 index jumping 2.2%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest rally means the S&amp;P, NASDAQ and Dow Jones are all back in positive territory for the year. The only other major index to share this status is Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bovespa index, up 9.7% so far this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The upturn in the market is positive for investors, although the main UK indices still have some way to go before they get back into the black. The FTSE 100 is currently down 7.3% year-to-date, and the FTSE 250 down 8.7%. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says markets may be turning the corner, after a rough October: Asia markets managed to close out the month of October and post their second consecutive day of gains in what has been a pretty poor month for equity markets in general. This rebound could well be down to some end of month position adjusting, however there have been some indications in the past few days that we might be starting to see a bit of a short term base, with most of the bad news already priced in to some extent. American\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get enough of Halloween, so Wall Street is eager to join today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the pre-market calls from CMC Markets: Dow Jones is expected to open 136 points higher at 25,010 S&amp;P500 is expected to open 18 points higher at 2,700 The FTSE 100 is continuing to push higher. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now up 115 points, or 1.6% to 7150. Nearly every sector is up, led by manufacturers, energy firms, tech stocks and banks: Here are the top risers on the Footsie this morning However, this still leaves the FTSE 100 nursing a 5% loss for October (it started the month at 7,510). Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Halloween rally, global markets are still on track for their worst month since the financial crisis. Figures calculated earlier this week showed that $8 trillion had been wiped off global stocks in October. Trade wars, the slowdown in China, tensions in the eurozone and Brexit have all encouraged investors to ditch risky stocks. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: Smart money is running for the hill and this was the message which October brought for the global equity market. Global stocks lost over $8 trillion in October, a headline which suits the best on the Halloween day. Investors are refusing to be spooked on Halloween, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEX: With October containing as much red as the goriest of slasher flicks, the markets oddly chose to rebound on what would have been an entirely calendar-appropriate day to continue the month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading horrors. Building on Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, the FTSE shot up 1.3% after the bell, allowing the index to cross 7100 for the first time in 3 weeks. It benefited from the market-wide shift in sentiment, which itself came despite further evidence that the trade war is hurting the Chinese economy, as the country suffered a slide in manufacturing activity. Overnight, China got the shivers, as manufacturing activity fell and the yuan was fixed at a new 10-year low to the dollar. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally is welcome, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not enough to wipe out this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. October has been particularly bad for US investors, with the main indices falling sharply. CNBC has crunched the numbers, and explains: After Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comeback, the Dow is down 5.9 percent this month, still its worst performance since August 2015. The S&amp;P 500 is off by 7.9 percent in October, on track for its worst month since May 2010. On Monday, the S&amp;P 500 closed in correction territory, down 10.2 percent from its record. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Obviously we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a correction phase of the stock market and I think investors have to realize that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The monetary environment has changed. As you can see, even with a 10 percent change in the stock markets, interest rates have barely moved lower.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European stocks are all jumping - fortunately not with fright. Weeeee! The FTSE 100 is flying faster than a rocket. The blue-chip index has gained 88 points, or 1.2%, to 7124, clawing back some of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Bank Standard Chartered is leading the charge, up 4% after reporting that profits rose from $557m to $752m in the last quarter. Retailer Next is struggling, though, down almost 5%. Next reported that full priced shares are up 2% year-on-year, but retail sales (at its high street stores) have plunged by 8.0% in the last quarter. Online sales growth has slowed, to just +12.7% compared to +14.8% in the year to date. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Halloween - a dark time of ritual, dressing-up, and trick-or-treating. But any children touring the City of London must make a special effort to scare investors; they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re well used to shocks and scares this month. October has been a torrid month for equities. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has shed 6% over the last 30 days, even hitting a 22-month low last week, as global markets took a collective chilly bath. If you really want to make a investor quiver, wave a chart showing how world markets have lose almost 8.5% this month, wiping out trillions of dollars of value. Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says there is fear on the trading floors: October has well and truly lived up to its chilling reputation, with stock markets around the globe suffering one of their worst months in recent memory. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a wild ride for investors and there is no guarantee it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over yet. Markets may have recovered their early losses and some indices may even be in the green for the week but volatility has not eased and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a concern. But after a month of gory red, things might be turning. Wall Street rallied last night, with the Dow gaining more than 400 points. Stocks have strengthened in Asia too, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei gaining 2% and China up nearly 1.5%. Thea main European markets are also up in early trading. There are still reasons to hide under the bedsheets, though. Yesterday, we learned that eurozone growth has halved. Later today we get fresh unemployment and inflation figures for the eurozone. David Madden of CMC Markets says this data could set the mood for the day, and beyond: The stand-off between the Italian government and the EU continues. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew 0.8% in the third-quarter on an annual basis, which was below the forecast of 0.9%. Matteo Salvini, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s joint deputy prime minister claimed the underwhelming update is a reason the government needs to increase spending, and in turn increase the budget deficit. The Italian situation could spark another round of the eurozone debt crisis, and given that the country has the third-largest government bond market in the world, the fallout could be enormous. Dealers will be keeping an eye out for the eurozone CPI and unemployment reports which are due out at 10am (UK time). The CPI rate is tipped to be 2.2%, and the jobless rate is expected to hold steady at 8.1%.
