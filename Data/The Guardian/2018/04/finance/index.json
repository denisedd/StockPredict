It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still early in the US trading session however.</p> <p>The attraction of the music-streaming service probably lies in Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong market share and rapidly growing revenues. It may be some time before Spotify actually turns a profit though, as the company is resolutely prioritising growth over profit, and will be channelling money into investing in services and building further scale.</p> <p>Unlike its main competitors Apple and Amazon, Spotify is focused on music streaming, so it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t benefit from the network effects of a wider ecosystem.

                "bodyText":"And finally, Spotify has closed at $149 per share. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a drop from its opening level of $165.9, but still 13% above the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreference price\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of $132. That values Spotify at around $26.6bn, more than some analysts had suggested before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our tale of the latest tech float: Goodnight! GW A recovery rally on Wall Street has helped the US stock market recover a chunk of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls. The Dow Jones industrial average has closed 1.65% higher, up 389 points at 24,033 - having lost over 450 points yesterday. Traders were encouraged by reports that the White House was not planning action against Amazon. Spotify may have bucked the trend with its direct listing, but its ownership structure is depressingly familiar, says our financial editor Nils Pratley. Its founders are wedded to keeping vice-like control via a share structure with unequal voting rights. For unequal, read unfair: Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzen own 38.9% of the ordinary shares but they have created \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beneficiary certificates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with super-charged voting rights that only they can own. Include those holdings and Ek and Lorentzen have 80.4% of the votes. As the prospectus is obliged to concede: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If our founders act together, they will have control over the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of directors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Put another way, for as long as the duo stick together, they are unsackable. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, says Spotify has a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgreat story\u00e2\u20ac\u2122; even so, people should be cautious when investing. He explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSpotify is floating on the stock market at a pretty inauspicious time for the tech industry, which has been rocked by the Facebook data scandal and now potentially faces greater regulation as a result. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweeted attacks on Amazon don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help lift sentiment towards the sector either. Despite the downbeat mood music, Spotify shares changed hands on the market at a substantial premium to the highest price previously paid in private transactions, indicating significant investor demand for the stock. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still early in the US trading session however. The attraction of the music-streaming service probably lies in Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong market share and rapidly growing revenues. It may be some time before Spotify actually turns a profit though, as the company is resolutely prioritising growth over profit, and will be channelling money into investing in services and building further scale. Unlike its main competitors Apple and Amazon, Spotify is focused on music streaming, so it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t benefit from the network effects of a wider ecosystem. However the company has already carved out a dominant role, and has demonstrated its ability to leverage scale by renegotiating agreements with music labels, boosting its gross margin from 12% to 21% since 2015. The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Danni Hewson is impressed by the streaming service\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening debut: Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alex Webb points out that Spotify is now worth more than some established players (despite having never made a profit!) Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some video of the moment Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares joined the market: Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are bouncing around in early trading, as investors weigh up whether to buy in at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening price. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just slipped below $164, from the opening price of $165.9. Early days, though.... The Wall Street Journal says Spotify has hit the markets with a bang: Spotify Technology roared onto the public market Tuesday as the music-streaming giant pulled off an unusual method of going public. The stock opened at $165.90 and traded in a close range immediately after. With an opening value of $29.55 billion, Spotify is poised to become the third-largest U.S.-listed tech IPO on record, according to Dealogic. That \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunusual method\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 involved spurning the investment banks who would have underwritten the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares (providing a safety net for the market debut), in return for a large fee. AT LAST! Spotify is finally trading, after more than three hours of intense discussions on the Wall Street trading floor. Shares have opened for trading at $165.90, sharply higher than the $132 which had been suggested. That, by my maths, values Spotify at around $29.5bn. I imagine the company should be pretty pleased - this is a sharp jump on the value of its shares earlier this year (when they could only be traded privately between shareholders). On a lighter note, the New York Stock Exchange has confirmed that it accidentally flew a Swiss flag to mark Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing -- which is unfortunate as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually a Swedish company. More here: Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely market valuation is pushing closer to $30bn, as its unconventional \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdirect listing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 continues to play out on the trading floor There are 178.1 million Spotify shares in existence (although the company is only offering around a third to New York investors today). So if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing hits $170, as seems possible, the company could be worth several billion dollars more than forecast. Market makers on Wall Street are continuing to haggle over Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s valuation, pushing its likely share price value even higher: After a edgy day, European stock markets have closed mostly in the red. The escalation of tensions between China and the US over tariffs hit sentiment in the City, and beyond, as traders returned to their desks after the Easter break. Anxiety over the tech sector also weighed on shares, despite the interest in Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing in New York, and Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upbeat statement. The slowdown in eurozone factory growth last month also didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide traders with any fresh optimism. So, the FTSE 100 finished 26 points lower, or 0.4%, at 7,030. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX shed almost 0.7%, but France was calmer and Italy actually rallied a little. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, thinks Europe could be a safe-haven from some of the turbulence in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets. It was a rough start to the second quarter for European equities. Still, next to the losses seen on Wall Street on Monday, the damage in Europe was contained. Europe is out of the firing line for Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs for now and has a lower weighting in technology companies compared to the US. Both factors make Europe a relative haven from the current negative news flow. Higher still and higher.... Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are now seen opening at $150-$160 - indicating that its stock market listing is going well. Wall Street is pushing higher in volatile trading. The Dow is now up 256 points, or 1% -- which would recover around half of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153investors continue to process the latest chess-moves in the nascent trade war between China and the US,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, so this bounce-back might be fragile. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is 0.2% higher, partly thanks to Tesla which is rallying after sticking to its pledge to more than double production of its Model 3 by the end of June. Those early prices suggest that Spotify could be worth around $27bn, I think. Not too shabby, given the company hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t made a profit out of its 157 million customers. Ooooh - Spotify is being priced at between $145 and $155 per share. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than the $132 which had been pencilled in. This delay is because the company decided not to use investment banks to underwrite its offering -- saving it millions of dollars in fees. So, if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing goes smoothly, other companies might consider taking the same track. Donald Trump is refusing to back down in his fight against Amazon, and just fired off a new tweet: Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market listing is underway...but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what price its shares are trading at yet. Wall Street has opened a little higher, as traders hope to recovery from Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. The Dow has gained 0.5% in early trading, up 123 points at 23,767 Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some early reaction to Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new production numbers: Just in: Electric carmaker Tesla has just released its latest eagerly-awaited production figures, which confirm rumours that it has missed some of its own targets. Tesla says it produced 34,494 vehicles in the last three months, 40% more than the final quarter of 2017. This makes January-March \u00e2\u20ac\u0153by far the most productive quarter in Tesla history\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it says. This includes 9,766 Model 3s (Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new model), and 24,728 were Model S and Model X vehicles. Tesla also reveals that it has ramped up production recently -- amid reports that founder Elon Musk has taken personal control of car output in recent days (and even been sleeping at the factory). The company says: In the past seven days, Tesla produced 2,020 Model 3 vehicles. In the next seven days, we expect to produce 2,000 Model S and X vehicles and 2,000 Model 3 vehicles. It is a testament to the ability of the Tesla production team that Model 3 volume now exceeds Model S and Model X combined. What took our team five years for S/X, took only nine months for Model 3. However, Musk had previously aimed to produce 2,500 Tesla 3 cars each week by now. So Tesla hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hit that goal yet. But crucially, it says it still aims to get production of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc3\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 model up to 5,000 per week in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcabout\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 three months. Shares are rallying in pre-market trading - up around 6% Spotify logos have sprung up at Wall Street, ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing: New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market may claw back some of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses when trading resumes in under an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. The Dow Jones index is expected to rise by 0.6%, or around 140 points, judging by the futures markets. That would take a small bite out of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout, when it lost over 450 points (and was down 730 points at one stage). Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA says the markets are still nervous, though: The second quarter got off to a rough start on Monday, with trade war fears and declining tech stocks taking their toll on investor sentiment, but we are seeing a small rebound ahead of the open on Wall Street. US futures are up to half a percentage point higher on Tuesday, but this pales in comparison to the losses recorded on Monday and reflects ongoing weakness in stocks. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attacks on Amazon over the weekend put the spotlight back on the tech sector, as it tries to recover from the Facebook data scandal that threatens more regulation. Pressure on the sector doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to be going away in the near-term which will continue to act as a drag on indices. Traders might need their tin hats this spring... In less than 90 minutes, music streaming site Spotify will join the US stock exchange. You can get up to speed quickly with our explainer, which outlines why the popular service (which has never turned a profit) could be worth up to $25bn - and why today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing could be particularly lively.... Joe Weisenthal of Bloomberg is questioning whether Donald Trump has really hurt Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price (as suggested earlier). He points out that other tech companies have suffered similar falls, even though they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been spared a digital roasting from the president: However, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d suggest that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack on Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax affairs (and its implications for the digital companies) are one of several factors weighing on markets. And sometimes, investors like to have an excuse to sell -- especially if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting jittery. Bad news: another 97 workers at the collapsed UK construction and outsourcing group Carillion have lost their jobs. That take the total redundancies at the company to 1,802, since it was liquidated in January in one of the biggest UK corporate failures in years. Some 9,946 jobs have been saved (because other companies have taken on the contracts they work on). Sky is bucking today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff, after a cunning scheme to help Rupert Murdoch take full control of the broadcaster emerged. Disney has \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexpressed interest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in buying Sky News, a move that might clear the way for Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox company take control of the 61% of Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already own. 21CF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid has been hit by media plurality concerns - given Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong position in UK media (including owning the Times and Sun newspapers). But those worries might abate, if Sky News wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t part of the package. Jolly decent of Disney to offer to help, eh? Not exactly. The US giant has its own motive - namely to take over Fox (including all of Sky) in a $66bn (\u00c2\u00a347bn) deal. That takeover risks being derailed because Comcast recently launched its own takeover offer for Sky. Sky shares have risen to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, up 1.5% at \u00c2\u00a313.15. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s higher than either Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer (\u00c2\u00a312.50) or Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (\u00c2\u00a310.75), suggesting traders expect a higher bid. City firm Liberum expects Fox to strike back: We think the news and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments from Sky point to a revised bid from Fox/Disney to trump Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1250p bid. More here: Two and a half-hours into the new trading quarter, and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is still down. The FTSE 100 is currently 46 points lower or 0.6%, at 7010. Industrial stocks, utilities and telecoms firms are leading the selloff. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital blames the double-whammy of trade tensions following China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs, and the tech selloff in America: On tech\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on the market, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a case of the star performers suffering and this has a big psychological effect on sentiment. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just that they have been behind the bulk of the gains in recent years and therefore exert an outsized effect on indices when they sell off; there is also a kind of network effect on other stocks. On trade, there is hope that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to US sanctions is sufficiently moderate and contained to prevent further escalation. However we await to see where this goes and whatever happens from here, there is no \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the sense that the direction of travel is either one-way or going no further \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we are not about to see a freeing up of global trade (reversal of tariffs), which would be risk-positive. Even if there is no further escalation, the background music is risk-off. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardly unusual for Donald Trump to lash out on Twitter -- as Hillary Clinton, CNN, the FBI, several senators and the Mexican government can all testify. But still, his trenchant criticism of Amazon in recent days has caused a real stir in the markets for several reasons, helping to fuel this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market selloff. Partly, because Trump is taking the side of the old-economy - tweeting that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fully tax paying retailers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are being forced to shut stores because (he claims) Amazon is getting an unfairly good deal. Politifact, a US website, has debunked Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the US Postal Service is losing money thanks to Amazon. It says: Amazon isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t causing the United States Postal Service to lose a fortune. In fact, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contributing to its biggest growth sector, package delivery. Deals like the one with Amazon brought in $7 billion in fiscal year 2017. But still, the US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments suggest that other tech disruptors could also come under fire -- especially if changes are made to the US tax system to help traditional retailers. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the only concern. Some industry figures are concerned that Amazon (whose shares fell 5% yesterday) is being hammered because its founder, Jeff Bezos, also owns the Washington Post. Vanity Fair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gabriel Sherman is reporting that Trump is firmly focused on Bezos, thanks to the Post\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of his presidency: Sherman says: He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s off the hook on this. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s war,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd one source told me. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He gets obsessed with something, and now he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obsessed with Bezos,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said another source. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump is like, how can I fuck with him?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That sort of behaviour will unnerve Wall Street, as investors try to judge where to place their money. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also unusual to see politicians try to settle scores so publicly. Paul Donovan, UBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief global economist, fears that such \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrandom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attacks could undermine faith in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrule of law\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Just in: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing has just posted its slowest quarter growth in a year. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all bad -- growth in March picked up a little, pushing the manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Index up to 55.1 from 55.0 in February. Factory bosses reported that output growth picked up last month, but increases in new orders and employment slowed. Data firm Markit says: The average reading over the opening quarter as a whole (55.1) was the weakest in a year, suggesting that the underlying pace of expansion has been generally slower since the start of 2018. Growth across Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector has hit an eight-month low, as the recent \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceuro boom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 falters. The eurozone manufacturing PMI, which tracks activity across the sector, dropped to 56.6 in March, down from 58.6 in February. This is the third monthly drop in a row, but it still signals solid growth (50 points would show stagnation). Factory bosses reported that output, new orders and new exports grew at a slower rate last month. They also reported problems getting hold of the raw materials and parts they needed, as supply chains struggled to cope. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, is concerned that business confidence also dipped last month. The fact that business optimism about the coming year has slipped to a 15-month low suggests there are other factors that are now hitting factory order books. Export growth has more than halved since late last year, linked in part to the appreciation of the euro, and in some cases demand is being stymied by higher prices. Hopes that the markets might calm down after their volatile start to 2018 have been dashed this morning. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, says investors need to decide whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re heading into a bear market, or just a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrevaluation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of asset prices. The major fear for markets is that the imposition of retaliatory import tariffs by China could just be the tip of the iceberg and will cause a chain reaction that drags more sectors and countries into the dispute. In a world where China is not willing to turn the other cheek and where President Trump likes to get the last word, the situation is set for further turmoil and the danger for investors is that this will escalate into a broader battle, which could leave few sectors immune to trouble. Each of the major tech companies appears to have its own particular set of problems to deal with. Facebook - data security. Intel - Apple chips. Tesla - missed targets compounding fears of excessive leverage. Amazon - President Trump. However, the one thing these companies do have in common is that these stocks are held by most of the big popular global funds. This means that many investors may have substantial exposure, even if they are not direct shareholders, which makes the tech troubles a wider problem. Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff was actually Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst start to an April since 1929 -- a date etched in market memory thanks to the crash later that year. Now, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just one day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading, but its not a great open for the second quarter either... Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff means America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P 500 has now shed 3.4% since the start of the year, while the Dow is down almost 5%. That follows a remarkable 2017, which saw the US stock market surge by around 25%. European markets have fallen down across the board in nervous trading, as traders rush to catch up with events after the Easter break. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says fears of a trade war are refusing to go away: On Monday China announced that it has implemented afforementioned tariffs on 128 types of US goods. Implementing the tariffs makes China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel and aluminium tariffs official. China has to show it is serious. We still expect a settlement in trade negotiations between the two nations. Sentiment will be fragile until the result of trade negotiations become clear. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has fallen sharply at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 shed 54 points, or 0,7%, to 7001 points, as traders take their cue from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide on Wall Street. The US president appears to have unnerved the markets, with his trade war rhetoric and attacks on Amazon. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, explains: The fall in tech stocks and escalating trade tensions continued to rattle markets after the Easter break. This time, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs and tech stocks driving the selloff, and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the U.S. President is doing himself any favors before the midterm elections. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been aggressive, by imposing levies on $3 billion worth of imports from the U.S.; the question now is - what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next? A tariff \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctit for tat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is a lose-lose scenario. So, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely that after this war of nerves, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies will find a middle ground. Markets should get used to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiating style - kicking off with something dramatic, and then scaling down through negotiation. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fresh worries over a global trade war are rippling through the markets today, after China hit back against America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on steel and aluminium by targeting imports of food, wine, steel and even ginseng. The news that Beijing is imposing its own tariffs of up to 25% on more than 120 US products sparked a selloff on Wall Street last night, sending the S&amp;P into correction territory. The Dow plunged by over 700 points at one stage, before ending the day 458 points lower. With Donald Trump expected to announce new curbs on China soon, traders are worried that this tit-for-tat action could escalate. As David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Beijing decided to impose levies on approximately $3 billion worth of goods from the US. In the grand scheme of things, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been too aggressive, but dealers fear we could be starting a long trade war. The ball is now in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in court, and traders are waiting for the US President to make the next move. European markets were closed yesterday for Easter Monday, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting losses of almost 1% on the main indices this morning. Trump has also put the technology sector into a spin, after sending a series of tweets criticising Amazon for avoiding taxes and not paying the US Post Office a fair rate. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price tanked by over 5% on Monday, on concerns that the e-commerce giant is firmly in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s firing line. Music streaming site Spotify will hope to ride out the market choppiness, when it lists its shares on the New York stock exchange for the first time. Spotify has taken the refreshing decision not to employ investment banks to underwrite its listing, so the launch could be more volatile than usual. We also get a new healthcheck on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector: The agenda 9am BST: Eurozone manufacturing PMI survey for March 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI survey for March 2.30pm BST: Spotify joins the US stock market",

The notebook on which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m writing this was designed in California, but probably assembled in China, with many of the components coming from South Korea and Japan. Apple could produce it entirely in North America, and probably would in the face of 30 percent tariffs. But the factories it would take to do that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t (yet) exist.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the factories that do exist were built to serve globalized production \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and many of them would be marginalized, maybe even made worthless, by tariffs that broke up those global value chains. That is, they would become stranded assets. Call it the anti-China shock.</p> <p>Of course, it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just be factories left stranded by a trade war. A lot of people would be stranded too. The point of the famous \u00e2\u20ac\u0153<a href=\"https://www.ddorn.net/papers/Autor-Dorn-Hanson-ChinaShock.pdf\">China shock</a>\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd paper by Autor et al wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that rapid trade growth made America as a whole poorer, it was that rapid changes in the location of production displaced a significant number of workers, creating personal hardship and hurting their communities. The irony is that an anti-China shock would do exactly the same thing. And I, at least, care more about the impact on workers than the impact on capital.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/981529499539050496\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Some thoughts on trade wars and the stock market that doesn&#39;t like them <a href=\"https://t.co/4PoalWlx7a\">https://t.co/4PoalWlx7a</a></p>&mdash; Paul Krugman (@paulkrugman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/981529499539050496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 4, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ac500e8e4b0dec03f4a8aea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-04T17:48:05.801Z\">6.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Analysts at Capital Economics have warned that President Donald Trump could raise the stakes further, possibly by labelling China a currency manipulator later this month.</strong></p> <p>In a note to clients, they say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The next flashpoint may be the US Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s semi-annual currency report, due out this month.

                "bodyText":"Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report on Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise rebound: Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three major indexes staged a comeback to close around 1 percent higher on Wednesday as investors turned their focus to earnings and away from a trade conflict between the United States and China that wreaked havoc in earlier trading. After investors fled equities in the morning due to proposed retaliatory tariffs from China, their concerns about a potential trade war eased by the afternoon after Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the administration was in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negotiation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with China rather than a trade war. Investors said they were comforted by the fact that any tariffs would not take effect immediately, if at all. Strategists also cited the S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bounce above a key technical support level and said they expect equities to rise further around the first quarter earnings season, due to start in mid-April. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re starting to feel that while markets hate uncertainty, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bark is worse than his bite when it comes to trade,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas. In a surprise twist, shares have surged back in New York. The Dow has closed up 230 points, bouncing back from its early slump. Why? Well, markets are mysterious and sometimes random things, but Larry Kudlow can take some credit after his efforts telling investors not to panic. Paul Krugman, the Nobel-prize wining economist (and trade expert) has written an article for the New York Times, outlining why a trade war would be highly disruptive. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Since about 1990 corporate America has bet heavily on hyperglobalization \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on the continuance of an open-market regime that has encouraged complex value chains that sprawl across borders. The notebook on which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m writing this was designed in California, but probably assembled in China, with many of the components coming from South Korea and Japan. Apple could produce it entirely in North America, and probably would in the face of 30 percent tariffs. But the factories it would take to do that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t (yet) exist. Meanwhile, the factories that do exist were built to serve globalized production \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and many of them would be marginalized, maybe even made worthless, by tariffs that broke up those global value chains. That is, they would become stranded assets. Call it the anti-China shock. Of course, it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just be factories left stranded by a trade war. A lot of people would be stranded too. The point of the famous \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China shock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd paper by Autor et al wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that rapid trade growth made America as a whole poorer, it was that rapid changes in the location of production displaced a significant number of workers, creating personal hardship and hurting their communities. The irony is that an anti-China shock would do exactly the same thing. And I, at least, care more about the impact on workers than the impact on capital. Analysts at Capital Economics have warned that President Donald Trump could raise the stakes further, possibly by labelling China a currency manipulator later this month. In a note to clients, they say: The next flashpoint may be the US Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s semi-annual currency report, due out this month. As a candidate, Trump promised to label China a currency manipulator \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on day one\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but so far has resisted. In and of itself, that would not trigger any action, but it would be a signal that the trade spat is escalating. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story on the US/China trade spat, for anyone just tuning in: China has raised the stakes in the escalating trade showdown with the United States by unveiling tariffs on a wide-ranging list of American imports in response to levies on Chinese goods put forward by Donald Trump. Beijing will impose additional tariffs of 25% on 106 American products from 14 separate categories, including soybean, cars and chemical products, covering imports to China worth up to $50bn (\u00c2\u00a336bn), Chinese state news agencies said on Wednesday. The measures come after the US announced details of new 25% tariffs on $50bn worth of imports from China drawn up by the Trump administration. The list of more than 1,300 products targets China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial base, covering everything from industrial robots and electronics to metal alloys and aircraft parts. Washington said the levies were in response to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unfair trade practices related to the forced transfer of US technology and intellectual property,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd adding that the list of products had been designed to target China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial plans while minimising the impact on the US economy. The array of Chinese products that would be affected is lengthy and varied, covering everything from aircraft jets and tyres, to uranium and nuclear reactor parts, poultry incubators, haymaking machines and guns and ammunition. Technology products are also hit, including TV cameras, jukeboxes and cassette players. The proposed list will undergo a public review process before trade officials ultimately decide which products should be hit by tariffs. The Chinese state news agency Xinhua said the country would only implement its tariffs on American goods once the US government imposed levies on imports from China. Some types of aircraft, lubricants, tobacco and orange juice are on the list of products targeted by Beijing, along with some trucks and SUVs. The inclusion of agricultural and food and drink products such as soybeans, whisky, beef, corn and wheat is likely to raise eyebrows for targeting southern American states where Trump drew much of his support while running for the presidency. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also pulled together a full list of the products which could be landed with new tariffs: Wall Street is looking calmer now, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back with any major developments.... Other countries could benefit if China hits US exporters with new tariffs. As Dutch financial group bank Rabobank puts it: There aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough soybeans in the world to meet China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demands without US supplies. They suspect that farmers in Australia and Brazil might benefit, at the expense of US farmers, if American agricultural products become uncompetitively priced in China. European stock markets have closed for the night, with trade jitters weighing on shares. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the biggest companies across Europe, has lost 0.5% today, with losses in Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market did a little better, though, with the FTSE 100 finishing 3 points higher (up a meagre 0.05%). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a transcript of Larry Kudlow, the US National Economic Council Director, telling Fox Business why a trade war won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t break out between the US and China. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Absolutely not. Absolutely not. And let me just say right at the top, number one, blame China, not President Trump. Because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been going on for many years. Trump is really the first president to fight back and to put a shot across the bow, stealing intellectual property rights, technology transfers, high barriers, investment limitations, high tariffs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this stuff really is not just unfair, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlawful. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outside the boundaries of the WTO. Every country in the world knows this. Every analyst knows this is the case. Somebody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got to deal with it. President Trump is going to deal with it. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no trade war here. What you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got is the early stages of a process which will include tariffs, comments on the tariffs, then ultimate decisions and negotiations. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already backchannel talks going on. So look, I understand the stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anxiety. I get that. But on the other hand, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over react. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see how this works out. My view Stu, look, you know I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a growth guy, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a Reagan supply side growth guy. I think that at the end of this whole process, that at the end of the rainbow, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pot of gold. And if you open up that pot, you will see better economic growth, more trading going on, improved wages for both sides. Anytime you lower barriers, anytime you lower barriers, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key, the president will say this, lower barriers is the key, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raise the barriers. Anytime you do that, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for growth. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for American growth and American workers, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for the rest of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a volatile morning on the New York stock exchange, as traders saw shares slide sharply at the open before recovering some ground... Jonathan Butcher, principal economist at consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie, reckons a full-blown trade clash between America and China would hurt global growth badly. He says the mere risk of trade disputes will make people reluctant to spend, and discourage firms from investing in new equipment and factories. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The risk of a trade war developing is a threat to the global economy. We are currently enjoying a period of robust global growth, but sentiment plays a big part in maintaining economic momentum. The threat of a trade war could dampen sentiment, slowing consumer spending and business investment. Should a trade war escalate between the US and China, Wood Mackenzie estimates that global economic growth could slow from 2.9% to 2.2% over the next 4 years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wall Street is clawing its way back from its early slump. The Dow is still in the red, but only by 150 points (-0.6%) while the Nasdaq is only 0.5% lower lower. Traders may be heeding the soothing words of economics advisor Larry Kudlow, and reassessing the risks of a trade war. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also received some decent economic news today. US companies created 241,000 private sector jobs last month, more than expected. That indicates the labor market is still strong, and could mean a strong Non-Farm Payroll jobs report on Friday. Commodity prices are still suffering, though; the soybean future contract is down almost 3%. Larry Kudlow, the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new top economic advisor, has embarked on a mission to calm the markets. Speaking to reporters on the White House driveway, Kudlow insisted that America wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t about to lose a trade war with China. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it that way. This is a negotiation, using all the tools\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kudlow has also popped up on Fox Business, to tell the markets not to panic. He claims that the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal is to get rid of trade barriers, and create a genuine level-playing field of free and fair trade. As Kudlow puts it: I think that at the end of this whole process, the end of the rainbow, there is a pot of gold. If you open up that pot, you will see better economic growth, more trading going on, improved wages for both sides. Any time you lower barriers....it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for growth. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for American growth and American workers. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for the rest of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth. The US president has tweeted again: $500bn is a nice round number, but officially the US only ran a trade in goods deficit of $375.2bn with China last year. Any farmer planning to sell his soybean crop may not agree either...... Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff means the Dow is now 11% off its record high, leaving it in correction territory. That record high, of 26,616 points, was set on Friday 26th January - the day Donald Trump addressed the World Economic Forum, and boasted that the US stock market was up 50% since he won the election. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never been higher since.... This is turning into a broad-based rout. Each of the 30 blue-chip companies which makes up the Dow has fallen into the red. Chemicals maker DowDuPont has lost 2.8%, Intel has lost 2.5%, General Electric and Goldman Sachs is down 2%. Every sector of the S&amp;P 500 has also fallen. Boeing is also being hit hard. Its shares are down over 4% in early trading. Bloomberg explains why China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new 25% tariffs could be bad news for the airline maker: In a tit-for-tat response to tariffs from Trump, China announced the planned levy on aircraft weighing between 15,000 kilograms (33,000 pounds) and 45,000 kilograms, which would include some variants of Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 737 family of passenger jets. Single-aisle jets, dominated by the 737 and Airbus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s A320 family, both with sticker prices of about $100 million, are likely to account for three quarters of the global market over the next two decades, according to Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s estimates. Shares in automobile manufacturers are falling in New York, following the news that China is proposing a 25% tariff on imports of some US cars. Fiat Chrysler is down 2.6%, electric carmaker Tesla has lost 3.7%, and Ford has dipped by 1.5%. The opening bell of the New York stock market is ringing, and shares are taking a bath. The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen by 480 points at the start of trading, as 2% was swiftly wiped off the benchmark index. The S&amp;P 500 index (which includes more companies than the Dow) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index are also sliding, as investors express their anxiety over the tit-for-tat trade clashes between China and the US. Details to follow.... Just time for a quick peek at the European markets...and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all in the red, as trade war fears bite. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says investors have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply disturbed by the speed and extent of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs. Tin hats on... Traders in New York are getting ready for a rough open to the trading session, in just over 10 minutes. The Dow Jones is currently on track to fall by almost 550 points, according to the futures markets, as Wall Street gives its verdict on the latest US-China tariffs. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says trade war fears are gripping the financial markets today. Investors are diving out of shares, and putting money into safe-haven assets like gold, he says: Dow futures have collapsed 500 points and other global indices were sharply lower at the time of writing after China retaliated overnight to a slate of trade measures launched by the US government hours earlier aimed at narrowing China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vast trade surplus with America. China said it will apply tariffs on 106 US-produced goods, ranging from aeroplanes to soya beans. While the escalation of trade wars have weighed heavily on commodity prices such as corn, soya beans, crude oil and copper, gold on the other hand has been able to climb higher thanks to its safe haven status. Gold is up 1% today, at $1,325 per ounce. Jared Bernstein, former economic advisor to vice-president Joe Biden, argues that America and China might not actually impose these tariffs for months, or indeed ever: Economist George Magnus, of Oxford University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s China Centre, believes these new tariffs are only a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfoothill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the history of trade wars. But the situation could become a lot worse, he told Bloomberg TV, if the two sides announce further tariffs. Potentially, almost all US exports to China could face new tariffs, which would hurt both country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economies. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweeted about this fear: Guy Foster, head of research at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, points out there is time for America and China to step back from their new tariffs: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The important thing to note about the current spat between China and the US is that the US has built a timescale for negotiation into their plans. Seven weeks of consultation with the public will follow before US tariffs bite. The Chinese announcement today was to make sure agricultural and aeronautic businesses and workers have the longest time possible to lobby for a climbdown from this confrontation while they engage to find mutually beneficial ways of reducing the bilateral trade deficit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. With an hour to go until the open, the Dow is expected to fall by around 2% - a fairly chunky decline. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details of the Wilbur Ross interview: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs \u00e2\u20ac\u0153amount to about three-tenths of a percent of our GDP. So, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardly a life-threatening activity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ross said in an interview with CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Squawk Box.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relatively proportionate to the tariffs we put on based on the intellectual property.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wilbur Ross, the US Commerce secretary, says we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised that China has hit back today. He told CNBC it would have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremely embarrassing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Beijing if it hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t retaliated, and that markets shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too alarmed. Ross said: They are very good at arithmetic. They know we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about fractions of 1% of the respective economies. So, this is not World War 3. America is waking up to the news that China and the US have taken another step closer to a trade war that could hurt the global economy badly. A few hours ago, China announced plans to impose 25% tariffs on a swathe of US goods, worth $50bn last year. The list includes soybeans, cars and aircraft -- three key export areas. Beef, cigars and whiskey are all on the list too. Economists say the tariffs are tougher than expected. They would hit American exporters, such as farmers, hard, as Beijing puts the US agricultural sector in the firing line. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy finance minister has insisted that China doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a trade war, as it would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclose-lose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 situation. But Beijing has also made it clear that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back down. As its eEmbassy in Washington, put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As the Chinese saying goes, it is only polite to reciprocate. The retaliation came hours after America announced tariffs on over 1,300 Chinese products. The wide-ranging list covered machinery, electronics - even uranium and flamethrowers. The office of the US trade representative said the measures would target products that benefitted from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theft of US intellectual property. President Trump has responded to Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move - he tweeted that America lost its trade war with China many years ago, so must take new measures to close its trade deficit. Angel Gurria, Secretary General of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, has called the latest developments \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery worrysome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He told an audience in London: You are talking about the number one and number two traders in the world,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not good for anyone, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lose-lose situation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US Soybean Export Council has said it \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcregrets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision, warning that companies in the US and China will both suffer. Financial markets have reacted badly, with the price of soybeans tumbling by 5%. European stock markets have fallen into the red, and Wall Street is bracing for a sharp selloff in 90 minutes time. In the futures market, aircraft-maker Boeing are down 4%, and machinery giant Caterpillar has lost 3.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average is expected to fall by over 500 points, or around 2%. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, says investors fear that relations between Washington and Beijing could deteriorate further: Despite hopes of success in negotiations between the US and China last week, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation from China is likely to cement fears amongst analysts of a trade war. The tariffs represent the U.S.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful challenge in decades to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic practices, with 25% tariffs unless Beijing makes major trade and investment concessions. China has announced retaliatory measures today, with 25% tariffs on US goods, leading the markets in Europe to slump this morning. The uncertainty in the markets over the heightening trade tensions also weighed on the oil markets. Traders will be bracing themselves for further volatility in the coming days.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: President Trump has declared that America has already lost the trade war with China: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a change of position from Trump. Last month, he tweeted that trade wars were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood, and easy to win\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - for a country in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position. Christopher Balding, associate professor of business and economics at the HSBC Business School in Shenzhen, reckons China has a clear warning to America -- back down over trade, or else: Last year, the US-China Business Council issued a report explaining why exports to China were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vital to US economic growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They pointed out that China is America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-largest goods export market (behind Canada and Mexico), while service exports swelled over 400% between 2006 and 2015. The report argued that trade with China supports a lot of US jobs: US goods exports to China come from a wide range of industries including transportation equipment, agriculture, computers and electronics, and chemicals. These exports also sustain logistics jobs in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ports and throughout the country. US services exports to China included travel and education, royalties, transportation, business and professional services, and financial services. The Council also explains how States across America have a stake - and could thus suffer from a trade war: Most states have seen significant increases in exports of goods and services to China since 2006. Thirty states experienced at least triple-digit goods export growth to China since 2006, and four states saw growth of more than 500 percent over the same period: Alabama, Montana, North Dakota, and South Carolina. Every US state had triple-digit services export growth to China since 2006, 16 states had export growth of more than 400 percent. China is among the top five goods and services export markets for most states. China was a top three goods export market for 39 states in 2016, and among the top five for another eight states. That includes states that are not usually associated with strong China trade ties, including Alabama, Arizona, Minnesota, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, South Carolina, and Tennessee Wendy Chen, an economist at Nomura, has told my colleague Lily Kuo that America and China can still avoid a trade war: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think there is still room for negotiation between the two economies, although the risk of a full-blown trade war is rising,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that the Chinese government isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t messing about with its new tariffs. By including aircraft, soybeans and cars, Beijing is targeting the three largest exports from America to China last year (according to the US Census Bureau). China has released a list of the 106 US products which will incur a new 25% tariff (unless Donald Trump backs down and abandons America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed tariffs on Chinese goods). The list includes: Yellow soybeans black soybeans other corn corn flour uncombed cotton durum wheat fresh and cold beef (whole head or half) fresh and cold beef with bones frozen boneless beef unstemmed tobacco tobacco cigars tobacco cigarettes cigar and cigarettes with tobacco substitute hookah materials frozen orange juice whiskey various types of cars and trucks aircrafts of more than 15000kg but less than 45000 kg weight Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full list China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy commerce minister, Wang Shouwen, has blamed the US government for triggering the latest tit-for-tat tariffs. Shouwen told reporters in Beijing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It must be said, we have been forced into taking this action. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our action is restrained.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wang was speaking alongside deputy finance minister Zhu Guangyao, as he insisted that China didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a trade war. The future market is now indicating that the Dow Jones industrial average will tumble by 600 points, or more than 2%. Such a sharp selloff would confirm that Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation is firmer than many investors expected (or hoped). Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics, says the strength and scale of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation is somewhat unexpected: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The assumption was China would not respond too aggressively and avoid escalating tensions. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response is a surprise for some people. Evans-Pritchard adds that the two sides could still avert a trade war: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more of a game of brinkmanship, making it clear what the cost would be, in the hopes that both sides can come to agreement and none of these tariffs will come into force.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that China hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t said when these new tariffs on $50bn of US imports will come into effect. The Ministry of Finance says it depends when the $50bn of tariffs outlined by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration last night are implemented. So, unless both sides back down, there will soon be 25% tariffs on $100bn of trade between the two countries: Shares in major American industry giants are expected to take a tumble when Wall Street opens at 2.30pm BST: The soybean selloff is deepening, as traders anticipate weaker demand for this crucial product. Corn and wheat are also being hit by worries of a trade war between China and the US: Back in Beijing, deputy finance minister Zhu Guangyao says China will not give in to pressure for America over intellectual property rights. Reuters has more details: External pressure will instead promote China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s development and innovation, Zhu told reporters in Beijing. Friction is hard to avoid in fast-growing China-U.S. trade, and huge challenges face the two sides, but Zhu said he still hoped relations could return to a healthy track, since a trade war could hurt all sides. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation is more forceful than the financial markets had expected, says Gao Qi, Singapore-based strategist at Scotiabank. That explains why shares fell immediately in Europe, with Wall Street on track for losses too. He told Bloomberg: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response was tougher than what the market was expecting -- investors didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t foresee the country levying additional tariffs on sensitive and important products such as soybeans and airplanes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors believe a trade war will hurt both countries and their economies eventually.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to slap a 25% tariff on soybean imports from America looks like a real shot over the bows of the Trump administration. Soybeans are a crucial part of the global food chain, used as a source of oil and also to feed livestock such as pigs and chicken. The World Wildlife Fund calls it the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcking of beans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, saying: It contains 38% protein \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 2x as much as pork, 3x more than eggs, and 12x more than milk. Also the protein in soybean has a more complete range of essential amino acids than most other foods. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also used in vegetarian food products like tofu (which comes from soy milk). China is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest import of soybeans; American farms sold around $14bn of soybeans to China companies last year. So farmers in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agricultural belt - which is typically Republican-supporting - may have deep concerns about the tit-for-tat tariffs. NBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Janis Mackey Frayer says China had this in mind when it drew up today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs... Soybean tariffs could also hurt Chinese farmers - pushing up their import prices and making pork more expensive. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign ministry has urged the US to abandon its plan to impose tariffs on 1,300 Chinese products. At a daily press briefing, the ministry said the two countries should resolve trade differences through dialogue. Geng Shuang, a foreign ministry spokesperson, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those who attempt to make China surrender through pressure or intimidation have never succeeded before, and will not succeed now. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy finance minister, Zhu Guangyao, is holding a press conference now. Zhu tells reporters in Beijing that the Chinese government doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a trade war -- despite having just announced retaliatory tariffs on $50bn of American goods. A trade war would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclose-lose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for China and America, he says. Co-operation is the only right choice for both countries, Zhu insists. He says China wants to resolve the issues with America in a constructive way. Analyst John Kemp fears that Beijing and Washington won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to stop the situation escalating into a full-blown trade war: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs are aimed firmly at America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agricultural industry, says John Ross, senior fellow at Renmin University of China: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s swift retaliation against the US has hit the financial markets. The Chinese yuan has fallen 0.4% against the US dollar, its biggest fall in two weeks, according to Reuters data. European stock markets have also slumped into the red; Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is down 0.5%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has shed 1.4%. US stock market is expected to fall sharply when trading begins in around five hours. The Dow is down 1.3% in the futures market. The Chinese finance ministry has released more details of the new 25% tariffs which it will impose on US imports, in retaliation to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs on its exports. It confirms that the reciprocal measures cover 106 different US products. The list includes soybeans, chemicals, whisky, cigars, some types of beef, corn and wheat. Some types of aircraft, lubricants, tobacco and orange juice are also targeted, along with some trucks and SUVs. Crucially, these imports were worth $50bn in 2017 -- that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same value as the 1,300 Chinese goods which America is targetting with its new tariffs. Newsflash: China has just announced a fresh wave of tariffs on American goods, in retaliation to the US tariffs released last night. Chinese state TV is reporting that 106 US products are affected, including a 25% tariff on soybeans, automomobiles and chemicals. In total, the goods affected are worth $50bn per year. So, Beijing hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wasted any time in delivering on its pledge to hit back against the new proposed US tariffs on 1,300 of its products. Many US farmers rely on sales of soybeans to China, so this could have a significant impact on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agriculture sector. The soybean price has taken an immediate hit. The array of Chinese products that would be affected by America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new 25% tariffs is lengthy, and varied. It includes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153compounds of depleted uranium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, nuclear reactor parts, a wide range of vaccines and medical products, aircraft tyres, stainless steel and aluminium in various sizes, and aircraft jets and tyres, domestic and commercial dishwashers, storage water heaters, and sewing machines. On the agricultural side, poultry incubators, haymaking machines and milking devices are all hit -- suggesting US farmers could suffer from these tariffs. Cranes, snowploughs and locomotive parts are all on the list too. Technology products are also hit, including TV cameras, a range of televisions, and even fuses. Even weapons are covered - including rocket launchers, flame-throwers, rifles, shotguns, pistols and military weapons. The US will now hold a consultation on whether to impose these tariffs. The full list is online here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of a trade war between China and America are swirling this morning as both sides ratchet up the pressure. Last night, the US government announced details of new 25% tariffs on $50bn worth of imports from China. The list of over 1,300 products targets China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial base, covering everything from industrial robots and electronics to metal alloys and aircraft parts. America claims these new 25% tariffs is prompted by Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-running \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcintellectual property theft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of valuable technology and ideas developed by US companies. It says: The proposed list of products is based on extensive interagency economic analysis and would target products that benefit from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial plans while minimizing the impact on the US economy. The move comes two days after China hit back against America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on steel and aluminium by imposing new trade hurdles on 120 US products - including fresh food and steel. And there are already signs that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest move could trigger fresh retaliations. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambassador to the World Trade Organisation, Zhang Xiangchen, has declared this morning that his country will retaliate \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immediately\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, claiming that the Trump administration is breaking WTO rules. In a punchy statement, Zhang says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The findings of the U.S. Section 301 investigation are a willful distortion of facts and full of selective assertions and allegations, turning a blind eye to the actual progress that China has achieved in the market-oriented reforms, further opening-up and enhanced intellectual property protection.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Chinese Embassy in Washington was also quick to condemn this latest move - saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As the Chinese saying goes, it is only polite to reciprocate. The Chinese side will resort to the WTO dispute settlement mechanism and take corresponding measures of equal scale and strength against US products in accordance with Chinese law.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That raises the danger that China imposes its own tariffs on a wider range of US goods, taking the global economy a little bit closer to protectionism. Also coming up today: We get a new healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building sector this morning, which may show the impact of last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wintery weather. Plus, new jobs data from the Eurozone and America. Markets are expected to be subdued, given the trade tensions swirling around: Advertising giant WPP is also in the spotlight, after launching an investigation into an allegation of personal misconduct against its chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell. He denies the allegations \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unreservedly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but investors may be concerned.

As a nation, we cannot isolate ourselves any more than we can stem the ocean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tide. The international system provides agreed-upon rules of the road \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and mechanisms for enforcing them. It serves as the basis upon which we can insist on fairer trade practices from competitors and adequate burden-sharing from allies. It is the means by which we can continue to improve people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lives and livelihoods.</p> <p>The system, built at great sacrifice, continues to serve our interests. It should be preserved and defended \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ideally under strong U.S. leadership.</p> </blockquote> <p>[President Trump, of course, has criticised fellow NATO members for not spending enough on defence]</p> <p><strong>And on trade, Dimon writes that US does have some legitimate issues with China.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>China has realized significant economic and employment gains since joining the WTO in 2001. China was expected to continue on an aggressive path of opening up its economy, but this has happened at a much slower pace than most nations expected.</p> <p>Now, more than 16 years later, it has the second-largest economy in the world and is home to 20% of the Fortune 500 companies, yet it still considers itself a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153developing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd nation that should not be subject to the same WTO standards as the United States and other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153developed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd countries.</p> </blockquote> <p>However, simply imposing new tariffs on its goods in a unilateral fashion is not the answer. Instead, Dimon proposes a five-point plan:<br></p> <ul> <li>The United States should define very clearly, and in detail, what it wants from China.<br></li> <li> The United States should lay out a distinct timeline \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and determine what the reaction would be if it is not met. <br></li> <li>The United States should listen closely to China about any legitimate complaints it may have. <br></li> <li>This should be done in partnership with our largest allies, particularly Japan and Europe. <br></li> <li>The United States should revisit the Trans-Pacific Partnership and fix the parts considered unfair. The TPP could be an excellent economic and strategic agreement between America and its allies, particularly Asia. This is not against China: The country could at some point be offered the opportunity to enter the TPP if it demonstrates a willingness to meet its standards, which would improve upon the rules-based global trading system under American leadership.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sonalibasak/status/981835905370648576\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomkeene?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@tomkeene</a> on Jamie Dimon&#39;s annual letter: &quot;He&#39;s almost running for Treasury Secretary&quot; halfway through. <a href=\"https://t.co/NDIzzpEtI6\">https://t.co/NDIzzpEtI6</a></p>&mdash; Sonali Basak (@sonalibasak) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sonalibasak/status/981835905370648576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 5, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-04-05T11:18:55.409Z\">at 12.18pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ac5f6a3e4b059f638f16dc4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-05T10:26:14.389Z\">11.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Markets rally as trade fears ease</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back in the markets, mining companies are helping to drive the London stock market higher.</strong></p> <p>Resource giants such as Glencore, Anglo American and Antifagasta are among the top risers on the FTSE 100.</p> <p>Mining companies would all suffer from a global trade war, as slower growth would hit demand for coal, iron ore, copper, aluminium.

                "bodyText":"And finally.... the closing bell of Wall Street has just been rung, ending a positive day on the markets. The Dow was up 1% at the close, up 242 point, meaning it has posted a three-day winning streak. That follows a strong session on the other side of the Atlantic: Commodity prices have also recovered some ground; soybeans are up 1.5% today while corn gained 2.3%. That may show that the soothing words from US officials, such as Larry Kudlow, is working. Or we might be reading too much into it! Pinning a narrative on the market action is tempting, but not always accurate.... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow to track whether the recovery continues, or stumbles. Goodnight! GW Not so fast, markets! The Financial Times is reporting that China could launch a legal challenge to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed tariffs, at the World Trade Organisation. The FT says: Beijing signalled it was willing to escalate its fight with Donald Trump over his plan for anti-China tariffs on Thursday by launching a legal challenge against Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newly proposed duties on more than 1,300 Chinese products. The Chinese move to open a World Trade Organization case came despite efforts by White House officials to ease fears of a looming trade war and is likely to feed doubts over the ability of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies to reach an amicable settlement. Beijing said the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed tariffs, unveiled earlier this week, represented a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious violation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of global trading rules because they discriminated against Chinese goods and violated the tariff limits Washington had made commitments to.... Investors don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem too alarmed, though; the Dow is up almost 1% still, with the S&amp;P 500 0.6% higher in late trading. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a taste of the New York stock exchange today, as traders rode the market higher: With 90 minutes trading to go, the Dow is up 0.7% - or 173 points - on Wall Street. Larry Kudlow has certainly hit the ground running, since joining the White House as National Economic Council Director. During his tour of media outlets, the former Reagan adviser even told Fox that US growth could hit the heady heights of 5%. CNBC has the details: Asked whether the economy could post 5 percent annual GDP as it recovers from the financial recession, Kudlow said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we could.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Will we get 5 percent forever? No. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a catch up here,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kudlow told Fox Business Network. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any economist will show you the long-term trend line for GDP versus the actual now: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re like several trillion dollars below where we should be based on the long-term trend lines. I want to get back to that full potential.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Frankly, that seems awfully ambitious. And if the US economy did rattle along at such a heady pace, the Federal Reserve would surely raise interest rates promptly for fear of inflation surging. Time will tell.... The New York stock market is extending its gains. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 1% today at 24,495, a gain of 231 points. Quite a recovery from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariff-fuelled panic: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally was the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best day since the aftermath of the EU referendum, says Marketwatch: U.K. stocks on Thursday logged the best one-session gain in nearly two years as investors grew hopeful that negotiations would lead the U.S. and China to de-escalate brewing trade tensions. The FTSE 100 index rose 2.4% to 7,199.50, marking its best daily advance since June 29, 2016, a rally that occurred in the aftermath of the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the European Union, known as Brexit. Here are the details of how the European markets surged to a three-week high tonight: UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100: up 165 points at 7,199.50, a gain of 2.35% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: up 347 points at 12,305, a gain of 29% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC 40: up 134 points at 5,276.6, a gain of 2.6% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: up 526 points at 22,969, a gain of 2.35% Fiona Cincotta of City Index says a relief rally swept the markets today: Markets across the globe continued to bounce back as optimism increases that the US and China are willing to work towards avoiding an all-out trade war. The FTSE was led 169 point higher by tech stocks and the heavyweight commodity sector; the miners gaining support from higher metal prices, on hopes that China, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest consumer of metals won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be entering a trade war with the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. Boom! European market stock have roared back today, as traders wager that trade war fears have been overblown. In London the FTSE gained over 2%, boosting its value by some \u00c2\u00a342bn. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says buyers came back with a vengeance on Thursday. It was a complete one-eighty from Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout. The bounce-back attributed to White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow easing trade war fears has gained some traction. The DAX index hit a 2-week high while the FTSE 100 reached its highest in 3-weeks. In this volatile environment, there is still scope to blind-sided again by the next official comment or Tweet about US-China trade negotiations. Markets, eh? Shares in major US exporters are rallying today, as Larry Kudlow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments help to reassure investors. The Dow is now up 200 points, or 0.8%. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 1.8%, or 120-odd points. Just in: Larry Kudlow, the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economic advisor, has played down the risks of a trade war. Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Kudlow argues that the spat with China could have a happy ending - if it forces Beijing to play fairly. Ding Ding! Shares are rising on the New York stock market, on hopes that a trade war between the US and China can be avoided. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 165 points, or 0.7%, to 24428. That extends yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late rally. The US president has found some time in his busy schedule to correct the Washington Post\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headlines: Sports fans keen to watch the Winter Olympics helped to drive America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit to a nine-year high. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reports that service imports rose by $1.1bn in February, to $47.8bn. That includes a $1.0bn increase in charges for the use of intellectual property, which \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reflects payments for the rights to broadcast the 2018 Winter Olympic Games\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That payment was made by NBC, which splashed out up $963 million for the rights to air the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear that the money was well-spent. Viewing figures were 7% lower than for Sochi in 2014, making the 2018 Winter Olympics the least-watched on record. Newsflash: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade gap has widened to its highest level in almost a decade. The difference between US imports and exports hit $57.6bn in February, the biggest gap since October 2008, up from $56.7bn in January. Exports rose by 1.7% to $204.4bn, but imports also increased by 1.7% to $262.0bn. That means Donald Trump hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, yet, made any progress in reducing America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit with the rest of the world. The trade gap with China did narrow -- possibly due to the impact of the lunar New Year? -- but the deficit with Mexico widened. Reuters has more details: The deficit has now risen for six straight months. The goods trade deficit was the highest since July 2008 and the surplus on services was the lowest since December 2012. Part of the rise in the trade deficit in February reflected commodity price increases. The politically sensitive goods trade deficit with China fell 18.6% to $29.3 billion. The deficit with Mexico surged 46.6% in February. The president may not be best pleased.... The number of new vans bought in the UK fell by 5.6% in March. The SMMT has reported that UK new van registrations dropped to 59,764 last month, from 63,316 a year ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a smaller decline than for cars, but it could also be a sign of economic uncertainty - and that March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad weather curbed spending. They add: Uplift in demand for smaller vans (1.8%) and pickups (6.8%) fails to offset declines for medium (-2.0%) and heavier (-10.5%) models. More than 94,000 new van registrations in Q1 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c dropping -3.7% compared to the same period in 2017. SMMT CEO Mike Hawes says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A decline in the important plate change month of March is a concern and we need the right economic conditions to restore market stability and encourage buyers to invest in new commercial vehicles. The new van market is a key barometer of business confidence and while uncertainty remains, a degree of fluctuation in demand is to be expected this year. The SMMT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rolling tally of van sales suggests demand has been cooling since the EU referendum: Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada suspect that UK economy growth could have halved in the last quarter. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve crunched through today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector PMI report, as well as the manufacturing and construction reports earlier this week. The upshot - growth in the first three months of 2018 won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t match the 0.4% recorded in October-December 2017. Sam Hill of RBC explains: The UK IHS Markit / CIPS Composite PMI dropped to 52.5 in March, a full two points lower than the previous month, on account of a large drop in the service sector survey. Whilst the manufacturing sector survey didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t contain too much evidence of weather-related disruption to activity, widespread snow early in March did appear to account for a good deal of the weakness in the construction and service sectors. The result is that our PMI-based GDP indicator now suggests Q1 GDP growth will be just 0.2% q/q, rather than 0.3% q/q previously. Given the margin for error in the indicator, and the relatively brief period of weather-related disruption we maintain our forecast of 0.3% q/q for Q1 GDP for the time being. Newsflash: Another sign that China and the US could avoid a trade war: Jamie Dimon, the head of JP Morgan, has warned American politicians not to drive the world economy into a new protectionist era. In his annual letter to shareholder, Dimon gives a clear signal to Donald Trump not to undermine international institutions including NATO and the World Trade Organisations. Such groups, Dimon points out, underpin the world order and allows democratic principles such as free speech and equality to spread. As he puts it: Reversing the interconnectedness built by our post-World War II institutions is neither desirable nor feasible. As a nation, we cannot isolate ourselves any more than we can stem the ocean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tide. The international system provides agreed-upon rules of the road \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and mechanisms for enforcing them. It serves as the basis upon which we can insist on fairer trade practices from competitors and adequate burden-sharing from allies. It is the means by which we can continue to improve people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lives and livelihoods. The system, built at great sacrifice, continues to serve our interests. It should be preserved and defended \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ideally under strong U.S. leadership. [President Trump, of course, has criticised fellow NATO members for not spending enough on defence] And on trade, Dimon writes that US does have some legitimate issues with China. China has realized significant economic and employment gains since joining the WTO in 2001. China was expected to continue on an aggressive path of opening up its economy, but this has happened at a much slower pace than most nations expected. Now, more than 16 years later, it has the second-largest economy in the world and is home to 20% of the Fortune 500 companies, yet it still considers itself a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153developing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd nation that should not be subject to the same WTO standards as the United States and other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153developed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd countries. However, simply imposing new tariffs on its goods in a unilateral fashion is not the answer. Instead, Dimon proposes a five-point plan: The United States should define very clearly, and in detail, what it wants from China. The United States should lay out a distinct timeline \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and determine what the reaction would be if it is not met. The United States should listen closely to China about any legitimate complaints it may have. This should be done in partnership with our largest allies, particularly Japan and Europe. The United States should revisit the Trans-Pacific Partnership and fix the parts considered unfair. The TPP could be an excellent economic and strategic agreement between America and its allies, particularly Asia. This is not against China: The country could at some point be offered the opportunity to enter the TPP if it demonstrates a willingness to meet its standards, which would improve upon the rules-based global trading system under American leadership. Back in the markets, mining companies are helping to drive the London stock market higher. Resource giants such as Glencore, Anglo American and Antifagasta are among the top risers on the FTSE 100. Mining companies would all suffer from a global trade war, as slower growth would hit demand for coal, iron ore, copper, aluminium. So today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally suggests that the City is hopeful that a full-blown protectionist clash can be avoided. Lena Komileva of (g+)economics says there have been encouraging noises from officials in China and the US, following the news yesterday that both sides could enforce tariffs on $50bn of imports. It is encouraging that the Chinese side has offered antidote to the escalation of language coming from the new While House China hawks around Trump: The US Chinese ambassador said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negotiation would still be our preference but it takes two to tango\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Clearly, the ground is set for an intensive round of talks stretching over the next half year, into the US midterm elections on 6 November, during which time markets will face continued headline risk, but trade wars is not the endgame on the radar. But still..... investors should be prepared for significant market volatility this year, she adds: This may not be a trade war, but China and the US are caught in a long term economic cold war for global market share in new technologies. Geopolitical risk, and the market fragmentation that comes with it, is not a transitory wave but a climate sea change. Breaking away from the car sales figures...we have evidence that the UK economy slowed in March as wintery weather gripped Britain. Activity in the dominant UK service sector slowed last month, growing at its slowest rate since July 2016. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to data firm Markit, whose UK service sector PMI fell to just 51.7 last month from 54.5 in February (any reading over 50 shows growth). Companies reported that bad weather disrupted business operations, and contributed to subdued consumer spending in March. Britain suffered some of its worst weather in years last month; a bitter cold spell, heavy snow and dangerous ice caused transport disruption and forced thousands of schools to close. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI surveys suggest the economy weakened: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK economy iced up in March, suffering the weakest increase in business activity since the Brexit vote amid widespread disruptions caused by some of the heaviest snowfall in years. As a result, first quarter economic growth will likely have been adversely affected. The PMI surveys collectively signal a quarterly GDP growth rate of just under 0.3%, down from 0.4% in the fourth quarter, albeit with the rate of growth sliding to just 0.15% in March alone. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight agrees: With construction activity also being hit markedly, the March purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 surveys overall fuel belief that the severe weather may well have caused GDP growth to dip to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2018. Alex Buttle, director of car buying comparison website Motorway.co.uk, says the auto industry is failing to persuade drivers to buy new, less-polluting, diesel cars: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What a difference a year makes. Twelve months ago the car industry was celebrating record new car sales, today, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s facing something of a crisis with no clear plans to reverse its fortunes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The car industry has tried but failed to promote the benefits of Euro 6 diesel cars without government support and sales figures are telling. Consumers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buying the sales patter with new diesel proving a confusing area for potential buyers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Diesel car owners are choosing instead to keep their current vehicles running longer than commit right now to a big ticket purchase. And instead of moving towards cleaner, greener motoring, British roads will remain clogged up with older, more polluting cars until the tide meaningfully turns towards electric. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also concerned by the modest rise in electric car sales: While new diesel registration figures are weak, the more worrying statistic is slow growth in AFV sales. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although electric and hybrid sales are up in March, a 5.7% rise is nowhere near rapid enough to keep us on track for the 2040 electric-hybrid switch over. The UK auto sector suffered a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctriple whammy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 this year, says Ian Plummer, Manufacturing and Agency Director at Auto Trader. First, Q1 of 2017 was always going to be a hard act to follow because sales were artificially inflated by consumers pulling forward purchases ahead of changes to Vehicle Excise Duty. Second, we had several days of Arctic weather and this impacted deliveries to dealers and deterred consumers from visiting showrooms. And third, the ongoing negative impact of Brexit. Not only has it severely dented consumer confidence but falling exchange rates has reduced the scope for manufacturers to entice consumers with strong offers due to the impact of a falling pound on the profitability of cars sold in the UK. Factor in the diesel crisis, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of reasons for people to put off buying a new car. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry has now suffered its longest drop in sales in over six years. The last time it fell for so many consecutive months was between July 2010 and July 2011 (13 months). Ian Gilmartin, head of retail &amp; wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, is also worried by the drop in car sales: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no disguising the fact that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another disappointing month for the new car sector. Achieving strong sales when new plate models hit the road is central to most sellers overall strategy, so there will be some concern at the continued slump revealed in these figures. However, the comparison with last March is a little misleading, as the record result posted then was in part due to sales being brought forward ahead of tax changes that came into place in April 2017. Some of the fall can also be attributed to a prolonged natural correction following a bumper couple of years, which we always knew was going to be unsustainable in the long run. The 15.7% slump in UK car registrations last month is a disappointment, says Chris Bosworth, Director of Strategy at Close Brothers Motor Finance: Traditionally March is a popular month to buy vehicles as the new number plates are out, and this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures should have been boosted by a spike in demand before the new VED changes set in. That said, petrol and alternative fuels remain the heroes of the forecourts, with diesel suffering and seeing yet another month of decline. Bosworth also predicts turbulence in the car sector as Britain exits the European Union: Dealers need to be willing and able to offer the most appropriate finance and stock to their customers, whether that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s diesel, petrol, or electric. The strong pound should ease the way and allow them to buy better value stock, while also offering breathing space for the losses incurred by cars sat on the forecourt. Confirmation that drivers are shunning diesel cars, in the light of the Volkswagen emissions scandal: NEWSFLASH: UK car sales slumped by 15.7% last month, according to new industry data which confirms that car buyers are shunning diesel cars. That means that, as feared, car registrations have now declined for 12 months in a row. Sales so far this year are down 12.4% compared to the first three months of 2017. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders say: As predicted, the UK new car market fell in March, down -15.7%, but still the fourth biggest March ever for the sector. Fall in diesel demand continues, down -37.2% compared to same month last year, with AFVs up 5.7% and petrol holding steady at 0.5%. The slump was broad-based; sales to business fell by 14.3%, while sales to private buyers shrank by 16.5%. The SMMT blame Brexit uncertainty, and the move towards banning diesel cars from some UK cities to combat air pollution. Economic and political uncertainty and confusion over air quality plans continued to affect confidence, resulting in declines across all sales types. As this chart shows, March 2017 was a bumper month -- making last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline all the sharper: European stock markets have hit a two-week high in early trading. Shares have rallied in London, Frankfurt, Paris, Madrid and Milan, on hopes that America and China will step back from launching a damaging trade war. What a difference a day makes -- yesterday, shares were sliding after China announced 25% tariffs on key US exports like soybeans, cars and aeroplanes Konstantinos Anthis, Head of Research at ADS Securities, explains: Risk appetite turns positive as US and China seem willing to negotiate a way out of their trade spat helping equities move the upside and pushing the yen and Gold further lower. China did announce a new round of tariffs worth $50 billion but said that they will only come into effect when the US implement their own measures. This suggests that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision is yet another move on the negotiating table which explains why risk sentiment didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t decline. March 2017 was a record-breaking month for the UK car industry. Sales jumped by 8% as drivers rushed to buy new vehicles before changes to vehicle excise duty pushed up the cost. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not surprising that sales fell last month. However.... a double-digit slump would be a serious reversal, and it would also mean sales have declined steadily for year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than a blip. Tony Burke, assistant general secretary of the Unite Union, tweets: Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, has confirmed that March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK car sales figures (due in 50 minutes) were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153undoubtedly grim\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Hawes also warned that Brexit uncertainty continues to cast a shadow over the sector. He told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All the indicators are that consumer and business confidence has declined, especially for the big ticket items. A car is the second biggest thing you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re likely to buy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The industry is facing this uncertainty since the referendum. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re an industry that operates on wafer thin margins so anything that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to affect the competitiveness of each of those plants is going to put a lot of pressure on. Now models, allocations tent to happen every four, maybe five years, so we can see ahead to when some of those decision points are. What we need is as much certainty in an uncertain world and trying to retain as many of the benefits as we currently have with our relationship with Europe, because it is by far our biggest market and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right on our doorstep. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The transitional deal has given us a bit of certainty for an additional 21 months and it gives us the time to be able to negotiate what that future relationship is going to look like. For us we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been very clear, we need to make sure there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no tariffs, ideally staying within the customs union and indeed the single market. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s made us so competitive and enabled us to grow since the recession. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to see that go backwards.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry has suffered another slump in car sales, as economic uncertainty and the diesel emissions scandal continues to bite. Figures released at 9am today are expected to show that new registrations shrank by around 15% last month, compared to March 2017. That would mean the industry has racked up 12 months of falling sales in a row, As Reuters explains: After record-high sales in 2015 and 2016, full-year demand dropped in 2017 due to uncertainty about future environmental levies on diesel cars and weaker consumer spending after June 2016\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote, which pushed up prices. Demand was also artificially inflated in March last year, when customers brought forward purchases to beat a tax rise which came into force in April 2017. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s automobile industry is already concerned that it could suffer badly if new trade barriers are introduced after Brexit; sliding domestic sales will only add to its anxiety. Also coming up today After yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turmoil, the financial markets are calmer as the White House tries to calm fears of a trade war. Wall Street staged a late rally last night, as Larry Kudlow, president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new top economic adviser, insisted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no trade war here,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Kudlow argued that people shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over-react to the news that America and China are threatening to slap tariffs on $50bn of each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good, suggesting that there is time to stave them off. The City has got the message; the blue-chip FTSE 100 index has just jumped by 95 points at the start of trading. We get fresh US trade figures later today, which will show whether Trump has had any success narrowing the trade deficit. Plus, data firm Markit is releasing its latest healthcheck on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector.

Dow Jones: -1% at 24,270 S&amp;P 500: -0.9% at 2,640 Nasdaq: -1.1% at 7,000 Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at currency firm Oanda says that the dollar has been little moved by the big miss on US jobs because traders have other things on their minds: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not often that the see a miss of around 88,000 in the US job creation figures and markets shrug it off but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exactly what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen today. The US jobs report was somewhat overshadowed this week by the ongoing back and forth between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies which has threatened to disrupt the period of strong growth the global economy is seeing. Despite that, traders as ever were paying very close attention to the data release and were clearly unmoved by what they saw, despite the non-farm payrolls number being well below expectations. The 103,000 increase in US jobs in March was well below the 202,000 average of the past three months. But Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, says the non-farm payrolls report is typically volatile: The modest 103,000 gain in payroll employment in March, which follows a massive 326,000 gain in February, is a good illustration of the inherent volatility in the non-farm payroll data. The March gain was the worst in six months. The February gain was the best in two-and-a-half years. Economists at ING say the US Federal Reserve is likely to shrug off the weak jobs growth in March, instead focusing on the pick-up in wage growth to 2.7% (as expected) from 2.6%. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s James Smith says we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still on track for three more interest rate rises this year: A rebound in wage growth will outweigh any concerns over lower payrolls for the Fed, as policymakers gear up for three more hikes this year. With core inflation set to reach the 2% level again in data released next week, we expect the Fed to raise rates a further three times this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although of course, policymakers will also have a firm eye on escalating global trade tensions. The headline figure on March payrolls was a very big miss but there was better news on wage growth, which picked up to 2.7% year-on-year last month from 2.6% in February. But a predicted fall in the jobless rate to 4% did not materialise, instead remaining unchanged at 4.1% according to the US Labor Department. The department said the 103,000 increase in payrolls in March was driven by the manufacturing, health care and mining sectors, as well as professional and business services. Employment in the retail and construction sectors fell last month after large gains in February. The closely watched report is just out and shows the US economy added 103,000 jobs in March. It was the lowest in six months and sharply below economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts of 193,000. The figure for February was revised up to 326,000 from 313,000. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost time... President Trump is standing by his trade policy today: He has also retweeted his tweet from Wednesday when he claimed America was not in a trade war with China: The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sugar tax comes into force today, in an attempt to lower sugar consumption and reduce obesity rates in the UK. Officially called the soft drinks levy, prices of some drinks will rise as manufactures pass on some of their additional costs. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says the policy is well-targeted to reduce sugar consumption among the young: Trade war or rebalancing? Here is our full story on this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK productivity figures, which showed a pick-up for a second consecutive quarter at the end of 2017: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payrolls day, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get the latest snapshot of the US jobs market when the Labor Department publishes the March figures at 1.30pm UK time. Here is what is expected from economists polled by Reuters. (Figures in brackets show February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures, which could be revised.) US non-farm payrolls: +193,000 (+313,000) Unemployment rate: 4% (4.1%) Average earnings growth, year-on year: 2.7% (2.6%) US stock index futures are down as a gloomy mood persists among investors on both sides of the Atlantic: Dow futures: -0.8% Nasdaq futures: -0.8% S&amp;P futures: -0.7% The Institute of Directors says its too early to get excited about the long-awaited pick-up in UK productivity. Senior economist Tej Parikh says: While productivity growth has been near its strongest since the recession in recent quarters, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still too early to begin heralding this as the start of a new trend. For starters, a drop-off in hours worked played a key role in pushing up the numbers, while all-important output growth has continued to be modest. So, policymakers need to keep their foot on the gas. Business leaders would encourage the government to push forward with consultations and with allocating funding from the Industrial Strategy, to help kick-start the economic engine. Solving the productivity puzzle will require a comprehensive approach. Directors want to see improvements in the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s physical and digital infrastructure, to help boost idea diffusion and connectivity between regions. But macro investments need to be matched by direct support for businesses, particularly the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclong tail\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of low productivity SMEs. These firms need greater assistance to absorb new technologies and to upskill their workers and management in order to deliver efficiency enhancing changes to their organisations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Robert Jenrick, exchequer secretary to the Treasury, has responded to the productivity figures with the usual stuff: We want to increase productivity growth to ensure higher living standards for people across the country. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouraging we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had the best two quarters of productivity growth since the financial crisis but we must improve productivity over the longer term, which is why we are increasing public investment in our schools, hospitals, and infrastructure in this parliament to the highest sustained level in 40 years. Productivity in the UK grew by 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017, according to figures published this morning by the Office for National Statistics. It was the second consecutive quarter of productivity growth - as measured by output per hour - and left productivity 1.8% above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2007, before the financial crisis took hold. Some decent news after a prolonged period of weak productivity since the beginning of the crisis which has left the UK lagging behind other economies and created a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153productivity puzzle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for economists, who would have expected to see a pick-up after the downturn. As the ONS explains: An increase of 0.7% is slightly higher than the average quarterly rate of productivity growth in the decade prior to the 2008 economic downturn, since when UK productivity growth has been subdued. This sustained stagnation, often referred to as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153productivity puzzle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, contrasts with patterns following previous UK economic downturns when productivity initially fell, but subsequently recovered to the previous trend rate of growth. The graph below shows how UK productivity failed to pick-up again as expected after the financial crisis: Marks and Spencer is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 this morning, closely followed by Next.

It all looks more like a classic Trump negotiation - float an extreme position to step back from the worst-case scenario in return for some big concessions. Both sides would prefer to negotiate a settlement. Nevertheless, markets will be sensitive to the fact that a full-blown trade war could result if the two camps back themselves into a corner. The risk of miscalculation increases the more the two sides push this. The US-China trade spat could wipe 0.5% off Chinese gross domestic product - if the US carries out its latest threats and Beijing responds. That is an estimate from economists at Capital Economics, who were predicting the row would cost China 0.1% in GDP before the latest escalation. They suggest that if the US does impose new tariffs on $100bn of Chinese imports, President Xi Jinping may feel he has no choice but to once again respond in kind. Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at the consultancy, explains the risks: This would mean expanding the proposed Chinese tariff list to cover nearly all imports from the US, which Chinese data put at $155bn last year. These higher stakes increase the urgency of reaching an agreement with the US but also risk a more damaging outcome if talks break down. Fighting talk from Beijing this morning as it responds to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revelation that he is considering new $100bn tariffs on goods imported from China. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement: If the US side disregards opposition from China and the international community and insists on carrying out unilateralism and trade protectionism, the Chinese side will take them on until the end at any cost. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a trade war, but we aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afraid of fighting one. In the very definition of a tit-for-tat row, Donald Trump announced on Thursday night that he had instructed the US trade representative to consider slapping $100bn in additional tariffs on Chinese goods. He said in a statement the further measures were being considered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in light of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unfair retaliation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd against earlier US trade actions. It came a day after China issued a $50bn list of US goods including soybeans and small aircraft for possible import tariff hikes. That itself was 11 hours after the White House announced a list of 1,333 Chinese imports, also worth about $50bn, for punitive tariffs of 25%. Traders at spread-betting firm IG are expecting US markets to open lower. (The Wall Street opening bell goes at 2.30pm BST.) The FTSE 100 has opened lower this morning, along with the rest of its major European peers, as investors fear a full-blown trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. FTSE 100: -0.3% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.5% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.4% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.2% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.6% Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.3% Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors were left rattled after Donald Trump revealed after markets closed on Thursday night that he was considering imposing new tariffs on $100bn of goods imported from China. The news threw traders, who had been hopeful that a full-blown trade war could be avoided. China has responded this morning by saying that Beijing would fight the US \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at any cost\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Jasper Lawler from London Capital Group explains how investors reacted to the latest developments: Trumps announcement of a potential further $100 billion of tariffs on China briskly ended any hopes of an amicable conclusion to escalating trade tensions, initially sent Asian markets tumbling, along with European and US futures sharply lower. Whilst the knee jerk reaction was a heavy sell off from traders, markets since pared some losses, with Asia closing mixed and Europe still pointing to a lower start but less extreme than when the news broke. The message from the White House has been mixed at best this week, with White House advisor Larry Kudlow and other officials playing down any trade war fears, which worked to boost the markets. However, much of the good work by Kudlow and co was undone by Trump on Thursday evening, who is showing an increasingly hard-line approach. Stick with us for all the latest updates on the US/China spat. Also coming up today is the US non-farm payrolls report for March at 1.30pm BST. And its day one of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tax on sugary drinks.",

                "bodyText":"Stock markets are moving higher after a speech by China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Xi at the Boao Forum defused some of the fears of a trade war between Beijing and the US. Xi said China would take measures to widen market access for foreign investors and would lower import tariffs on products including cars. However China is reported to have filed a complaint with the World Trade Organisation over the proposed US tariffs on steel and aluminium. And investors still face a number of other uncertainties, not least the US sanctions on Russia which has hit the rouble hard. Elsewhere, Bank of England policymaker Ian McCafferty said the monetary policy committee should not dally over raising UK interest rates given wage growth and the strength of the global economy. The comments gave a lift to the pound. Meanwhile European Central Bank member Ewald Nowotny said it was time to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153normalise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd its monetary policy. And in the US, producer prices rose by more than expected in March, giving more ammunition to the Federal Reserve to increase borrowing costs. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. With trade war fears easing after the overnight speech from Chinese president Xi, US markets have opened sharply higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 390 points or 1.63% higher, while the S&amp;P 500 is up 1.36% and the Nasdaq Composite has climbed 1.65%. Commenting on the Xi speech to Reuters, strategist Art Hogan at Wunderlich Securities in New York said: The expectation was [the Xi speech] could have gone one of two ways: he could have been aggressive about US tariffs or been conciliatory, and it feels like he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more conciliatory. Back with the Boao Forum in China, and the managing director of the International Monetary Fund has also had talks with president Xi: Stronger than forecast US producer price figures for March give more ammunition for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again later this year. The Fed has indicated it could increased borrowing costs another two times in 2018 but some expect another rise on top of that if the economic data merits it. So a 0.3% rise in the producer price index last month adds fuel to those expectations. That is an increase from the 0.2% rise in February, and higher than analyst forecasts of 0.1%. The year on year increase in March was 3%, up from 2.8% in the previous month and ahead of the 2.9% expected. The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures index, rose to 1.6% after being at 1.5% for four months. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which released the data, said: A major factor in the March advance in prices for final demand services was the index for outpatient care (partial), which climbed 0.4 percent. The indexes for machinery, equipment, parts, and supplies wholesaling; cable and satellite subscriber services; airline passenger services; food and alcohol wholesaling; and hospital inpatient care also moved higher. In contrast, margins for automotive fuels and lubricants retailing fell 10.4 percent. The indexes for apparel, footwear, and accessories retailing and wireless telecommunications services also decreased. As a sign things are a little calmer on the stock markets at the moment, the VIX volatility index - which had been rising in recent days - is currently down 5% at 20.61. That is not to say there are not a number of uncertainties for investors, from the US/China trade dispute, the situation in Syria, Russian sanctions and the latest on the Mueller investigation in the US. European stock markets are holding on to their gains, and Wall Street is still expected to open sharplyhigher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The Dow Jones is all set to leap 320 points after the bell, a chunky jump that would take the beleaguered index to 24300, pushing it towards the top end of its recent trading bracket. However, it is important to note that the US open and close can often operate in completely different universes, especially if Trump gives into his urge to cause a bit of Twitter chaos. Brexit is getting real: The pound has hit a day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high of $1.4179, up 0.38% on the talk of further interest rate rises. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB, said: Sterling has moved higher after some hawkish comments from BoE member McCafferty in which he cautioned fellow rate-setters against dallying when it comes to further tightening monetary policy. McCafferty was one of two dissenters who called for higher rates at the last meeting when the bank decided to keep its policy unchanged and his recent comments have pushed the pound/dollar rate to its highest level in more than a fortnight. With the bank expected to raise rates next month, remarks from the voting members will take on a greater importance in the coming weeks with the previous hike in November - the first such increase in more than a decade - being widely telegraphed in advance. Despite the slump in the rouble, Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has no plans to introduce any measures to reduce volatility. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first deputy chairman Sergei Shvetsov said the situation with the rouble was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adequate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to Reuters. And back with the effects of the US sanctions on Russian companies: At the time London stock exchange chief executive Xavier Rolet said: We warmly congratulate Mr Sokov and his management team on their successful IPO today. Welcoming En+ Group to London Stock Exchange is a significant milestone which underlines the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position as the leading global listing venue for international companies and investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 appetite for Russian issuers. With 100 Russian and CIS businesses listed and traded on London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets, with a total capitalisation of over $550 billion, London is a strong partner to Russian companies seeking access to global investor capital, as well as an open and dynamic place to do business. And the company was invited to open trading on the day it listed in November: The average British household benefited from the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emergency interest rate cut in the financial crisis to the tune of almost \u00c2\u00a39,000 in pay and \u00c2\u00a390,000 in household wealth, according to its chief economist. Speaking in Australia, Andy Haldane is defending some of the benefits from low interest rates just before Threadneedle Street looks to increase them to levels unseen since the 2008 crash began. According to him, the impact of low rates and quantitative easing has been to keep more people in work - helping them with their earnings - and to keep borrowing costs cheap to help cut mortgage costs. Asset prices have also been inflated, helping those who held them - even if they got less on their cash savings held in bank accounts. The significance of the loose monetary policy from the Bank is so significant, he says, that GDP in the UK would have been around 8% lower, unemployment 4 percentage points higher and the level of consumer prices 20% lower without its package to cut rates to 0.5% and inject \u00c2\u00a3435bn into the economy through QE. Just 4% of households were made \u00c2\u00a3500 or more worse off when taking income and wealth effects together, he says. And here is the dramatic movement in the rouble - it shows the rise in the number of roubles needed to buy one dollar: Meanwhile the Russian rouble continues to come under pressure following the US sanctions against a number of its companies. The currency is down around 4% against the dollar to 63.28, its second day of heavy losses and its lowest level since December 2016. And there is another twist in the trade dispute between the US and China. Associated Press reports: China is filing a complaint with the World Trade Organisation against U.S. tariffs on steel, aluminium products. The Geneva-based trade body said on Tuesday that China has requested 60 days of consultations with the United States to resolve the dispute. If the two sides can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree on a solution, the next step could be for Beijing to request a ruling from a panel of trade experts. China claims the duties of 25 percent on imports of steel and 10 percent on imports of aluminum products breach international trade rules. The Bank of England is not the only central bank to be considering reigning in the financial stimulus - low interest rates and quantitative easing - that have supported stock markets since the financial crisis. Speaking in London, European Central Bank policymaker and Bank of Austria governor Ewald Nowotny said it was now time to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153start the gradual normalisation of monetary policy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said: We are at an important turning point in monetary policy. We must normalise policy not too soon but not too late. He said there was the risk of stifling the recovery if the ECB tightened monetary policy too soon, but also a risk of an asset boom if it tightened too late. Sterling has edged to a two week high after the comments from Bank of England policymaker Ian McCafferty that there should be no delay in raising interest rates. The pound hit $1.4168 against the dollar in the wake of the remarks, up 0.28%. Against the euro sterling is 0.13% better at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1485. UK interest rates should be raised again without delay, a leading Bank of England policymaker has said. After its meeting last month the Bank hinted at an increase in May, and in an interview with Reuters, Ian McCafferty said the prospect of faster pay rises and a strong pick-up in the global economy emphasised the need for dearer borrowing costs before long. McCafferty said that wage growth, which has lagged inflation for much of the past decade, could prove to be stronger than many of his colleagues on the monetary policy committee believed. He told Reuters: We shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dally when it comes to tightening policy modestly,. Reuters adds: McCafferty said he could not be certain about whether to vote again for a rate rise until May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy meeting, but there had been no data or Brexit developments so far to make him think he was wrong in March to vote to raise rates to 0.75 percent. The former chief economic adviser to the Confederation of British Industry has been in the minority of BoE policymakers pushing for a rate hike previously in the past four years. Speaking in his office in the BoE on Monday... McCafferty said that as well as the boost from the world economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong recovery, he thought there was now no slack left in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market. Unemployment at its lowest rate since 1975, skill shortages and signs that employers were resorting to higher wage offers to lure staff from rival firms or stop them from leaving would also create inflation pressure. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not wages suddenly bursting away, but it gives you a modest upside risk,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said McCafferty, whose term at the central bank ends in August. And the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153jury is still out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on whether the inflationary hit from the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote in 2016 would fade as quickly as expected, he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On balance, those three arguments give me some potential modest upside risks to the (inflation) forecasts,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd McCafferty said. While the BoE had been wrong in the past about wages finally gaining momentum, labour market surveys so far this year showed that the recent recovery in the headline rate of growth of pay to nearly 3 percent looked more sustainable this time, he said. Often called one of the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most hawkish policymakers, McCafferty said there had been a case for following up November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate move with another hike as early as February. But he held off to avoid surprising households who had been told by the BoE that it plans to raise rates only gradually... On Brexit, McCafferty said British exporters remained in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a sweet spot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, helped by the weakness of the pound while concerns that they might lose business with supply chain customers elsewhere in the EU had so far proven overdone. But there were signs that British companies were wary about making long-term investments, and potential Brexit stumbling blocks would remain, he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a permanent feature of the landscape,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd McCafferty said. Mining shares are leading the way in London, while news that US regulators have approved Bayer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover of Monsanto and a positive update from LVMH have also helped sentiment. But ahead of the start of the US reporting season, the main support for the market in early trading is Chinese president Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech at Boao. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale said: What President Xi didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say at the Boao Forum matters more than what he did. There are plenty of reforms to come, including reduced auto tariffs, but no details. But the lack of any ramping-up of the US/Chinese trade-war-by-rhetoric was the key for equities to rally. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor said: President Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech overnight appears to have struck the right tone, providing some relief for investors who have been buffeted by the recent war of words between Trump and China over trade. While there was already an overwhelming sense that Chinese officials were keen to achieve a negotiated settlement before the proposed tariffs do any lasting damage to either the Chinese or US economies, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech was the clearest indication yet that China is prepared to take concrete steps to address some of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief criticisms. The big question is whether President Trump will now take the olive branch offered by Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conciliatory approach and dial down the rhetoric from his side too. Corporate profits have taken a back seat to trade tensions and increased volatility over the past few weeks, but as the US earnings season starts in earnest this week, they will take on huge significance. Equities received a huge boost when the US tax reform bill was signed into law in December and investors will want to see that this is feeding through to the bottom line to justify their continued faith. A good earnings season would do a lot to regain some equilibrium and provide some much-needed relief and calm for beleaguered investors. As fears of a trade war between China and the US ease - for the moment - after president Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech overnight, European markets have opened in a positive mood. The FTSE 100 is up 0.5% or 41 points, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has added just over 1%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.8% and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex is 0.6% better. And the US futures are predicting the Dow Jones Industrial Average - which added just 0.19% in the end on Monday - will open around 360 points higher or 1.5%. More fallout from the US imposition of sanctions on various Russian companies. Glencore, which has various contracts with Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rusal for the purchase of aluminium, says it is now evaluating these contracts. Glencore boss Ivan Glasenberg has resigned from the Rusal board, and a deal for Glencore to swap its shares in Rusal for global depository receipts in EN+ - which manages the assets of Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska - will not now go ahead. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A keynote speech by Chinese president Xi Jinping at the Boao Asian forum overnight has eased some of the concerns about a possible trade war with the US. America had proposed slapping tariffs on $50bn - or even $100bn - worth of Chinese products which prompted a tit-for-tat response from Beijing. Weekend comments from Donald Trump seemed to suggest the two sides might be able to reach a compromise, but on Monday, in typical fashion, the US president came out fighting again: So Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments at Boao were awaited with some trepidation. Investors were hoping to hear some positive news on China opening up its markets but were also wary of what he might say about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threats. In the event Xi seemed to make some veiled criticisms of the US but also said China would take measures to widen market access for foreign investors and would lower import tariffs on products including, yes, cars. Here is our report on the speech: The news made for a positive performance on Asian stock markets, with the Nikkei 225 up 0.74%, and this is likely to translate into an opening rise in Europe: Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Once again it is the background noise that is driving short term sentiment with big swings intraday making the price action difficult to predict. [Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] pledges to open up China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and lower import tariffs, while nothing particularly new, sent Asia markets higher and are likely to translate into a positive European open this morning. Whether they translate into anything other than words is another story but for now they appear to signal a willingness for China to move forward the discussions on trade with the US. But things are likely to remain volatile. For a start, as we know, Trump is nothing if not unpredictable, so his response to Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments will be interesting. Plus there are wider issues to unsettle investors. The imposition of sanctions by the US on a number of Russian companies sent the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market sharply lower on Monday, while growing tensions over Syria are also causing concern. The recent appointment of the hawkish John Bolton as the US national security advisor may not help matters. There is also the continuing dispute between the UK and Russia over the Salisbury poisoning. In the US itself, there are more uncertainties. The country faces a $1trn deficit, while Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal lawyer Michael Cohen had his office raided by the FBI. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: The raid was in connection with payments to adult star Stormy Daniels and conducted by the Justice Department with help from a referral from the Mueller investigation. The escalation that people are watching out for is that Trump responds by firing Robert Mueller. Political fireworks at home would put extra pressure on delicate trade negotiations. Elsewhere it is another fairly quiet day on the economic and corporate front, ahead of the start of the big US earnings season later this week.

The Nikkei in Tokyo closed 0.26% higher while Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng was 1.7% lower.</p> \n  <p><strong>There is relief that western missile strikes on Syria on Friday did not prompt a response from Russia, Syria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main ally, although traders will be watching cautiously for any signs of escalation of the conflict.</strong></p> \n  <p>Oil prices are slipping, with Brent crude in London down 1% to $71.83 a barrel while US crude is 0.9% lower at $66.79 a barrel.</p> \n  <p>Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One of the main concerns last week was around the extent of the response by the US backed coalition on president Assad of Syria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forces and any Russian reaction to it. The firing of over 100 cruise missiles over the weekend on various targets, with little in the way of casualties, appears to be tempered with relief that while it may reduce the risk of an escalation in the short term, it in no way means that we might not get a counter response further down the line. As such markets here in Europe look set to open cautiously higher this morning after shares traded slightly firmer in Asia.</p> \n   <p>The US also appears to be complementing its military approach by focusing on the additional sanctions route, after UN ambassador Nikki Haley announced that further sanctions were being discussed on Russian companies who have dealings with Assad and the use of chemical weapons, with details likely to be announced by US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin later today.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Geopolitical developments and corporate earnings remain the main focus, in the absence of major economic news apart from US retail sales data for March, out at 13:30 BST. </p> \n  <p>In the UK, we will get the latest labour market stats tomorrow, followed by inflation on Wednesday and retail sales on Thursday, but today the calendar is barren.

                "bodyText":"Wall Street has opened higher, as fears of an escalating conflict in Syria faded. Dow Jones up 0.5% S&amp;P 500 up 0.5% Nasdaq up 0.66% However, European stock markets have slipped after starting the day in positive territory. The FTSE 100 index in London has fallen more, dragged down again by the stronger pound. Sterling is trading 0.57% higher at $1.4323, the highest since 25 January, and the second-highest level since the Brexit vote. UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index down 0.8% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax down 0.15% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC down 0.09% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB down 0.05% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex down 0.03% Oil prices are falling today. Brent crude in London has lost 1.3% to $71.64 a barrel while US crude is down 1.4% at $66.43 a barrel. With this, we are closing the blog. Thank you for reading and for your great comments. We will be back tomorrow. Since Trump became president in January 2017, the dollar has weakened substantially against most major currencies, including China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yuan and, until the US sanctions against Russia in the last few weeks, the rouble. Against the yuan, the dollar has fallen 8.6% since 20 January 2017, Reuters data show. It has risen 4.5% against the rouble, although it was down 4% against the Russian currency until new US sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs were announced 1 1/2 weeks ago. The US dollar index which measures its value against a basket of major trading partner currencies has lost 11.2% since Trump took office. Back to currencies. US president Donald Trump has tweeted In Greece, the central government ran up a primary budget surplus of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.3bn in the first three months of the year, beating its target, Reuters reports. According to finance ministry data, the surplus was boosted by higher tax revenues. The government was targeting a primary budget surplus, which excludes debt servicing costs, of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.09bn. The central government surplus excludes the budgets of social security organisations and local administration. It is not the measure monitored by Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU and IMF lenders but is a good health indicator of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances. While the pound is still up nearly half a percent against the dollar, Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rouble has stabilised following a steep drop earlier in the day. The dollar now buys 62.33 units of the Russian currency, compared with 63.15 in early London trading. Last week, the rouble weakened beyond 65 against the dollar for the first time since late 2016 after new US sanctions against a number of Russian oligarchs and officials. More sanctions are looming today, in retaliation for Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support for the Syrian regime which is thought to be bhind the chemical weapons attack in Ghouta two weeks ago. Over in the US, retail sales bounced back in March after three months of falling sales, with households buying cars and other big-ticket items. The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.6% last month from the previous month, following declines of 0.1% and 0.2% in February and January respectively. Sales were up 4.5% from a year earlier. Excluding cars, petrol, building materials and food services, which can be volatile, retail sales rose 0.4% compared with an unchanged reading in February. Economists have blamed the weakness in consumer spending at the start of the year on delays in processing tax refunds, which have held back households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 spending power. Bookmaker Betway has suspended betting on the next governor of the Bank of England after a flurry of bets on Andrew Bailey. The next governor, who will succeed Mark Carney in June 2019, is expected to be announced towards the end of the year. Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority had been relatively unfancied at 9/1, but the online bookie received a sudden influx of bets on him succeeding Carney and has suspended betting as a result. Bailey had been tipped by City economists as the most likely candidate to succeed Carney. Betway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alan Alger said: There had been some speculation that Andrew Bailey was a leading candidate to replace Mark Carney as the new Governor of the Bank of England and in the last few days we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen huge support for him taking the role. The current Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority was available at 9/1, but as a result of the weight of support towards him, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had no choice but to suspend the market. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Xi Jinping has said rising protectionism adds risks and uncertainty to the world economy, according to state media. His comments were made to Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum. Xi also said it was necessary for both sides to strengthen cooperation and work together to find new driving forces for global economic growth. Sterling has climbed above $1.43 for the first time since 25 January, and only the second time since the Brexit vote in June 2016. The pound climbed as high as $1.4318, up 0.54%, as technical meetings between UK and EU negotiators got under way in Brussels, followed by talks over the Irish border issue on Wednesday. Brian Martin, head of global economics at ANZ, said there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong vested interest on both sides to agree on a workable trade deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, Jane Foley, senior currencies strategist at Rabobank, cautioned that hopes that a trade deal can be hammered out by October 2018 may be too ambitious, with the north Ireland border remaining a particular area of concern. Markets also have their eyes on key UK labour market, inflation and retail sales data in coming days. The Bank of England is widely expected to raise interest rates next month but if there are further signs of an economic slowdown, a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dovish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rate hike would put pressure on sterling, analysts say. Octavio Marenzi, CEO of capital markets management at consultancy Opimas, has sent us his thoughts on Bank of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first-quarter results. We are seeing a very favorable environment for banking currently and Bank of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings reflect this. Overall, BofA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results are good, and pushed RoE [return on equity] above 10%, even if they are not as strong as arch-rival JPMorgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Consumer Banking and Wealth Management registered solid, sustainable growth in revenues. However, investment banking fees pulled Global Banking into slightly negative territory. BofA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results in fixed-income trading were not as strong as we expected and declined compared to Q1 last year, but handily beat the last quarter of 2017. EU foreign ministers have threatened to impose new economic sanctions on Syria over the recent chemical attack on civilians in Ghouta near Damascus, but held off from joining anticipated new US sanctions against Russia. The 28 foreign ministers said in a joint statement after talks in Luxembourg: The European Union will continue to consider further restrictive measures against Syria as long as the repression continues. In the US, the bank earnings season continues. Bank of America has reported a 34% rise in first-quarter profit after the lender benefited from higher interest rates. The second-biggest US bank by assets said net income rose to a record $6.5bn in the three months to March from $4.5bn a year earlier. Earnings per share climbed to 62 cents from 45 cents. Wall Street analysts had expected 59 cents per share. Total revenues rose 4% to $23.3bn. Consumer banking, Bank of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest business, posted 9% growth in revenues to $9bn. It relies heavily on higher interest rates to maximise profits because it has a large amount of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities. Chief executive Brian Moynihan said: Strong client activity, coupled with a growing global economy and solid US consumer activity, led to record quarterly earnings. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank JPMorgan Chase and Citi also reported strong earnings on Friday. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, has looked at the Footsie. The FTSE was dealing with duel pressures this Monday, both in its commodity sector losses and the success of sterling. While the rest of the markets held strong, the FTSE dropped 35 points to send it towards a one week low. Part of that decline is being informed by the chunky drop suffered by BP and Shell, which slipped 1.5% and 0.8% respectively. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because Brent Crude itself fell 1.2%, the black stuff in retreat in response following the contrast between the actually military engagement seen in Syria over the weekend and the supply-worrying rhetoric used by Trump last week. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the only thing upsetting the FTSE \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the index also had to deal with the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest increase. Against the dollar sterling shot up half a percent, sending cable above $1.43 to its highest price in almost a year and a half. The currency was less robust against the euro, and even then it lifted it towards a fresh 11 month peak. Turning to this afternoon and the US open may inject a bit more positivity into a fairly stagnant session. The Dow Jones is expected to surge 150 points after the bell, a move that would lift the index back above 24500. As for data, the focus will be on retail sales, with analysts expecting a rise from -0.1% to 0.4% month-on-month. Stock markets have got off to a (cautiously) positive start to the week despite air strikes carried out by the US, UK and France in Syria over the weekend, in response to a chemical weapons attack a couple of weeks ago. The missile strikes had been well-flagged and Russia did not retaliate. UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index down 0.41% at 7234.83 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax up 0.18% at 12,465.78 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC flat at 5315.57 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB up 0.22% at 23,382.52 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex up 0.16% at 9782.50 Oil prices are falling. Brent crude in London has lost nearly $1 to $71.63 while US crude is down 86 cents at $66.53 a barrel. Spot gold has steadied at 1,344.38 an ounce, down 0.1%, after hitting an earlier peak of $1,348.69. The dollar continues to weaken, while sterling is strengthening ahead of key economic data this week. Russian stocks are falling ahead of likely new US sanctions. The rouble-dominated RTS index has slipped 0.4% while the rouble-based MOEX index is down 0.6%. The US is due to announce new economic sanctions against Russia today aimed at companies that are believed to be involved in equipment linked to chemical weapons, according to Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations. The EU has already imposed a range of economic sanctions on the Assad regime, cutting off most diplomatic and economic sanctions, but with very limited impact. Russia is Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest energy supplier. While the EU imposed sanctions against Moscow over the crisis in Ukraine, it is cautious about new punitive measures. It appears unlikely that the European Union will join the US in imposing new sanctions on Russia or Syria over the chemical weapons attack that prompted the first co-ordinated western air strikes in Syria at the weekend. EU foreign ministers are putting the emphasis on diplomacy at a meeting in Luxembourg. Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok, who met his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Moscow on Friday, told reporters as he arrived at the meeting today: We have to keep pushing to get a ceasefire and humanitarian aid through the [UN] Security Council and eventually a peace process. The only solution is a peace process through the Security Council. British foreign secretary Boris Johnson told reporters: It is very important to stress [the strikes are] not an attempt to change the tide of the war in Syria or to have a regime change. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid the Syrian war will go on its horrible, miserable way. But it was the world saying that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had enough of the use of chemical weapons. Sterling has touched an intra-day high of $1.4304 against the dollar, up 0.5%, the highest level since 25 January. Stock market futures are still suggesting a higher open on Wall Street, with the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 seen opening 0.6% while the Nasdaq is expected to rise 0.7%. The EU has called on Russia and Iran to use their influence on the Syrian government to prevent it from using chemical weapons again. The EU said in comments released to a meeting of the global chemical weapons watchdog, seen by Reuters: The EU calls upon all countries, notably Russia and Iran, to use their influence to prevent any further use of chemical weapons, notably by the Syrian regime. And here is our story on Wetherspoon closing all its social media accounts, a move that has been met with scepticism. Matthew Weaver writes: The pub chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision was reportedly in response to the trolling of some MPs, but many commentators suspected it was a publicity stunt by the chairman, Tim Martin. Commercial real estate agency and consultancy Colliers International says 15 major UK retailers or restaurant groups have gone into CVA (company voluntary arrangement) or administration in the past 12 months. Colliers has calculated that around 12,000 jobs have been lost or are on the line. The most recent business failure was Conviviality, the company behind Bargain Booze and Wine Rack. We wonder how many more retailers are going to get into trouble or people lose their jobs before someone decides to tackle the problem properly. John Webb, head of business rates at Colliers, says: These figures are as bad, if not worse than the crash of 2008/9 when 16 companies went into administration- 12 in 2008 and 4 in 2009- and we are only in April now. Data from Visa card released overnight shows a steep fall in consumers on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high streets in March. The number of people visiting UK shops dropped 6% compared with the same month last year, the biggest fall in shopper numbers since the end of 2010. UK pub chain JD Wetherspoon is shutting all its social media accounts in protest against the mis-use of personal data and the failure to tackle online bullying. Wetherspoon said it was closing Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts for its head office and almost 900 pubs in Britain and Ireland. Mark Zuckerberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Facebook is under huge pressure after it emerged that the personal information of millions of users was gathered by Cambridge Analytica, the data analytics firm that worked with Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election team and the winning Brexit campaign. Zuckerberg has admitted that the data breach included his own Facebook profile. Social media platforms have also been criticised for doing too little to crack down on bullying and hate speech. Wetherspoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman and founder Tim Martin said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s becoming increasingly obvious that people spend too much time on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, and struggle to control the compulsion. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that closing these accounts will affect our business whatsoever, and this is the overwhelming view of our pub managers. Martin has also been vocal in his support of Brexit. Last year Wetherspoon was forced to issue a denial after a spoof Twitter account falsely claimed the company did not allow staff to wear poppies at work to commemorate fallen service men and women. Sterling has fared better than the dollar. The pound is up 0.28% to $1.4276, continuing a two-week rally against the dollar that saw it push towards a new post-Brexit referendum high on Friday. Against the euro, sterling has slipped 0.1% to 86.49p but remains at its highest level since late May 2017. Key economic data on British unemployment, wages, inflation and retail sales are due this week. Markets expect the Bank of England to hike interest rates by a quarter point next month. Marc Ostwald, global strategist at ADM Investor Services International in London, said: With markets almost fully discounting a BOE rate hike, this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s run of monthly indicators are anticipated to give the hike a green light. Japan and China agree that a trade war will have serious consequences for the world economy, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign minister Taro Kono has said today following high-level talks between the two countries. Kono told reporters after the first such dialogue in nearly eight years, according to Reuters: We have shared understanding that a trade war, no matter which country has brought it about, would have a very large impact on the prosperity of the international economy. There are fears that a trade row between China and the US could escalate, with the two nations threatening each other with higher tariffs. On currency markets, the dollar is struggling. It is flat against a broad basket of major currencies but has weakened 0.3% so far this month, and lost 2.5% since the start of the year. The euro is steady, trading at around $1.23. Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit Agricole, told Reuters: The military strikes were well telegraphed and we are seeing a continuation in the broad market theme from lat week of a weaker dollar and favourable conditions for risk taking. European stock markets have given up some of their earlier gains. FTSE 100 index down 0.14% at 7254.60 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax up 0.12% at 12,457.13 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC up 0.03% at 5316.83 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB up 0.17% at 23,369.72 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex up 0.19% at 9785.50 The rouble and Russian stocks are heading lower, dragged down by the threat of new US sanctions and falling oil prices. Washington said on Sunday it would impose further sanctions against Russia on Monday over Moscow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support for Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Details are expected later today. The rouble has lost 0.3% against the dollar to 62.24 and 0.4% against the euro to 76.85 Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dollar-denominated RTS index has fallen 0.66% while the rouble-based MOEX Russian index is down 0.35%. Oil prices have extended their losses, with Brent crude in London down more than $1 a barrel at $71.51, a 1.5% fall. Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sale of its oncology business includes leukaemia therapy Oncaspar, the rights to pancreatic cancer treatment Onyvyde outside the US and other drugs in development. Jefferies analysts Peter Welford, David Steinberg and Lucy Codrington believe the deal will boost Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiating position in any talks with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest drugmaker Takeda, which has disclosed that it is considering a bid. We see the possible strategic fit given the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus therapeutic areas of oncology, gastrointestinal and neuroscience, with Shire bolstering the latter two franchises. Furthermore, Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading global position in rare diseases would likely be attractive for most large pharma/biotech, particularly given the long duration assets in immunoglobulin and enzyme replacement therapy Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current market value is around $37bn, down 6% since disclosing its interest in Shire, against the London-listed company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $47bn. The Jefferies analysts say: Hence, we presume Takeda would need a significant equity raise to acquire Shire, suggesting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153merger\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is perhaps better terminology, which may raise hurdles to the successful completion of any future deal. Analysts are cautious about whether WPP will be broken up, now that Sorrell is gone. Citi analysts Thomas Singlehurst and Catherine O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill reckon the main question is whether a new WPP chief executive goes for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quick fix\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or sticks with the existing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slow fix\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In the last year, WPP has been seen by many to be losing its way. Against the backdrop of an improving macro environment, organic growth has been slowing. In practice this slowdown has been happening for years and has a multitude of explanatory factors. Anyone coming in to take over the CEO role at WPP will be entirely focused on turning this round. The debate is now whether a new CEO goes for a Quick Fix vs. (the existing) Slow Fix. Paul Richards, media analyst at Numis, says Sorrell will be hard to replace with one person. The succession has led to questions over the size and scope of WPP and we can see a change of management accelerating the current process of reducing overlap and increasing flexibility. Richards views Sorrell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tragic end to a remarkable career which saw the creation of WPP as a global leader in marcoms [marketing communications]\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. WPP has bought other holding companies (Y&amp;R, Grey, Cordiant) as well as agencies and accordingly has grown to employ over 200,000 people in 400 businesses across 3,000 offices in 112 countries. In response to industry pressures including clients in-sourcing activity, pressure on CPG and structural challenges from the duopoly of Facebook &amp; Google, WPP was already working to simplify its business and increase flexibility. We expect a new CEO to continue and accelerate this process and a strategic review could lead to the group slimming its operations by a quarter to a third in our view. WPP is due to report first-quarter results on 30 April. Sorrell is free to start a new advertising venture because he has never had a non-compete agreement, the Financial Times reports. In a farewell note to staff, Sir Martin underscored the role WPP had played in his career, saying the company was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not just a matter of life or death, it was, is and will be more important than that\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He also hinted at his next step when he signed off saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Back to the future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd WPP shares dropped as much as 5% in early trading and are now down 1.7% at \u00c2\u00a311.67, with investors worried that Sorrell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure leaves the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest advertising group rudderless at a time when it might be broken up. European stock markets have opened higher, apart from the London stock market which has slipped slightly. UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index down 0.12% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax up 0.27% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC flat Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB up 0.13% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex up 0.08% Shares in Whitbread have surged nearly 8%, replacing Shire as the top riser on the FTSE 100 index in early trading. Whitbread is under mounting pressure from hedge funds to break up its business by spinning off the Costa Coffee chain, after activist investor Elliott Advisors built up a stake of more than 6%. Shares in Shire have opened 2.6% on the news, making it the biggest riser on the FTSE 100. Shares in WPP have dropped 5% after the departure of chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell. London-listed drugmaker Shire, which specialises in rare diseases, is selling its oncology business to French drugmaker Servier for $2.4bn. The division generated revenues of $262m last year. Shire, which is a potential bid target for Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest drugmaker Takeda, said it would consider returning the proceeds of the sale to shareholders through a share buyback. Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive Flemming Ornskov hailed the sale as a key milestone for the company. While the oncology business has delivered high growth and profitability, we have concluded that it is not core to Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longer-term strategy. We will continue to evaluate our portfolio for opportunities to unlock further value and sharpen our focus on rare disease leadership with selective disposals of non-strategic assets. The proceeds from the transaction increase optionality and Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Board will consider returning the proceeds of the sale to shareholders through a shareholder-approved share buyback after the current offer period regarding Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible offer for Shire concludes. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Following another week of gains last week, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax and the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index hitting six-week highs on Friday, European stock markets are set to open higher today. US stock futures are also up, pointing to a higher open on Wall Street later. Asian markets were mixed. The Nikkei in Tokyo closed 0.26% higher while Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng was 1.7% lower. There is relief that western missile strikes on Syria on Friday did not prompt a response from Russia, Syria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main ally, although traders will be watching cautiously for any signs of escalation of the conflict. Oil prices are slipping, with Brent crude in London down 1% to $71.83 a barrel while US crude is 0.9% lower at $66.79 a barrel. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: One of the main concerns last week was around the extent of the response by the US backed coalition on president Assad of Syria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forces and any Russian reaction to it. The firing of over 100 cruise missiles over the weekend on various targets, with little in the way of casualties, appears to be tempered with relief that while it may reduce the risk of an escalation in the short term, it in no way means that we might not get a counter response further down the line. As such markets here in Europe look set to open cautiously higher this morning after shares traded slightly firmer in Asia. The US also appears to be complementing its military approach by focusing on the additional sanctions route, after UN ambassador Nikki Haley announced that further sanctions were being discussed on Russian companies who have dealings with Assad and the use of chemical weapons, with details likely to be announced by US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin later today. Geopolitical developments and corporate earnings remain the main focus, in the absence of major economic news apart from US retail sales data for March, out at 13:30 BST. In the UK, we will get the latest labour market stats tomorrow, followed by inflation on Wednesday and retail sales on Thursday, but today the calendar is barren. The International Monetary Fund holds its spring meetings of central bankers and finance ministers in Washington this week. The main corporate news at the weekend was the resignation of WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell. He is leaving the advertising group he founded more than three decades ago ahead of the findings of an investigation into alleged personal misconduct. He is in line for almost \u00c2\u00a320m in payouts. His departure is seen as paving the way for a breakup of WPP. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a round-up of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s front pages.",

                "bodyText":"Sir Martin Sorrell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation has raised the question of whether his successor will be able to stop a breakup of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest advertising group. A number of names have emerged as potential runners and riders, including the Informa chief executive Stephen Carter, who has worked at Ofcom, cable firm NTL and at WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ad agency JWT; Adam Crozier, whose pedigree includes running ITV, Royal Mail, the Football Association and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi; the Sky chief executive, Jeremy Darroch; and Andrew Robertson, the chief executive of WPP rival Omnicom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global BBDO ad network. Some analysts believe that there is more value in breaking up the sprawling empire \u00e2\u20ac\u201c WPP employs more than 200,000 staff in 400 separate ad businesses in more than 3,000 offices in 112 countries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly as its stock market value has plummeted more than a third in the past year. A breakup of WPP could net shareholders more than \u00c2\u00a322bn, about \u00c2\u00a317 a share, much more than its current value of \u00c2\u00a311.50 a share or \u00c2\u00a315bn market cap, according to analysts.

                "bodyText":"Sir Martin Sorrell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s abrupt resignation from WPP triggered a 6.5% slide in the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price on Monday as investors mulled the uncertain future of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest advertising business. Sir Martin, who founded WPP 33 years ago, resigned with immediate effect on Saturday amid an investigation into allegations of personal misconduct. Analysts reacted cautiously to the resignation, telling investors there will not be an immediate crisis at WPP. However, they acknowledged that the market had reacted to uncertainty over succession planning at WPP, compounding a performance that has resulted in shares in the group declining by a third over the past year. One of WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest shareholders, Harris Associates, said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153regrettable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to have a leadership transition without Sorrell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s involvement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It highlights the apparent lack of detailed succession planning that has troubled us and many other observers for some time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Roddy Davidson, an analyst at investment group Shore Capital, said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are not overly concerned about the immediate impact of Sorrell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure on the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flagship agencies as these are major international enterprises in their own right, with strong performance track records and independent management structures.

                "bodyText":"Time for a quick recap. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workers have received their first inflation-beating pay rise in a year. Wages rose by 2.8% per year in the three months to February, meaning they narrowly overtook inflation. In a solid set of data, the UK unemployment rate hit a new 42-year low of 4.2% and the employment rate climbed to a record high. But.... workers are still around \u00c2\u00a3800 per year poorer than before the financial crisis, and real wage growth is likely to remain modest this year. Economists have also predicted that rising wages make a UK interest rate rise next month more likely. This helped to push the pound up to a new 22-month high this morning. Although it has dipped since, it is close to its highest point since June 2016 (before the EU referendum). The International Monetary Fund has sounded the alarm over rising protectionism in the global economy. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF also predicted that global growth will be solid this year and next, but it also sees a slowdown further ahead. World stock markets have gained ground today, thanks to strong financial results from Netflix and Goldman Sachs - and the absence of fresh geopolitical tensions. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today... The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning about trade wars hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spooked the financial markets. Over in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average has gained 209 points, or 0.85%, to 24,782. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq indices are also enjoying gains, as investors shrug off the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worries about looming problems in the global economy. Instead, Wall Street has been cheered by forecast-beating results from Netflix last night, and both Goldman Sachs and Johnson &amp; Johnson today. Why do the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term forecasts suggest Britain might outperform some EU members, despite Brexit? Maurice Obsfeld says the Fund is using a rather optimistic model for Brexit, in which no new tariffs are imposed between the UK and the European Union and there is broad equivalency between the two sides. This best-case scenario assumes that both sides aim for an agreement n their own interests. So, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if all goes well...things do not look so bad\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the UK economy, Obsfeld said. But, there will still be losses compared to staying in the EU, he adds. Chris Giles of the FT points out that the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Economic Outlook is rather more positive than Maurice Obstfeld\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy statement today. Is that because recent economic data, and spiralling trade tensions, mean the report is already out of date? Obstfeld agrees that some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high frequency data\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that suggests slowing economic growth has been released in recent weeks, since the report was completed. That includes various Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) reports, which have fallen back from recent highs. The IMF is taking questions on its World Economic Outlook now. Our economics editor Larry Elliott asks the Fund what it wants creditor nations (such as Germany and China) to do to help tackle trade imbalances. Maurice Obstfeld replies that Germany has the ability to spend more on infrastructure, and also boost private investment - measures that would close its trade surplus. On the other side of the coin, America should be more concerned about the sustainability of its public finances (the annual budget deficit could hit a staggering $1 trillion in 2020). Some reaction to the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report: The IMF has upgraded its forecast for UK growth by 0.1% this year to 1.6%, from 1.5% last October. But growth in 2019 has been lowered by 0.1% to 1.5%. That would see Britain lag behind the eurozone, which is expected to grow by 2.4% this year and 2% in 2019. The IMF has also warned America against triggering a trade war with China. In an unusually forthright comment, Maurice Obstfeld said the recent tariffs pushed through by Donald Trump will push America deeper into the red: He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These initiatives will do little\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 to change the multilateral or overall US external current account deficit, which owes primarily to a level of aggregate US spending that continues to exceed total income. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recent US fiscal measures will actually widen the US current account deficit. NEWSFLASH: The International Monetary Fund has warned that the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade system is in peril, as the showdown between America and China over tariffs threatens to boil over. The warning comes in the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest assessment of the global economy, which is being released in Washington now. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic counsellor, singled out the dangers of protectionism, saying: The first shots in a potential trade war have now been fired.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The multilateral rules-based trade system that evolved after world war two and that nurtured unprecedented growth in the world economy needs strengthening. Instead, it is in danger of being torn apart.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Obstfeld also took aim at populism, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The renewed popularity of nationalistic policies is another after-effect of the financial crisis and its prolonged aftermath.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But despite these concerns, the IMF expects the global economy to grow by 3.9% in 2018 and 2019 -- 0.2 percentage points higher than six months ago. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market figures: Confusingly, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some disagreement over whether Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living squeeze has actually ended. It all depends which inflation measure you choose -- the benchmark Consumer Price Index (CPI), or CPIH, which includes housing costs. Then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the choice between basic pay, and total pay (including bonuses). Fortunately, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures both came in at +2.8% for February. Once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve cleared that hurdle, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the question of whether to take the most recent monthly inflation figure, or the average of the last three months. The Office for National Statistics favours CPIH, which was 2.7% in December and January and 2.5% in February - comfortably below February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage growth. Thus, the ONS says that real wages are rising. But the Treasury prefers to use the average of CPI over the last three months - which, at 2.9%, is still slightly above nominal earnings. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not heard the government celebrating the end of the pay squeeze. The media, though, are generally taking February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CPI reading (2.7%) and declaring that real wages are back (just!). Over in the eurozone, German investor confidence has tumbled into negative territory. The German economic sentiment index, calculated by research institute ZEW, has slumped to -8.2 this month, from +5.1 in March. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest reading since November 2012, when the eurozone crisis was hurting confidence. ZEW blamed the decline on fears of a global trade war, and recent data showing that German exports and production output have both fallen sharply earlier this year. Carsten Brzeski of ING called today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ZEW reading a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disastrous outcome\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which bolsters fears that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth is slowing. He added: The German economy had a start to forget in the first two months of the year. In fact, while the weakening of soft data could still be labelled as a levelling off from record highs, hard data in Germany and the entire Eurozone have clearly disappointed. At least in Germany, it would require a strong rebound in March to prevent an unexpected weak first quarter. Nevertheless, there are good reasons to blame exceptional factors like the weather, the timing of vacation and the flu for weaker economic activity in the first two months. Sound fundamentals still bode well for growth in the coming months. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also not forget that up to now, trade tensions are noise for the economic outlook and central banks, rather than hard reality. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Margaret Greenwood MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs data: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After nearly eight years of austerity, average wages are still lower than they were before the financial crash a decade ago. It is shameful that over 4 million children are growing up in poverty. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While we welcome that there are more people in work, these figures mask serious inequalities in the labour market, including the employment gap faced by women, disabled people and BAME groups who have too often borne the brunt of austerity cuts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A Labour government will make tackling poverty an immediate priority with a real Living Wage of \u00c2\u00a310 per hour by 2020, an end to the public sector pay cap and urgent reforms to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deeply flawed Universal Credit programme.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With unemployment at a 42-year low, many firms are struggling to fill vacant positions. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report shows there were 815,000 job vacancies in the last quarter, which is 44,000 more than for a year ago. Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg is hopeful that this gives workers the upper hand in wage negotiations (despite the IoD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s misgivings). He writes~: Accelerating wage growth, low and stabilising unemployment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the UK seems to be approaching full employment. Employment gains are slowing despite record high labour demand. Instead, wage growth is edging up nicely as the degree of mismatch between the skills of the remaining workers and the skills demanded by firms increases. With inflation expected to fall back towards 2% this year (from 2.7% in February) Pickering reckons real weekly earnings growth can rise towards 1.0% by the end of the 2018. The pound has slipped back from the 22-month high struck this morning, and is now down 0.2% against the US dollar at $1.4319. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little surprising, given this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick-up in basic pay. It may reflect the fact that total pay (including bonuses) only rise by 2.8% -- weaker than the 3% expected. Anthony Gillham, Old Mutual Wealth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of multi-asset, points out that wage growth is still rather anaemic - leaving some households vulnerable to an interest rate rise: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although symbolic, wage growth is still only marginally above the rate of inflation and the 2.8% increase has actually come in under expectations. This relatively sluggish wage growth is despite unemployment falling to its lowest level in over 40 years. It is somewhat disappointing that wage growth hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come through more powerfully given that there is really very little room for unemployment to fall any further. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although wage growth does strengthen the outlook for the UK fractionally, it does not change the fact that over the long-term consumers have still seen real pay suffer since the financial crisis. And it is worth bearing in mind that with increased minimum pension contribution rates coming into effect this month, disposable income may even come down. The Institute of Directors has poured a little cold water over today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, by warning that bosses will struggle to keep raising workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pay. The IoD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior economist, Tej Parikh, says the worst of the pay squeeze seems to be over - but questions whether the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forward momentum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on hiring and wage growth can be sustained. With skilled labour in short supply, productivity - long the bugbear of the UK economy - is crucial, Parikh explains: Many employers are already straining to fill vacancies due to chronic labour shortages, which have been compounded in a number of sectors, including social care and hospitality, by the notable drop in the number of migrants coming to the UK. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A further pick-up in salaries will also be restrained by the limited ability of SMEs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which employ 60 percent of the workforce \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to compete for a shrinking pool of labour. As such, small business owners will need greater support in managing regulatory costs and raising their productivity if wage growth is to become a long-lasting facet of our economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Via Resolution Foundation, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation that real pay (wage increases minus inflation) is rising fastest in the financial world but still shrinking in the public sector, and beyond.... The small boost from the pick-up in wages could be wiped out for many borrowers if the Bank of England raises interest rates. Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, says people should tackle their spending before the next rate hike lands: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the time to start splashing the cash, you should make hay while the sun shines and keep control of your spending. Create a budget and make sure you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spending any more than you need too. Spend 30 minutes looking at where you could make savings, from switching where you do your weekly shop to changing your energy supplier. Half an hour of research and admin could save you hundreds, if not thousands a year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This chart shows how wages have caught up with inflation, after around a year of falling real pay: And this one shows how the jobless rate is the lowest since Harold Wilson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premiership: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unions have welcomed the news that workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pay has finally caught up with rising prices - but warned that earnings are still too weak: TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says the government must do more: Unions have negotiated pay rises for workers across the UK, from the counters at McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to the factory floor at Ford. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But wage growth is still weak. Workers are \u00c2\u00a314 a week worse off than they were in 2007 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with pay packets not expected to return to their pre-crisis level until 2025. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is why tens of thousands of people will march through London on Saturday 12 May as part of the TUC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA New Deal for Working People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 demonstration. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government must get the economy working again for working people. Ministers need to increase the minimum wage to \u00c2\u00a310 an hour, fund a proper pay rise for all public servants, and give workers stronger rights to negotiate fair pay deals.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (That 0.2% figure is based on CPIH - a measure of inflation including housing costs. If you use the Consumer Prices Index, real wages are up by 0.1%). Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Esther McVey, has hailed the news that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment rate has hit a new all-time high. She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Another milestone for employment has been reached under this Government as employment reaches a record high, up 3.2 million since 2010 - the 16th time the employment record has been broken in the same period. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That means on average, over 1,000 people have moved into work every day since 2010, and credit has to be given to the businesses who have created those jobs and the individuals who are taking those opportunities. This chart, from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report, shows how the employment rate has climbed to 75.4%: Tara Sinclair of George Washington University tweets: All this talk of pay rises may have a hollow ring in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public sector, where the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity programme has kept wage growth pinned on the mat for several years. The Resolution Foundation points out that pay is not rising uniformly across the UK - instead, those in the City have been enjoying inflation-busting pay rises for a while: Real pay (adjusted for inflation) has been rising by almost 2.8 per cent for those in finance for the past year, and 1.5 per cent for those in construction, yet the squeeze continues in the public sector. Stephen Clarke, Senior Economic Analyst at the Resolution Foundation, adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures confirm that Britain passed an important living standards milestone in early 2018 as its 12-month pay squeeze finally ended. Wages should continue to strengthen over the course of the year as inflation falls back. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good to see pay finally back in positive territory, but Britain has a lot of ground to make up after an awful decade of pay squeezes, stagnation and all too fleeting recoveries. On average, people are still taking home less than they did before the crisis. My colleague Richard Partington points out that falling inflation, rather than bumper pay rises, is behind the pick-up in real wages: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the slump in the pound since the EU referendum has now largely passed through the economic system, especially given sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent rally. Geraint Johnes, research director at the Work Foundation and Professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School, says the UK jobs market is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gradually returning to a healthy state\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He adds: These trends seem to confirm that the labour market is gradually returning to a more stable state following a period in which many workers took on gig employment as a stop-gap in the aftermath of the recession.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Borrowers beware! While the pick-up in wages is welcome, it could also prompt the Bank of England to raise interest rates from 0.5% to 0.75% next month. Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the first time in more than a year, British workers are not feeling progressively poorer month by month.... Wage growth has been the missing piece of the puzzle in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long, slow recovery from the financial crisis. With the final piece now in place the Bank of England now has the catalyst to be able to follow through on its plans to raise interest rates at the next MPC meeting in May and start the move back towards monetary normality. Jeremy Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst, says the real wage squeeze on the average UK worker is coming to an end (and not before time!). While most of this improvement has been due to a collapse in inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something that should be shown to have continued tomorrow \u00e2\u20ac\u201c businesses are paying higher wages as the labour market in the UK tightens. Unemployment is currently at its lowest level since the mid-1970s and hopefully, that will propel higher wages for months to come. As we have noted before, real wage gains are the silver bullet for the UK economy. Real wage growth is significant because it relies on optimistic employers being happy with business conditions, it allows consumers to re-balance spending figures from credit uptake and it promotes growth in generalised output with a central bank more comfortable to normalise monetary policy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In another boost, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate has hit a new 42-year low of just 4.2%, as more people find jobs. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report shows that there are now 32.26 million people in work, 427,000 more than a year ago. The number of people classed as unemployed has dropped by 136,000 over the last year, and now stands at 1.42 million. And the employment rate has hit 75.4%, the highest since records began in 1971. Basic pay in the UK is now rising at its fastest rate since August 2015, as this chart from the ONS shows: Pay including bonuses also rose by 2.8% over the last quarter. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker than the 3% which economists expected, but is still just ahead of February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate (we get March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures tomorrow). BREAKING: Pay increases in the UK have finally overtaken inflation, after a year-long wage squeeze. Basic earnings rose by 2.8% per year in the three months to February, new figures from the Office for National Statistic show. That means they rose a little faster than inflation, which dipped to 2.7% in February. This is the first time in around a year that wages have risen faster than the cost of living - and means real wages are now rising by 0.1%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small but important step towards ending the cost of living squeeze. The Office for National Statistics says: Latest estimates show that average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain in real terms (that is, adjusted for price inflation) increased by 0.2% excluding bonuses, and by 0.1% including bonuses, compared with a year earlier. More to follow.... You can get up to speed on the UK labour market with these tweets from economist Rupert Seggins: Just over 15 minutes to go until the UK labour market report is released, and tension is growing in the City. Viraj Patel, FX strategist at ING, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It seems that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re back to good old-fashioned U.K. data watching to determine the short-term direction for the currency. A 3% wage growth print in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s U.K. jobs report should seal the deal for a May BOE hike.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound is continuing to strengthen, and just touched a new 22-month high of $1.4376 against the US dollar. Sterling had now risen for eight trading days in a row, as the City braces for UK interest rates to rise in May. It may also show that worries over a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 are easing. Speaking of China....Beijing has hit back at America after Donald Trump accused it of currency manipulation. A China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign ministry spokeswoman told reporters that information coming out of United States regarding the Chinese currency is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bit chaotic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, following the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on Twitter. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the tweet in question: This is part of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-running claim that other countries are cheating America by keeping their currencies too low. But.... one could argue that Trump is actually guilty of currency manipulation, as his wilder moves can prompt traders to sell the dollar: As Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale puts it: What matters now is the nervousness induced by both President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late-cycle fiscal largesse and his twitter feed. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s observation that Russian and China are playing the currency devaluation game was an eyebrow-raiser. Overnight, China reported that its economy grew by 6.8% in the first three months of this year. That broadly matched estimates, calming worries that the Chinese economy might be cooling. However, separate date showed that industrial output missed expectations and company investment has slowed. European stock markets have risen in early trading, taking their cue from Wall Street which rallied yesterday. Royal Bank of Canada are also eagerly awaiting today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK labour market report. They say: It is expected that the unemployment rate holds at 4.3% for what would be the seventh month in the last eight. Of most interest though is likely to be the news on average earnings growth. The including-bonus measure looks as though it could hit 2.9% 3m/y from 2.8% 3m/y, and if the ex-bonus measure reaches 2.8% 3m/y, as expected, then it will be the highest rate since August 2015 and help reinforce the case for a May Bank Rate hike Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group predicts that the today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK jobs report could drive the pound higher - if wages have indeed picked up in recent weeks: Traders are looking optimistically towards today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK jobs data, with expectations that it will support a Spring rate rise by the central bank [Bank of England]. Whilst UK unemployment is forecast to remain constant at 4.3%, average earnings are forecast to hit 3% in the three months to February. Given that inflation was 2.7% in February we could start to finally see the pressure of falling wages in real terms ease for the UK consumer. A strong reading could pile the pressure on the BoE to hike rates as good inflationary pressures pick up, potentially pushing GBP/USD to $1.45. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After a year of pain, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living squeeze could finally be easing. New earnings figures released this morning are expected to show that pay has overtaken inflation, for the first time since last spring. Economists predicts that average basic pay grew by 2.8% per year in the three months to February. Chuck in bonuses too, and pay packets may have grown by up to 3%. That would overtake inflation, which dropped to 2.7% in February, meaning pay packets are no longer being totally eroded by the cost of living. This would be welcome news for hard-pressed households....and would also raise the chances that the Bank of England hikes interest rates next month. The pound has already reacted, by hitting a 22-month high this morning. At $1.4360, sterling is its strongest against the US dollar since the Brexit vote of June 2016. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: It has already been established that a significant number of Bank of England policymakers are expecting wages to start outstripping headline inflation in the coming months, and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s average earnings number for the three months to February, could well be the first sign post on the way to that becoming a reality. The jobs data may also show that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate has stuck at just 4.3%, a 42-year low. Also coming up today... The International Monetary Fund will release its latest assessment of the global economy, as its Spring Meeting gets underway in Washington. Investors will also be watching the situation in the Middle East closely, following last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strikes in Syria. Any signs that the situation is escalating could hit stocks: On the corporate front, Associated British Foods has reported a pick-up of sales at its Primark operation. It adds: Primark performed well with profit growth of 4% achieved against a backdrop of unseasonable weather in Europe and a margin decline following the adverse effect of currency on purchases. High street retailer JD Sports has also defied the high street gloom, by reporting a 24% increase in profits for the last year. Drinks retailer Majestic Wine has announced a new growth strategy. It is planning to invest up to \u00c2\u00a312m to win new customers - which will make a dent in its short-term profits: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9.30am BST: UK labour market report 10am BST: The ZEW institute publishes its survey of German economic sentiment 2pm BST: IMF releases its World Economic Outlook",

More recently Opec had agreed with Russia, another major supplier, to cap output and protect prices, even though growing production from US shale companies threatened to undermine this strategy.<br></p> <p>However a surprise drop in US oil inventories this week, along with concerns about Middle Eastern supply following the military strikes on Syria by the US, the UK and France, have kept crude prices buoyant.<br></p> <p>Meanwhile, ahead of an Opec meeting on Friday, Reuters reported that Saudi Arabia wanted to see prices as high as $100 a barrel. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Friday sees a host of energy ministers from some of the most influential oil producing nations meet in the Saudi city of Jeddah, heightening anticipation of what could be yet another production freeze/cut extension in the offing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd<br></p> </blockquote> <p>More here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/19/oil-price-hits-three-year-high-at-74-a-barell\">Oil price hits three-year high of $74 a barrel</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong><em>Goodnight!

Saudi Arabia announced their desire to see the prices reach $80-100 per barrel on Wednesday, causing oil to jump $2 (3%) to $73.40. Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments were seen as an intent to continue limiting oil production, although oil stores are currently close to the 5-year average.<br></p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth mentioning that Saudi Arabia plans to sell a 5% stake in their largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, and launch the biggest IPO in history, valued at $100Bln. Higher oil prices would likely increase demand for these shares, providing the opportunity to earn more money.</p> <p>Nevertheless, this pre-sale price pumping tactic could easily turn into a time bomb. After the deal, Saudi Arabia could return to the strategy they used in 2014, refusing to balance supply and pushing prices to multi-year lows by increasing output.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ad8aa77e4b0d4b06ccb5c4e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-19T14:56:54.683Z\">3.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nickel continues to post strong gains, due to that speculation about new US sanctions on Russian metal producers.</strong></p> <p>Fiona Cincotta, Senior Market Analyst at <a href=\"http://www.cityindex.co.uk/\">City Index</a>, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Aluminium is at a 6-year high, up 32% just this month, whilst nickel has surged 20% this week alone as concerns over Russian sanctions and supply issues dominate.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/986848807148236800\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Commodity?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Commodity</a> prices are spiking everywhere. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Nickel?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Nickel</a> is up 18% in the last 5 trading days! <a href=\"https://t.co/QioOc9y9wl\">pic.twitter.com/QioOc9y9wl</a></p>&mdash; jeroen blokland (@jsblokland) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/986848807148236800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 19, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-04-19T16:07:51.806Z\">at 5.07pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ad8a2cae4b0d4b06ccb5bc5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-19T14:54:59.491Z\">3.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3a9443fe349c92f7e38df56b1bd6b06f96f0b64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3a9443fe349c92f7e38df56b1bd6b06f96f0b64/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange today\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange today, where the Dow is down 0.2%</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ad8a6f0e4b096a5b0266a10\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-19T14:26:58.842Z\">3.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official: Allergan says it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the early stages of considering a possible offer for Shire\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</strong></p> <p>It adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No offer has been made.

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nick Fletcher on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s action in the commodity market: Oil has hit a new three-and-a-half-year peak, and other commodity prices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c notably nickel and aluminium \u00e2\u20ac\u201c moved sharply higher as Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sanctions and the continuing conflict in Syria fuelled fears of supply shortages. Brent crude rose 1.7% to $74.74 (\u00c2\u00a352.67) a barrel on Thursday, the highest level since November 2014 when oil group Opec began increasing production to protect its market share, a move that subsequently led to a supply glut and a price slump to $27 a barrel just over a year later. More recently Opec had agreed with Russia, another major supplier, to cap output and protect prices, even though growing production from US shale companies threatened to undermine this strategy. However a surprise drop in US oil inventories this week, along with concerns about Middle Eastern supply following the military strikes on Syria by the US, the UK and France, have kept crude prices buoyant. Meanwhile, ahead of an Opec meeting on Friday, Reuters reported that Saudi Arabia wanted to see prices as high as $100 a barrel. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Friday sees a host of energy ministers from some of the most influential oil producing nations meet in the Saudi city of Jeddah, heightening anticipation of what could be yet another production freeze/cut extension in the offing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Goodnight! GW At the risk of being cynical.... Saudi Arabia do have a particular motive to keep the oil price high - the impending flotation of energy giant Aramco. If crude is trading at three-year highs, Saudi might get a better price from investors for a stake in its domestic operator. But the team at FXPro say traders should be cautious, in case the stratgy changes: The main focus today is on oil prices, which, since late 2014, have continued to rise to new heights. Saudi Arabia announced their desire to see the prices reach $80-100 per barrel on Wednesday, causing oil to jump $2 (3%) to $73.40. Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments were seen as an intent to continue limiting oil production, although oil stores are currently close to the 5-year average. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth mentioning that Saudi Arabia plans to sell a 5% stake in their largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, and launch the biggest IPO in history, valued at $100Bln. Higher oil prices would likely increase demand for these shares, providing the opportunity to earn more money. Nevertheless, this pre-sale price pumping tactic could easily turn into a time bomb. After the deal, Saudi Arabia could return to the strategy they used in 2014, refusing to balance supply and pushing prices to multi-year lows by increasing output. Nickel continues to post strong gains, due to that speculation about new US sanctions on Russian metal producers. Fiona Cincotta, Senior Market Analyst at City Index, says: Aluminium is at a 6-year high, up 32% just this month, whilst nickel has surged 20% this week alone as concerns over Russian sanctions and supply issues dominate. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official: Allergan says it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the early stages of considering a possible offer for Shire\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It adds: No offer has been made. There can be no certainty an offer will be made nor as to the terms on which any such offer would be made. A further announcement will be made as appropriate. So the City might get one of its favourite things - a takeover battle, between Takedo and Allergan to take control of Shire, whose shares are now 9% higher #developing The Shire takeover battle takes another twist! Over in Washington, INF chief Christine Lagarde has been channelling JFK as she urges world leaders to take advantage of the current relative calm: The IMF is particularly concerned about America, and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to cut taxes and boost the US deficit [the equivalent of ignoring that leak in the attic, and splashing out on a new swimming pool instead] Oil is continuing to climb, with Brent now trading at $74.40 per barrel. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a gain of 1% today, and its highest level since last 2014. Traders are citing recent falls in oil inventories, and signs that Opec members such as Saudi Arabia will continue to rein in production to prevent prices falling. This chart shows how prices picked up after Opec agree to curb supplies in 2016. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs market continues to sizzle. The number of US citizens filing new claims for unemployment benefit fell to 232,000 last week, from 233,000. That suggests that job creation and retention remains strong, with the labor market close to full employment. Now we have a statement from Shire... confirming that it has rejected Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advances. But significantly, Shire also says the two sides are still talking, suggesting a takeover is still possible. The company says it has: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153entered into a dialogue with Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advisers to discuss whether a further, more attractive, proposal may be forthcoming and to understand the basis on which such a proposal would be made. The Board and management of Shire remain committed to enhancing shareholder value and are focused on fully evaluating internal and external opportunities to maximise value for shareholders, including any further proposals from Takeda. Shares in Shire have now dropped back to \u00c2\u00a338.98, leaving them around 3.7% higher today. Newsflash: Takeda has confirmed that it has approached Shire with a takeover bid -- but its advances was rejected. In a statement to the City, the Japanese pharma firm says it suggested buying Shire for \u00c2\u00a346.50 per share -- \u00c2\u00a317.75 in cash (US dollars) and \u00c2\u00a328.75 of new Takeda shares. However, Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board rejected the proposal. However, this story isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over! Takeda says that discussions between the two sides are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcongoing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, suggesting another offer could come before next Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deadline. Takeda insists that it will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remain disciplined\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over any formal offer -- a nod to Shire shareholders not to expect the moon on a stick. As previously stated, Takeda intends to maintain its well-established dividend policy and investment grade credit rating. Takeda also argues that merger with Irish-headquartered Shire would make sense: Building on Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existing momentum, the acquisition of Shire would accelerate its transformation and result in a global, value-based, R&amp;D-driven biopharmaceutical leader headquartered in Japan, with a balanced geographic footprint, a robust, modality-diverse pipeline and enhanced financial strength. Back in the City, shares in pharmaceutical firm Shire has jumped almost 7% as traders anticipate a takeover battle. Reuters is reporting that Japanese firm Takeda Pharmaceuticals has made an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcindicative takeover proposal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for Shire - which produces the ADHD drug Adderall - worth \u00c2\u00a343bn, or \u00c2\u00a346.50 per share. Last month, Takeda said it was considering making an offer for Shire, so the City has been waiting for the next move. Under takeover rules, Takeda has until 25 April to bid, or walk away. Shire was founded in Hampshire, but is now based in Ireland for tax purposes. Takeda is particularly interested in its rare diseases portfolio, where it has 40 programmes in its drug pipeline. Shire are currently up 256p at \u00c2\u00a340.12, to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. Russia has launched an attempt to win compensation over America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs on steel and aluminium. Moscow has filed an official complaint to the World Trade Organisation, arguing that the 25% tariff on steel, and 10% on aluminium, are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsafeguard measures\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - ie, designed to protect the US economy, not for national security. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important distinction - as major exporters can ask for compensation under WTO rules if they are penalised by such safeguards. As Russia puts it: Although the United States presented the measures at issue as being adopted to address the threat that imports of steel and aluminium pose to the US national security, they are in essence safeguard measures, and the Agreement on Safeguards and Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994) are applicable to them. The United States did not provide notification under paragraph 1(c) of Article 12 of the Agreement on Safeguards on taking a decision to apply the safeguard measures to the WTO Committee on Safeguards. The Russian Federation is a WTO Member that has a substantial interest as exporter of the products subject to the safeguard measures. Therefore, the Russian Federation requests consultations with the United States under paragraph 3 of Article 12 of the Agreement on Safeguards and paragraph 2 of Article XIX of the GATT 1994. So, Russia now joins China, India and the EU in opposing these tariffs: Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, says the 1.2% fall in retail sales last month is disappointing - but there are some reasons for optimism: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With snow and rain right through March including in the critical run up to Easter, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise that shoppers avoided the high street. So, while online retailers benefited to some extent, last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales were particularly disappointing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Footfall was significantly impacted by the weather, and the first of retailers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 spring/summer fashion and home product ranges would have been of little consolation to shoppers looking to stay warm. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all doom and gloom. This week, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already seen evidence of wages growing in real terms as inflation has eased. Moreover, our most recent survey* shows that consumer sentiment is recovering and is higher than it was both in December and this time last year. This is particularly true of younger people, with more under 45s saying they think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be better off next year. Keith Richardson, managing director retail sector at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, also blames the icy blast of grim weather for keeping shoppers off the streets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While Mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day and an early Easter provided some respite for retailers in March, the impact of two Beasts from the East was brutal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The high street felt the worst of the chill as shoppers simply stayed at home to avoid the snow. But it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just the weather to blame. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fashion clearly suffered as nobody wants to buy spring clothing during a blizzard, even from the comfort of their sofa. Economist Rupert Seggins says the retail sector will have a slight negative impact on growth in the last quarter: Economics journalist Dharshini David says the weak spending figures might deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates next month: Rhian Murphy, ONS Senior Statistician, says the wintery weather in March hurt Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high street stores, but boosted web retailers: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Retail sales fell in the first quarter due to a large decline in March with petrol sales seeing a significant slump as a result of the poor weather keeping many shoppers indoors. However, the snow actually helped boost online spending with department stores in particular seeing growth in their web sales. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Various shops also reported increased spending on gifts in the run-up to Easter and Mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day, which also helped boost online sales.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: UK retail sales suffered an unexpectedly sharp fall last month, as the Beast from the East hit the sector. Sales volumes fell by 1.2% on March, much worse than the 0.5% which economists had expected. The Office for National Statistics blames bad weather for the decline - backing up what Debenhams reported this morning. The figures also show that Britain has suffered its weakest quarter for retail sales in a year, with volumes down 0.5% in January-March. The ONS says: In the three months to March 2018 (Quarter 1), the quantity bought in retail sales fell by 0.5% when compared with Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2017, with declines in all sectors except for department stores and non-store retailing. The month-on-month growth rate fell by 1.2% due to a large fall of 7.4% from petrol sales; a likely consequence of adverse weather conditions, which impacted travel. Department stores were the only sector to show positive growth in March at 0.8%, with feedback from retailers suggesting that online offers for Mothering Sunday and Easter boosted internet sales more than usual during the adverse weather. The quantity bought in supermarket stores declined in March, while specialist food stores saw strong growth; possibly due to the easier access to these stores during snow. Reaction to follow... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on how the nickel price has soared as investors anticipate new sanctions on Russian metal producers: Nickel surged more than nine percent on Thursday to its strongest level since late 2014 on fears U.S. sanctions on major Russian aluminium producer Rusal may be broadened and could hit key Russian nickel supplier Nornickel. It was the second straight session of sharp gains for nickel, adding to Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 7.5-percent spike, spurred by worries over tighter global supply for a commodity already in deficit. Three-month nickel on the London Metal Exchange rallied as much as 9.3% percent to $16,690 a tonne, the highest since December, 2014. The metal, used to make stainless steel, was up 7.3 percent at $16,395 by 0702 GMT. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pretty clearly there is a lot of smoke. And pretty clearly the U.S. has Russia in its sights for a number of reasons known to them,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said UBS analyst Lachlan Shaw. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A logical extension would be if you were to broaden sanctions, then Norilsk would fall under that remit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Norilsk Nickel, or Nornickel, is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-biggest nickel producer. An official for Nornickel this week dismissed the idea of the prospect of sanctions on the company driving up the nickel price. The FTSE 100 has hit a 10-week high, as the commodity rally pushes up shares in mining giants and oil producers. The Footsie is up 17 points at 7334, as it recovers from last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Energy and raw materials companies are leading the way, with Anglo American up 1.6% and Royal Dutch Shell gaining 0.5%. Over in the City, shares in Debenhams have slumped by 10% to its lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis. Traders are unimpressed by its latest financial results, showing an 85% slump in pre-tax profits and a warning that full-year earnings will be lower than many brokers expected. The company also blamed the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBeast from the East\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for hitting sales in March, saying it had to close almost 100 stores as icy, snowy weather gripped the UK. That followed on from a disappointing Christmas, which had already prompted a profits warning in January. Debs says it is accelerating its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Debenhams Redesigned\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd strategy - an attempt to boost digital sales, cut costs, and lure more customers through the doors by billing shopping as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fun leisure activity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But...finance director Matt Smith isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hanging around to see the results - he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moving to Selfridges. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor, says Saudi Arabia is pushing for a high oil price to prop up its fiscal plans: Despite the influence of US shale, Saudi Arabia still calls the shots on global oil markets, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasingly obvious the Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are comfortable with oil at $80 or more. Add a drop in weekly US oil reserves to the mix and the only way for crude prices is up. Saudi bullishness should be no surprise given it must somehow bankroll Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expensive reforms and modernisation at home. Even lumber is being swept higher by the surge in commodity prices: The rubber price has, umm, bounced by 5% today, after China announced temporary anti-dumping measures on imports. The measures will affect halogenated butyl rubber imported from the United States, European Union and Singapore, Reuters reports The surge in commodity prices this month is quite astonishing: Shares in Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mining sector has hit a three-month high this morning, following the rally in commodity prices: Oil isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only commodity to rally today. Nickel has surged by 9% this morning, hitting its highest level since December 2014. That follows reports that Russian mining firm Norilsk Nickel could be caught up in US sanctions against Moscow. That could have serious consequences for manufacturers, as nickel is a key component in rechargeable batteries used in mobile phones and electric cars, for example. Earlier this month the US imposed sanctions on aluminium-producer United Co. Rusal. That has caused drama in the commodities markets, with aluminium up another 5% today. Bloomberg explains: Consumers, manufacturers and traders are scrambling to secure supply cut off by Rusal, the largest aluminum producer outside China. Aluminum reached a six-year high and nickel jumped the most intraday since 2009. Alumina, a raw material needed to make aluminum, notched a fresh record. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It really is unprecedented in terms of the turmoil it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unleashed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Robin Bhar, a metals analyst at Societe Generale SA, said by phone from London. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s amazing to watch.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, agrees that supply worries and geopolitical tensions are pushing oil up: Oil found support after data from the Energy Information Administration showed that crude inventories dropped 1.1 million barrels in the week to 13 April, while gasoline and distillate stockpiles fell by more than 3 million barrels. Now it is OPEC and Co.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turn to capitalize on the bullish report as they meet in Jeddah on Friday. While the elimination of oversupply has been a critical factor pushing oil prices, I still believe there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a significant risk premium being priced in, specifically the fear of supply disruption from the Middle East and possible renewed sanctions on Russia and Iran. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The oil price is on a tear this morning, hitting its highest levels since late 2014 as stockpiles fall and worries about geopolitical tensions in the Middle East weigh on the markets. Brent crude has crashed over the $74 per barrel mark this morning, following data yesterday showing a surprise drop in US oil inventories. US crude (West Texas Intermediate) is also rising, hitting a three-year high of $68.95. Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US-UK-French military strikes in Syria have also pushed oil prices higher, amid worries that supplies from the region could be disrupted. In addition, a Reuters report that Saudi Arabia is pushing for higher prices -- perhaps even $100 per barrel -- has caught traders attention. It may show that the Opec cartel will push on with its supply curbs, to keep prices buoyant. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Traders are starting to get excited that the oil market is finally rebalancing with the global supply glut evaporating. Whilst it may be premature for the OPEC led group implementing supply cuts to cheer, the numbers are certainly pointing to a potential end in sight. Also coming up today... We get a new healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sector, with sales figures for March released this morning. Economists predict that they fell by 0.5% month-on-month, as grim weather kept shoppers away from the high streets. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales numbers for March could shatter the perception of consumers feeling a little better about their spending habits. So far this year consumers have been in a fairly cautious mood with retail sales in January and February rising 0.1% and 0.8% respectively. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s March numbers could reverse all or most of these gains with expectations of a decline of 0.5%. High street chain Debenhams, broadcaster Sky and pest control firm Rentokil are also reporting to the City. The news from Debenhams isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great - pre-tax profits slumped by almost 85% in the last six months: Sky has reported a 5% rise in like-for-like revenues, and are speaking to the press now....

Without that, growth would have been 0.3%, in line with City forecasts. Activity had been weak in every month, not only in late February and early March, the ONS made clear.</p> <p>Some analysts said the first-quarter collapse of the construction company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/15/jobs-carillion-liquidation-construction-hs2\">Carillion</a>, which had knock-on effects to smaller subcontracting firms, had a bigger impact than the weather.</p> <p>Second, the strong performance by manufacturing during 2017 came to an end in early 2018. Factory output was up 1.3% in the final three months of last year but by 0.2% in the latest quarter. A slowdown in the eurozone has led to weaker demand for UK exports but survey evidence suggests that manufacturers have run into capacity constraints following years of underinvestment.</p> <p>Third, the lack of spending power for consumers is having an impact on the service sector, which accounts for around 80% of the economy and grew by only 0.3% in the first quarter. </p> </blockquote> <p>More here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/27/is-philip-hammond-right-to-be-so-tiggerish-over-the-economy-uk-gdp-growth\">Is Philip Hammond right to be so Tiggerish over the economy?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ae32d6de4b026c402d8696a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-27T14:17:51.018Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sterling keeps falling as interest rate rise looks unlikely</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back in the markets, the pound has hit an eight-week low as traders continue to digest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/apr/27/uk-us-french-growth-gdp-global-economy-tsb-bank-it-meltdown-business-live?page=with:block-5ae2df22e4b0ed4091d27185#block-5ae2df22e4b0ed4091d27185\">Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alarmingly sharp slowdown</a>.</strong></p> <p>Sterling has shed a cent and a half, to $1.37, its lowest point since the start of March.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19949dc930d5c75aa2584e82162f418407b7acd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19949dc930d5c75aa2584e82162f418407b7acd7/0_0_1793_634/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The pound vs the US dollar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"354\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The pound vs the US dollar</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The pound has also shed one eurocent against the euro, dropping to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.14.</p> <p>Investors are concluding that an early UK interest rate rise now looks a lot less likely, given the weak growth in the last quarter - and the fact that the poor weather is only partly to blame. </p> <p><strong>Lukman Otunuga, </strong>Research Analyst at <strong>FXTM</strong>, says the UK GDP figures have undermined the pound sharply. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Buying sentiment towards the British Pound was dealt a severe blow on Friday, following reports that the U.K economy grew much slower than expected in Q1.</p> <p>U.K GDP growth slowed to 0.1% in the first quarter, much worse than the expected 0.3%, and its weakest since 2012.

European stock markets showed more modest gains, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX gaining 0.65% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC up 0.5%. Markets were also cheered by the remarkable scenes from Korea today, where the leaders of North and South have held talks and even hugged like a couple of old friends. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, says: The drop in the pound has helped the FTSE 100. The British equity benchmark is internationally focused and the slide in the pound has helped the market hit its highest level since early February. The geopolitical mood is improving after the historic meeting between North and South Korean leaders, as it suggest the two nations are on the road to peace. And that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to wrap up. Thanks, and have a good weekend. GW These charts help tell the (unhappy) story of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy in the last three months: Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says there are three reasons why the UK economy slowed to a near-standstill in the last three months. First, construction had a terrible start to the year, with a drop in output of more than 3%. Without that, growth would have been 0.3%, in line with City forecasts. Activity had been weak in every month, not only in late February and early March, the ONS made clear. Some analysts said the first-quarter collapse of the construction company Carillion, which had knock-on effects to smaller subcontracting firms, had a bigger impact than the weather. Second, the strong performance by manufacturing during 2017 came to an end in early 2018. Factory output was up 1.3% in the final three months of last year but by 0.2% in the latest quarter. A slowdown in the eurozone has led to weaker demand for UK exports but survey evidence suggests that manufacturers have run into capacity constraints following years of underinvestment. Third, the lack of spending power for consumers is having an impact on the service sector, which accounts for around 80% of the economy and grew by only 0.3% in the first quarter. More here: Back in the markets, the pound has hit an eight-week low as traders continue to digest Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alarmingly sharp slowdown. Sterling has shed a cent and a half, to $1.37, its lowest point since the start of March. The pound has also shed one eurocent against the euro, dropping to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.14. Investors are concluding that an early UK interest rate rise now looks a lot less likely, given the weak growth in the last quarter - and the fact that the poor weather is only partly to blame. Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM, says the UK GDP figures have undermined the pound sharply. Buying sentiment towards the British Pound was dealt a severe blow on Friday, following reports that the U.K economy grew much slower than expected in Q1. U.K GDP growth slowed to 0.1% in the first quarter, much worse than the expected 0.3%, and its weakest since 2012. While the snow had some negative impacts on GDP, the bad weather really can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bear all the blame - its effects on growth were small. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dismal GDP figures have not only dented confidence in the health of the U.K economy, but also in the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to raise interest rates in May. With the Pound notorious for its extreme sensitivity to monetary policy speculation, further downside is likely as investors heavily reduce bets of a rate hike next month. NEWSFLASH: The Bank of England and the European Central Bank are teaming up to protect the financial services industry from Brexit risks. Details are sparse, but presumably it will look at the issue of access to the EU by City banks after Brexit, passporting, regulatory equivalence, and the huge number of EU-based derivative contracts owned by UK banks. In a statement, the UK government says: Today, the European Commission and HM Treasury have asked the European Central Bank and the Bank of England to convene a technical working group on risk management in the period around 30 March 2019 in the area of financial services. The European Commission and HM Treasury will attend as observers and other relevant authorities will be invited on an issue-specific basis. This technical work is separate from the on-going negotiations on the Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and the UK and from the negotiations on the overall understanding of the framework for the future relationship between the EU and the UK. In a nutshell.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on the American growth figures: U.S. GDP growth moderated in the first quarter, but at least part of the slowdown is statistical coming from residual seasonality in the data. Real GDP grew 2.3%, better than expected but below the 2.9% in the fourth quarter and the weakest growth in a year, according to the advanced estimate from the BEA. Growth, though modest, was widespread including investment, consumer spending, trade and government. Imports and durable goods spending were drags. Real disposable income growth accelerated to 3.4% on the back of tax cuts, after rising 1.1% in the fourth quarter. The saving rate jumped to 3.1%, from 2.6% in the fourth quarter. The US GDP report shows that consumer spending, the biggest portion of the American economy, only rose by 1.1% in the last quarter. However, business investment remained solid, and trade boosted growth (having been a drag on growth at the end of last year). Growth in government spending slowed to 1.2%, from 3%, but inventory building by companies added almsost 0.5% to growth. That all added up to a growth rate of 2.3% (if the pattern in Q1 was expanded over the full year) - a little better than expected. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some snap reaction: NEWSFLASH: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew much faster than Britain in the first three months of this year. US GDP expanded by almost 0.6% between January and March, or at an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcannualised rate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of 2.3%. That beats forecasts of 2.0% annualised growth, but is a little slower than the 2.9% recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. More to follow.... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about to discover how America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy fared in the first three months of this year. But first, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the disappointing UK growth figures: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy slowed to a virtual standstill in the first three months of 2018, the weakest period of activity in more than five years. Office for National Statistics figures showed a sharp contraction in the construction sector, weaker manufacturing growth and a squeeze on consumer spending power contributed to GDP growth of 0.1% in the first quarter. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the economy was strong and that the exceptional weather in late February and early March had been partly to blame for the slowdown. The ONS, however, said the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beast from the east\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had been only a minor factor. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The truth is that the last eight years of Tory economic failure has allowed our economy to be left exposed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear to everyone except Philip Hammond that our economy is in need of increased investment and working families are struggling with the cost of living and the burden of increasing household debt.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One week of snow doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain a decade of weak growth, dismal productivity and falling wages. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the avalanche of cuts that has done the long-term damage.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The performance of the economy was much worse than the Bank of England had been expecting and almost certainly puts paid to any chance of an interest rate rise when the monetary policy committee meets early next month. City firm Fathom Consulting reckon there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an evens chance that Britain suffers two quarters of negative growth this year - the official definition of a recession. In another worrying sign, the ONS says there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153longer-term weakening\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector, particularly in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153domestic consumer-facing industries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing the details of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK GDP report: TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady blames government cutbacks for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One week of snow doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain a decade of weak growth, dismal productivity and falling wages. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the avalanche of cuts that has done the long-term damage. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to modernise Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure. The government should set up a National Investment Bank to upgrade roads and rail, and to bring high-speed broadband and clean energy to every part of Britain. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to get our public services back up to strength. Schools, hospitals and other vital services are part of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core economy. If they remain starved of resources, the rest of the economy will continue to struggle too.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Evening Standard (edited by former chancellor-turned-newspaper editor George Osborne) has pinned the blame firmly on Brexit: The latest figures out today show gross domestic product grew by just 0.1 per cent in the first three months of this year. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a sharp fall in construction, manufacturing barely grew and the consumer is squeezed by higher inflation. All this against the backdrop of a world economy that, by contrast, is going gangbusters. Two years ago, Britain was the fastest growing of the major Western economies. Then the country voted to leave the EU, and the Government said we would also leave the single market and customs union. Now we are the slowest growing of the major Western economies. Draw your own conclusions. Liz Truss, chief secretary to the Treasury, says Britain is still \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTiggerish\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 despite the slowdown (referencing a line from chancellor Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget speech) Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures also show that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has only expanded by 1.2% in the last year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much slower than average, illustrating how growth has slowed in recent quarters. Professor Costas Milas and Dr Mike Ellington of the University of Liverpool argue that such weak growth \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kills the case\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the Bank of England raising UK interest rates next month. How likely is for this first GDP estimate to be revised upwards? Our database suggests that since 2006, the ONS has produced a first annual GDP growth reading which has on average been only 0.11 percentage points lower than the revised one. Therefore, if history repeats itself, the revised GDP growth reading will be only slightly higher at 1.2%+0.11%=1.31% which is equally disappointing! MPC members cannot, and will not, ignore the fact that the latest data for GDP growth and inflation are substantially weaker than their most recent predictions. Annual GDP growth of 1.2% is far below their forecast in February 2018 that suggested 1.65% was the most likely outcome for the first quarter of 2018. Likewise, the figure for 2018Q1 CPI inflation, of 2.7%, is also far lower than their prediction of 2.92% reported in February 2018. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official spokesman has opined: Alfie Stirling, Head of Economics at the New Economics Foundation, makes an important point - the link between wages and economic growth has frayed badly since the financial crisis: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP estimates from the Office for National Statistics are again disappointing, and fall far short of what would be expected from a healthy economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But worse still is that GDP growth of any kind is no longer leading to higher real wages. Since 2010, GDP growth has become \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdecoupled\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from growth in pay with the latest estimates showing that total pay in February was the lowest monthly level seen for 2 years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This grim phenomenon is unique, both to the community of major economies and to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own historical record. It points to an economic model that is no longer working for people.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Danielle Haralambous, UK analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buying the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsnow excuse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 either. She says: Growth was surprisingly soft in the first quarter of 2018, even lower than our expectation, which factored in the impact of bad weather in February-March. This hit output in the construction sector particularly hard, but there is more to the story than snow, and the slowdown will be a big consideration in the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deliberations next month. Ivan Petrella, associate professor at Warwick Business School, says the UK economy is showing signs of weakness - and Brexit may well be to blame. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP number confirms a recent trend of slow growth and a weakening economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One is tempted to attribute a large part of that to uncertainty following the Brexit referendum. In fact, after the initial boost to growth associated to the fall of the pound, the UK economy considerably under-performed with respect to its European partners last year and shows all the signs of heading for the same trend this year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rob Kent-Smith of the Office for National Statistics on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock slowdown: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our initial estimate shows the UK economy growing at its slowest pace in more than five years, with weaker manufacturing growth, subdued consumer-facing industries and construction output falling significantly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the snow had some impact on the economy, particularly in construction and some areas of retail, its overall effect was limited with the bad weather actually boosting energy supply and online sales.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd John McDonnell MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chancellor, says Philip Hammond should blame his own government, not the weather, for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alarmingly weak growth this year. McDonnell argues that the UK urgently needs fresh investment: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing GDP figures further confirm that continued Tory austerity cuts are weakening growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Chancellor will want to blame this all on a bit of bad weather, but the ONS say this had a limited impact. The truth is that the last eight years of Tory economic failure has allowed our economy to be left exposed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is the weakest Q1 growth since 2012. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear to everyone except Philip Hammond that our economy is in need of increased investment and working families are struggling with the cost of living and the burden of increasing household debt. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The next Labour government will end austerity and provide the investment vitally needed to kick-start the economy to deliver rising living standards for the many, not the few.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd UK chancellor Philip Hammond has blamed the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBeast from the East\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak growth, saying that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exceptional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bad weather had some impact. One problem, chancellor.... the Office for National Statistics says the snow only had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153generally small\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd impact. According to the ONS, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services industries were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broadly unaffected\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the bad weather, while there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no evidence to show that the fall in the manufacturing growth was due to the effects of the snow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tej Parikh, senior economist at the Institute of Directors, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153particularly disappointing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Growth has slowed much more sharply expected, and he singles out Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU as a factor: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The icy weather slowed industrial deliveries, grounded construction projects, and pushed consumers off the high-street, so some cooling was expected. But it clear that some further underlying weakness persists in the economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It should hopefully bounce back this quarter. Some of the business activity lost due to the snow will be recovered over the coming months, leading to a rebound in the figures. Consumer spending power will also be bolstered by the fall in inflation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But, the bigger picture remains one of a safe but sluggish economy. Confidence amongst business leaders, whilst no longer outright pessimistic, remains very much on the fence, and that is largely a result of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the precise nature of Brexit. Dr Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is suffering from political paralysis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sadly, the latest GDP figures confirm what we have been saying for some time: the UK is stuck in the global growth slow lane, while other countries race ahead. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Westminster politicians need to start focusing their attention on a much stronger, more proactive drive to boost growth and investment. While the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBeast from the East\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 clearly had an impact in the first quarter, the underlying slow-growth trend is real cause for concern. Marshall adds that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153faltering infrastructure, a training system in chaos and patchy digital connectivity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are all holding the economy back. Most worryingly, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has actually shrunk - once you adjust for population increases. Although gross domestic product has risen by a meagre 0.1% in the last three months, it contracted by 0.1% on a per-capita basis. The ONS is adamant that this slowdown can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just be blamed on the icy weather that blasted Britain over the winter: There were gasps on the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading floors (and in at least one newsroom) when the unexpectedly weak UK growth figures were released. Jeremy Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst, says the slowdown in growth caused \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a sharp intake of breath\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. 0.1% is the lowest quarter on quarter growth since Q4 2012 with particular weakness seen in construction and services sectors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sectors worth over 80% of the UK economy. There are some caveats within this number of course; it is only the advance reading and therefore subject to revision and the poor weather that the UK suffered will have had a large effect on demand, particularly private consumption. That being said, March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers were horrific, are unlikely to be part of the sample yet and any revision to this advance number could easily be lower as opposed to higher.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just UK voters who could call themselves the JAMs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Just About Managing - it now seems that the wider UK economy is in that predicament too.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Marc Br\u00c3\u00bctsch, chief economist at insurance group Swiss Life, says the UK economy failed to hit expectations: Economist Howard Archer also fears that the economy is weakening: Sterling is tumbling as City traders react to the news that the UK economy barely grew in the last three months. The pound has lost a whole cent against the US dollar to $1.3815, its lowest level since 9 March. Investors are wagering that the Bank of England will be reluctant to raise interest rates next month, when the UK economy looks so fragile. The Office for National Statistics reports that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector shrank sharply in the last three months, dragging the UK growth rate down to just 0.1%. The ONS says: UK GDP growth was the slowest since Quarter 4 2012, with construction being the largest downward pull on GDP, falling by 3.3%. Production increased by 0.7%, with manufacturing growth slowing to 0.2%; slowing manufacturing was partially offset by an increase in energy production due to the below-average temperatures. The services industries were the largest contributor to GDP growth, increasing by 0.3% in Quarter 1 2018, although the longer-term trend continues to show a weakening in services growth. While some impacts on GDP from the snow in the first quarter of 2018 have been recorded for construction and retail sales, the effects were generally small, with very little impact observed in other areas of the economy. BREAKING! UK economic growth slowed sharply in the first three months of 2018, with GDP rising by just 0.1%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the weakest quarterly growth since the last three months of 2012, and a worse result than expected. More to follow.... Tensions is building as the City prepares for the first estimate of UK GDP to be released, in just three minutes... Economist Catherine Colebrook has written about the shortcomings with GDP in the Guardian today. She says it fails to measure whether poverty is being reduced, whether the environment is being protected, or if people are happier (themes that Bobby Kennedy picked up in 1968). She explains: If we want to understand whether the economy is really delivering for its citizens, we need some new indicators. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), where I am the chief economist, is proposing a dashboard of five outcome indicators, to be updated annually, which would directly measure our progress against the outcomes the public wants the economy to deliver \u00e2\u20ac\u201c broadly shared prosperity, justice and sustainability. Our chosen indicators are the distribution of the gains from growth; poverty rates among children and adults; levels of wellbeing among individuals at different income levels; the gap between the median income of the poorest region of the UK and the richest; and the gap between projected carbon emissions and the cost-effective path to decarbonisation. Suren Thiru of the British Chambers of Commerce is also expecting a UK slowdown.... Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, says there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a risk that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate slowed sharply in the first quarter of this year, to below the City forecast of 0.3%. If so, that would cut the chances that the Bank of England raises interest rates next month. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now 50 years since Robert F. Kennedy gave his now-famous speech explaining why gross domestic product is a flawed measure that tracks \u00e2\u20ac\u0153everything, except that which makes life worthwhile\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Youtube clip of the speech, given to the University of Kansas in March 1968, three months before Kennedy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assassination. As Kennedy brilliantly put it: It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts Whitman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rifle and Speck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. The UK Treasury have created a short video explaining GDP: Sylvia Walter, senior economist at insurance company Swiss Life, says the French government shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic about the slowdown: Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that the current rolling strikes on France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s railways will hurt growth this quarter. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Marcus Bensasson says bad weather hurt the French manufacturing sector: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy saw growth slow sharply in the first quarter as winter storms ripped through the country, hitting factory production. Gross domestic product expanded 0.3 percent, the weakest in more than a year and less than half the 0.7 percent pace recorded in the previous three months. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also slightly below the 0.4 percent estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Just in: Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has posted another quarter of solid growth. Spanish GDP rose by 0.7% during the first three months of this year, official figures show. That means Spain has grown by 0.7% per quarter for nine months in a row. The annual growth rate dipped slightly, to 2.9% from 3.1%, but is still fairly strong. Bad weather, falling business investment and weaker export growth have combined to slow the French economy. Statistics firm INSEE explains that a series of factors meant French growth slowed to just 0.3% in the last three months, from a bouncy 0.7% in the last three months of 2017. According to INSEE: French household consumption rose by 0.2%, the same as three months earlier Business investment (gross fixed capital formation) dropped to +0.6%, from +1.1% Exports fell by 0.1%, having risen by 2.5% in October-December. Manufacturing production shrank by 1.1%, compared with 1.5% growth previously That all adds up to a chunky slowdown - economists had expected growth to slow to +0.4%. Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a poor - but not catastrophic - result, adding: [Annual] Growth of above 2.5 per cent in the second half of 2017 was never going to be sustained for long, and one-off factors such as weather also likely dented consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 spending in Q1. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we get a major healthcheck on the global economy with new growth figures for Britain, the United States, France and Spain. Economists predict they will show a slowdown on both sides of the Atlantic in the first three months of this year, as bad weather and worries over trade wars hit growth. In the UK, quarterly growth is tipped to fall to 0.3%, from 0.4% in October-December. That would be rather weak performance in historical terms., below the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term trend growth rate. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada thinks Britain could have suffered an even sharper slowdown, given the bitter weather that gripped the country this winter. Q1 GDP is out today, but will likely be affected to the severe weather conditions in the quarter. Our economists are in line with consensus (0.3% q/q), but markets would probably be tolerant of a downside miss in particular, given the weather-related uncertainty. US growth is also expected to have slowed, from around 0.7% to 0.5% on a quarterly basis. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says the American growth figures will be closely scrutinised by investors. Economic growth in the first quarter is forecast to have slowed to 2% on an annualised basis, down from 2.9%, as consumers spending braked sharply. This is expected to more of a bump in the road rather than the start of a full on change in direction for the US economy, which remains supported by a tightening labour market and sizeable tax cut. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just learned that French growth rate slowed sharply, to just 0.3% from 0.7% in the previous quarter. That appears to confirm fears that the eurozone is slowing, after a strong 2017 (more in a moment). Also coming up today We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be watching the ongoing tech problems at TSB Bank, as customers still struggle to access their accounts a week after its IT migration. Eurozone finance ministers will be meeting to discuss Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout, which expires this summer. The Bank of England is launching a new educational resource to help young people understand how the economy works. Plus, there could be some credit rating announcements tonight: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 8am BST: Spanish GDP for January-March 2018 9.30am BST: UK GDP for January-March 2018 10am BST: Eurozone economic confidence stats for April 1.30pm BST: US GDP for January-March 2018 3pm: Bank of England launches its econoME educational resource",
