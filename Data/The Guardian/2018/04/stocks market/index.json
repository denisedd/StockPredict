Stock markets fell after Beijing hit back against Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imposition of tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium with a swath of retaliatory duties on 128 imported American products, including pork and apples. The Dow Jones tumbled by more than 730 points, or 3%, to 23,368 as a selloff swept the New York market but recovered to end the day down 459 points, or 1.9%. The wider S&amp;P 500 index was also down 2.3% and the tech-focused Nasdaq shed 2.74%. The losses were also driven by further falls for Amazon and Facebook as the tech companies face greater scrutiny from Washington. Food exporters were among the worst hit, with meat producer Tyson Foods down 4.6% to $69.82 while Hormel, which makes Spam, and Pilgrim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pride took smaller losses. The White House accused China on Monday of distorting global markets and said the country should not target \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fairly traded US exports\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after Beijing increased tariffs on 128 US products in response to US duties on imports of aluminium and steel. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s subsidisation and continued overcapacity is the root cause of the steel crises,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Instead of targeting fairly traded US exports, China needs to stop its unfair trading practices, which are harming US national security and distorting global markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd China announced on Sunday that it would implement retaliatory tariffs of up to 25% on $3bn in food imports from the US, raising the possibility of a trade war between the two countries. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ministry of commerce said it would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153suspending tariff concessions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on 128 US food products. Fresh and dried fruits, almonds, pistachios and wine would be subject to an additional 15% tariff. Eight other items, including frozen pork, would be subject to a 25% tariff. The tariffs would begin on Monday, the ministry said. The tariffs were in line with a list of potential duties on US products released two weeks ago in response to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on steel and aluminium. The US president has also promised to levy 25% on $60bn in annual imports from China. The Beijing ministry said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a large number of people expressed their support\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the measures in order to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153safeguard the interests of the country and its industry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It added that China and the US should resolve issues through negotiation and dialogue. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies, cooperation is the only correct option.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd An editorial in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Global Times newspaper warned that America could \u00e2\u20ac\u0153say goodbye to the delusion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that China would not retaliate against Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on aluminium and steel. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even though China and the US have not publicly said they are in a trade war, the sparks of such a war have already started to fly,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the newspaper said. But analysts say the fact that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs do not cover some of the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest exports to China, such as soybeans, is a sign Beijing wants to avoid an all-out trade war. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The amount subject to tariff is not big, which shows China is willing to ease the intensity of the trade conflict that was started by the US. Trump gave us a heavy shot, and China is giving a light shot back,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Shi Yinhong, director of the US research centre at Renmin University in Beijing. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic czar Liu He spoke to the US treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, last week over the phone. Mnuchin is reportedly considering a trip to China to continue talks. Still, some in China are calling for stronger retaliatory measures on soybeans and other agricultural products as well as big-ticket US goods such as Boeing aircraft. China, the third largest consumer of US pork, bought $1.1bn in pork products from the US last year, according to the US Meat Export Federation. The state-owned Xinhua news on Monday called Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self-defeating gamble.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The editorial, published in English, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The threatening tariffs, if realized, may hurt China. Yet the damage will be done at the expense of enormous American interests.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US senator Elizabeth Warren said on a three-day visit to China that US policy towards China had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153misdirected\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and she was not afraid of tariffs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We told ourselves a happy face story that never fit with the facts. Now US policymakers are starting to look more aggressively at pushing China to open up the markets without demanding a hostage price of access to US technology,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said on Sunday in Beijing. With US-China ties at a low, analysts say the countries are likely to keep struggling over trade. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even if this conflict can be eased, it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last long. There will be rounds after rounds of trade wars in the future,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Shi. Additional reporting by Wang Xueying",

                "bodyText":"And finally, Spotify has closed at $149 per share. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a drop from its opening level of $165.9, but still 13% above the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreference price\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of $132. That values Spotify at around $26.6bn, more than some analysts had suggested before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our tale of the latest tech float: Goodnight! GW A recovery rally on Wall Street has helped the US stock market recover a chunk of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls. The Dow Jones industrial average has closed 1.65% higher, up 389 points at 24,033 - having lost over 450 points yesterday. Traders were encouraged by reports that the White House was not planning action against Amazon. Spotify may have bucked the trend with its direct listing, but its ownership structure is depressingly familiar, says our financial editor Nils Pratley. Its founders are wedded to keeping vice-like control via a share structure with unequal voting rights. For unequal, read unfair: Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzen own 38.9% of the ordinary shares but they have created \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beneficiary certificates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with super-charged voting rights that only they can own. Include those holdings and Ek and Lorentzen have 80.4% of the votes. As the prospectus is obliged to concede: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If our founders act together, they will have control over the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of directors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Put another way, for as long as the duo stick together, they are unsackable. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, says Spotify has a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgreat story\u00e2\u20ac\u2122; even so, people should be cautious when investing. He explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSpotify is floating on the stock market at a pretty inauspicious time for the tech industry, which has been rocked by the Facebook data scandal and now potentially faces greater regulation as a result. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweeted attacks on Amazon don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help lift sentiment towards the sector either. Despite the downbeat mood music, Spotify shares changed hands on the market at a substantial premium to the highest price previously paid in private transactions, indicating significant investor demand for the stock. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still early in the US trading session however. The attraction of the music-streaming service probably lies in Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong market share and rapidly growing revenues. It may be some time before Spotify actually turns a profit though, as the company is resolutely prioritising growth over profit, and will be channelling money into investing in services and building further scale. Unlike its main competitors Apple and Amazon, Spotify is focused on music streaming, so it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t benefit from the network effects of a wider ecosystem. However the company has already carved out a dominant role, and has demonstrated its ability to leverage scale by renegotiating agreements with music labels, boosting its gross margin from 12% to 21% since 2015. The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Danni Hewson is impressed by the streaming service\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening debut: Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alex Webb points out that Spotify is now worth more than some established players (despite having never made a profit!) Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some video of the moment Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares joined the market: Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are bouncing around in early trading, as investors weigh up whether to buy in at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening price. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just slipped below $164, from the opening price of $165.9. Early days, though.... The Wall Street Journal says Spotify has hit the markets with a bang: Spotify Technology roared onto the public market Tuesday as the music-streaming giant pulled off an unusual method of going public. The stock opened at $165.90 and traded in a close range immediately after. With an opening value of $29.55 billion, Spotify is poised to become the third-largest U.S.-listed tech IPO on record, according to Dealogic. That \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunusual method\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 involved spurning the investment banks who would have underwritten the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares (providing a safety net for the market debut), in return for a large fee. AT LAST! Spotify is finally trading, after more than three hours of intense discussions on the Wall Street trading floor. Shares have opened for trading at $165.90, sharply higher than the $132 which had been suggested. That, by my maths, values Spotify at around $29.5bn. I imagine the company should be pretty pleased - this is a sharp jump on the value of its shares earlier this year (when they could only be traded privately between shareholders). On a lighter note, the New York Stock Exchange has confirmed that it accidentally flew a Swiss flag to mark Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing -- which is unfortunate as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually a Swedish company. More here: Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely market valuation is pushing closer to $30bn, as its unconventional \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdirect listing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 continues to play out on the trading floor There are 178.1 million Spotify shares in existence (although the company is only offering around a third to New York investors today). So if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing hits $170, as seems possible, the company could be worth several billion dollars more than forecast. Market makers on Wall Street are continuing to haggle over Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s valuation, pushing its likely share price value even higher: After a edgy day, European stock markets have closed mostly in the red. The escalation of tensions between China and the US over tariffs hit sentiment in the City, and beyond, as traders returned to their desks after the Easter break. Anxiety over the tech sector also weighed on shares, despite the interest in Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing in New York, and Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upbeat statement. The slowdown in eurozone factory growth last month also didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide traders with any fresh optimism. So, the FTSE 100 finished 26 points lower, or 0.4%, at 7,030. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX shed almost 0.7%, but France was calmer and Italy actually rallied a little. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, thinks Europe could be a safe-haven from some of the turbulence in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets. It was a rough start to the second quarter for European equities. Still, next to the losses seen on Wall Street on Monday, the damage in Europe was contained. Europe is out of the firing line for Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs for now and has a lower weighting in technology companies compared to the US. Both factors make Europe a relative haven from the current negative news flow. Higher still and higher.... Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are now seen opening at $150-$160 - indicating that its stock market listing is going well. Wall Street is pushing higher in volatile trading. The Dow is now up 256 points, or 1% -- which would recover around half of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153investors continue to process the latest chess-moves in the nascent trade war between China and the US,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, so this bounce-back might be fragile. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is 0.2% higher, partly thanks to Tesla which is rallying after sticking to its pledge to more than double production of its Model 3 by the end of June. Those early prices suggest that Spotify could be worth around $27bn, I think. Not too shabby, given the company hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t made a profit out of its 157 million customers. Ooooh - Spotify is being priced at between $145 and $155 per share. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than the $132 which had been pencilled in. This delay is because the company decided not to use investment banks to underwrite its offering -- saving it millions of dollars in fees. So, if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing goes smoothly, other companies might consider taking the same track. Donald Trump is refusing to back down in his fight against Amazon, and just fired off a new tweet: Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market listing is underway...but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what price its shares are trading at yet. Wall Street has opened a little higher, as traders hope to recovery from Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. The Dow has gained 0.5% in early trading, up 123 points at 23,767 Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some early reaction to Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new production numbers: Just in: Electric carmaker Tesla has just released its latest eagerly-awaited production figures, which confirm rumours that it has missed some of its own targets. Tesla says it produced 34,494 vehicles in the last three months, 40% more than the final quarter of 2017. This makes January-March \u00e2\u20ac\u0153by far the most productive quarter in Tesla history\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it says. This includes 9,766 Model 3s (Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new model), and 24,728 were Model S and Model X vehicles. Tesla also reveals that it has ramped up production recently -- amid reports that founder Elon Musk has taken personal control of car output in recent days (and even been sleeping at the factory). The company says: In the past seven days, Tesla produced 2,020 Model 3 vehicles. In the next seven days, we expect to produce 2,000 Model S and X vehicles and 2,000 Model 3 vehicles. It is a testament to the ability of the Tesla production team that Model 3 volume now exceeds Model S and Model X combined. What took our team five years for S/X, took only nine months for Model 3. However, Musk had previously aimed to produce 2,500 Tesla 3 cars each week by now. So Tesla hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hit that goal yet. But crucially, it says it still aims to get production of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc3\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 model up to 5,000 per week in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcabout\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 three months. Shares are rallying in pre-market trading - up around 6% Spotify logos have sprung up at Wall Street, ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing: New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market may claw back some of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses when trading resumes in under an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. The Dow Jones index is expected to rise by 0.6%, or around 140 points, judging by the futures markets. That would take a small bite out of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout, when it lost over 450 points (and was down 730 points at one stage). Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA says the markets are still nervous, though: The second quarter got off to a rough start on Monday, with trade war fears and declining tech stocks taking their toll on investor sentiment, but we are seeing a small rebound ahead of the open on Wall Street. US futures are up to half a percentage point higher on Tuesday, but this pales in comparison to the losses recorded on Monday and reflects ongoing weakness in stocks. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attacks on Amazon over the weekend put the spotlight back on the tech sector, as it tries to recover from the Facebook data scandal that threatens more regulation. Pressure on the sector doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to be going away in the near-term which will continue to act as a drag on indices. Traders might need their tin hats this spring... In less than 90 minutes, music streaming site Spotify will join the US stock exchange. You can get up to speed quickly with our explainer, which outlines why the popular service (which has never turned a profit) could be worth up to $25bn - and why today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing could be particularly lively.... Joe Weisenthal of Bloomberg is questioning whether Donald Trump has really hurt Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price (as suggested earlier). He points out that other tech companies have suffered similar falls, even though they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been spared a digital roasting from the president: However, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d suggest that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack on Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax affairs (and its implications for the digital companies) are one of several factors weighing on markets. And sometimes, investors like to have an excuse to sell -- especially if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting jittery. Bad news: another 97 workers at the collapsed UK construction and outsourcing group Carillion have lost their jobs. That take the total redundancies at the company to 1,802, since it was liquidated in January in one of the biggest UK corporate failures in years. Some 9,946 jobs have been saved (because other companies have taken on the contracts they work on). Sky is bucking today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff, after a cunning scheme to help Rupert Murdoch take full control of the broadcaster emerged. Disney has \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexpressed interest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in buying Sky News, a move that might clear the way for Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox company take control of the 61% of Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already own. 21CF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid has been hit by media plurality concerns - given Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong position in UK media (including owning the Times and Sun newspapers). But those worries might abate, if Sky News wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t part of the package. Jolly decent of Disney to offer to help, eh? Not exactly. The US giant has its own motive - namely to take over Fox (including all of Sky) in a $66bn (\u00c2\u00a347bn) deal. That takeover risks being derailed because Comcast recently launched its own takeover offer for Sky. Sky shares have risen to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, up 1.5% at \u00c2\u00a313.15. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s higher than either Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer (\u00c2\u00a312.50) or Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (\u00c2\u00a310.75), suggesting traders expect a higher bid. City firm Liberum expects Fox to strike back: We think the news and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments from Sky point to a revised bid from Fox/Disney to trump Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1250p bid. More here: Two and a half-hours into the new trading quarter, and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is still down. The FTSE 100 is currently 46 points lower or 0.6%, at 7010. Industrial stocks, utilities and telecoms firms are leading the selloff. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital blames the double-whammy of trade tensions following China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs, and the tech selloff in America: On tech\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on the market, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a case of the star performers suffering and this has a big psychological effect on sentiment. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just that they have been behind the bulk of the gains in recent years and therefore exert an outsized effect on indices when they sell off; there is also a kind of network effect on other stocks. On trade, there is hope that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to US sanctions is sufficiently moderate and contained to prevent further escalation. However we await to see where this goes and whatever happens from here, there is no \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the sense that the direction of travel is either one-way or going no further \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we are not about to see a freeing up of global trade (reversal of tariffs), which would be risk-positive. Even if there is no further escalation, the background music is risk-off. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardly unusual for Donald Trump to lash out on Twitter -- as Hillary Clinton, CNN, the FBI, several senators and the Mexican government can all testify. But still, his trenchant criticism of Amazon in recent days has caused a real stir in the markets for several reasons, helping to fuel this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market selloff. Partly, because Trump is taking the side of the old-economy - tweeting that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fully tax paying retailers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are being forced to shut stores because (he claims) Amazon is getting an unfairly good deal. Politifact, a US website, has debunked Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the US Postal Service is losing money thanks to Amazon. It says: Amazon isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t causing the United States Postal Service to lose a fortune. In fact, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contributing to its biggest growth sector, package delivery. Deals like the one with Amazon brought in $7 billion in fiscal year 2017. But still, the US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments suggest that other tech disruptors could also come under fire -- especially if changes are made to the US tax system to help traditional retailers. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the only concern. Some industry figures are concerned that Amazon (whose shares fell 5% yesterday) is being hammered because its founder, Jeff Bezos, also owns the Washington Post. Vanity Fair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gabriel Sherman is reporting that Trump is firmly focused on Bezos, thanks to the Post\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of his presidency: Sherman says: He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s off the hook on this. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s war,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd one source told me. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He gets obsessed with something, and now he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obsessed with Bezos,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said another source. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump is like, how can I fuck with him?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That sort of behaviour will unnerve Wall Street, as investors try to judge where to place their money. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also unusual to see politicians try to settle scores so publicly. Paul Donovan, UBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief global economist, fears that such \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrandom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attacks could undermine faith in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrule of law\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Just in: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing has just posted its slowest quarter growth in a year. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all bad -- growth in March picked up a little, pushing the manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Index up to 55.1 from 55.0 in February. Factory bosses reported that output growth picked up last month, but increases in new orders and employment slowed. Data firm Markit says: The average reading over the opening quarter as a whole (55.1) was the weakest in a year, suggesting that the underlying pace of expansion has been generally slower since the start of 2018. Growth across Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector has hit an eight-month low, as the recent \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceuro boom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 falters. The eurozone manufacturing PMI, which tracks activity across the sector, dropped to 56.6 in March, down from 58.6 in February. This is the third monthly drop in a row, but it still signals solid growth (50 points would show stagnation). Factory bosses reported that output, new orders and new exports grew at a slower rate last month. They also reported problems getting hold of the raw materials and parts they needed, as supply chains struggled to cope. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, is concerned that business confidence also dipped last month. The fact that business optimism about the coming year has slipped to a 15-month low suggests there are other factors that are now hitting factory order books. Export growth has more than halved since late last year, linked in part to the appreciation of the euro, and in some cases demand is being stymied by higher prices. Hopes that the markets might calm down after their volatile start to 2018 have been dashed this morning. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, says investors need to decide whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re heading into a bear market, or just a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrevaluation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of asset prices. The major fear for markets is that the imposition of retaliatory import tariffs by China could just be the tip of the iceberg and will cause a chain reaction that drags more sectors and countries into the dispute. In a world where China is not willing to turn the other cheek and where President Trump likes to get the last word, the situation is set for further turmoil and the danger for investors is that this will escalate into a broader battle, which could leave few sectors immune to trouble. Each of the major tech companies appears to have its own particular set of problems to deal with. Facebook - data security. Intel - Apple chips. Tesla - missed targets compounding fears of excessive leverage. Amazon - President Trump. However, the one thing these companies do have in common is that these stocks are held by most of the big popular global funds. This means that many investors may have substantial exposure, even if they are not direct shareholders, which makes the tech troubles a wider problem. Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff was actually Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst start to an April since 1929 -- a date etched in market memory thanks to the crash later that year. Now, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just one day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading, but its not a great open for the second quarter either... Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff means America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P 500 has now shed 3.4% since the start of the year, while the Dow is down almost 5%. That follows a remarkable 2017, which saw the US stock market surge by around 25%. European markets have fallen down across the board in nervous trading, as traders rush to catch up with events after the Easter break. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says fears of a trade war are refusing to go away: On Monday China announced that it has implemented afforementioned tariffs on 128 types of US goods. Implementing the tariffs makes China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel and aluminium tariffs official. China has to show it is serious. We still expect a settlement in trade negotiations between the two nations. Sentiment will be fragile until the result of trade negotiations become clear. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has fallen sharply at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 shed 54 points, or 0,7%, to 7001 points, as traders take their cue from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide on Wall Street. The US president appears to have unnerved the markets, with his trade war rhetoric and attacks on Amazon. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, explains: The fall in tech stocks and escalating trade tensions continued to rattle markets after the Easter break. This time, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs and tech stocks driving the selloff, and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the U.S. President is doing himself any favors before the midterm elections. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been aggressive, by imposing levies on $3 billion worth of imports from the U.S.; the question now is - what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next? A tariff \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctit for tat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is a lose-lose scenario. So, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely that after this war of nerves, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies will find a middle ground. Markets should get used to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiating style - kicking off with something dramatic, and then scaling down through negotiation. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fresh worries over a global trade war are rippling through the markets today, after China hit back against America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on steel and aluminium by targeting imports of food, wine, steel and even ginseng. The news that Beijing is imposing its own tariffs of up to 25% on more than 120 US products sparked a selloff on Wall Street last night, sending the S&amp;P into correction territory. The Dow plunged by over 700 points at one stage, before ending the day 458 points lower. With Donald Trump expected to announce new curbs on China soon, traders are worried that this tit-for-tat action could escalate. As David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Beijing decided to impose levies on approximately $3 billion worth of goods from the US. In the grand scheme of things, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been too aggressive, but dealers fear we could be starting a long trade war. The ball is now in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in court, and traders are waiting for the US President to make the next move. European markets were closed yesterday for Easter Monday, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting losses of almost 1% on the main indices this morning. Trump has also put the technology sector into a spin, after sending a series of tweets criticising Amazon for avoiding taxes and not paying the US Post Office a fair rate. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price tanked by over 5% on Monday, on concerns that the e-commerce giant is firmly in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s firing line. Music streaming site Spotify will hope to ride out the market choppiness, when it lists its shares on the New York stock exchange for the first time. Spotify has taken the refreshing decision not to employ investment banks to underwrite its listing, so the launch could be more volatile than usual. We also get a new healthcheck on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector: The agenda 9am BST: Eurozone manufacturing PMI survey for March 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI survey for March 2.30pm BST: Spotify joins the US stock market",

The notebook on which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m writing this was designed in California, but probably assembled in China, with many of the components coming from South Korea and Japan. Apple could produce it entirely in North America, and probably would in the face of 30 percent tariffs. But the factories it would take to do that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t (yet) exist.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the factories that do exist were built to serve globalized production \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and many of them would be marginalized, maybe even made worthless, by tariffs that broke up those global value chains. That is, they would become stranded assets. Call it the anti-China shock.</p> <p>Of course, it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just be factories left stranded by a trade war. A lot of people would be stranded too. The point of the famous \u00e2\u20ac\u0153<a href=\"https://www.ddorn.net/papers/Autor-Dorn-Hanson-ChinaShock.pdf\">China shock</a>\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd paper by Autor et al wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that rapid trade growth made America as a whole poorer, it was that rapid changes in the location of production displaced a significant number of workers, creating personal hardship and hurting their communities. The irony is that an anti-China shock would do exactly the same thing. And I, at least, care more about the impact on workers than the impact on capital.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/981529499539050496\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Some thoughts on trade wars and the stock market that doesn&#39;t like them <a href=\"https://t.co/4PoalWlx7a\">https://t.co/4PoalWlx7a</a></p>&mdash; Paul Krugman (@paulkrugman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/981529499539050496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 4, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ac500e8e4b0dec03f4a8aea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-04T17:48:05.801Z\">6.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Analysts at Capital Economics have warned that President Donald Trump could raise the stakes further, possibly by labelling China a currency manipulator later this month.</strong></p> <p>In a note to clients, they say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The next flashpoint may be the US Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s semi-annual currency report, due out this month.

                "bodyText":"Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report on Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise rebound: Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three major indexes staged a comeback to close around 1 percent higher on Wednesday as investors turned their focus to earnings and away from a trade conflict between the United States and China that wreaked havoc in earlier trading. After investors fled equities in the morning due to proposed retaliatory tariffs from China, their concerns about a potential trade war eased by the afternoon after Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the administration was in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negotiation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with China rather than a trade war. Investors said they were comforted by the fact that any tariffs would not take effect immediately, if at all. Strategists also cited the S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bounce above a key technical support level and said they expect equities to rise further around the first quarter earnings season, due to start in mid-April. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re starting to feel that while markets hate uncertainty, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bark is worse than his bite when it comes to trade,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas. In a surprise twist, shares have surged back in New York. The Dow has closed up 230 points, bouncing back from its early slump. Why? Well, markets are mysterious and sometimes random things, but Larry Kudlow can take some credit after his efforts telling investors not to panic. Paul Krugman, the Nobel-prize wining economist (and trade expert) has written an article for the New York Times, outlining why a trade war would be highly disruptive. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Since about 1990 corporate America has bet heavily on hyperglobalization \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on the continuance of an open-market regime that has encouraged complex value chains that sprawl across borders. The notebook on which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m writing this was designed in California, but probably assembled in China, with many of the components coming from South Korea and Japan. Apple could produce it entirely in North America, and probably would in the face of 30 percent tariffs. But the factories it would take to do that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t (yet) exist. Meanwhile, the factories that do exist were built to serve globalized production \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and many of them would be marginalized, maybe even made worthless, by tariffs that broke up those global value chains. That is, they would become stranded assets. Call it the anti-China shock. Of course, it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just be factories left stranded by a trade war. A lot of people would be stranded too. The point of the famous \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China shock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd paper by Autor et al wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that rapid trade growth made America as a whole poorer, it was that rapid changes in the location of production displaced a significant number of workers, creating personal hardship and hurting their communities. The irony is that an anti-China shock would do exactly the same thing. And I, at least, care more about the impact on workers than the impact on capital. Analysts at Capital Economics have warned that President Donald Trump could raise the stakes further, possibly by labelling China a currency manipulator later this month. In a note to clients, they say: The next flashpoint may be the US Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s semi-annual currency report, due out this month. As a candidate, Trump promised to label China a currency manipulator \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on day one\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but so far has resisted. In and of itself, that would not trigger any action, but it would be a signal that the trade spat is escalating. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story on the US/China trade spat, for anyone just tuning in: China has raised the stakes in the escalating trade showdown with the United States by unveiling tariffs on a wide-ranging list of American imports in response to levies on Chinese goods put forward by Donald Trump. Beijing will impose additional tariffs of 25% on 106 American products from 14 separate categories, including soybean, cars and chemical products, covering imports to China worth up to $50bn (\u00c2\u00a336bn), Chinese state news agencies said on Wednesday. The measures come after the US announced details of new 25% tariffs on $50bn worth of imports from China drawn up by the Trump administration. The list of more than 1,300 products targets China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial base, covering everything from industrial robots and electronics to metal alloys and aircraft parts. Washington said the levies were in response to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unfair trade practices related to the forced transfer of US technology and intellectual property,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd adding that the list of products had been designed to target China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial plans while minimising the impact on the US economy. The array of Chinese products that would be affected is lengthy and varied, covering everything from aircraft jets and tyres, to uranium and nuclear reactor parts, poultry incubators, haymaking machines and guns and ammunition. Technology products are also hit, including TV cameras, jukeboxes and cassette players. The proposed list will undergo a public review process before trade officials ultimately decide which products should be hit by tariffs. The Chinese state news agency Xinhua said the country would only implement its tariffs on American goods once the US government imposed levies on imports from China. Some types of aircraft, lubricants, tobacco and orange juice are on the list of products targeted by Beijing, along with some trucks and SUVs. The inclusion of agricultural and food and drink products such as soybeans, whisky, beef, corn and wheat is likely to raise eyebrows for targeting southern American states where Trump drew much of his support while running for the presidency. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also pulled together a full list of the products which could be landed with new tariffs: Wall Street is looking calmer now, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back with any major developments.... Other countries could benefit if China hits US exporters with new tariffs. As Dutch financial group bank Rabobank puts it: There aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough soybeans in the world to meet China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demands without US supplies. They suspect that farmers in Australia and Brazil might benefit, at the expense of US farmers, if American agricultural products become uncompetitively priced in China. European stock markets have closed for the night, with trade jitters weighing on shares. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the biggest companies across Europe, has lost 0.5% today, with losses in Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market did a little better, though, with the FTSE 100 finishing 3 points higher (up a meagre 0.05%). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a transcript of Larry Kudlow, the US National Economic Council Director, telling Fox Business why a trade war won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t break out between the US and China. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Absolutely not. Absolutely not. And let me just say right at the top, number one, blame China, not President Trump. Because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been going on for many years. Trump is really the first president to fight back and to put a shot across the bow, stealing intellectual property rights, technology transfers, high barriers, investment limitations, high tariffs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this stuff really is not just unfair, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlawful. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outside the boundaries of the WTO. Every country in the world knows this. Every analyst knows this is the case. Somebody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got to deal with it. President Trump is going to deal with it. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no trade war here. What you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got is the early stages of a process which will include tariffs, comments on the tariffs, then ultimate decisions and negotiations. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already backchannel talks going on. So look, I understand the stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anxiety. I get that. But on the other hand, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over react. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see how this works out. My view Stu, look, you know I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a growth guy, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a Reagan supply side growth guy. I think that at the end of this whole process, that at the end of the rainbow, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pot of gold. And if you open up that pot, you will see better economic growth, more trading going on, improved wages for both sides. Anytime you lower barriers, anytime you lower barriers, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key, the president will say this, lower barriers is the key, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raise the barriers. Anytime you do that, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for growth. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for American growth and American workers, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for the rest of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a volatile morning on the New York stock exchange, as traders saw shares slide sharply at the open before recovering some ground... Jonathan Butcher, principal economist at consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie, reckons a full-blown trade clash between America and China would hurt global growth badly. He says the mere risk of trade disputes will make people reluctant to spend, and discourage firms from investing in new equipment and factories. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The risk of a trade war developing is a threat to the global economy. We are currently enjoying a period of robust global growth, but sentiment plays a big part in maintaining economic momentum. The threat of a trade war could dampen sentiment, slowing consumer spending and business investment. Should a trade war escalate between the US and China, Wood Mackenzie estimates that global economic growth could slow from 2.9% to 2.2% over the next 4 years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wall Street is clawing its way back from its early slump. The Dow is still in the red, but only by 150 points (-0.6%) while the Nasdaq is only 0.5% lower lower. Traders may be heeding the soothing words of economics advisor Larry Kudlow, and reassessing the risks of a trade war. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also received some decent economic news today. US companies created 241,000 private sector jobs last month, more than expected. That indicates the labor market is still strong, and could mean a strong Non-Farm Payroll jobs report on Friday. Commodity prices are still suffering, though; the soybean future contract is down almost 3%. Larry Kudlow, the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new top economic advisor, has embarked on a mission to calm the markets. Speaking to reporters on the White House driveway, Kudlow insisted that America wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t about to lose a trade war with China. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it that way. This is a negotiation, using all the tools\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kudlow has also popped up on Fox Business, to tell the markets not to panic. He claims that the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal is to get rid of trade barriers, and create a genuine level-playing field of free and fair trade. As Kudlow puts it: I think that at the end of this whole process, the end of the rainbow, there is a pot of gold. If you open up that pot, you will see better economic growth, more trading going on, improved wages for both sides. Any time you lower barriers....it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for growth. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for American growth and American workers. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for the rest of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth. The US president has tweeted again: $500bn is a nice round number, but officially the US only ran a trade in goods deficit of $375.2bn with China last year. Any farmer planning to sell his soybean crop may not agree either...... Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff means the Dow is now 11% off its record high, leaving it in correction territory. That record high, of 26,616 points, was set on Friday 26th January - the day Donald Trump addressed the World Economic Forum, and boasted that the US stock market was up 50% since he won the election. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never been higher since.... This is turning into a broad-based rout. Each of the 30 blue-chip companies which makes up the Dow has fallen into the red. Chemicals maker DowDuPont has lost 2.8%, Intel has lost 2.5%, General Electric and Goldman Sachs is down 2%. Every sector of the S&amp;P 500 has also fallen. Boeing is also being hit hard. Its shares are down over 4% in early trading. Bloomberg explains why China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new 25% tariffs could be bad news for the airline maker: In a tit-for-tat response to tariffs from Trump, China announced the planned levy on aircraft weighing between 15,000 kilograms (33,000 pounds) and 45,000 kilograms, which would include some variants of Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 737 family of passenger jets. Single-aisle jets, dominated by the 737 and Airbus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s A320 family, both with sticker prices of about $100 million, are likely to account for three quarters of the global market over the next two decades, according to Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s estimates. Shares in automobile manufacturers are falling in New York, following the news that China is proposing a 25% tariff on imports of some US cars. Fiat Chrysler is down 2.6%, electric carmaker Tesla has lost 3.7%, and Ford has dipped by 1.5%. The opening bell of the New York stock market is ringing, and shares are taking a bath. The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen by 480 points at the start of trading, as 2% was swiftly wiped off the benchmark index. The S&amp;P 500 index (which includes more companies than the Dow) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index are also sliding, as investors express their anxiety over the tit-for-tat trade clashes between China and the US. Details to follow.... Just time for a quick peek at the European markets...and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all in the red, as trade war fears bite. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says investors have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply disturbed by the speed and extent of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs. Tin hats on... Traders in New York are getting ready for a rough open to the trading session, in just over 10 minutes. The Dow Jones is currently on track to fall by almost 550 points, according to the futures markets, as Wall Street gives its verdict on the latest US-China tariffs. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says trade war fears are gripping the financial markets today. Investors are diving out of shares, and putting money into safe-haven assets like gold, he says: Dow futures have collapsed 500 points and other global indices were sharply lower at the time of writing after China retaliated overnight to a slate of trade measures launched by the US government hours earlier aimed at narrowing China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vast trade surplus with America. China said it will apply tariffs on 106 US-produced goods, ranging from aeroplanes to soya beans. While the escalation of trade wars have weighed heavily on commodity prices such as corn, soya beans, crude oil and copper, gold on the other hand has been able to climb higher thanks to its safe haven status. Gold is up 1% today, at $1,325 per ounce. Jared Bernstein, former economic advisor to vice-president Joe Biden, argues that America and China might not actually impose these tariffs for months, or indeed ever: Economist George Magnus, of Oxford University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s China Centre, believes these new tariffs are only a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfoothill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the history of trade wars. But the situation could become a lot worse, he told Bloomberg TV, if the two sides announce further tariffs. Potentially, almost all US exports to China could face new tariffs, which would hurt both country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economies. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweeted about this fear: Guy Foster, head of research at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, points out there is time for America and China to step back from their new tariffs: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The important thing to note about the current spat between China and the US is that the US has built a timescale for negotiation into their plans. Seven weeks of consultation with the public will follow before US tariffs bite. The Chinese announcement today was to make sure agricultural and aeronautic businesses and workers have the longest time possible to lobby for a climbdown from this confrontation while they engage to find mutually beneficial ways of reducing the bilateral trade deficit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. With an hour to go until the open, the Dow is expected to fall by around 2% - a fairly chunky decline. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details of the Wilbur Ross interview: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs \u00e2\u20ac\u0153amount to about three-tenths of a percent of our GDP. So, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardly a life-threatening activity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ross said in an interview with CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Squawk Box.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relatively proportionate to the tariffs we put on based on the intellectual property.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wilbur Ross, the US Commerce secretary, says we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised that China has hit back today. He told CNBC it would have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremely embarrassing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Beijing if it hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t retaliated, and that markets shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too alarmed. Ross said: They are very good at arithmetic. They know we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about fractions of 1% of the respective economies. So, this is not World War 3. America is waking up to the news that China and the US have taken another step closer to a trade war that could hurt the global economy badly. A few hours ago, China announced plans to impose 25% tariffs on a swathe of US goods, worth $50bn last year. The list includes soybeans, cars and aircraft -- three key export areas. Beef, cigars and whiskey are all on the list too. Economists say the tariffs are tougher than expected. They would hit American exporters, such as farmers, hard, as Beijing puts the US agricultural sector in the firing line. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy finance minister has insisted that China doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a trade war, as it would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclose-lose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 situation. But Beijing has also made it clear that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back down. As its eEmbassy in Washington, put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As the Chinese saying goes, it is only polite to reciprocate. The retaliation came hours after America announced tariffs on over 1,300 Chinese products. The wide-ranging list covered machinery, electronics - even uranium and flamethrowers. The office of the US trade representative said the measures would target products that benefitted from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theft of US intellectual property. President Trump has responded to Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move - he tweeted that America lost its trade war with China many years ago, so must take new measures to close its trade deficit. Angel Gurria, Secretary General of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, has called the latest developments \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery worrysome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He told an audience in London: You are talking about the number one and number two traders in the world,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not good for anyone, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lose-lose situation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US Soybean Export Council has said it \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcregrets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision, warning that companies in the US and China will both suffer. Financial markets have reacted badly, with the price of soybeans tumbling by 5%. European stock markets have fallen into the red, and Wall Street is bracing for a sharp selloff in 90 minutes time. In the futures market, aircraft-maker Boeing are down 4%, and machinery giant Caterpillar has lost 3.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average is expected to fall by over 500 points, or around 2%. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, says investors fear that relations between Washington and Beijing could deteriorate further: Despite hopes of success in negotiations between the US and China last week, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation from China is likely to cement fears amongst analysts of a trade war. The tariffs represent the U.S.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful challenge in decades to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic practices, with 25% tariffs unless Beijing makes major trade and investment concessions. China has announced retaliatory measures today, with 25% tariffs on US goods, leading the markets in Europe to slump this morning. The uncertainty in the markets over the heightening trade tensions also weighed on the oil markets. Traders will be bracing themselves for further volatility in the coming days.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: President Trump has declared that America has already lost the trade war with China: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a change of position from Trump. Last month, he tweeted that trade wars were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood, and easy to win\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - for a country in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position. Christopher Balding, associate professor of business and economics at the HSBC Business School in Shenzhen, reckons China has a clear warning to America -- back down over trade, or else: Last year, the US-China Business Council issued a report explaining why exports to China were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vital to US economic growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They pointed out that China is America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-largest goods export market (behind Canada and Mexico), while service exports swelled over 400% between 2006 and 2015. The report argued that trade with China supports a lot of US jobs: US goods exports to China come from a wide range of industries including transportation equipment, agriculture, computers and electronics, and chemicals. These exports also sustain logistics jobs in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ports and throughout the country. US services exports to China included travel and education, royalties, transportation, business and professional services, and financial services. The Council also explains how States across America have a stake - and could thus suffer from a trade war: Most states have seen significant increases in exports of goods and services to China since 2006. Thirty states experienced at least triple-digit goods export growth to China since 2006, and four states saw growth of more than 500 percent over the same period: Alabama, Montana, North Dakota, and South Carolina. Every US state had triple-digit services export growth to China since 2006, 16 states had export growth of more than 400 percent. China is among the top five goods and services export markets for most states. China was a top three goods export market for 39 states in 2016, and among the top five for another eight states. That includes states that are not usually associated with strong China trade ties, including Alabama, Arizona, Minnesota, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, South Carolina, and Tennessee Wendy Chen, an economist at Nomura, has told my colleague Lily Kuo that America and China can still avoid a trade war: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think there is still room for negotiation between the two economies, although the risk of a full-blown trade war is rising,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that the Chinese government isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t messing about with its new tariffs. By including aircraft, soybeans and cars, Beijing is targeting the three largest exports from America to China last year (according to the US Census Bureau). China has released a list of the 106 US products which will incur a new 25% tariff (unless Donald Trump backs down and abandons America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed tariffs on Chinese goods). The list includes: Yellow soybeans black soybeans other corn corn flour uncombed cotton durum wheat fresh and cold beef (whole head or half) fresh and cold beef with bones frozen boneless beef unstemmed tobacco tobacco cigars tobacco cigarettes cigar and cigarettes with tobacco substitute hookah materials frozen orange juice whiskey various types of cars and trucks aircrafts of more than 15000kg but less than 45000 kg weight Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full list China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy commerce minister, Wang Shouwen, has blamed the US government for triggering the latest tit-for-tat tariffs. Shouwen told reporters in Beijing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It must be said, we have been forced into taking this action. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our action is restrained.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wang was speaking alongside deputy finance minister Zhu Guangyao, as he insisted that China didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a trade war. The future market is now indicating that the Dow Jones industrial average will tumble by 600 points, or more than 2%. Such a sharp selloff would confirm that Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation is firmer than many investors expected (or hoped). Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics, says the strength and scale of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation is somewhat unexpected: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The assumption was China would not respond too aggressively and avoid escalating tensions. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response is a surprise for some people. Evans-Pritchard adds that the two sides could still avert a trade war: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more of a game of brinkmanship, making it clear what the cost would be, in the hopes that both sides can come to agreement and none of these tariffs will come into force.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that China hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t said when these new tariffs on $50bn of US imports will come into effect. The Ministry of Finance says it depends when the $50bn of tariffs outlined by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration last night are implemented. So, unless both sides back down, there will soon be 25% tariffs on $100bn of trade between the two countries: Shares in major American industry giants are expected to take a tumble when Wall Street opens at 2.30pm BST: The soybean selloff is deepening, as traders anticipate weaker demand for this crucial product. Corn and wheat are also being hit by worries of a trade war between China and the US: Back in Beijing, deputy finance minister Zhu Guangyao says China will not give in to pressure for America over intellectual property rights. Reuters has more details: External pressure will instead promote China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s development and innovation, Zhu told reporters in Beijing. Friction is hard to avoid in fast-growing China-U.S. trade, and huge challenges face the two sides, but Zhu said he still hoped relations could return to a healthy track, since a trade war could hurt all sides. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation is more forceful than the financial markets had expected, says Gao Qi, Singapore-based strategist at Scotiabank. That explains why shares fell immediately in Europe, with Wall Street on track for losses too. He told Bloomberg: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response was tougher than what the market was expecting -- investors didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t foresee the country levying additional tariffs on sensitive and important products such as soybeans and airplanes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors believe a trade war will hurt both countries and their economies eventually.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to slap a 25% tariff on soybean imports from America looks like a real shot over the bows of the Trump administration. Soybeans are a crucial part of the global food chain, used as a source of oil and also to feed livestock such as pigs and chicken. The World Wildlife Fund calls it the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcking of beans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, saying: It contains 38% protein \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 2x as much as pork, 3x more than eggs, and 12x more than milk. Also the protein in soybean has a more complete range of essential amino acids than most other foods. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also used in vegetarian food products like tofu (which comes from soy milk). China is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest import of soybeans; American farms sold around $14bn of soybeans to China companies last year. So farmers in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agricultural belt - which is typically Republican-supporting - may have deep concerns about the tit-for-tat tariffs. NBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Janis Mackey Frayer says China had this in mind when it drew up today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs... Soybean tariffs could also hurt Chinese farmers - pushing up their import prices and making pork more expensive. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign ministry has urged the US to abandon its plan to impose tariffs on 1,300 Chinese products. At a daily press briefing, the ministry said the two countries should resolve trade differences through dialogue. Geng Shuang, a foreign ministry spokesperson, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those who attempt to make China surrender through pressure or intimidation have never succeeded before, and will not succeed now. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy finance minister, Zhu Guangyao, is holding a press conference now. Zhu tells reporters in Beijing that the Chinese government doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a trade war -- despite having just announced retaliatory tariffs on $50bn of American goods. A trade war would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclose-lose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for China and America, he says. Co-operation is the only right choice for both countries, Zhu insists. He says China wants to resolve the issues with America in a constructive way. Analyst John Kemp fears that Beijing and Washington won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to stop the situation escalating into a full-blown trade war: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs are aimed firmly at America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agricultural industry, says John Ross, senior fellow at Renmin University of China: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s swift retaliation against the US has hit the financial markets. The Chinese yuan has fallen 0.4% against the US dollar, its biggest fall in two weeks, according to Reuters data. European stock markets have also slumped into the red; Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is down 0.5%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has shed 1.4%. US stock market is expected to fall sharply when trading begins in around five hours. The Dow is down 1.3% in the futures market. The Chinese finance ministry has released more details of the new 25% tariffs which it will impose on US imports, in retaliation to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs on its exports. It confirms that the reciprocal measures cover 106 different US products. The list includes soybeans, chemicals, whisky, cigars, some types of beef, corn and wheat. Some types of aircraft, lubricants, tobacco and orange juice are also targeted, along with some trucks and SUVs. Crucially, these imports were worth $50bn in 2017 -- that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same value as the 1,300 Chinese goods which America is targetting with its new tariffs. Newsflash: China has just announced a fresh wave of tariffs on American goods, in retaliation to the US tariffs released last night. Chinese state TV is reporting that 106 US products are affected, including a 25% tariff on soybeans, automomobiles and chemicals. In total, the goods affected are worth $50bn per year. So, Beijing hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wasted any time in delivering on its pledge to hit back against the new proposed US tariffs on 1,300 of its products. Many US farmers rely on sales of soybeans to China, so this could have a significant impact on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agriculture sector. The soybean price has taken an immediate hit. The array of Chinese products that would be affected by America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new 25% tariffs is lengthy, and varied. It includes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153compounds of depleted uranium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, nuclear reactor parts, a wide range of vaccines and medical products, aircraft tyres, stainless steel and aluminium in various sizes, and aircraft jets and tyres, domestic and commercial dishwashers, storage water heaters, and sewing machines. On the agricultural side, poultry incubators, haymaking machines and milking devices are all hit -- suggesting US farmers could suffer from these tariffs. Cranes, snowploughs and locomotive parts are all on the list too. Technology products are also hit, including TV cameras, a range of televisions, and even fuses. Even weapons are covered - including rocket launchers, flame-throwers, rifles, shotguns, pistols and military weapons. The US will now hold a consultation on whether to impose these tariffs. The full list is online here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of a trade war between China and America are swirling this morning as both sides ratchet up the pressure. Last night, the US government announced details of new 25% tariffs on $50bn worth of imports from China. The list of over 1,300 products targets China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial base, covering everything from industrial robots and electronics to metal alloys and aircraft parts. America claims these new 25% tariffs is prompted by Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-running \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcintellectual property theft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of valuable technology and ideas developed by US companies. It says: The proposed list of products is based on extensive interagency economic analysis and would target products that benefit from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial plans while minimizing the impact on the US economy. The move comes two days after China hit back against America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on steel and aluminium by imposing new trade hurdles on 120 US products - including fresh food and steel. And there are already signs that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest move could trigger fresh retaliations. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambassador to the World Trade Organisation, Zhang Xiangchen, has declared this morning that his country will retaliate \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immediately\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, claiming that the Trump administration is breaking WTO rules. In a punchy statement, Zhang says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The findings of the U.S. Section 301 investigation are a willful distortion of facts and full of selective assertions and allegations, turning a blind eye to the actual progress that China has achieved in the market-oriented reforms, further opening-up and enhanced intellectual property protection.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Chinese Embassy in Washington was also quick to condemn this latest move - saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As the Chinese saying goes, it is only polite to reciprocate. The Chinese side will resort to the WTO dispute settlement mechanism and take corresponding measures of equal scale and strength against US products in accordance with Chinese law.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That raises the danger that China imposes its own tariffs on a wider range of US goods, taking the global economy a little bit closer to protectionism. Also coming up today: We get a new healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building sector this morning, which may show the impact of last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wintery weather. Plus, new jobs data from the Eurozone and America. Markets are expected to be subdued, given the trade tensions swirling around: Advertising giant WPP is also in the spotlight, after launching an investigation into an allegation of personal misconduct against its chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell. He denies the allegations \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unreservedly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but investors may be concerned.

                "bodyText":"The US private equity firm Carlyle Group has agreed to buy the Australian wine producer behind the Hardys and Echo Falls labels for A$1bn (\u00c2\u00a3547m) as it hopes to capitalise on China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing thirst for wine. Accolade is the biggest wine company by volume in both Australia and the UK, and the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brands also include Banrock Station and Kumala. Carlyle said it was keen to tap into Accolade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth opportunities in Asia. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a company with great brands and strong market positions, with multiple growth opportunities, particularly in Asian markets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carlyle said. The sale of Accolade by its owners, the Australian private equity firm Champ, comes at a time of rapid growth in demand for wine by China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s swelling middle classes. Sales of Australian wines to China have been bolstered by a free-trade agreement struck between the two countries that came into force in 2015 in which China cut import tariffs on Australian wine from up to 20% to about 3%. In 2017, Australian wine exports to mainland China jumped 63% to a record A$848m, putting Australia just behind France in sales of wine to the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy. Australian winemakers also stand to benefit from Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to raise tariffs on US wine imports in retaliation to higher import tariffs imposed by Donald Trump on a range of Chinese products. China is the biggest export market for Australian wine, ahead of the US and the UK.

Carlyle is making a big bet on Accolade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential, having agreed to pay triple the A$290m Champ paid for an 80% stake in the company in 2011. Constellation Brands, a beer, wine and spirits company, is also selling its 20% stake to Carlyle. Last year Champ abandoned plans to publicly list Accolade, citing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave the European Union as one of the reasons behind the decision. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no doubt that the United Kingdom is a changing landscape and we are adjusting to that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Haddock said at the time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fall in the pound makes it much harder for exporters selling into the UK, who must sacrifice margins to stay competitive on the shelves of supermarket retailers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Accolade has a bottling facility in Bristol, where more than 500 people are employed and more than 600,000 bottles are filled every day. It is the largest wine warehouse and distribution centre in Europe, according to the company.",

As a nation, we cannot isolate ourselves any more than we can stem the ocean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tide. The international system provides agreed-upon rules of the road \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and mechanisms for enforcing them. It serves as the basis upon which we can insist on fairer trade practices from competitors and adequate burden-sharing from allies. It is the means by which we can continue to improve people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lives and livelihoods.</p> <p>The system, built at great sacrifice, continues to serve our interests. It should be preserved and defended \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ideally under strong U.S. leadership.</p> </blockquote> <p>[President Trump, of course, has criticised fellow NATO members for not spending enough on defence]</p> <p><strong>And on trade, Dimon writes that US does have some legitimate issues with China.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>China has realized significant economic and employment gains since joining the WTO in 2001. China was expected to continue on an aggressive path of opening up its economy, but this has happened at a much slower pace than most nations expected.</p> <p>Now, more than 16 years later, it has the second-largest economy in the world and is home to 20% of the Fortune 500 companies, yet it still considers itself a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153developing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd nation that should not be subject to the same WTO standards as the United States and other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153developed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd countries.</p> </blockquote> <p>However, simply imposing new tariffs on its goods in a unilateral fashion is not the answer. Instead, Dimon proposes a five-point plan:<br></p> <ul> <li>The United States should define very clearly, and in detail, what it wants from China.<br></li> <li> The United States should lay out a distinct timeline \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and determine what the reaction would be if it is not met. <br></li> <li>The United States should listen closely to China about any legitimate complaints it may have. <br></li> <li>This should be done in partnership with our largest allies, particularly Japan and Europe. <br></li> <li>The United States should revisit the Trans-Pacific Partnership and fix the parts considered unfair.

                "bodyText":"And finally.... the closing bell of Wall Street has just been rung, ending a positive day on the markets. The Dow was up 1% at the close, up 242 point, meaning it has posted a three-day winning streak. That follows a strong session on the other side of the Atlantic: Commodity prices have also recovered some ground; soybeans are up 1.5% today while corn gained 2.3%. That may show that the soothing words from US officials, such as Larry Kudlow, is working. Or we might be reading too much into it! Pinning a narrative on the market action is tempting, but not always accurate.... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow to track whether the recovery continues, or stumbles. Goodnight! GW Not so fast, markets! The Financial Times is reporting that China could launch a legal challenge to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed tariffs, at the World Trade Organisation. The FT says: Beijing signalled it was willing to escalate its fight with Donald Trump over his plan for anti-China tariffs on Thursday by launching a legal challenge against Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newly proposed duties on more than 1,300 Chinese products. The Chinese move to open a World Trade Organization case came despite efforts by White House officials to ease fears of a looming trade war and is likely to feed doubts over the ability of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies to reach an amicable settlement. Beijing said the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed tariffs, unveiled earlier this week, represented a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious violation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of global trading rules because they discriminated against Chinese goods and violated the tariff limits Washington had made commitments to.... Investors don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem too alarmed, though; the Dow is up almost 1% still, with the S&amp;P 500 0.6% higher in late trading. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a taste of the New York stock exchange today, as traders rode the market higher: With 90 minutes trading to go, the Dow is up 0.7% - or 173 points - on Wall Street. Larry Kudlow has certainly hit the ground running, since joining the White House as National Economic Council Director. During his tour of media outlets, the former Reagan adviser even told Fox that US growth could hit the heady heights of 5%. CNBC has the details: Asked whether the economy could post 5 percent annual GDP as it recovers from the financial recession, Kudlow said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we could.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Will we get 5 percent forever? No. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a catch up here,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kudlow told Fox Business Network. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any economist will show you the long-term trend line for GDP versus the actual now: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re like several trillion dollars below where we should be based on the long-term trend lines. I want to get back to that full potential.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Frankly, that seems awfully ambitious. And if the US economy did rattle along at such a heady pace, the Federal Reserve would surely raise interest rates promptly for fear of inflation surging. Time will tell.... The New York stock market is extending its gains. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 1% today at 24,495, a gain of 231 points. Quite a recovery from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariff-fuelled panic: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally was the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best day since the aftermath of the EU referendum, says Marketwatch: U.K. stocks on Thursday logged the best one-session gain in nearly two years as investors grew hopeful that negotiations would lead the U.S. and China to de-escalate brewing trade tensions. The FTSE 100 index rose 2.4% to 7,199.50, marking its best daily advance since June 29, 2016, a rally that occurred in the aftermath of the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the European Union, known as Brexit. Here are the details of how the European markets surged to a three-week high tonight: UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100: up 165 points at 7,199.50, a gain of 2.35% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: up 347 points at 12,305, a gain of 29% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC 40: up 134 points at 5,276.6, a gain of 2.6% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: up 526 points at 22,969, a gain of 2.35% Fiona Cincotta of City Index says a relief rally swept the markets today: Markets across the globe continued to bounce back as optimism increases that the US and China are willing to work towards avoiding an all-out trade war. The FTSE was led 169 point higher by tech stocks and the heavyweight commodity sector; the miners gaining support from higher metal prices, on hopes that China, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest consumer of metals won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be entering a trade war with the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. Boom! European market stock have roared back today, as traders wager that trade war fears have been overblown. In London the FTSE gained over 2%, boosting its value by some \u00c2\u00a342bn. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says buyers came back with a vengeance on Thursday. It was a complete one-eighty from Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout. The bounce-back attributed to White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow easing trade war fears has gained some traction. The DAX index hit a 2-week high while the FTSE 100 reached its highest in 3-weeks. In this volatile environment, there is still scope to blind-sided again by the next official comment or Tweet about US-China trade negotiations. Markets, eh? Shares in major US exporters are rallying today, as Larry Kudlow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments help to reassure investors. The Dow is now up 200 points, or 0.8%. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 1.8%, or 120-odd points. Just in: Larry Kudlow, the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economic advisor, has played down the risks of a trade war. Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Kudlow argues that the spat with China could have a happy ending - if it forces Beijing to play fairly. Ding Ding! Shares are rising on the New York stock market, on hopes that a trade war between the US and China can be avoided. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 165 points, or 0.7%, to 24428. That extends yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late rally. The US president has found some time in his busy schedule to correct the Washington Post\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headlines: Sports fans keen to watch the Winter Olympics helped to drive America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit to a nine-year high. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reports that service imports rose by $1.1bn in February, to $47.8bn. That includes a $1.0bn increase in charges for the use of intellectual property, which \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reflects payments for the rights to broadcast the 2018 Winter Olympic Games\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That payment was made by NBC, which splashed out up $963 million for the rights to air the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear that the money was well-spent. Viewing figures were 7% lower than for Sochi in 2014, making the 2018 Winter Olympics the least-watched on record. Newsflash: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade gap has widened to its highest level in almost a decade. The difference between US imports and exports hit $57.6bn in February, the biggest gap since October 2008, up from $56.7bn in January. Exports rose by 1.7% to $204.4bn, but imports also increased by 1.7% to $262.0bn. That means Donald Trump hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, yet, made any progress in reducing America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit with the rest of the world. The trade gap with China did narrow -- possibly due to the impact of the lunar New Year? -- but the deficit with Mexico widened. Reuters has more details: The deficit has now risen for six straight months. The goods trade deficit was the highest since July 2008 and the surplus on services was the lowest since December 2012. Part of the rise in the trade deficit in February reflected commodity price increases. The politically sensitive goods trade deficit with China fell 18.6% to $29.3 billion. The deficit with Mexico surged 46.6% in February. The president may not be best pleased.... The number of new vans bought in the UK fell by 5.6% in March. The SMMT has reported that UK new van registrations dropped to 59,764 last month, from 63,316 a year ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a smaller decline than for cars, but it could also be a sign of economic uncertainty - and that March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad weather curbed spending. They add: Uplift in demand for smaller vans (1.8%) and pickups (6.8%) fails to offset declines for medium (-2.0%) and heavier (-10.5%) models. More than 94,000 new van registrations in Q1 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c dropping -3.7% compared to the same period in 2017. SMMT CEO Mike Hawes says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A decline in the important plate change month of March is a concern and we need the right economic conditions to restore market stability and encourage buyers to invest in new commercial vehicles. The new van market is a key barometer of business confidence and while uncertainty remains, a degree of fluctuation in demand is to be expected this year. The SMMT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rolling tally of van sales suggests demand has been cooling since the EU referendum: Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada suspect that UK economy growth could have halved in the last quarter. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve crunched through today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector PMI report, as well as the manufacturing and construction reports earlier this week. The upshot - growth in the first three months of 2018 won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t match the 0.4% recorded in October-December 2017. Sam Hill of RBC explains: The UK IHS Markit / CIPS Composite PMI dropped to 52.5 in March, a full two points lower than the previous month, on account of a large drop in the service sector survey. Whilst the manufacturing sector survey didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t contain too much evidence of weather-related disruption to activity, widespread snow early in March did appear to account for a good deal of the weakness in the construction and service sectors. The result is that our PMI-based GDP indicator now suggests Q1 GDP growth will be just 0.2% q/q, rather than 0.3% q/q previously. Given the margin for error in the indicator, and the relatively brief period of weather-related disruption we maintain our forecast of 0.3% q/q for Q1 GDP for the time being. Newsflash: Another sign that China and the US could avoid a trade war: Jamie Dimon, the head of JP Morgan, has warned American politicians not to drive the world economy into a new protectionist era. In his annual letter to shareholder, Dimon gives a clear signal to Donald Trump not to undermine international institutions including NATO and the World Trade Organisations. Such groups, Dimon points out, underpin the world order and allows democratic principles such as free speech and equality to spread. As he puts it: Reversing the interconnectedness built by our post-World War II institutions is neither desirable nor feasible. As a nation, we cannot isolate ourselves any more than we can stem the ocean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tide. The international system provides agreed-upon rules of the road \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and mechanisms for enforcing them. It serves as the basis upon which we can insist on fairer trade practices from competitors and adequate burden-sharing from allies. It is the means by which we can continue to improve people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lives and livelihoods. The system, built at great sacrifice, continues to serve our interests. It should be preserved and defended \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ideally under strong U.S. leadership. [President Trump, of course, has criticised fellow NATO members for not spending enough on defence] And on trade, Dimon writes that US does have some legitimate issues with China. China has realized significant economic and employment gains since joining the WTO in 2001. China was expected to continue on an aggressive path of opening up its economy, but this has happened at a much slower pace than most nations expected. Now, more than 16 years later, it has the second-largest economy in the world and is home to 20% of the Fortune 500 companies, yet it still considers itself a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153developing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd nation that should not be subject to the same WTO standards as the United States and other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153developed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd countries. However, simply imposing new tariffs on its goods in a unilateral fashion is not the answer. Instead, Dimon proposes a five-point plan: The United States should define very clearly, and in detail, what it wants from China. The United States should lay out a distinct timeline \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and determine what the reaction would be if it is not met. The United States should listen closely to China about any legitimate complaints it may have. This should be done in partnership with our largest allies, particularly Japan and Europe. The United States should revisit the Trans-Pacific Partnership and fix the parts considered unfair. The TPP could be an excellent economic and strategic agreement between America and its allies, particularly Asia. This is not against China: The country could at some point be offered the opportunity to enter the TPP if it demonstrates a willingness to meet its standards, which would improve upon the rules-based global trading system under American leadership. Back in the markets, mining companies are helping to drive the London stock market higher. Resource giants such as Glencore, Anglo American and Antifagasta are among the top risers on the FTSE 100. Mining companies would all suffer from a global trade war, as slower growth would hit demand for coal, iron ore, copper, aluminium. So today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally suggests that the City is hopeful that a full-blown protectionist clash can be avoided. Lena Komileva of (g+)economics says there have been encouraging noises from officials in China and the US, following the news yesterday that both sides could enforce tariffs on $50bn of imports. It is encouraging that the Chinese side has offered antidote to the escalation of language coming from the new While House China hawks around Trump: The US Chinese ambassador said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negotiation would still be our preference but it takes two to tango\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Clearly, the ground is set for an intensive round of talks stretching over the next half year, into the US midterm elections on 6 November, during which time markets will face continued headline risk, but trade wars is not the endgame on the radar. But still..... investors should be prepared for significant market volatility this year, she adds: This may not be a trade war, but China and the US are caught in a long term economic cold war for global market share in new technologies. Geopolitical risk, and the market fragmentation that comes with it, is not a transitory wave but a climate sea change. Breaking away from the car sales figures...we have evidence that the UK economy slowed in March as wintery weather gripped Britain. Activity in the dominant UK service sector slowed last month, growing at its slowest rate since July 2016. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to data firm Markit, whose UK service sector PMI fell to just 51.7 last month from 54.5 in February (any reading over 50 shows growth). Companies reported that bad weather disrupted business operations, and contributed to subdued consumer spending in March. Britain suffered some of its worst weather in years last month; a bitter cold spell, heavy snow and dangerous ice caused transport disruption and forced thousands of schools to close. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI surveys suggest the economy weakened: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK economy iced up in March, suffering the weakest increase in business activity since the Brexit vote amid widespread disruptions caused by some of the heaviest snowfall in years. As a result, first quarter economic growth will likely have been adversely affected. The PMI surveys collectively signal a quarterly GDP growth rate of just under 0.3%, down from 0.4% in the fourth quarter, albeit with the rate of growth sliding to just 0.15% in March alone. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight agrees: With construction activity also being hit markedly, the March purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 surveys overall fuel belief that the severe weather may well have caused GDP growth to dip to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2018. Alex Buttle, director of car buying comparison website Motorway.co.uk, says the auto industry is failing to persuade drivers to buy new, less-polluting, diesel cars: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What a difference a year makes. Twelve months ago the car industry was celebrating record new car sales, today, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s facing something of a crisis with no clear plans to reverse its fortunes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The car industry has tried but failed to promote the benefits of Euro 6 diesel cars without government support and sales figures are telling. Consumers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buying the sales patter with new diesel proving a confusing area for potential buyers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Diesel car owners are choosing instead to keep their current vehicles running longer than commit right now to a big ticket purchase. And instead of moving towards cleaner, greener motoring, British roads will remain clogged up with older, more polluting cars until the tide meaningfully turns towards electric. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also concerned by the modest rise in electric car sales: While new diesel registration figures are weak, the more worrying statistic is slow growth in AFV sales. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although electric and hybrid sales are up in March, a 5.7% rise is nowhere near rapid enough to keep us on track for the 2040 electric-hybrid switch over. The UK auto sector suffered a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctriple whammy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 this year, says Ian Plummer, Manufacturing and Agency Director at Auto Trader. First, Q1 of 2017 was always going to be a hard act to follow because sales were artificially inflated by consumers pulling forward purchases ahead of changes to Vehicle Excise Duty. Second, we had several days of Arctic weather and this impacted deliveries to dealers and deterred consumers from visiting showrooms. And third, the ongoing negative impact of Brexit. Not only has it severely dented consumer confidence but falling exchange rates has reduced the scope for manufacturers to entice consumers with strong offers due to the impact of a falling pound on the profitability of cars sold in the UK. Factor in the diesel crisis, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of reasons for people to put off buying a new car. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry has now suffered its longest drop in sales in over six years. The last time it fell for so many consecutive months was between July 2010 and July 2011 (13 months). Ian Gilmartin, head of retail &amp; wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, is also worried by the drop in car sales: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no disguising the fact that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another disappointing month for the new car sector. Achieving strong sales when new plate models hit the road is central to most sellers overall strategy, so there will be some concern at the continued slump revealed in these figures. However, the comparison with last March is a little misleading, as the record result posted then was in part due to sales being brought forward ahead of tax changes that came into place in April 2017. Some of the fall can also be attributed to a prolonged natural correction following a bumper couple of years, which we always knew was going to be unsustainable in the long run. The 15.7% slump in UK car registrations last month is a disappointment, says Chris Bosworth, Director of Strategy at Close Brothers Motor Finance: Traditionally March is a popular month to buy vehicles as the new number plates are out, and this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures should have been boosted by a spike in demand before the new VED changes set in. That said, petrol and alternative fuels remain the heroes of the forecourts, with diesel suffering and seeing yet another month of decline. Bosworth also predicts turbulence in the car sector as Britain exits the European Union: Dealers need to be willing and able to offer the most appropriate finance and stock to their customers, whether that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s diesel, petrol, or electric. The strong pound should ease the way and allow them to buy better value stock, while also offering breathing space for the losses incurred by cars sat on the forecourt. Confirmation that drivers are shunning diesel cars, in the light of the Volkswagen emissions scandal: NEWSFLASH: UK car sales slumped by 15.7% last month, according to new industry data which confirms that car buyers are shunning diesel cars. That means that, as feared, car registrations have now declined for 12 months in a row. Sales so far this year are down 12.4% compared to the first three months of 2017. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders say: As predicted, the UK new car market fell in March, down -15.7%, but still the fourth biggest March ever for the sector. Fall in diesel demand continues, down -37.2% compared to same month last year, with AFVs up 5.7% and petrol holding steady at 0.5%. The slump was broad-based; sales to business fell by 14.3%, while sales to private buyers shrank by 16.5%. The SMMT blame Brexit uncertainty, and the move towards banning diesel cars from some UK cities to combat air pollution. Economic and political uncertainty and confusion over air quality plans continued to affect confidence, resulting in declines across all sales types. As this chart shows, March 2017 was a bumper month -- making last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline all the sharper: European stock markets have hit a two-week high in early trading. Shares have rallied in London, Frankfurt, Paris, Madrid and Milan, on hopes that America and China will step back from launching a damaging trade war. What a difference a day makes -- yesterday, shares were sliding after China announced 25% tariffs on key US exports like soybeans, cars and aeroplanes Konstantinos Anthis, Head of Research at ADS Securities, explains: Risk appetite turns positive as US and China seem willing to negotiate a way out of their trade spat helping equities move the upside and pushing the yen and Gold further lower. China did announce a new round of tariffs worth $50 billion but said that they will only come into effect when the US implement their own measures. This suggests that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision is yet another move on the negotiating table which explains why risk sentiment didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t decline. March 2017 was a record-breaking month for the UK car industry. Sales jumped by 8% as drivers rushed to buy new vehicles before changes to vehicle excise duty pushed up the cost. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not surprising that sales fell last month. However.... a double-digit slump would be a serious reversal, and it would also mean sales have declined steadily for year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than a blip. Tony Burke, assistant general secretary of the Unite Union, tweets: Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, has confirmed that March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK car sales figures (due in 50 minutes) were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153undoubtedly grim\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Hawes also warned that Brexit uncertainty continues to cast a shadow over the sector. He told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All the indicators are that consumer and business confidence has declined, especially for the big ticket items. A car is the second biggest thing you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re likely to buy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The industry is facing this uncertainty since the referendum. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re an industry that operates on wafer thin margins so anything that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to affect the competitiveness of each of those plants is going to put a lot of pressure on. Now models, allocations tent to happen every four, maybe five years, so we can see ahead to when some of those decision points are. What we need is as much certainty in an uncertain world and trying to retain as many of the benefits as we currently have with our relationship with Europe, because it is by far our biggest market and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right on our doorstep. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The transitional deal has given us a bit of certainty for an additional 21 months and it gives us the time to be able to negotiate what that future relationship is going to look like. For us we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been very clear, we need to make sure there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no tariffs, ideally staying within the customs union and indeed the single market. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s made us so competitive and enabled us to grow since the recession. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to see that go backwards.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry has suffered another slump in car sales, as economic uncertainty and the diesel emissions scandal continues to bite. Figures released at 9am today are expected to show that new registrations shrank by around 15% last month, compared to March 2017. That would mean the industry has racked up 12 months of falling sales in a row, As Reuters explains: After record-high sales in 2015 and 2016, full-year demand dropped in 2017 due to uncertainty about future environmental levies on diesel cars and weaker consumer spending after June 2016\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote, which pushed up prices. Demand was also artificially inflated in March last year, when customers brought forward purchases to beat a tax rise which came into force in April 2017. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s automobile industry is already concerned that it could suffer badly if new trade barriers are introduced after Brexit; sliding domestic sales will only add to its anxiety. Also coming up today After yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turmoil, the financial markets are calmer as the White House tries to calm fears of a trade war. Wall Street staged a late rally last night, as Larry Kudlow, president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new top economic adviser, insisted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no trade war here,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Kudlow argued that people shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over-react to the news that America and China are threatening to slap tariffs on $50bn of each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good, suggesting that there is time to stave them off. The City has got the message; the blue-chip FTSE 100 index has just jumped by 95 points at the start of trading. We get fresh US trade figures later today, which will show whether Trump has had any success narrowing the trade deficit. Plus, data firm Markit is releasing its latest healthcheck on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector. The agenda 9am BST: UK car sales for March 9am BST: Eurozone service sector PMI for March 9.30am BST: UK service sector PMI for March 1.30pm BST: US weekly jobless figures 1.30pm BST: US trade balance for February",

Dow Jones: -1% at 24,270 S&amp;P 500: -0.9% at 2,640 Nasdaq: -1.1% at 7,000 Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at currency firm Oanda says that the dollar has been little moved by the big miss on US jobs because traders have other things on their minds: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not often that the see a miss of around 88,000 in the US job creation figures and markets shrug it off but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exactly what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen today. The US jobs report was somewhat overshadowed this week by the ongoing back and forth between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies which has threatened to disrupt the period of strong growth the global economy is seeing. Despite that, traders as ever were paying very close attention to the data release and were clearly unmoved by what they saw, despite the non-farm payrolls number being well below expectations. The 103,000 increase in US jobs in March was well below the 202,000 average of the past three months. But Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, says the non-farm payrolls report is typically volatile: The modest 103,000 gain in payroll employment in March, which follows a massive 326,000 gain in February, is a good illustration of the inherent volatility in the non-farm payroll data. The March gain was the worst in six months. The February gain was the best in two-and-a-half years. Economists at ING say the US Federal Reserve is likely to shrug off the weak jobs growth in March, instead focusing on the pick-up in wage growth to 2.7% (as expected) from 2.6%. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s James Smith says we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still on track for three more interest rate rises this year: A rebound in wage growth will outweigh any concerns over lower payrolls for the Fed, as policymakers gear up for three more hikes this year. With core inflation set to reach the 2% level again in data released next week, we expect the Fed to raise rates a further three times this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although of course, policymakers will also have a firm eye on escalating global trade tensions. The headline figure on March payrolls was a very big miss but there was better news on wage growth, which picked up to 2.7% year-on-year last month from 2.6% in February. But a predicted fall in the jobless rate to 4% did not materialise, instead remaining unchanged at 4.1% according to the US Labor Department. The department said the 103,000 increase in payrolls in March was driven by the manufacturing, health care and mining sectors, as well as professional and business services. Employment in the retail and construction sectors fell last month after large gains in February. The closely watched report is just out and shows the US economy added 103,000 jobs in March. It was the lowest in six months and sharply below economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts of 193,000. The figure for February was revised up to 326,000 from 313,000. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost time... President Trump is standing by his trade policy today: He has also retweeted his tweet from Wednesday when he claimed America was not in a trade war with China: The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sugar tax comes into force today, in an attempt to lower sugar consumption and reduce obesity rates in the UK. Officially called the soft drinks levy, prices of some drinks will rise as manufactures pass on some of their additional costs. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says the policy is well-targeted to reduce sugar consumption among the young: Trade war or rebalancing? Here is our full story on this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK productivity figures, which showed a pick-up for a second consecutive quarter at the end of 2017: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payrolls day, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get the latest snapshot of the US jobs market when the Labor Department publishes the March figures at 1.30pm UK time. Here is what is expected from economists polled by Reuters. (Figures in brackets show February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures, which could be revised.) US non-farm payrolls: +193,000 (+313,000) Unemployment rate: 4% (4.1%) Average earnings growth, year-on year: 2.7% (2.6%) US stock index futures are down as a gloomy mood persists among investors on both sides of the Atlantic: Dow futures: -0.8% Nasdaq futures: -0.8% S&amp;P futures: -0.7% The Institute of Directors says its too early to get excited about the long-awaited pick-up in UK productivity. Senior economist Tej Parikh says: While productivity growth has been near its strongest since the recession in recent quarters, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still too early to begin heralding this as the start of a new trend. For starters, a drop-off in hours worked played a key role in pushing up the numbers, while all-important output growth has continued to be modest. So, policymakers need to keep their foot on the gas. Business leaders would encourage the government to push forward with consultations and with allocating funding from the Industrial Strategy, to help kick-start the economic engine. Solving the productivity puzzle will require a comprehensive approach. Directors want to see improvements in the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s physical and digital infrastructure, to help boost idea diffusion and connectivity between regions. But macro investments need to be matched by direct support for businesses, particularly the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclong tail\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of low productivity SMEs. These firms need greater assistance to absorb new technologies and to upskill their workers and management in order to deliver efficiency enhancing changes to their organisations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Robert Jenrick, exchequer secretary to the Treasury, has responded to the productivity figures with the usual stuff: We want to increase productivity growth to ensure higher living standards for people across the country. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouraging we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had the best two quarters of productivity growth since the financial crisis but we must improve productivity over the longer term, which is why we are increasing public investment in our schools, hospitals, and infrastructure in this parliament to the highest sustained level in 40 years. Productivity in the UK grew by 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017, according to figures published this morning by the Office for National Statistics. It was the second consecutive quarter of productivity growth - as measured by output per hour - and left productivity 1.8% above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2007, before the financial crisis took hold. Some decent news after a prolonged period of weak productivity since the beginning of the crisis which has left the UK lagging behind other economies and created a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153productivity puzzle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for economists, who would have expected to see a pick-up after the downturn. As the ONS explains: An increase of 0.7% is slightly higher than the average quarterly rate of productivity growth in the decade prior to the 2008 economic downturn, since when UK productivity growth has been subdued. This sustained stagnation, often referred to as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153productivity puzzle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, contrasts with patterns following previous UK economic downturns when productivity initially fell, but subsequently recovered to the previous trend rate of growth. The graph below shows how UK productivity failed to pick-up again as expected after the financial crisis: Marks and Spencer is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 this morning, closely followed by Next.

These remain merely proposals with a lot of ways and time for the administration to back out.

Both sides would prefer to negotiate a settlement. Nevertheless, markets will be sensitive to the fact that a full-blown trade war could result if the two camps back themselves into a corner. The risk of miscalculation increases the more the two sides push this. The US-China trade spat could wipe 0.5% off Chinese gross domestic product - if the US carries out its latest threats and Beijing responds. That is an estimate from economists at Capital Economics, who were predicting the row would cost China 0.1% in GDP before the latest escalation. They suggest that if the US does impose new tariffs on $100bn of Chinese imports, President Xi Jinping may feel he has no choice but to once again respond in kind. Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at the consultancy, explains the risks: This would mean expanding the proposed Chinese tariff list to cover nearly all imports from the US, which Chinese data put at $155bn last year. These higher stakes increase the urgency of reaching an agreement with the US but also risk a more damaging outcome if talks break down. Fighting talk from Beijing this morning as it responds to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revelation that he is considering new $100bn tariffs on goods imported from China. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement: If the US side disregards opposition from China and the international community and insists on carrying out unilateralism and trade protectionism, the Chinese side will take them on until the end at any cost. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a trade war, but we aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afraid of fighting one. In the very definition of a tit-for-tat row, Donald Trump announced on Thursday night that he had instructed the US trade representative to consider slapping $100bn in additional tariffs on Chinese goods. He said in a statement the further measures were being considered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in light of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unfair retaliation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd against earlier US trade actions. It came a day after China issued a $50bn list of US goods including soybeans and small aircraft for possible import tariff hikes. That itself was 11 hours after the White House announced a list of 1,333 Chinese imports, also worth about $50bn, for punitive tariffs of 25%. Traders at spread-betting firm IG are expecting US markets to open lower. (The Wall Street opening bell goes at 2.30pm BST.) The FTSE 100 has opened lower this morning, along with the rest of its major European peers, as investors fear a full-blown trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. FTSE 100: -0.3% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.5% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.4% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.2% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.6% Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.3% Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors were left rattled after Donald Trump revealed after markets closed on Thursday night that he was considering imposing new tariffs on $100bn of goods imported from China. The news threw traders, who had been hopeful that a full-blown trade war could be avoided. China has responded this morning by saying that Beijing would fight the US \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at any cost\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Jasper Lawler from London Capital Group explains how investors reacted to the latest developments: Trumps announcement of a potential further $100 billion of tariffs on China briskly ended any hopes of an amicable conclusion to escalating trade tensions, initially sent Asian markets tumbling, along with European and US futures sharply lower. Whilst the knee jerk reaction was a heavy sell off from traders, markets since pared some losses, with Asia closing mixed and Europe still pointing to a lower start but less extreme than when the news broke. The message from the White House has been mixed at best this week, with White House advisor Larry Kudlow and other officials playing down any trade war fears, which worked to boost the markets. However, much of the good work by Kudlow and co was undone by Trump on Thursday evening, who is showing an increasingly hard-line approach. Stick with us for all the latest updates on the US/China spat. Also coming up today is the US non-farm payrolls report for March at 1.30pm BST. And its day one of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tax on sugary drinks.",

Even taking the financial crash into account, and measuring their assets over a longer period, they would still hold more than half of all wealth.</p> <p>Since 2008, the wealth of the richest 1% has been growing at an average of 6% a year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much faster than the 3% growth in wealth of the remaining 99% of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population.

                "bodyText":"The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest 1% are on course to control as much as two-thirds of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wealth by 2030, according to a shocking analysis that has lead to a cross-party call for action. World leaders are being warned that the continued accumulation of wealth at the top will fuel growing distrust and anger over the coming decade unless action is taken to restore the balance. An alarming projection produced by the House of Commons library suggests that if trends seen since the 2008 financial crash were to continue, then the top 1% will hold 64% of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wealth by 2030. Even taking the financial crash into account, and measuring their assets over a longer period, they would still hold more than half of all wealth. Since 2008, the wealth of the richest 1% has been growing at an average of 6% a year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much faster than the 3% growth in wealth of the remaining 99% of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population. Should that continue, the top 1% would hold wealth equating to $305tn (\u00c2\u00a3216.5tn) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up from $140tn today. Analysts suggest wealth has become concentrated at the top because of recent income inequality, higher rates of saving among the wealthy, and the accumulation of assets. The wealthy also invested a large amount of equity in businesses, stocks and other financial assets, which have handed them disproportionate benefits. New polling by Opinium suggests that voters perceive a major problem with the influence exerted by the very wealthy. Asked to select a group that would have the most power in 2030, most (34%) said the super-rich, while 28% opted for national governments.

In 1970 as a whole, the trade deficit averaged 0.2% of GDP \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a performance that today would be greeted with jubilation rather than despair. Not since the early 1980s has the UK run a surplus on goods, and at the last count the annual deficit was running at \u00c2\u00a3135bn. The deficit in manufactured products alone stood at \u00c2\u00a395bn.</p> \n<p>For the first time in ages, however, there has been a stirring of interest in trade.

According to data produced by the <a href=\"https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7851\">House of Commons library</a>, it has run a trade deficit in goods and services combined in every year since 1999. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, the deficit is getting bigger over time, doubling from \u00c2\u00a341bn to \u00c2\u00a382bn between 2012 and 2016. <br></p> \n<p>The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading performance with the rest of the world has been better.

He finds that almost all sectors are running a bigger deficit. The deficit with Germany has increased by 5% a year, with France by 7% a year and with the rest of the EU by 11% a year. <br></p> \n<p>Smallwood says the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade performance has deteriorated because the single market and the customs union are designed to suit other countries, Germany in particular, but not Britain.</p> \n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is not surprising that our trade deficit with the EU continues to grow, because the single market and customs union does not represent a free trade area. <a href=\"https://financialobserver.eu/poland/the-single-market-is-difficult-for-services/\">It is a free trade area only in goods</a>. Manufactured goods represent Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comparative advantage, whereas ours is in services. </p> \n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have entered into a lop-sided arrangement under which all impediments to trade have been removed from areas where our trading partners are strong but not from areas where we are strong. So obviously our overall trade deficit with them has gone on rising, and will continue to do so.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f7ad0a18-de29-4f4f-9968-cc131fa91abf\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Productivity is an economic measure of the efficiency of a workforce. It typically measures the level of output per hour of work, or per worker.</p>\n    <p>A more productive workforce signals stronger growth and healthier public finances. Productivity gains are vital to economic prosperity because it signals that more is being achieved by workers in less time. Gains are typically achieved through advances in technology and increased skill levels within a workforce.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, productivity growth has stalled since the financial crisis, putting it behind international rivals. The UK ranks fifth out of G7 leading industrial nations, with Canada and Japan having weaker levels of productivity. Germany is the most productive nation per hour, while the US is top for output per worker.</p>\n    <p>Weak productivity is problematic because it signals weaker economic growth, therefore eroding the public finances. Without an improvement in productivity, economies miss out on increases in wages and living standards, putting further pressure on the welfare system and depressing tax receipts.</p>\n    <p>Some industries are more productive than others. In the UK, manufacturing firms are among the most efficient, whereas the services sector operate at below average productivity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>This argument is supported by the data. Britain runs a surplus in services with the EU and while it has been growing it has not been doing so nearly fast enough to offset a growing deficit in goods, especially manufactured goods. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, the trend will continue unless EU barriers to trade in services are removed. Inevitably, life will be easier for exporters of EU manufactured goods to the UK than it will be for exporters of UK services to the EU.</p> \n<p>Trade deficits have consequences. The need to finance them means there will be upward pressure on interest rates. Productivity growth, which depends on a thriving manufacturing sector, will be lower than it would otherwise would be. Workers who lose their jobs in industry will be decanted into low-wage, low-skill sectors.<br></p> \n<p>Clearly, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s whopping trade deficit is the result of a range of factors. High interest rates, an over-valued currency, a culture of short-termism, poor management and unwillingness to invest in new machinery and skills have all played a part. It would fly in the face of the evidence to suggest that the trade deficit is simply a function of being a member of the single market and the customs union.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2018-04-08T13:07:29/embed.html\" data-alt=\"UK trade gap graph\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2018-04-08T13:07:29/embed.html\">UK trade gap graph</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Equally, it is hard to deny that other countries are doing rather better out of the current trading arrangements. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit for goods and services combined with the EU is 4% of GDP and rising. More than two-thirds of the deficit in goods is with the EU. The surplus in services is around a sixth of the deficit in goods.</p> \n<p>Business groups say that leaving the single market and the customs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 union will make matters even worse, but imagine the UK on the outside weighing up the pros and cons of joining a club where the trading rules amplified our weaknesses and nullified our strengths.

What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, the trend will continue unless EU barriers to trade in services are removed. Inevitably, life will be easier for exporters of EU manufactured goods to the UK than it will be for exporters of UK services to the EU. Trade deficits have consequences. The need to finance them means there will be upward pressure on interest rates. Productivity growth, which depends on a thriving manufacturing sector, will be lower than it would otherwise would be. Workers who lose their jobs in industry will be decanted into low-wage, low-skill sectors. Clearly, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s whopping trade deficit is the result of a range of factors. High interest rates, an over-valued currency, a culture of short-termism, poor management and unwillingness to invest in new machinery and skills have all played a part. It would fly in the face of the evidence to suggest that the trade deficit is simply a function of being a member of the single market and the customs union. Equally, it is hard to deny that other countries are doing rather better out of the current trading arrangements. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit for goods and services combined with the EU is 4% of GDP and rising. More than two-thirds of the deficit in goods is with the EU. The surplus in services is around a sixth of the deficit in goods. Business groups say that leaving the single market and the customs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 union will make matters even worse, but imagine the UK on the outside weighing up the pros and cons of joining a club where the trading rules amplified our weaknesses and nullified our strengths. Would we really be gagging to join?",

China has been gradually opening up its markets for a long time now and there is a hope that Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech may contain some commitments that will help kick start negotiations between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. </p> <p>The message from Larry Kudlow and Peter Navarro \u00e2\u20ac\u201c White House Senior Economic Advisor and Director of the White House National Trade Council, respectively \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in recent days has been that, while US President Donald Trump is willing to embark on tariffs, he is open to negotiations in order to avoid this. This very much supports the view that this is simply a tactic to get China to the negotiating table and perhaps we can start to see less confrontational talk and more willingness to find a diplomatic solution.</p> <p>This makes Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Tuesday one of, if not the, most important event for markets this week. Many expect announcements on further opening of the Chinese economy, the question is how far he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll go and whether it will be enough to satisfy the US administration, at least to the point that it takes on a less provocative approach.

For every two steps forward, it takes one step back.</p> <p>That said the economic backdrop hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just thawed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warming up. Slowing consumer price rises mean wages will soon be growing again in real terms.</p> <p>Few things stoke buyers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 confidence more than the sense that their paypackets are rising, and the Halifax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research shows mortgages are now at their most affordable for a decade.</p> <p>Yet no-one is predicting a sudden acceleration in demand.

The month on month increase of 1.5% now suggests an all-time high in terms of average house price, and overall the data would seem to indicate that the market is so far performing to expectations this year, including the annual forecast released by the Halifax for 2018 at the end of last year. </p> <p>In many respects, a report suggesting that house price growth is mainly unchanged represents a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno news is good news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 result for the property market, as given the current challenges of low available stock levels, impending interest rate increases and ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the fact that both activity and values seem to be maintaining a stable trajectory does underline the strength of consumer confidence in bricks and mortar. The fact that prices aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t increasing at a steeper rate does mean that, hopefully, more First Time Buyers will be able to take advantage of both the raft of competitively priced mortgages which are still available, together with the exemption on Stamp Duty and Land Tax and get onto the housing ladder in the coming months. Elsewhere in the market, for those wanting to trade up to a larger property, the current trend of more sustainable price increases together with better mortgage affordability will, hopefully, enable those who want to move home this year with the right environment to do so.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-04-09T09:10:03.873Z\">at 10.10am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5acb24f5e4b0131dfe31d7d3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-09T08:38:38.290Z\">9.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone consumer confidence falls for third month in a row</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit of gloom from the eurozone.</p> <p>Consumer sentiment fell in April for the third month in a row, due to concerns about a possible trade war between the US and China and a slowdown in global growth.</p> <p>The Sentix index fell from 24 in March to 19.6 in April, lower than the forecast level of 20.

Both exports and imports took an unexpected hit in February. Exports dropped by 3.2% month on month (from -0.4% in January), while imports decreased by 1.3% month on month, (from -0.4%). The trade surplus widened somewhat, from 17.3bn euro in January to 18.4bn euro in February. </p> <p>These days, talking about trade means talking about Trump and tariffs. In Germany, these talks have caused quite some goose bumps. Rightly so. In 2017, the US was Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest export partner. The bilateral trade surplus amounted to more than 50bn euro, with vehicles and machinery recording the largest bilateral surplus. At the same time, Germany runs a significant trade deficit with the US in agricultural products.

China announced to impose a 25% import tariff on cars produced in the US. This would immediately harm Germany as the single largest car exporting company in the US is in fact a German car manufacturer.</p> <p>While the prospects for the German export machinery have deteriorated significantly in recent weeks, the present state of the economy gives some reasons for concern. In fact, the entire start to the year 2018 has been a disappointment. Sentiment indicators have started to weaken, albeit from record highs, and industrial data for the first two months showed the weakest performance since 2009. In our view, seasonal effects, the cold winter weather and a flu epidemic were probably the main drivers of this disappointment. At least in the near term, sound fundamentals, low interest rates, record high employment, high capacity utilisation, low inventories and filled order books are strong arguments in favour of a re-acceleration of the economy.

                "bodyText":"Stock markets are having a nervy day, as investors try and come to terms with the current state of the trade dispute between the US and China. A seemingly conciliatory tweet from President Trump over the weekend gave some grounds for optimism that the tit-for-tat tariffs may not turn into a full blown trade war. But today Trump was back on the attack again, calling the current trade practices \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stupid.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Elsewhere Barclays deputy chairman Sir Gerry Grimstone praised Chinese president Xi Jinping for his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153authoritarian\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd leadership. He was speaking at the Boao Forum where Xi is due to give a keynote speech on Tuesday. The uncertainty saw markets come off their best levels. The FTSE 100 was already underperforming other markets, as companies with Russian links were hit by the new round of sanctions unveiled on Friday. So despite an opening rise on Wall Street, the FTSE 100 is currently down 0.3%, while the German and French markets are virtually flat. On the economic front, there were some positive UK house price figures from the Halifax. But eurozone consumer sentiment fell sharply, down for the third month in a row and there was some weak trade data from Germany. The City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, unveiled its \u00c2\u00a330m Brexit bill as part of its annual business plan. And on the corporate front Deutsche Bank has ousted its British born chief executive John Cryan in an attempt to get back on track. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The International Monetary Fund has warned of a demographic timebomb for developed economies such as Britain, the USA and Japan that will require a radical rethink for immigration policies in response. Identifying a mounting threat to economic growth and the welfare systems of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most advanced countries, the fund said increasing numbers of baby boomers reaching retirement could potentially \u00e2\u20ac\u0153overwhelm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd these countries. It said throwing open their borders to more immigrants and boosting the participation of women and older people could help to solve the problem, at a time when the working age population will be expected over the coming decades to support roughly double the number of elderly people as they do today. The comments came as part of the funds World Economic Outlook. US markets have recovered some ground after Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses, on hopes that the trade dispute with China can be resolved through negotiation. Investors are also hoping that this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s start of the reporting season, with results due from the likes of JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, will see some positive news. The recent tax cuts unveiled by Donald Trump, which have been out of the spotlight since the trade row began, should give a boost to corporate earnings. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 185 points or 0.8% higher, while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.65% higher and the Nasdaq Composite 0.86% higher. But uncertainty remains about the trade conflict given Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s various twitter comments, and ahead of a key speech by Chinese president Xi on Tuesday. All the morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains on European stock markets have virtually evaporated, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac both flat, and the FTSE 100 down 0.25%. Wall Street is still expected to open higher, but not as strongly as the futures were suggesting earlier, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average tipped to gain around 180 points. Markets have come off their best levels after President Trump made another twitter intervention into the current trade dispute with China. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is now up 0.55% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.24%. But the FTSE 100 is virtually flat, with mining companies in particular under pressure as the sector is hit by the latest US sanctions on Russian firms. Chinese president Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Tuesday is likely to be one of the most important events of the week for stock markets, says Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda: Whether the [positive market] moves we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing at the start of the week in Asia and Europe \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and in US futures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c reflect optimism that a solution [to the current trade dispute] will be found or are simply a case of profit taking on Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moves isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clear but a speech from Chinese President Xi Jinping scheduled for Tuesday may point towards the former. China has been gradually opening up its markets for a long time now and there is a hope that Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech may contain some commitments that will help kick start negotiations between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. The message from Larry Kudlow and Peter Navarro \u00e2\u20ac\u201c White House Senior Economic Advisor and Director of the White House National Trade Council, respectively \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in recent days has been that, while US President Donald Trump is willing to embark on tariffs, he is open to negotiations in order to avoid this. This very much supports the view that this is simply a tactic to get China to the negotiating table and perhaps we can start to see less confrontational talk and more willingness to find a diplomatic solution. This makes Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Tuesday one of, if not the, most important event for markets this week. Many expect announcements on further opening of the Chinese economy, the question is how far he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll go and whether it will be enough to satisfy the US administration, at least to the point that it takes on a less provocative approach. Any indication that this is the case could provide some reprieve for markets and lift investor sentiment. Speaking of China, Barclays bank deputy chairman Sir Gerry Grimstone has praised the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Xi Jinping for his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153authoritarian\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd leadership. Grimstone - who is also chairman of Standard Life Aberdeen - said at the Boao Forum for Asia, that China was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wonderful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for UK business. In a Bloomberg TV interview, he added: The fact that Xi is prepared to give such strong authoritarian guidance within the context of a market economy is great for companies such as mine. He also said the current dispute between the US and China \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could potentially be a trade war.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The full story and Grimstone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments are here. President Xi is due to give a keynote speech on Tuesday at the Boao Forum - which is taking place on the tropical island of Hainan - where he is expected to address the trade situation. Well, that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last long. President Trump is on the attack again on Chinese trade: It may be generally calm in the markets but not for companies with Russian links. In the wake of the latest US sanctions on Russian businesses, a number of listed firms have seen their shares come under pressure again. EN+, which manages the assets of tycoon Oleg Deripaska, is down 27% while Roman Abramovich\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Evraz has lost 15.5% - the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 - and Polymetal has fallen 8.7%. European markets are managing to hold on to their gains, but the continuing trade tensions between the US and China mean this positivity could prove fleeting, says Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG: European markets are in a more optimistic mood today, with the focus shifting towards a more constructive end to the US-China stand-off. However, recent weeks have shown us that volatility is likely to remain a key part of the trading landscape, with daily shifts in tone from US and China driving huge swings in stocks of late. A relative dearth of major economic releases over the first two days of this week provides greater emphasis on the geopolitical factors that have shaped market sentiment over recent weeks, with North Korea and particularly China likely to remain key going forward. Donald Trump clearly believes that a crisis will be averted by a deal which would allow free trade between the countries and compromise over intellectual property; however the risk of failure to find a resolution is very real for the global economic picture. The fear is that we have two stubborn and headstrong leaders who are unlikely to cave in, with the stand-off growing increasingly fraught as time passes. At the moment the FTSE 100 is up 0.2%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 0.9% better and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.5%. Back with the UK house price figures, and here is our report by Julia Kollewe: House prices strengthened in March to post their biggest monthly gain since August, according to Halifax, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest mortgage lender. The average price of a UK home rose 1.5% in March to hit \u00c2\u00a3227,871, the highest recorded price. Prices in the three months to March were 2.7% higher than a year earlier, up from the 1.8% annual growth recorded in February. The strong house price growth came as a surprise after months of lacklustre growth and declines in December and January reported by Halifax, part of Lloyds Banking Group. Rival lender Nationwide reported a 0.2% decline for March to \u00c2\u00a3211,625, the second monthly fall in a row. However, Halifax warned that monthly changes could be volatile. Prices fell 0.1% between January and March compared with the previous three months, the second consecutive quarterly decline. The full story is here: And here are some comments on the figures: Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders: After February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s freeze, the March thaw brought some relief to the property market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but only just. The month-on-month jump in average prices shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be taken as a sudden blooming of pent-up demand. On a quarterly basis, prices are still stagnating; and nationally the market remains stuck in its familiar pattern of tantalising inertia. For every two steps forward, it takes one step back. That said the economic backdrop hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just thawed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warming up. Slowing consumer price rises mean wages will soon be growing again in real terms. Few things stoke buyers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 confidence more than the sense that their paypackets are rising, and the Halifax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research shows mortgages are now at their most affordable for a decade. Yet no-one is predicting a sudden acceleration in demand. The crucial ingredient \u00e2\u20ac\u201c buyer confidence in the future course of the market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c remains in short supply. Sam Mitchell, chief executive of online estate agents HouseSimple.com: For a month in which persistent snow kept cars on drives, this is an enormous rebound, albeit that stock shortage is playing a major role in average monthly price volatility. We actually saw quite a few opportunistic sellers taking advantage of the bad weather last month to steal a march on the competition and market while there were fewer properties being listed. Now the snow has melted, we should see a healthy bounce in activity this month as we come into what is seasonally a busy period for the property market. For homeowners who might have delayed marketing their properties in March, this is their window of opportunity. Any Brexit fears seem to have abated for the time being and we are seeing a healthy level of interest from buyers, particularly in the north of England where the stamp duty freeze for first time buyers has definitely helped stimulate the market. Savvy sellers, who are pricing effectively, are having no problems getting offers, even in the tougher London market, where there are still plenty of committed buyers. Brian Murphy, head of lending for the Mortgage Advice Bureau: The report released by the Halifax this morning suggests that the UK housing market is ticking over steadily, with house price growth mainly unchanged on the previous quarter. The month on month increase of 1.5% now suggests an all-time high in terms of average house price, and overall the data would seem to indicate that the market is so far performing to expectations this year, including the annual forecast released by the Halifax for 2018 at the end of last year. In many respects, a report suggesting that house price growth is mainly unchanged represents a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno news is good news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 result for the property market, as given the current challenges of low available stock levels, impending interest rate increases and ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the fact that both activity and values seem to be maintaining a stable trajectory does underline the strength of consumer confidence in bricks and mortar. The fact that prices aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t increasing at a steeper rate does mean that, hopefully, more First Time Buyers will be able to take advantage of both the raft of competitively priced mortgages which are still available, together with the exemption on Stamp Duty and Land Tax and get onto the housing ladder in the coming months. Elsewhere in the market, for those wanting to trade up to a larger property, the current trend of more sustainable price increases together with better mortgage affordability will, hopefully, enable those who want to move home this year with the right environment to do so. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit of gloom from the eurozone. Consumer sentiment fell in April for the third month in a row, due to concerns about a possible trade war between the US and China and a slowdown in global growth. The Sentix index fell from 24 in March to 19.6 in April, lower than the forecast level of 20. Economic expectations turned negative for the first time since July 2016. Sentix managing director Patrick Hussy said: Even though the current situation is still rated as excellent...the prospects for the future have become massively gloomier. The customs disputes, fuelled by US president Donald Trump, are leaving their traces. The City watchdog has outlined plans to significantly increase its spending on Brexit to help smooth the process for financial firms, one of the biggest sectors of the economy that could face disruption. The Financial Conduct Authority will need about \u00c2\u00a330m for making changes to the way it governs the work of banks, insurers and asset managers in the City of London, according to its annual business plan published on Monday. The EU withdrawal budget, paid for by fees levied on the finance industry, is the first time the regulator has outlined a specific price tag for Brexit and illustrates the ballooning costs for many government organisations as the UK leaves the EU. The FCA said it had earmarked \u00c2\u00a32.5m in additional costs last year, although had done some work from its existing half a billion-pound budget to carry out some of its work on Brexit in the last financial year. Over in Germany, there has been a boardroom shake-up at the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank. Julia Kollewe reports: Deutsche Bank, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest lender, has ousted its British chief executive, John Cryan, after years of losses and promoted the co-head of its retail banking arm to the top job. Following a two-week boardroom battle, Deutsche has appointed Christian Sewing as chief executive with immediate effect. He vowed to take \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tough decisions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to return the bank to profitability. Cryan, a Yorkshireman who took the helm at Deutsche in June 2015, leaves at the end of this month, two years before his contract was due to end. Our full story is here: Here are the recent movements in house prices according to the Halifax: House prices in the UK rose by 1.5% in March compared to the previous month, according to the Halifax. This was a better than expected result, with analysts forecasting growth of just 0.2%. This was the fasted increase since August last year, but the Halifax does point out the monthly figures can be volatile. House prices rose by 2.7% in the first three months of the year compared to the same period last year, up from the 1.8% annual growth reported in February. But compared to the October to December quarter, they slipped by 0.1%, the second successive decline on this measure. Russell Galley, Halifx managing director, said: House prices in the three months to March were largely unchanged compared with the previous quarter. The annual rate of growth continues to be in a narrow range of under 3%; though the average price of \u00c2\u00a3227,871 is a new high. Activity levels, like house price growth, have softened compared with a year ago. Mortgage approvals are down compared to 12 months ago, whilst home sales have remained flat in the early months of the year. This lack of direction in the housing market is in stark contrast to the continuing strength of the UK jobs market. The unemployment rate is now the joint lowest since 1975 and in the three months to January there were 402,000 more people in work compared to a year earlier. In the coming months we expect price growth to remain close to our prediction of 3% despite the very positive factors of continuing low mortgage rates, great affordability levels and a robust labour market. The continuing shortage of properties for sale will also support price growth. Investors are also looking to a speech from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Xi on Tuesday, where he is expected to comment on the current trade situation with the US. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hope he also expands on his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153friendship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with Donald Trump (as referenced by the US president over the weekend.) As expected, European markets have made a steady start to the week on hopes that the trade dispute between the US and China can be resolved before the threatened tariffs kick in. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.22% , while Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stoxx 600 index opened up 0.3%. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has added 0.5% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.2%. Wall Street is expected to follow the generally positive mood when US markets open later, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average predicted to rebound by more than 200 points. This would not recover the 572 point drop seen on Friday, but US markets have been so volatile in recent days that it would be no surprise to see the Dow do that during the day. Earlier there was some weaker than expected trade data from Germany, with imports and exports both down. It is the weakest start to a new year since 2009, says economist Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank, at a time when Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariff plans could hit the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy: The latest trade data confirm that the German economy has had a weak start to the new year. Both exports and imports took an unexpected hit in February. Exports dropped by 3.2% month on month (from -0.4% in January), while imports decreased by 1.3% month on month, (from -0.4%). The trade surplus widened somewhat, from 17.3bn euro in January to 18.4bn euro in February. These days, talking about trade means talking about Trump and tariffs. In Germany, these talks have caused quite some goose bumps. Rightly so. In 2017, the US was Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest export partner. The bilateral trade surplus amounted to more than 50bn euro, with vehicles and machinery recording the largest bilateral surplus. At the same time, Germany runs a significant trade deficit with the US in agricultural products. The only comforting factor for Germany is that it has a very diversified export sector, particularly in terms of geographic diversification. Still, even though the current stage of the global trade conflict seems to be limited to China and the US, Germany could become the first prominent victim outside of these two countries. China announced to impose a 25% import tariff on cars produced in the US. This would immediately harm Germany as the single largest car exporting company in the US is in fact a German car manufacturer. While the prospects for the German export machinery have deteriorated significantly in recent weeks, the present state of the economy gives some reasons for concern. In fact, the entire start to the year 2018 has been a disappointment. Sentiment indicators have started to weaken, albeit from record highs, and industrial data for the first two months showed the weakest performance since 2009. In our view, seasonal effects, the cold winter weather and a flu epidemic were probably the main drivers of this disappointment. At least in the near term, sound fundamentals, low interest rates, record high employment, high capacity utilisation, low inventories and filled order books are strong arguments in favour of a re-acceleration of the economy. However, if anything downside risks for the economy have clearly increased in recent weeks. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It was another wild week on stock markets last week as the rollercoaster ride that is the trade dispute between the US and China continued to unnerve investors. After the US detailed the $50bn of tariffs it would slap on Chinese goods, Beijing responded with its own targeted list, but hopes of talks behind the scenes to avert a trade war seemed to calm the markets a little. Until that is President Trump raised the stakes by promising to increase the tariffs to $100bn of goods. Perhaps overcome by trade fatigue, European markets merely shrugged, but on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.3% on Friday. But in another turnaround, Trump seemed to be more conciliatory over the weekend. He tweeted: So Asian markets have edged higher, with the NIkkei 225 up 0.5% and European markets set to follow suit. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: Steep declines on Wall Street have been shrugged off in Asian markets overnight and European shares look set for a positive open. US shares had initially held up relatively after President Donald Trump threatened another $100bn in tariffs against China. Few were willing to hold on over the weekend after US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin acknowledged the possibility of a trade war. Trump tweeted over the weekend with respect to China that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTaxes will become reciprocal &amp; a deal will be made on intellectual property.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s softened stance offers some hope for calm in his trade dispute with China. The opening calls from IG show: It is also the start of the US reporting season, and it will be interesting to see if investors can break away from watching Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twitter account to concentrate on what companies are saying about the economy Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: With US earnings season starting this week some decent reports could be the difference between a rebound off these [market] lows, and optimism about future profits or worries as to whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen the high water mark for profits growth. Investors will have to look past recent tax changes, as well as market volatility and flatter yield curves to determine what effects these might have on long term profitability.

For a start, as we know, Trump is nothing if not unpredictable, so his response to Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments will be interesting.</p> <p>Plus there are wider issues to unsettle investors.

                "bodyText":"Stock markets are moving higher after a speech by China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Xi at the Boao Forum defused some of the fears of a trade war between Beijing and the US. Xi said China would take measures to widen market access for foreign investors and would lower import tariffs on products including cars. However China is reported to have filed a complaint with the World Trade Organisation over the proposed US tariffs on steel and aluminium. And investors still face a number of other uncertainties, not least the US sanctions on Russia which has hit the rouble hard. Elsewhere, Bank of England policymaker Ian McCafferty said the monetary policy committee should not dally over raising UK interest rates given wage growth and the strength of the global economy. The comments gave a lift to the pound. Meanwhile European Central Bank member Ewald Nowotny said it was time to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153normalise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd its monetary policy. And in the US, producer prices rose by more than expected in March, giving more ammunition to the Federal Reserve to increase borrowing costs. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. With trade war fears easing after the overnight speech from Chinese president Xi, US markets have opened sharply higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 390 points or 1.63% higher, while the S&amp;P 500 is up 1.36% and the Nasdaq Composite has climbed 1.65%. Commenting on the Xi speech to Reuters, strategist Art Hogan at Wunderlich Securities in New York said: The expectation was [the Xi speech] could have gone one of two ways: he could have been aggressive about US tariffs or been conciliatory, and it feels like he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more conciliatory. Back with the Boao Forum in China, and the managing director of the International Monetary Fund has also had talks with president Xi: Stronger than forecast US producer price figures for March give more ammunition for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again later this year. The Fed has indicated it could increased borrowing costs another two times in 2018 but some expect another rise on top of that if the economic data merits it. So a 0.3% rise in the producer price index last month adds fuel to those expectations. That is an increase from the 0.2% rise in February, and higher than analyst forecasts of 0.1%. The year on year increase in March was 3%, up from 2.8% in the previous month and ahead of the 2.9% expected. The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures index, rose to 1.6% after being at 1.5% for four months. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which released the data, said: A major factor in the March advance in prices for final demand services was the index for outpatient care (partial), which climbed 0.4 percent. The indexes for machinery, equipment, parts, and supplies wholesaling; cable and satellite subscriber services; airline passenger services; food and alcohol wholesaling; and hospital inpatient care also moved higher. In contrast, margins for automotive fuels and lubricants retailing fell 10.4 percent. The indexes for apparel, footwear, and accessories retailing and wireless telecommunications services also decreased. As a sign things are a little calmer on the stock markets at the moment, the VIX volatility index - which had been rising in recent days - is currently down 5% at 20.61. That is not to say there are not a number of uncertainties for investors, from the US/China trade dispute, the situation in Syria, Russian sanctions and the latest on the Mueller investigation in the US. European stock markets are holding on to their gains, and Wall Street is still expected to open sharplyhigher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The Dow Jones is all set to leap 320 points after the bell, a chunky jump that would take the beleaguered index to 24300, pushing it towards the top end of its recent trading bracket. However, it is important to note that the US open and close can often operate in completely different universes, especially if Trump gives into his urge to cause a bit of Twitter chaos. Brexit is getting real: The pound has hit a day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high of $1.4179, up 0.38% on the talk of further interest rate rises. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB, said: Sterling has moved higher after some hawkish comments from BoE member McCafferty in which he cautioned fellow rate-setters against dallying when it comes to further tightening monetary policy. McCafferty was one of two dissenters who called for higher rates at the last meeting when the bank decided to keep its policy unchanged and his recent comments have pushed the pound/dollar rate to its highest level in more than a fortnight. With the bank expected to raise rates next month, remarks from the voting members will take on a greater importance in the coming weeks with the previous hike in November - the first such increase in more than a decade - being widely telegraphed in advance. Despite the slump in the rouble, Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has no plans to introduce any measures to reduce volatility. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first deputy chairman Sergei Shvetsov said the situation with the rouble was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adequate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to Reuters. And back with the effects of the US sanctions on Russian companies: At the time London stock exchange chief executive Xavier Rolet said: We warmly congratulate Mr Sokov and his management team on their successful IPO today. Welcoming En+ Group to London Stock Exchange is a significant milestone which underlines the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position as the leading global listing venue for international companies and investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 appetite for Russian issuers. With 100 Russian and CIS businesses listed and traded on London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets, with a total capitalisation of over $550 billion, London is a strong partner to Russian companies seeking access to global investor capital, as well as an open and dynamic place to do business. And the company was invited to open trading on the day it listed in November: The average British household benefited from the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emergency interest rate cut in the financial crisis to the tune of almost \u00c2\u00a39,000 in pay and \u00c2\u00a390,000 in household wealth, according to its chief economist. Speaking in Australia, Andy Haldane is defending some of the benefits from low interest rates just before Threadneedle Street looks to increase them to levels unseen since the 2008 crash began. According to him, the impact of low rates and quantitative easing has been to keep more people in work - helping them with their earnings - and to keep borrowing costs cheap to help cut mortgage costs. Asset prices have also been inflated, helping those who held them - even if they got less on their cash savings held in bank accounts. The significance of the loose monetary policy from the Bank is so significant, he says, that GDP in the UK would have been around 8% lower, unemployment 4 percentage points higher and the level of consumer prices 20% lower without its package to cut rates to 0.5% and inject \u00c2\u00a3435bn into the economy through QE. Just 4% of households were made \u00c2\u00a3500 or more worse off when taking income and wealth effects together, he says. And here is the dramatic movement in the rouble - it shows the rise in the number of roubles needed to buy one dollar: Meanwhile the Russian rouble continues to come under pressure following the US sanctions against a number of its companies. The currency is down around 4% against the dollar to 63.28, its second day of heavy losses and its lowest level since December 2016. And there is another twist in the trade dispute between the US and China. Associated Press reports: China is filing a complaint with the World Trade Organisation against U.S. tariffs on steel, aluminium products. The Geneva-based trade body said on Tuesday that China has requested 60 days of consultations with the United States to resolve the dispute. If the two sides can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree on a solution, the next step could be for Beijing to request a ruling from a panel of trade experts. China claims the duties of 25 percent on imports of steel and 10 percent on imports of aluminum products breach international trade rules. The Bank of England is not the only central bank to be considering reigning in the financial stimulus - low interest rates and quantitative easing - that have supported stock markets since the financial crisis. Speaking in London, European Central Bank policymaker and Bank of Austria governor Ewald Nowotny said it was now time to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153start the gradual normalisation of monetary policy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said: We are at an important turning point in monetary policy. We must normalise policy not too soon but not too late. He said there was the risk of stifling the recovery if the ECB tightened monetary policy too soon, but also a risk of an asset boom if it tightened too late. Sterling has edged to a two week high after the comments from Bank of England policymaker Ian McCafferty that there should be no delay in raising interest rates. The pound hit $1.4168 against the dollar in the wake of the remarks, up 0.28%. Against the euro sterling is 0.13% better at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1485. UK interest rates should be raised again without delay, a leading Bank of England policymaker has said. After its meeting last month the Bank hinted at an increase in May, and in an interview with Reuters, Ian McCafferty said the prospect of faster pay rises and a strong pick-up in the global economy emphasised the need for dearer borrowing costs before long. McCafferty said that wage growth, which has lagged inflation for much of the past decade, could prove to be stronger than many of his colleagues on the monetary policy committee believed. He told Reuters: We shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dally when it comes to tightening policy modestly,. Reuters adds: McCafferty said he could not be certain about whether to vote again for a rate rise until May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy meeting, but there had been no data or Brexit developments so far to make him think he was wrong in March to vote to raise rates to 0.75 percent. The former chief economic adviser to the Confederation of British Industry has been in the minority of BoE policymakers pushing for a rate hike previously in the past four years. Speaking in his office in the BoE on Monday... McCafferty said that as well as the boost from the world economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong recovery, he thought there was now no slack left in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market. Unemployment at its lowest rate since 1975, skill shortages and signs that employers were resorting to higher wage offers to lure staff from rival firms or stop them from leaving would also create inflation pressure. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not wages suddenly bursting away, but it gives you a modest upside risk,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said McCafferty, whose term at the central bank ends in August. And the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153jury is still out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on whether the inflationary hit from the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote in 2016 would fade as quickly as expected, he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On balance, those three arguments give me some potential modest upside risks to the (inflation) forecasts,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd McCafferty said. While the BoE had been wrong in the past about wages finally gaining momentum, labour market surveys so far this year showed that the recent recovery in the headline rate of growth of pay to nearly 3 percent looked more sustainable this time, he said. Often called one of the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most hawkish policymakers, McCafferty said there had been a case for following up November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate move with another hike as early as February. But he held off to avoid surprising households who had been told by the BoE that it plans to raise rates only gradually... On Brexit, McCafferty said British exporters remained in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a sweet spot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, helped by the weakness of the pound while concerns that they might lose business with supply chain customers elsewhere in the EU had so far proven overdone. But there were signs that British companies were wary about making long-term investments, and potential Brexit stumbling blocks would remain, he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a permanent feature of the landscape,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd McCafferty said. Mining shares are leading the way in London, while news that US regulators have approved Bayer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover of Monsanto and a positive update from LVMH have also helped sentiment. But ahead of the start of the US reporting season, the main support for the market in early trading is Chinese president Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech at Boao. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale said: What President Xi didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say at the Boao Forum matters more than what he did. There are plenty of reforms to come, including reduced auto tariffs, but no details. But the lack of any ramping-up of the US/Chinese trade-war-by-rhetoric was the key for equities to rally. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor said: President Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech overnight appears to have struck the right tone, providing some relief for investors who have been buffeted by the recent war of words between Trump and China over trade. While there was already an overwhelming sense that Chinese officials were keen to achieve a negotiated settlement before the proposed tariffs do any lasting damage to either the Chinese or US economies, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech was the clearest indication yet that China is prepared to take concrete steps to address some of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief criticisms. The big question is whether President Trump will now take the olive branch offered by Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conciliatory approach and dial down the rhetoric from his side too. Corporate profits have taken a back seat to trade tensions and increased volatility over the past few weeks, but as the US earnings season starts in earnest this week, they will take on huge significance. Equities received a huge boost when the US tax reform bill was signed into law in December and investors will want to see that this is feeding through to the bottom line to justify their continued faith. A good earnings season would do a lot to regain some equilibrium and provide some much-needed relief and calm for beleaguered investors. As fears of a trade war between China and the US ease - for the moment - after president Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech overnight, European markets have opened in a positive mood. The FTSE 100 is up 0.5% or 41 points, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has added just over 1%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.8% and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex is 0.6% better. And the US futures are predicting the Dow Jones Industrial Average - which added just 0.19% in the end on Monday - will open around 360 points higher or 1.5%. More fallout from the US imposition of sanctions on various Russian companies. Glencore, which has various contracts with Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rusal for the purchase of aluminium, says it is now evaluating these contracts. Glencore boss Ivan Glasenberg has resigned from the Rusal board, and a deal for Glencore to swap its shares in Rusal for global depository receipts in EN+ - which manages the assets of Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska - will not now go ahead. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A keynote speech by Chinese president Xi Jinping at the Boao Asian forum overnight has eased some of the concerns about a possible trade war with the US. America had proposed slapping tariffs on $50bn - or even $100bn - worth of Chinese products which prompted a tit-for-tat response from Beijing. Weekend comments from Donald Trump seemed to suggest the two sides might be able to reach a compromise, but on Monday, in typical fashion, the US president came out fighting again: So Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments at Boao were awaited with some trepidation. Investors were hoping to hear some positive news on China opening up its markets but were also wary of what he might say about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threats. In the event Xi seemed to make some veiled criticisms of the US but also said China would take measures to widen market access for foreign investors and would lower import tariffs on products including, yes, cars. Here is our report on the speech: The news made for a positive performance on Asian stock markets, with the Nikkei 225 up 0.74%, and this is likely to translate into an opening rise in Europe: Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Once again it is the background noise that is driving short term sentiment with big swings intraday making the price action difficult to predict. [Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] pledges to open up China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and lower import tariffs, while nothing particularly new, sent Asia markets higher and are likely to translate into a positive European open this morning. Whether they translate into anything other than words is another story but for now they appear to signal a willingness for China to move forward the discussions on trade with the US. But things are likely to remain volatile. For a start, as we know, Trump is nothing if not unpredictable, so his response to Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments will be interesting. Plus there are wider issues to unsettle investors. The imposition of sanctions by the US on a number of Russian companies sent the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market sharply lower on Monday, while growing tensions over Syria are also causing concern. The recent appointment of the hawkish John Bolton as the US national security advisor may not help matters. There is also the continuing dispute between the UK and Russia over the Salisbury poisoning. In the US itself, there are more uncertainties. The country faces a $1trn deficit, while Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal lawyer Michael Cohen had his office raided by the FBI. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: The raid was in connection with payments to adult star Stormy Daniels and conducted by the Justice Department with help from a referral from the Mueller investigation. The escalation that people are watching out for is that Trump responds by firing Robert Mueller. Political fireworks at home would put extra pressure on delicate trade negotiations. Elsewhere it is another fairly quiet day on the economic and corporate front, ahead of the start of the big US earnings season later this week.

Overall, it seems likely that GDP growth will soften from the +0.4% (qoq) recorded in Q4, though the extent of this will largely hinge on how the dominant services sector has fared. </p> <p>Surveys suggest that the snow has weighed heavily on the sector, with the March services PMI falling to the lowest seen since immediately after the EU referendum in July 2016.

A tweet from Donald Trump warning Russia to get ready for US missile strikes against its ally Syria sent the Russian rouble down 2.5% to its lowest level since November 2016. Surprise falls in UK manufacturing and construction output in February suggest the UK economy slowed in the first quarter of 2018. European stock markets are still trading lower. Wall Street has also opened lower. FTSE 100 index in London broadly flat at 7266 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax down 0.8% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC down 0.6% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex down 0.2% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB down 0.4% Dow Jones down 0.4% Nasdaq down 0.5% S&amp;P 500 down 0.4% The rouble, already down, tumbled 2.5%, taking its total losses to almost 12% since Friday when the US government imposed fresh sanctions against seven Russian oligarchs and their businesses. The Russian rouble has fallen to its weakest level since November 2016, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lira hit another record low and emerging markets stocks slipped, after Donald Trump warned Russia in a tweet to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153get ready\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for US missile strikes against its ally Syria in response to Saturday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chemical weapons attack on a rebel-held town outside Damascus. In the US, consumer prices fell for the first time in 10 months in March due to weak gasoline prices, according to the Labor Department. The consumer price index slipped 0.1% last month, the first and biggest drop since May 2017. It comes after a 0.2% increase in February. However, the annual inflation rate rose to 2.4% from 2.2%, marking the fastest annual growth in a year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to the news that online retailer Shop Direct will be closing three warehouses in Greater Manchester. Martin Lane, managing editor of money.co.uk, says: Another dark day for the retail industry with Shop Direct making nearly 2,000 members of staff redundant, proving even online retailers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t immune to current economic pressures. The pattern of well loved stores filing for administration or cutting jobs over the last few weeks is terrible news for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail industry. The location of Shop Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warehouses appears to be the cause of these redundancies being made and with a new site not expected until 2021 there is little hope for staff to be transferred. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s undoubtedly distressing news for employees of Shop Direct and their families. Now is the time to check what redundancy rights you have and dig out any income or mortgage protection policies you hold. The website has a guide explaining redundancy rights. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research has put out its monthly estimate of GDP growth. It reckons that growth slowed to 0.2% in the first quarter of this year, from 0.4% in the fourth quarter. Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at NIESR, said The main reason for the weakness was severe weather in March which is likely to have disrupted activity in all major sectors of the economy. There is a small offset in industrial production growth which recovered in the first quarter after the previous quarter was affected by the Fortis oil pipeline shutdown. But he also warned that there could be larger than normal revisions to the data at a later stage, if previous severe weather episodes serve as a guide. Take for example the quarterly GDP growth for the final quarter of 2010 when the UK experienced a prolonged period of extreme cold weather. The economy was initially estimated to have shrunk by 0.5% but subsequent data revisions show that the economy expanded by 0.1% over this period. More bad news in the retail industry. The online retailer Shop Direct is to close three sites in Greater Manchester, leading to the loss of nearly 2,000 jobs, PA reports. The move is part of Shop Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to open a new warehouse in East Midlands Gateway, which will replace current centres in Shaw, Little Hulton and Raven. The firm said that the three sites have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153limited accessibility, layout and loading restrictions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and no longer meet the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153operational ambitions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A total of 1,992 staff are to enter into redundancy consultation, with the number made up of 1,177 permanent Shop Direct jobs and 815 agency roles. The new site at East Midlands Gateway will be automated, with approximately 500 permanent roles created when operational in 2020. The number is expected to increase by an additional 200 to 300 agency colleagues during peak periods, Shop Direct said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For Shop Direct to continue to meet customer demand, the business now needs a new, purpose-built and automated facility in a central, well-connected location, that can accommodate all one-man fulfilment and returns operations on one site, and that provides room for continued expansion,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the company added. Returning to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s triple set of UK data - industrial production, trade and construction \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the forecasting group EY Item Club has looked at the impact on GDP and interest rates. A largely disappointing set of news on the UK economy which fuels suspicion that GDP growth likely slowed to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter. While the weakened February data may surprise the Bank of England and provide some food for thought, the odds remain strongly in favour of the monetary policy committee pressing ahead with a 25 basis point interest rate hike to 0.75% at their May meeting. However, expectations of another hike in November may well be diluted. Investec economist George Brown is also predicting a slowdown to 0.3% GDP growth between January and March, from 0.4% in the final three months of last year. With the snowfall having spilled over into the first week of March, we could see another soft outturn cap off Q1. Overall, it seems likely that GDP growth will soften from the +0.4% (qoq) recorded in Q4, though the extent of this will largely hinge on how the dominant services sector has fared. Surveys suggest that the snow has weighed heavily on the sector, with the March services PMI falling to the lowest seen since immediately after the EU referendum in July 2016. Still, with snow affecting only a brief period of the quarter, we expect the impact to be relatively modest and have tentatively pencilled in a 0.1ppt slowing in growth to 0.3% for Q1. Here is our story The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sugar tax came into force on Friday, leaving a bitter taste for sugar companies and drinks manufacturers that now have to pay a levy on high-sugar drinks they sell. In another blow to sugar companies and farmers, sugar prices have fallen to 2 1/2 year lows, due to a glut of sugar on the market caused by high output from India and Thailand. India recently scrapped a 20% sugar export tax. The Indian Sugar Mills Association has revised its sugar output estimate for this season starting in October up to 29.5m tonnes. This still looks too low, as sugar output was 28.2m tonnes as of 31 March. World sugar prices have been falling for the last couple of years following a series of bumper crops. This has hit Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S\u00c3\u00bcdzucker, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest sugar producer, which issued a profit warning last week. FastFT quoted Michael McDougall at commodity brokers ED&amp;F Man Capital Markets: The market is finding it hard to get out from under the cloud of increased sugar production that is effectively the result of good weather and government policies. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said about the manufacturing and trade data: The modest stimulus to growth from sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2016 depreciation has begun to fade, while the global trade upswing has lost some momentum too. Meanwhile Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, tweeted Returning to the trade data, while the goods trade deficit shrank in February, this reflected a drop in imports rather than an improvement in exports. And the deficit widened by \u00c2\u00a3100m the three months to February. The ONS said movements in goods exports were largely offset by imports, therefore there was little change in the goods deficit with EU or non-EU countries, which widened by \u00c2\u00a3200m and narrowed by \u00c2\u00a3100m respectively in the three months to February 2018. The ONS head of national accounts Darren Morgan said: Manufacturing continued to grow in the three months to February but at the slowest rate seen since the summer, with increases in machinery, metal products and pharmaceuticals offset by falls in electrical appliances and oil refining. This drop in refining may have contributed to the fall in fuel exports and the large rise in fuel imports also seen in the three months to February. The trade deficit widened a little in the three months to February, with reduced imports of machinery offsetting the rise in fuel imports. Construction fell in the three months to February after an erratic couple of months, mainly due to a big decline in repair work. However, this was partially offset by growth in both infrastructure and housebuilding. The detail of the manufacturing data reveals that seven of 13 manufacturing sub-sectors declined in March, led by machinery and equipment, down 3.9%, the first fall since last June. Of the sub-sectors that upped their factory output in February, the weapons and ammunition industry stood out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c output rose 28.6%, its strongest growth since August 2014. Pharmaceuticals were also up, by 3.3%. The ONS said there was some anecdotal evidence that heavy snow in late February hurt construction, although the impact was hard to quantify. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation, was quick to respond to the data. Manufacturing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent run of growth came to a halt in February though the picture across sectors was more varied, with some hefty output falls in some key sub-sectors. Whilst there doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to have been an appreciable impact on the sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance from the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBeast from the East\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in February, weather-related events may yet have a bearing on the numbers in the coming month however. She added: Despite this, the data looks more like a temporary wobble than a turn for the worse. Whilst other indicators may have softened since the start of the year, on-going growth in the global economy should continue to spur growth across manufacturing in the coming quarters. Sterling slipped after the surprise falls in UK manufacturing and construction output in February. The figures will be scrutinised by the Bank of England, which has been widely expected to raise interest rates next month. Industrial production, which comprises manufacturing, energy and mining, rose 0.1% in February, a sharp slowdown from the 1.3% growth sen in January. The trade figures are better. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goods trade deficit with the rest of the world shrank to \u00c2\u00a310.2bn in February from \u00c2\u00a312.2bn in January \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the smallest shortfall since September, and better than the City had expected. The UK data are out. Manufacturing output fell unexpectedly in February, posting its first drop in almost a year, according to official figures. It fell 0.2% in February from the previous month and stagnated in January. The Office for National Statistics also reported another sharp drop in construction output of 1.6%, defying hopes of a small rebound after January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3.1% slump. The figures suggest the UK economy may have slowed in the first quarter. Turning to oil, Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy minister said today that he was happy with the current state of the oil market. The oil cartel Opec, Russia and several other non-Opec countries began cutting supply in January 2017 in an effort to eliminate the global glut of crude that had built up in previous years. The pact has been extended until the end of this year. Speaking on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum, a meeting of oil producers and consumers in New Delhi, Khalid al-Falih said: I think a lot of the glut has been cleared. Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy minister said the country \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest exporter of oil \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would not let another supply glut develop, but also does not want oil prices to rise to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unreasonable levels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Brent crude is trading at $70.82 a barrel, easing from the 2014 highs touched yesterday when escalating Middle East tensions were offset by increasing inventories and production in the US. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s VDMA engineering association has called on the West to lift some sanctions against Moscow. Its president, Carl Martin Welcker, has told Reuters that the association is hoping for a sustained recovery in demand from the Russian market. German engineering exports to Russia rose 22.5% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.3bn last year, but that was still far below a peak of almost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8bn peak in 2012. Welcker said: Russia has developed very positively over the past year, after all the disappointing years before. He urged the West to reconsider sanctions imposed on Russia over its role in the Ukraine conflict. Economic sanctions have little political impact in this respect, we want them to be critically scrutinised. The things that work should be upheld and others should be loosened if possible. Russian stocks and the rouble have slumped since the US announced new sanctions on Russian oligarchs and officials on Friday. A report released this morning shows that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high streets suffered more store closures in 2017 than in any year since 2010. Fashion retailers, shoe shops, travel agents and estate agents have been driven out by the rise of internet shopping. A net 1,700 chain shops closed their doors in 2017, according to analysis of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top 500 towns compiled by the Local Data Company (LDC) for PricewaterhouseCoopers. An average of 11 stores a day opened, while 16 a day closed. The data does not include independent shops. Our retail correspondent Sarah Butler writes: Fashion and footwear stores were the hardest hit in 2017, according to LDC, as shoppers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 freedom to spend on non-essentials was diminished by rising food price inflation, partly fuelled by the fall in the value of the pound after the vote for Brexit in 2016.

Other supermarkets Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Morrison\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are also up. Asos shares have fallen as much as 7% despite strong results, after the company upped its investment plans. Shopping mall operator Hammerson shares rose 1% initially on news of its rejection of a revised proposal from Kl\u00c3\u00a9pierre, but are now just 0.8% ahead. European stock markets have opened lower, as expected, with trade tensions simmering. FTSE 100 index in London down 0.27% at 7246.85 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax down 0.2% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC down 0.1% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB down 0.17% at 23,133 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex down 0.2% Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PSI down 0.2% Hammerson, which runs the Bullring shopping centre in Birmingham and Brent Cross in London, said this morning that it has rejected a sweetened \u00c2\u00a35bn bid from bigger French rival Kl\u00c3\u00a9pierre. The French shopping mall operator offered to pay 635p a share in a mix of Kl\u00c3\u00a9pierre shares and cash, up from its \u00c2\u00a34.9bn proposal on 8 March (615p a share). The French firm is trying to thwart Hammerson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned \u00c2\u00a33.4bn tie-up with Intu that would create Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest property company worth \u00c2\u00a321bn. Kl\u00c3\u00a9pierre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, Jan-Marc Jestin, made the revised proposal in a meeting with Hammerson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman David Tyler on Monday evening. But Hammerson said it was only a marginal increase. Tyler said: The board has considered the revised proposal from Kl\u00c3\u00a9pierre carefully. At 635p, it is only a 3% increase on the previous proposal and continues very significantly to undervalue the company.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest retailer Tesco has reported a 28% rise in operating profits, beating City expectations. Profits were boosted by better than expected sales in the last three months of its financial year. Online fashion retailer Asos, which targets shoppers in their 20s, has also reported strong numbers. Sales were up 27% in the first half and it expects similar growth in the second half. Chief executive Nick Beighton said the firm would step up investment in distribution and logistics. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, has issued a stark warning that the current system for world trade is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in danger of being torn apart\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with the potential to upset the present global economic upswing and make consumers poorer. She urged governments around the world to steer clear of protectionism or face negative consequences. Let us redouble our efforts to reduce trade barriers and resolve disagreements without using exceptional measures. You can read the full story here. Yesterday, stock markets in Europe and the US rallied after a speech by China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Xi Jinping eased fears of a trade war between Beijing and the US. European stock markets are expected to open lower this morning, as concerns remain. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, explains: For equity markets to regain a sense of equilibrium we need to start to see progress on the road away from a potential trade war, and currently there is no evidence of that whatsoever. The strange thing is that for all the warm words, and President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive response to them, is that what President Xi actually said wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much different to previous speeches he has made in the past, which means that eventually these words will need to be turned into actions. The easiest one to deliver is probably the reduction in tariffs on cars, but even that is likely to be difficult, particularly since further talks between the various parties aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually planned at the moment.

Rising prices have hit disposable income hard. Importantly, these ONS statistics reflect cash in purses and wallets, namely how people really feel about their spending and saving power on the ground.</p> <p>What they show is a marked deterioration that is unlikely to be offset by modest dips in inflation like the one we saw in February. </p> <p>Also weighing on people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minds will be house prices, which are not consistently keeping up with inflation.

                "bodyText":"It is time to close the blog for the day. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Thank you for all your comments and good-bye. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick summary of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main developments. Global stock markets are rising after Donald Trump toned down his threats of missile strikes in Syria. British Airways owner IAG is considering an offer for Norwegian Air. London house prices are falling at the fastest rate in nine years, according to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest mortgage lender Halifax. Banks and building societies in Britain have tightened criteria for granting credit cards and loans, leading to a fall in unsecured lending in the first quarter, according to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest credit conditions survey. Default rates have risen, however. In Europe, stock markets are also pushing higher. UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 flat Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax up 0.83% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC up 0.45% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB up 1.05% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex flat Wall Street has opened higher, on the back of expectations that lower US corporate taxes will boost company earnings alongside easing tensions over the Syria conflict. Dow Jones industrial average up 0.7% S&amp;P 500 up 0.55% Nasdaq up 0.6% Wall Street futures are edging higher, supported by expectations of strong corporate profits as the first-quarter earnings season gets under way and easing geopolitical tensions over Syria. Analysts are expecting quarterly profits at S&amp;P 500 companies to be 18.5% higher than a year ago, the biggest gain in seven years, according to a Thomson Reuters poll. And in his latest tweet Donald Trump toned down his threats of military action in Syria. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the west\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading economic think tank \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has called on governments to use inheritance tax to reduce wealth inequality. European stock markets have ventured into positive territory, as tensions eased in the Middle East. Donald Trump sent a new tweet, saying a military strike against Syria after a suspected chemical weapons attack on civilians \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could be very soon or not so soon at all\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 up 0.05% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax up 0.45% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC up 0.25% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB up 0.77% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex up 0.06% Here is our full story on IAG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential bid for low-cost carrier Norwegian. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets UK has had a closer look at Norwegian, which has undergone an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153explosive growth path\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the past few years - raising concerns that the airline might be overextending itself. In its most recent numbers Norwegian posted a bigger than expected net loss for the last three months of 2017 of $117m, down from a small profit a year before. Its rising costs in the form of new transatlantic routes has seen its costs rise quite sharply in recent years and expects to grow its capacity by 40% in 2018. Management plan to expand the fleet of operational aircraft to more than 190 planes by the end of 2019, from about 150 now, which when you consider the company only had 68 aircraft in 2012 is quite a sharp expansion. Its success in eating into the market share of its peers like Ryanair and Easyjet as well as forcing down prices on long haul routes has inevitably raised concerns that in a competitive market it could be getting ahead of itself. In a sign that it was having an effect in squeezing its competitors Ryanair CEO Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary, never one for holding back, claimed last September that Norwegian wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t survive the winter due to its ambitious expansion plans, and rising costs, prompting a withering response from Norwegian management that he was sore at losing his pilots to the rapidly expanding airline. We have seen in the past how over rapid expansion by accumulating too much debt can quickly get out of hand. Annual household savings in the UK have fallen to their lowest rate for a decade, according to the Office for National Statistics. The cash-based savings ratio fell to 0.9% in 2017, from 2.9% in 2016, the lowest it has been since 2008. There are different ways of measuring household savings. The latest national accounts saving ratio recorded an historic low of 4.9% in 2017, the ONS said. Charles Haresnape, chief executive of Gatehouse Bank, said: It is 2018 and yet, from a savings perspective, things are as bad in many respects as 2008. The fact that savings levels haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been this low since the global financial crisis exploded a decade ago is a worrying sign. Rising prices have hit disposable income hard. Importantly, these ONS statistics reflect cash in purses and wallets, namely how people really feel about their spending and saving power on the ground. What they show is a marked deterioration that is unlikely to be offset by modest dips in inflation like the one we saw in February. Also weighing on people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minds will be house prices, which are not consistently keeping up with inflation. So many homeowners, emboldened to borrow by healthy rises in recent years, are all too aware now that their house is not the piggy bank it used to be. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s limited wiggle room to save and fewer reasons to borrow. The Bank of England said this morning that the amount of unsecured credit available to households fell significantly in the first quarter, as lenders tightened their credit scoring criteria for granting credit cards and personal loans. Meanwhile the availability of mortgages was unchanged in the three months to mid March, and is not expected to change in the next three months to mid-June, according to lenders polled by the central bank. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit conditions survey also showed that demand for mortgages for house purchase has dropped significantly in the first quarter, although lenders expect a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153marked pick-up in demand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the second quarter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the traditional spring selling season. Consumers also borrowed less on credit cards between January and March but sought more personal loans. Lenders expect this to reverse in the next quarter, anticipating an increase in credit card lending alongside a fall in other unsecured lending. Lenders reported no change in demand for corporate lending from businesses of all sizes. Default rates on mortgages continued to fall between January and March for the fourth quarter in a row, but rose on unsecured lending such as credit cards and personal loans, with a further slight increase expected in the three months to June. Norwegian Air has told Reuters that it did not know of IAG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest until it saw the press reports on Thursday morning. The airline added that it has not held any discussions with IAG, and that the BA owner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest confirms the potential of Norwegian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business model and its growth prospects. In other takeover news, Disney will have to make bid to take full control of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest pay-TV broadcaster even if the competition regulator quashes Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a311.7bn for full control of Sky, the UK takeover panel has ruled. Our media business correspondent Mark Sweney writes: The owner of Walt Disney Studios has made a $66bn (\u00c2\u00a349bn) bid to take over 21st Century Fox, which owns a 39% stake in Sky, and is awaiting the outcome of the UK competition regulator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s verdict on whether to allow Murdoch to buy the 61% of Sky he does not already own. If the Competition and Markets Authority clears the bid and Disney is in turn allowed to complete its Fox deal, then Sky will come under the full ownership of the theme parks-to-films conglomerate. However, in December, Disney made a submission to the UK Takeover Panel, the city watchdog for corporate deals, saying that it did not wish to be forced to pursue a full takeover of Sky if Rupert Murdoch fails to take full control. Under rule 9.1 of the takeover code, companies are normally forced to make an offer if they buy a stake of 30% or more. Disney argued that owning Sky was not a major driver of its overall Fox deal - which includes buying Hollywood studio 20th Century Fox, the maker of films from X-Men to Deadpool - and so that rule should not apply. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The panel executive considers that securing control of Sky might reasonably be considered to be a significant purpose of Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s acquiring control of Fox,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the UK Takeover Panel said on Thursday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Following the acquisition by Disney of Fox, Disney will be required to make a mandatory offer to the holders of ordinary shares in Sky.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Takeover Panel said that if Disney is required to make a separate offer to take control of Sky then it will be at \u00c2\u00a310.75 a share, the same price that Rupert Murdoch has tabled and has been accepted by Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s directors. Analysts believe that Sky is undervalued - it is trading at \u00c2\u00a313 a share - and could be valued at up to \u00c2\u00a316 a share. The deal would greatly expand IAG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exposure to budget flying. Norwegian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have been suspended from trading on the Oslo stock exchange, after they soared as much as 28%. IAG, formed by the 2011 merger of Iberia and British Airways, bought Irish airline Aer Lingus in 2015 and Spanish budget carrier Vueling in 2013. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transport correspondent Gwyn Topham wrote this piece about Norwegian a year ago: In response, IAG said that it is considering an offer for the low-cost carrier and has acquired a 4.6% stake in Norwegian Air. It added in a statement to the London Stock Exchange that it has taken no decision to make an offer for Norwegian Air Shuttle at this time and that no discussions have taken place. Here is the statement: IAG considers Norwegian to be an attractive investment and has acquired a 4.61% ownership position in the airline (minority investment). The minority investment is intended to establish a position from which to initiate discussions with Norwegian, including the possibility of a full offer for Norwegian. IAG confirms that no such discussions have taken place to date, that it has taken no decision to make an offer at this time and that there is no certainty that any such decision will be made. British Airways owner IAG is considering a bid for Norwegian Air, Bloomberg is reporting. The news sent Norwegian shares soaring by more than a quarter. They are now 14.3% ahead while IAG shares are down 1.7%, after falling as much as 3.4%. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading firm IG, sums up the action so far on financial markets. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSteady but cautious\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is the best way to describe stock markets in Europe and the UK this morning. The British cabinet meets later to decide on military action, and the world is awaiting news of possible US strikes on Syria. As a result, it is hard to muster up the courage to keep chasing equities at present. Oil prices seem happy to consolidate around recent highs, awaiting further developments in the Syria situation. Fundamental news is going to have to do all the heavy lifting if the price is to rally further however \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the size and rapidity of the move from last summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows means that positioning is now all on the long side, with little sign of fresh money flowing in to drive the price higher. Ahead of the open, we expect the Dow to start at 24,205, 16 points higher from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. Theresa May has recalled ministers from their Easter break for a special cabinet meeting on how to respond to what she has described as a barbaric poison gas attack by Syrian government forces on civilians in Douma, east of the capital Damascus. Ministers will discuss whether to join the US and France in a possible military attack on Syria that would bring western and Russian forces into direct conflict for the first time in the seven-year-old civil war. Syria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main ally Russia said it had deployed military police in Douma on Thursday after the town was taken over by government forces. The RIA news agency quoted Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence ministry as saying: They are the guarantors of law and order in the region. Sterling is flat against the dollar at $1.4173 following its recent rally, to $1.4223 on Wednesday, as traders wait for more data that should help shape expectations of a Bank of England interest rate hike next month. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing and construction sectors posted surprise declines in February, pointing to an economic slowdown in the first quarter of this year. One of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading forecasting bodies, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, is predicting that GDP growth halved to 0.2% between January and March from 0.4% at the end of last year, while several City analysts are expecting an easing to 0.3% growth. Key UK data on inflation and the labour market will be released next week. European stock markets are broadly flat, as traders await more news on the conflict in Syria, and on the trade spat between the US and China. UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 down 0.06% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax down 0.06% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC down 0.06% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB up 0.27% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex up 0.02% Oil prices have eased slightly but remain high after Brent crude soared above $73 a barrel on Wednesday, the highest since late 2014. Brent is currently trading at $71.91 a barrel, while US crude is at $66.74 a barrel. Russian stocks and the rouble have recovered somewhat, after heavy sell-offs following the announcement of new US sanctions on Friday and despite rising tensions in the Middle East, with Donald Trump warning of missile strikes in Syria after a chemical attack. The rouble tumbled 2.5% to a two-year low of 65.06 against the dollar on Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweet on Wednesday, but has since stabilised and is now trading at 62.33, up 0.4%. Against the euro, the rouble gained 1% to 76.65 after touching 80.50 on Wednesday, a level last seen in March 2016. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance ministry put purchases of foreign currency for its reserves on hold this week to avoid extra pressure on the rouble. The dollar-denominated RTS stock market rose 2.3% while the rouble-based MOEX index was down 1.3%. House prices in London are falling at the fastest rate in nine years, according to a regional survey from Halifax, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest mortgage lender. Prices in the capital fell 3.2% in the first quarter of this year compared with the previous quarter, the sharpest decline since the depths of the financial crisis. London also recorded the sharpest fall in annual house prices since the start of 2011. Compared with the first quarter in 2017, property values declined by 3.8% following a 0.7% annual drop in the fourth quarter. The south east only saw a small annual increase in prices, of 0.3%, while the south west posted inflation of 1.9%. Elsewhere, prices grew strongly. The East Midlands and East Anglia recorded the strongest rates of annual price inflation, of 7.3% and 7.2% respectively, followed by Scotland at 6.7% and Yorkshire &amp; Humberside at 6.1%. Fellow British retailer Dunelm which sells bedding and kitchen equipment, has fared better. The homewares chain reported 4.6% growth in like-for-like sales in the third quarter, driven by a 36% surge in online sales. Its shares rose 8% on the news. In corporate news, Carpetright, the struggling UK carpet retailer, said it would seek approval from creditors for a restructuring plan to close 92 of its stores, with the likely loss of 300 jobs, and reduce rent at 113. It has 434 shops and concessions across Britain. The company also hopes to raise \u00c2\u00a360m from shareholders through a placing and open offer to reduce debts and fund its restructuring plan. It has issued a series of profit warnings in recent months, one of many highstreet retailers that are struggling as consumers are cautious about their spending. Carpetright will seek creditor approval at a meeting on 26 April for the company voluntary arrangement which will allow it to close shops and lower rents, before asking shareholders for their support on 30 April. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares plunged more than 16% in early trading. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property surveyors have issued the most downbeat assessment of the housing market for five years. The monthly survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) showed that in March demand from buyers fell for the 12th month in a row, new instructions from sellers declined for the seventh consecutive month, and prices were flat nationally. Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent has rejected the idea of a new super-committee charged with overseeing the economy and the financial system. He said merging the monetary and financial policy committees \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as proposed by some politicians \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would make decision-making too complicated and raise the risk of the kind of mistakes made before the financial crisis. In the text of a speech he was due to give via video link to a conference at Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank in Sydney, he argued for the separation of powers. Apart from anything else the policymaking process would be far too complicated to hold any one bit of it to account and the all-powerful policymaker would naturally tend to focus on the more verifiable tasks. A bit like the man who loses his keys in the park but looks for them under the streetlamp \u00e2\u20ac\u0153because that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where the light is\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the attention of policy would be directed to the most observable objectives. Perhaps we collectively fell foul of this trap, in some ways, ahead of the crisis. The risk of a rare event is not an easy thing to judge and, having gone so long without a serious problem in the financial system, our attention was distracted by the more easily monitored task of stabilising the economic cycle. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax, Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex and the FTSE 100 index in London are flat while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC has edged up 0.1%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Oil prices soared to their highest levels since December 2014, above $73 a barrel last night. Brent crude futures are at $72.30, still the highest in more than three years. Donald Trump declared on Wednesday that missiles \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will be coming\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Syria, taunting Russia for supporting Syrian president Bashar al-Assad after a suspected chemical attack in Douma near the Syrian capital. Both Damascus and Moscow have denied any responsibility. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments raised the prospect of direct conflict between the two world powers backing opposing sides for the first time in the seven-year-old civil war. Hidenori Suezawa, financial market analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities, told Reuters: Last year Russia and Syria did not shoot back against US missiles. But this time the scale of possible attacks by the US and possibly its allies seems larger if Russia fires back, the war front will be bigger. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think we are heading into World War III but should there be a direct collision between the US and Russia for the first time, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the sort of headline that would plunge stock prices. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said oil prices are also under pressure from developments in Saudia Arabia and Yemen. With nerves already frayed sentiment wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped by reports that Saudi Arabian defence systems had intercepted a number of missiles fired from Yemen, over the skies of Riyadh, which in turn saw oil prices hit their highest levels since December 2014 above $73. UK prime minister Theresa May insisted that the chemical weapons attack on Douma \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cannot go unchallenged\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She has not ruled out committing the UK to join a coordinated military intervention in Syria without consulting MPs. The Russian rouble steadied on Wednesday after two days of heavy losses amid mounting concerns over the Syrian conflict and new US sanctions. It closed down around 62.59 to the dollar, still down more than 7% so far this week. Stock futures are pointing to a flat or lower open in Europe. In Asia, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei edged down 0.2% while Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng lost 0.7%. On Wall Street, stocks also closed lower. The S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.55% while the Dow Jones lost 0.9%. Minutes of the US Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last meeting on 20-21 March released on Wednesday showed all of its policymakers thought the economy would improve further and that inflation would rise in coming months, suggesting a June rate hike remains on the table.

Jaguar Land Rover, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest carmaker, is to cut 1,000 contractor jobs in Solihull in the Midlands, after a fall in sales it attributed to uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote and the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s diesel policy. Here is our story: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major stock markets are all up as tensions between the US and Russia over Syria appear to have eased.

The latter faces a $1bn payment to settle regulatory investigations. Oil prices have edged higher and are on track for their biggest weekly gain since July. Brent crude in London is 0.3% higher at $72.22 a barrel while US crude is 0.2% ahead at $67.21 a barrel. Both have risen about $5 this week, in gains of about 8%. The pound is still trading 0.2% higher against the dollar at $1.460. Here is the statement from Jaguar: As is standard business practice, Jaguar Land Rover regularly reviews its production schedules to ensure market demand is balanced globally. On Monday we will be cascading our 18/19 production plans for the next fiscal year to our workforce. In light of the continuing headwinds impacting the car industry, we are making some adjustments to our production schedules and the level of agency staff. We are however continuing to recruit large numbers of highly skilled engineers, graduates and apprentices as we are over-proportionally invest in new products and technologies. We also remain committed to our UK plants in which we have invested more than \u00c2\u00a34bn since 2010 to future proof manufacturing technologies to deliver new models. We are not renewing TEMPORARY contracts of a number of agency staff at Solihull. Jaguar Land Rover has confirmed that it will cut 1,000 contractor jobs at its Solihull factory. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest carmaker blamed a fall in sales due uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote along with confusion over the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s diesel policy. Back to Jaguar Land Rover. ITV is reporting that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest carmaker will announce production cuts and 1,000 job losses on Monday, and blame Brexit. The company has told Reuters that it is making some adjustments to its production schedules and the level of agency staff. It added that it would unveil its 2018-19 production plans to its workforce on Monday. Jaguar also said that it regularly reviews its production schedules. Wells Fargo faces a $1bn fine to settle outstanding regulatory investigations related to car insurance and mortgage lending abuses, the bank said. This means it may have to revise its quarterly results to reflect the final settlement. Over in the US, Citigroup has reported a 13% increase in quarterly profits, fuelled by lower taxes and higher revenues from consumer banking. The fourth-biggest American bank by assets said net income rose to $4.6bn in the first quarter to 31 March, compared with $4.1bn a year earlier. Earnings per share climbed to $1.68 from $1.35. Analysts had expected $1.61. Wells Fargo, another US bank, posted a 6% rise in first-quarter profits to $5.5bn. Earlier today, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank JPMorgan reported a 35% jump in profits. US companies have benefited from the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate tax cuts. In January, Jaguar said it would temporarily scale back production at its factory in Halewood near Liverpool in the second quarter. The factory builds three Range Rover models and employs around 6,000 people. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest car manufacturer blamed faltering sales after the Brexit vote and a tax crackdown on diesel vehicles. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story at the time Breaking news: Joel Hills at ITV is tweeting that Jaguar Land Rover will cut production and around 1,000 jobs after a slump in sales. The company is expected to blame Brexit and the slump in demand for diesel vehicles. Meanwhile, in Italy, the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-largest economy, talks to form a government are still deadlocked. President Sergio Mattarella has declared that there has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no progress\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after a second round of talks with political parties. JPMorgan Chase, the biggest US bank by assets, has kicked off the US bank reporting season with strong figures. It has posted a 35% jump in first-quarter profits, boosted by higher interest rates on loans and lower taxes. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net income rose to $8.7bn or $2.37 a share, in the three months to March from $6.5bn, or $1.65 a share, a year earlier. Analysts had pencilled in $2.28 a share. Further detail on the comments made by Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov at a press conference this morning, courtesy of Reuters. He said he hoped there would be no repeat of the experience of Libya and Iraq in the Syria conflict, in a veiled warning to US president Donald Trump. God forbid anything adventurous will be done in Syria following the Libyan and Iraqi experience. He said even the smallest miscalculation in Syria could lead to new waves of migrants and that ultimatums and threats do not help the dialogue. More reassuringly, he said Russia and the US are using their channels of communications on Syria. European stock markets have taken the comments in their stride and are still trading higher, with the exception of the FTSE 100 in London, which remains flat partly due to the strengthening pound. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up 0.67% while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC is 0.3% higher. On a lighter note, the appointment of Goldman Sachs banker David Schwimmer as the new chief executive of the London Stock Exchange has prompted a lot of Friends jokes. There are some snaps on Reuters quoting the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov as saying that the atmosphere around Syria is very alarming, and that ultimatums and threats do not help the dialogue. He also said that the channels of communication with the US are being used. Gold prices are up for a second week as concerns over the conflict in Syria remain. While Donald Trump has back-pedalled on the threat of US missile strikes in Syria following last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chemical attack on civilians, the situation with Syria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main ally Russia remains tense. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich said international relations should not depend on the mood of one person when he wakes up in the morning. More on our politics blog. Gold is seen as a safe haven investment. Spot gold is trading 0.4% higher at $1,340.79 an ounce. And here are Mahony\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thoughts on China moving to trade deficit in March for the first time in a year. Chinese trade data has been the big focus for markets after the biggest economy in Asia posted its first dollar-denominated trade deficit in a year. A sizeable downward shift in Chinese exports will certainly provide heightened anxiety over where we go from here, with the threat of a trade war looming large over an economy which is still heavily reliant upon international demand for their products. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at at online trading firm IG, has taken a closer look at the UK stock market and the pound. Sterling has hit 10-week highs against the dollar and 11-week highs against the euro, partly related to diverging interest rate expectations for the UK and the eurozone. The Bank of England is widely expected to raise interest rates next month. The FTSE has continued to underperform its peers this morning, with the index trading in the red despite gains across German, Spanish and French indices. Dovish minutes from the European Central Bank yesterday, coupled with a wider story of dollar weakness has ensured the pound continues to outperform against its main peers. With the pound hitting a two-month high against the dollar and ten-month high against the euro, it comes as no surprise that the internationally focused FTSE 100 suffers, while the domestically focused FTSE 250 joins its European counterparts in the green. In other data just out, the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus increased to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac21bn in February from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20.2bn in January. Exports in the 19 countries sharing the euro declined by 2.3% but imports fell more, by 3.1%, month on month, according to the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics office Eurostat. The euro is broadly unchanged versus the dollar after final German inflation figures met economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations. In March, German inflation rose to a 1.6% annual rate from 1.4%. Spanish inflation also increased, to a four-month high of 1.2%, as did French CPI, which was released yesterday. It was confirmed at a 5 1/2 year high of 1.7% in March. Madden says: The rise in the cost of living in major eurozone countries points to an increase in demand, which is good for economic growth. David Maddden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: Stocks are mixed this morning with traders cautious about being overly long going into the weekend. President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rhetoric in relation to Syria has dialled down and this has removed some of the fear in the market, but as the situation is yet to be resolved, investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t particularly optimistic. We are expecting the Dow Jones to open up 22 points at 24,505 and we are calling the S&amp;P 500 flat at 2664. Oil prices are now heading higher again and are on course for their biggest weekly gain since July. Brent crude in London is up 0.7% at $72.53 a barrel, taking its gain this week to around 8%. US crude is also trading 0.7% higher, at $67.53 a barrel, and is up nearly 9% this week. European stock markets are rising, with the exception of the FTSE 100 in London, which is flat at 7,252. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax up 0.4% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC up 0.2% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB up 0.15% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex up 0.37% On currency markets, sterling has extended gains, rising nearly 0.5% above $1.4292 to 10-week highs. The dollar, for its part, has touched a six-week high against the yen as fears over an imminent US strike in Syria faded and investors anticipated strong US corporate earnings. Banks JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo will report first-quarter results before Wall Street opens today. The dollar rose 0.3% to 107.620 yen, its highest level since late February. Paul Donovan, global chief economist at UBS Wealth Management, has sent us his thoughts on trade. US president Trump suggested that there may not, in fact, be any new tariffs imposed in the Sino-US trade dispute, and that the US might apply to join the TPP. Markets have given cautious welcome to this news. Welcome, because avoiding a trade war is a clear economic positive. Cautious, because market trust in US presidential announcements is, perhaps, a little limited. Re-joining the TPP could be construed as anti-Chinese. The TPP is a preferential trade deal, meaning that those outside the deal are at a competitive disadvantage to those inside the deal. On the Sino-US trade dispute, the US does seem to be pushing hard for a tweetable \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we won\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd moment. The substance of any deal seems less important. Donovan noted that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus turned into a deficit in March but said this is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seasonal and temporary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The eurozone will be publishing its trade figures for February soon. The London Stock Exchange has picked Goldman Sachs banker David Schwimmer as its new chief executive, succeeding Xavier Rolet, who was forced out in November. The 49-year-old American is due to start at the LSE on 1 August after a 20-year career with the US investment bank, most recently as global head of market structure and global head of metals and mining in the investment banking division. He has also served as chief of staff to Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein, then chief operating officer. Schwimmer will be paid an annual salary of \u00c2\u00a3775,000 plus a potential bonus of 225% of salary, pro-rated for 2018 as he joins half way through the year. The size of bonus depends on the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial performance. He will also bank a one-off payment of \u00c2\u00a31.05m to compensate for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forfeiture of cash compensation for 2018 from his previous employer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c dubbed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153golden hello\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Schwimmer is also entitled to a 2018 long-term incentive plan grant of 300% of salary, which will vest based on performance over a three-year period. In addition, he will get a cash allowance of 15% of salary instead of pension and standard UK benefits, as well relocation support including housing allowance. Frenchman Xavier Rolet stood down as LSE boss in November 2017 after reported boardroom clashes over his management style. LSE chairman Donald Brydon said about Schwimmer: He is well known for his robust intellect and partnership approach with clients and colleagues alike. David Warren, who has been the LSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interim chief executive, will stay on as finance chief. Rolet was chief executive for more than eight years, when the LSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market value soared from \u00c2\u00a3800bn to almost \u00c2\u00a315bn. However, the company suffered a severe setback when the planned \u00c2\u00a321bn merger with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse was blocked by the European Commission in March 2017. It was the third botched attempt at a tie-up between the two stock exchange operators. Trading is lacklustre this morning on European stock markets, but they are near one-month highs. The Stoxx 600 index is on track for its third consecutive week of gains, its longest winning streak since January. Most of the first-quarter results released by European companies were positive. However British software firm Sage saw its shares plunge 19% after it cut its full-year revenue outlook. It is leading losses on the FTSE 100 index in London. British aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce is another big faller on the Footsie, with the shares down nearly 2%. It said it needs to ramp up inspections on its problematic Trent 1000 engines, leading to extra disruption for customers and additional costs. The company is in a the middle of a restructuring led by chief executive Warren East, but its turnaround has been held back by problems with some turbine blades that have worn out faster than expected. The company said it had decided to increase the number of inspections after coming across a new problem with the compressor on Trent 1000 engines, which are installed on Boeing 787s. East said: We sincerely regret the disruption this will cause to our customers. Our team of technical experts and service engineers is working around the clock to ensure we return them to full service as soon as possible. We will be working closely with Boeing and affected airlines to minimise disruption wherever possible. The FTSE 100 index is slightly negative, trading down some 6 points at 7251.70, while the FTSE 250 is also down, by 0.2%, or 41 points to 19732.13. Shopping centre operator Hammerson is the biggest faller on the FTSE 250 index after bigger French rival Kl\u00c3\u00a9pierre abandoned attempts to buy the company behind Birmingham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bullring and Brent Cross in London. Hammerson shares are down 12.7% at 454.1p, while Kl\u00c3\u00a9pierre rose 4.3%. Two days ago, Hammerson rejected a revised 635p-a-share proposal from Kl\u00c3\u00a9pierre, up from its initial offer of 615p a share, to be paid in cash and shares \u00e2\u20ac\u201c valuing the company at around \u00c2\u00a35bn. But Hammerson said the new proposal was only 3% higher and still undervalued its business. The French company said it was walking away because Hammerson failed to provide \u00e2\u20ac\u0153meaningful engagement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after the sweetened proposal this week. The board of Hammerson did not provide any meaningful engagement with respect to the increased proposal and, after careful consideration, Kl\u00c3\u00a9pierre has concluded that it does not intend to make an offer for Hammerson. This means Hammerson can push ahead with its planned \u00c2\u00a33.4bn acquisition of smaller UK rival Intu to create Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest property company worth \u00c2\u00a321bn. Intu owns the Trafford centre in Manchester. But what do shareholders think? Oil prices are slipping after Trump toned down his threat of missile strikes in Syria on Thursday. Brent crude in London is down 0.2% at $71.89 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but is up 7% this week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while US crude has edged down 0.15% at $66.92 a barrel. Both benchmarks have risen about $5 this week, putting them on track for the biggest weekly gains since July. They hit their highest level since late 2014 on Wednesday after Trump warned \u00e2\u20ac\u0153missiles will be coming\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Syria after a chemical attack on civilians and Saudi Arabia said it intercepted missiles from Yemen over Riyadh. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. As tensions over Syria ease, trade is back in focus today. US president Donald Trump has held out the prospect of rejoining the Trans Pacific Partnership, a multinational trade pact his government walked away from last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but only if it offered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantially better\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd terms than those provided in previous negotiations. His comments on Twitter came just hours after he told Republican senators that he had asked US trade representative Robert Lighthizer and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow to re-open negotiations. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments were greeted with caution in the Asia-Pacific region. Japanese finance minister Taro Aso told reporters after a cabinet meeting, before Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweet: If it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true, I would welcome it. He added that Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is a person who could change temperamentally, so he may say something different the next day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. New Zealand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister Jacinda Ardern also expressed some scepticism. If the United States, it turns out, do genuinely wish to rejoin, that triggers a whole new process. The TPP, which has 11 members, was set up to lower trade barriers in the Asia-Pacific region and to counter China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing clout. Trump pulled the US out of the pact in early 2017, citing concerns about US jobs. The news came as new data showed China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exports unexpectedly fell in March, the first drop since February 2017. The country ran up a rare trade deficit of $4.98bn for the month, also the first since February last year. Chinese exports dropped 2.7% last month from a year earlier while imports grew 14.4%, more than expected, according to customs data. Analysts had been expecting a surplus of $27.2bn, following February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surplus of $33.75bn. The export outlook has been clouded by an escalating trade dispute with the US. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus with the US fell to $15.3bn in March from $21bn in February. In the first quarter, its trade surplus with the US rose 19.4% from a year earlier to $58.25bn. US bank earnings will also be in focus today, with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo reporting first-quarter results.

The argument was that a bit of competition would do economics good.</p> <p>If the latest edition of the magazine Prospect is anything to go by, a debate is now well under way. Howard Reed, an economist who has worked for two of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading thinktanks, the Institute for Public Policy Research and the Institute for Fiscal Studies, <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/the-case-for-a-new-economics\">says the malaise is so serious </a>that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deconomics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is needed that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153decontaminates the discipline, deconstructs its theoretical heart, and rebuilds from first principles\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>Reed says a retooled economics would have four features. Firstly, recognition that there is no such thing as a value-free analysis of the economy. Neo-classical economics purports to be clean and pure but uses a cloak of ethical neutrality to make an an individualistic ethos the norm.</p> <p>Secondly, he says too much economics is about how humans ought to behave rather than how they actually behave. Thirdly, economics needs to focus on the good life rather than on those areas most susceptible to analysis through 19th century linear mathematics. Finally, he calls for a more pluralistic approach. Economics should be learning from other disciplines rather than colonising them.</p> <p>Prospect gave Diane Coyle, a Cambridge University economics professor, <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/dianecoyle\">the right to reply</a> to Reed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s piece and she does so with relish, calling it lamentable, a caricature and an ill-informed diatribe.</p> <p>Most modern economics involves empirical testing, Coyle says, often using new sources of data. She rejects the idea that the profession is stuck in an ivory tower fiddling around with abstruse mathematics while ignoring the real world. Rather, it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153addressing questions of immediate importance and relevance to policymakers, citizens and businesses\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>Nor is it true that the discipline requires that people be rational, calculating automatons. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It very often has people interacting with each other rather than acting as atomistic individuals, despite Reed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s charge.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd <br></p> <p>Coyle accepts that macro-economics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the big picture stuff that involves looking at the economy in the round \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is in a troubled state but says this is actually only a minority field.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The point that there are many economists doing interesting things in areas such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/09/what-is-behavioural-economics-richard-thaler-nobel-prize\">behavioural economics</a> is a fair one, but Coyle is on shakier ground when she skates over the problems in macro-economics.</p> <p>It was after all, macro-economists \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the people working at the International Monetary Fund, the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that the public relied on to get things right a decade ago.

Instead, they turned, if only fleetingly, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/11/keynesian-economics-is-it-time-for-the-theory-to-rise-from-the-dead\">Keynes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general theory</a>, which told them it would not be wise to wait for market forces to do their work. <br></p> <p>Reed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s argument is not just that blind faith in neo-classical economics led to the crisis. Nor is it simply that the systemic failure of 2008 means there is a need for a root-and-branch rethink. It is also that mainstream economics has been serving the interests of the political right.</p> <p>Some in the profession, particularly those who see themselves as progressives, appear to have trouble with this idea. That perhaps explains why they have been so rattled by even the teeniest bit of criticism. <br></p>",

Howard Reed, an economist who has worked for two of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading thinktanks, the Institute for Public Policy Research and the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says the malaise is so serious that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deconomics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is needed that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153decontaminates the discipline, deconstructs its theoretical heart, and rebuilds from first principles\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Reed says a retooled economics would have four features. Firstly, recognition that there is no such thing as a value-free analysis of the economy. Neo-classical economics purports to be clean and pure but uses a cloak of ethical neutrality to make an an individualistic ethos the norm. Secondly, he says too much economics is about how humans ought to behave rather than how they actually behave. Thirdly, economics needs to focus on the good life rather than on those areas most susceptible to analysis through 19th century linear mathematics. Finally, he calls for a more pluralistic approach. Economics should be learning from other disciplines rather than colonising them. Prospect gave Diane Coyle, a Cambridge University economics professor, the right to reply to Reed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s piece and she does so with relish, calling it lamentable, a caricature and an ill-informed diatribe. Most modern economics involves empirical testing, Coyle says, often using new sources of data. She rejects the idea that the profession is stuck in an ivory tower fiddling around with abstruse mathematics while ignoring the real world. Rather, it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153addressing questions of immediate importance and relevance to policymakers, citizens and businesses\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Nor is it true that the discipline requires that people be rational, calculating automatons. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It very often has people interacting with each other rather than acting as atomistic individuals, despite Reed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s charge.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Coyle accepts that macro-economics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the big picture stuff that involves looking at the economy in the round \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is in a troubled state but says this is actually only a minority field. The point that there are many economists doing interesting things in areas such as behavioural economics is a fair one, but Coyle is on shakier ground when she skates over the problems in macro-economics. It was after all, macro-economists \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the people working at the International Monetary Fund, the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that the public relied on to get things right a decade ago. All were blind to what was going on, and that had quite a lot to do with their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153markets tend to know best\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd belief system. Policy makers did not find the works of Hayek and Friedman particularly useful when a second great depression was looming. Instead, they turned, if only fleetingly, to Keynes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general theory, which told them it would not be wise to wait for market forces to do their work. Reed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s argument is not just that blind faith in neo-classical economics led to the crisis. Nor is it simply that the systemic failure of 2008 means there is a need for a root-and-branch rethink. It is also that mainstream economics has been serving the interests of the political right. Some in the profession, particularly those who see themselves as progressives, appear to have trouble with this idea. That perhaps explains why they have been so rattled by even the teeniest bit of criticism.",

The Nikkei in Tokyo closed 0.26% higher while Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng was 1.7% lower.</p> \n  <p><strong>There is relief that western missile strikes on Syria on Friday did not prompt a response from Russia, Syria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main ally, although traders will be watching cautiously for any signs of escalation of the conflict.</strong></p> \n  <p>Oil prices are slipping, with Brent crude in London down 1% to $71.83 a barrel while US crude is 0.9% lower at $66.79 a barrel.</p> \n  <p>Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One of the main concerns last week was around the extent of the response by the US backed coalition on president Assad of Syria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forces and any Russian reaction to it. The firing of over 100 cruise missiles over the weekend on various targets, with little in the way of casualties, appears to be tempered with relief that while it may reduce the risk of an escalation in the short term, it in no way means that we might not get a counter response further down the line. As such markets here in Europe look set to open cautiously higher this morning after shares traded slightly firmer in Asia.</p> \n   <p>The US also appears to be complementing its military approach by focusing on the additional sanctions route, after UN ambassador Nikki Haley announced that further sanctions were being discussed on Russian companies who have dealings with Assad and the use of chemical weapons, with details likely to be announced by US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin later today.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Geopolitical developments and corporate earnings remain the main focus, in the absence of major economic news apart from US retail sales data for March, out at 13:30 BST. </p> \n  <p>In the UK, we will get the latest labour market stats tomorrow, followed by inflation on Wednesday and retail sales on Thursday, but today the calendar is barren.

                "bodyText":"Wall Street has opened higher, as fears of an escalating conflict in Syria faded. Dow Jones up 0.5% S&amp;P 500 up 0.5% Nasdaq up 0.66% However, European stock markets have slipped after starting the day in positive territory. The FTSE 100 index in London has fallen more, dragged down again by the stronger pound. Sterling is trading 0.57% higher at $1.4323, the highest since 25 January, and the second-highest level since the Brexit vote. UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index down 0.8% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax down 0.15% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC down 0.09% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB down 0.05% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex down 0.03% Oil prices are falling today. Brent crude in London has lost 1.3% to $71.64 a barrel while US crude is down 1.4% at $66.43 a barrel. With this, we are closing the blog. Thank you for reading and for your great comments. We will be back tomorrow. Since Trump became president in January 2017, the dollar has weakened substantially against most major currencies, including China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yuan and, until the US sanctions against Russia in the last few weeks, the rouble. Against the yuan, the dollar has fallen 8.6% since 20 January 2017, Reuters data show. It has risen 4.5% against the rouble, although it was down 4% against the Russian currency until new US sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs were announced 1 1/2 weeks ago. The US dollar index which measures its value against a basket of major trading partner currencies has lost 11.2% since Trump took office. Back to currencies. US president Donald Trump has tweeted In Greece, the central government ran up a primary budget surplus of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.3bn in the first three months of the year, beating its target, Reuters reports. According to finance ministry data, the surplus was boosted by higher tax revenues. The government was targeting a primary budget surplus, which excludes debt servicing costs, of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.09bn. The central government surplus excludes the budgets of social security organisations and local administration. It is not the measure monitored by Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU and IMF lenders but is a good health indicator of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances. While the pound is still up nearly half a percent against the dollar, Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rouble has stabilised following a steep drop earlier in the day. The dollar now buys 62.33 units of the Russian currency, compared with 63.15 in early London trading. Last week, the rouble weakened beyond 65 against the dollar for the first time since late 2016 after new US sanctions against a number of Russian oligarchs and officials. More sanctions are looming today, in retaliation for Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support for the Syrian regime which is thought to be bhind the chemical weapons attack in Ghouta two weeks ago. Over in the US, retail sales bounced back in March after three months of falling sales, with households buying cars and other big-ticket items. The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.6% last month from the previous month, following declines of 0.1% and 0.2% in February and January respectively. Sales were up 4.5% from a year earlier. Excluding cars, petrol, building materials and food services, which can be volatile, retail sales rose 0.4% compared with an unchanged reading in February. Economists have blamed the weakness in consumer spending at the start of the year on delays in processing tax refunds, which have held back households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 spending power. Bookmaker Betway has suspended betting on the next governor of the Bank of England after a flurry of bets on Andrew Bailey. The next governor, who will succeed Mark Carney in June 2019, is expected to be announced towards the end of the year. Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority had been relatively unfancied at 9/1, but the online bookie received a sudden influx of bets on him succeeding Carney and has suspended betting as a result. Bailey had been tipped by City economists as the most likely candidate to succeed Carney. Betway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alan Alger said: There had been some speculation that Andrew Bailey was a leading candidate to replace Mark Carney as the new Governor of the Bank of England and in the last few days we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen huge support for him taking the role. The current Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority was available at 9/1, but as a result of the weight of support towards him, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had no choice but to suspend the market. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Xi Jinping has said rising protectionism adds risks and uncertainty to the world economy, according to state media. His comments were made to Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum. Xi also said it was necessary for both sides to strengthen cooperation and work together to find new driving forces for global economic growth. Sterling has climbed above $1.43 for the first time since 25 January, and only the second time since the Brexit vote in June 2016. The pound climbed as high as $1.4318, up 0.54%, as technical meetings between UK and EU negotiators got under way in Brussels, followed by talks over the Irish border issue on Wednesday. Brian Martin, head of global economics at ANZ, said there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong vested interest on both sides to agree on a workable trade deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, Jane Foley, senior currencies strategist at Rabobank, cautioned that hopes that a trade deal can be hammered out by October 2018 may be too ambitious, with the north Ireland border remaining a particular area of concern. Markets also have their eyes on key UK labour market, inflation and retail sales data in coming days. The Bank of England is widely expected to raise interest rates next month but if there are further signs of an economic slowdown, a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dovish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rate hike would put pressure on sterling, analysts say. Octavio Marenzi, CEO of capital markets management at consultancy Opimas, has sent us his thoughts on Bank of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first-quarter results. We are seeing a very favorable environment for banking currently and Bank of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings reflect this. Overall, BofA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results are good, and pushed RoE [return on equity] above 10%, even if they are not as strong as arch-rival JPMorgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Consumer Banking and Wealth Management registered solid, sustainable growth in revenues. However, investment banking fees pulled Global Banking into slightly negative territory. BofA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results in fixed-income trading were not as strong as we expected and declined compared to Q1 last year, but handily beat the last quarter of 2017. EU foreign ministers have threatened to impose new economic sanctions on Syria over the recent chemical attack on civilians in Ghouta near Damascus, but held off from joining anticipated new US sanctions against Russia. The 28 foreign ministers said in a joint statement after talks in Luxembourg: The European Union will continue to consider further restrictive measures against Syria as long as the repression continues. In the US, the bank earnings season continues. Bank of America has reported a 34% rise in first-quarter profit after the lender benefited from higher interest rates. The second-biggest US bank by assets said net income rose to a record $6.5bn in the three months to March from $4.5bn a year earlier. Earnings per share climbed to 62 cents from 45 cents. Wall Street analysts had expected 59 cents per share. Total revenues rose 4% to $23.3bn. Consumer banking, Bank of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest business, posted 9% growth in revenues to $9bn. It relies heavily on higher interest rates to maximise profits because it has a large amount of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities. Chief executive Brian Moynihan said: Strong client activity, coupled with a growing global economy and solid US consumer activity, led to record quarterly earnings. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank JPMorgan Chase and Citi also reported strong earnings on Friday. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, has looked at the Footsie. The FTSE was dealing with duel pressures this Monday, both in its commodity sector losses and the success of sterling. While the rest of the markets held strong, the FTSE dropped 35 points to send it towards a one week low. Part of that decline is being informed by the chunky drop suffered by BP and Shell, which slipped 1.5% and 0.8% respectively. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because Brent Crude itself fell 1.2%, the black stuff in retreat in response following the contrast between the actually military engagement seen in Syria over the weekend and the supply-worrying rhetoric used by Trump last week. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the only thing upsetting the FTSE \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the index also had to deal with the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest increase. Against the dollar sterling shot up half a percent, sending cable above $1.43 to its highest price in almost a year and a half. The currency was less robust against the euro, and even then it lifted it towards a fresh 11 month peak. Turning to this afternoon and the US open may inject a bit more positivity into a fairly stagnant session. The Dow Jones is expected to surge 150 points after the bell, a move that would lift the index back above 24500. As for data, the focus will be on retail sales, with analysts expecting a rise from -0.1% to 0.4% month-on-month. Stock markets have got off to a (cautiously) positive start to the week despite air strikes carried out by the US, UK and France in Syria over the weekend, in response to a chemical weapons attack a couple of weeks ago. The missile strikes had been well-flagged and Russia did not retaliate. UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index down 0.41% at 7234.83 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax up 0.18% at 12,465.78 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC flat at 5315.57 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB up 0.22% at 23,382.52 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex up 0.16% at 9782.50 Oil prices are falling. Brent crude in London has lost nearly $1 to $71.63 while US crude is down 86 cents at $66.53 a barrel. Spot gold has steadied at 1,344.38 an ounce, down 0.1%, after hitting an earlier peak of $1,348.69. The dollar continues to weaken, while sterling is strengthening ahead of key economic data this week. Russian stocks are falling ahead of likely new US sanctions. The rouble-dominated RTS index has slipped 0.4% while the rouble-based MOEX index is down 0.6%. The US is due to announce new economic sanctions against Russia today aimed at companies that are believed to be involved in equipment linked to chemical weapons, according to Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations. The EU has already imposed a range of economic sanctions on the Assad regime, cutting off most diplomatic and economic sanctions, but with very limited impact. Russia is Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest energy supplier. While the EU imposed sanctions against Moscow over the crisis in Ukraine, it is cautious about new punitive measures. It appears unlikely that the European Union will join the US in imposing new sanctions on Russia or Syria over the chemical weapons attack that prompted the first co-ordinated western air strikes in Syria at the weekend. EU foreign ministers are putting the emphasis on diplomacy at a meeting in Luxembourg. Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok, who met his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Moscow on Friday, told reporters as he arrived at the meeting today: We have to keep pushing to get a ceasefire and humanitarian aid through the [UN] Security Council and eventually a peace process. The only solution is a peace process through the Security Council. British foreign secretary Boris Johnson told reporters: It is very important to stress [the strikes are] not an attempt to change the tide of the war in Syria or to have a regime change. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid the Syrian war will go on its horrible, miserable way. But it was the world saying that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had enough of the use of chemical weapons. Sterling has touched an intra-day high of $1.4304 against the dollar, up 0.5%, the highest level since 25 January. Stock market futures are still suggesting a higher open on Wall Street, with the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 seen opening 0.6% while the Nasdaq is expected to rise 0.7%. The EU has called on Russia and Iran to use their influence on the Syrian government to prevent it from using chemical weapons again. The EU said in comments released to a meeting of the global chemical weapons watchdog, seen by Reuters: The EU calls upon all countries, notably Russia and Iran, to use their influence to prevent any further use of chemical weapons, notably by the Syrian regime. And here is our story on Wetherspoon closing all its social media accounts, a move that has been met with scepticism. Matthew Weaver writes: The pub chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision was reportedly in response to the trolling of some MPs, but many commentators suspected it was a publicity stunt by the chairman, Tim Martin. Commercial real estate agency and consultancy Colliers International says 15 major UK retailers or restaurant groups have gone into CVA (company voluntary arrangement) or administration in the past 12 months. Colliers has calculated that around 12,000 jobs have been lost or are on the line. The most recent business failure was Conviviality, the company behind Bargain Booze and Wine Rack. We wonder how many more retailers are going to get into trouble or people lose their jobs before someone decides to tackle the problem properly. John Webb, head of business rates at Colliers, says: These figures are as bad, if not worse than the crash of 2008/9 when 16 companies went into administration- 12 in 2008 and 4 in 2009- and we are only in April now. Data from Visa card released overnight shows a steep fall in consumers on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high streets in March. The number of people visiting UK shops dropped 6% compared with the same month last year, the biggest fall in shopper numbers since the end of 2010. UK pub chain JD Wetherspoon is shutting all its social media accounts in protest against the mis-use of personal data and the failure to tackle online bullying. Wetherspoon said it was closing Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts for its head office and almost 900 pubs in Britain and Ireland. Mark Zuckerberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Facebook is under huge pressure after it emerged that the personal information of millions of users was gathered by Cambridge Analytica, the data analytics firm that worked with Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election team and the winning Brexit campaign. Zuckerberg has admitted that the data breach included his own Facebook profile. Social media platforms have also been criticised for doing too little to crack down on bullying and hate speech. Wetherspoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman and founder Tim Martin said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s becoming increasingly obvious that people spend too much time on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, and struggle to control the compulsion. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that closing these accounts will affect our business whatsoever, and this is the overwhelming view of our pub managers. Martin has also been vocal in his support of Brexit. Last year Wetherspoon was forced to issue a denial after a spoof Twitter account falsely claimed the company did not allow staff to wear poppies at work to commemorate fallen service men and women. Sterling has fared better than the dollar. The pound is up 0.28% to $1.4276, continuing a two-week rally against the dollar that saw it push towards a new post-Brexit referendum high on Friday. Against the euro, sterling has slipped 0.1% to 86.49p but remains at its highest level since late May 2017. Key economic data on British unemployment, wages, inflation and retail sales are due this week. Markets expect the Bank of England to hike interest rates by a quarter point next month. Marc Ostwald, global strategist at ADM Investor Services International in London, said: With markets almost fully discounting a BOE rate hike, this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s run of monthly indicators are anticipated to give the hike a green light. Japan and China agree that a trade war will have serious consequences for the world economy, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign minister Taro Kono has said today following high-level talks between the two countries. Kono told reporters after the first such dialogue in nearly eight years, according to Reuters: We have shared understanding that a trade war, no matter which country has brought it about, would have a very large impact on the prosperity of the international economy. There are fears that a trade row between China and the US could escalate, with the two nations threatening each other with higher tariffs. On currency markets, the dollar is struggling. It is flat against a broad basket of major currencies but has weakened 0.3% so far this month, and lost 2.5% since the start of the year. The euro is steady, trading at around $1.23. Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit Agricole, told Reuters: The military strikes were well telegraphed and we are seeing a continuation in the broad market theme from lat week of a weaker dollar and favourable conditions for risk taking. European stock markets have given up some of their earlier gains. FTSE 100 index down 0.14% at 7254.60 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax up 0.12% at 12,457.13 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC up 0.03% at 5316.83 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB up 0.17% at 23,369.72 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex up 0.19% at 9785.50 The rouble and Russian stocks are heading lower, dragged down by the threat of new US sanctions and falling oil prices. Washington said on Sunday it would impose further sanctions against Russia on Monday over Moscow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support for Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Details are expected later today. The rouble has lost 0.3% against the dollar to 62.24 and 0.4% against the euro to 76.85 Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dollar-denominated RTS index has fallen 0.66% while the rouble-based MOEX Russian index is down 0.35%. Oil prices have extended their losses, with Brent crude in London down more than $1 a barrel at $71.51, a 1.5% fall. Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sale of its oncology business includes leukaemia therapy Oncaspar, the rights to pancreatic cancer treatment Onyvyde outside the US and other drugs in development. Jefferies analysts Peter Welford, David Steinberg and Lucy Codrington believe the deal will boost Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiating position in any talks with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest drugmaker Takeda, which has disclosed that it is considering a bid. We see the possible strategic fit given the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus therapeutic areas of oncology, gastrointestinal and neuroscience, with Shire bolstering the latter two franchises. Furthermore, Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading global position in rare diseases would likely be attractive for most large pharma/biotech, particularly given the long duration assets in immunoglobulin and enzyme replacement therapy Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current market value is around $37bn, down 6% since disclosing its interest in Shire, against the London-listed company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $47bn. The Jefferies analysts say: Hence, we presume Takeda would need a significant equity raise to acquire Shire, suggesting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153merger\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is perhaps better terminology, which may raise hurdles to the successful completion of any future deal. Analysts are cautious about whether WPP will be broken up, now that Sorrell is gone. Citi analysts Thomas Singlehurst and Catherine O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill reckon the main question is whether a new WPP chief executive goes for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quick fix\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or sticks with the existing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slow fix\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In the last year, WPP has been seen by many to be losing its way. Against the backdrop of an improving macro environment, organic growth has been slowing. In practice this slowdown has been happening for years and has a multitude of explanatory factors. Anyone coming in to take over the CEO role at WPP will be entirely focused on turning this round. The debate is now whether a new CEO goes for a Quick Fix vs. (the existing) Slow Fix. Paul Richards, media analyst at Numis, says Sorrell will be hard to replace with one person. The succession has led to questions over the size and scope of WPP and we can see a change of management accelerating the current process of reducing overlap and increasing flexibility. Richards views Sorrell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tragic end to a remarkable career which saw the creation of WPP as a global leader in marcoms [marketing communications]\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. WPP has bought other holding companies (Y&amp;R, Grey, Cordiant) as well as agencies and accordingly has grown to employ over 200,000 people in 400 businesses across 3,000 offices in 112 countries. In response to industry pressures including clients in-sourcing activity, pressure on CPG and structural challenges from the duopoly of Facebook &amp; Google, WPP was already working to simplify its business and increase flexibility. We expect a new CEO to continue and accelerate this process and a strategic review could lead to the group slimming its operations by a quarter to a third in our view. WPP is due to report first-quarter results on 30 April. Sorrell is free to start a new advertising venture because he has never had a non-compete agreement, the Financial Times reports. In a farewell note to staff, Sir Martin underscored the role WPP had played in his career, saying the company was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not just a matter of life or death, it was, is and will be more important than that\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He also hinted at his next step when he signed off saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Back to the future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd WPP shares dropped as much as 5% in early trading and are now down 1.7% at \u00c2\u00a311.67, with investors worried that Sorrell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure leaves the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest advertising group rudderless at a time when it might be broken up. European stock markets have opened higher, apart from the London stock market which has slipped slightly. UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index down 0.12% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax up 0.27% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC flat Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB up 0.13% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex up 0.08% Shares in Whitbread have surged nearly 8%, replacing Shire as the top riser on the FTSE 100 index in early trading. Whitbread is under mounting pressure from hedge funds to break up its business by spinning off the Costa Coffee chain, after activist investor Elliott Advisors built up a stake of more than 6%. Shares in Shire have opened 2.6% on the news, making it the biggest riser on the FTSE 100. Shares in WPP have dropped 5% after the departure of chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell. London-listed drugmaker Shire, which specialises in rare diseases, is selling its oncology business to French drugmaker Servier for $2.4bn. The division generated revenues of $262m last year. Shire, which is a potential bid target for Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest drugmaker Takeda, said it would consider returning the proceeds of the sale to shareholders through a share buyback. Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive Flemming Ornskov hailed the sale as a key milestone for the company. While the oncology business has delivered high growth and profitability, we have concluded that it is not core to Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longer-term strategy. We will continue to evaluate our portfolio for opportunities to unlock further value and sharpen our focus on rare disease leadership with selective disposals of non-strategic assets. The proceeds from the transaction increase optionality and Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Board will consider returning the proceeds of the sale to shareholders through a shareholder-approved share buyback after the current offer period regarding Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible offer for Shire concludes. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Following another week of gains last week, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax and the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index hitting six-week highs on Friday, European stock markets are set to open higher today. US stock futures are also up, pointing to a higher open on Wall Street later. Asian markets were mixed. The Nikkei in Tokyo closed 0.26% higher while Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng was 1.7% lower. There is relief that western missile strikes on Syria on Friday did not prompt a response from Russia, Syria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main ally, although traders will be watching cautiously for any signs of escalation of the conflict. Oil prices are slipping, with Brent crude in London down 1% to $71.83 a barrel while US crude is 0.9% lower at $66.79 a barrel. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: One of the main concerns last week was around the extent of the response by the US backed coalition on president Assad of Syria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forces and any Russian reaction to it. The firing of over 100 cruise missiles over the weekend on various targets, with little in the way of casualties, appears to be tempered with relief that while it may reduce the risk of an escalation in the short term, it in no way means that we might not get a counter response further down the line. As such markets here in Europe look set to open cautiously higher this morning after shares traded slightly firmer in Asia. The US also appears to be complementing its military approach by focusing on the additional sanctions route, after UN ambassador Nikki Haley announced that further sanctions were being discussed on Russian companies who have dealings with Assad and the use of chemical weapons, with details likely to be announced by US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin later today. Geopolitical developments and corporate earnings remain the main focus, in the absence of major economic news apart from US retail sales data for March, out at 13:30 BST. In the UK, we will get the latest labour market stats tomorrow, followed by inflation on Wednesday and retail sales on Thursday, but today the calendar is barren. The International Monetary Fund holds its spring meetings of central bankers and finance ministers in Washington this week. The main corporate news at the weekend was the resignation of WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell. He is leaving the advertising group he founded more than three decades ago ahead of the findings of an investigation into alleged personal misconduct. He is in line for almost \u00c2\u00a320m in payouts. His departure is seen as paving the way for a breakup of WPP. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a round-up of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s front pages.",

                "bodyText":"Sir Martin Sorrell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s abrupt resignation from WPP triggered a 6.5% slide in the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price on Monday as investors mulled the uncertain future of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest advertising business. Sir Martin, who founded WPP 33 years ago, resigned with immediate effect on Saturday amid an investigation into allegations of personal misconduct. Analysts reacted cautiously to the resignation, telling investors there will not be an immediate crisis at WPP. However, they acknowledged that the market had reacted to uncertainty over succession planning at WPP, compounding a performance that has resulted in shares in the group declining by a third over the past year. One of WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest shareholders, Harris Associates, said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153regrettable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to have a leadership transition without Sorrell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s involvement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It highlights the apparent lack of detailed succession planning that has troubled us and many other observers for some time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Roddy Davidson, an analyst at investment group Shore Capital, said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are not overly concerned about the immediate impact of Sorrell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure on the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flagship agencies as these are major international enterprises in their own right, with strong performance track records and independent management structures. That said, the resultant vacuum at the top of the company is not ideal.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price ended the day down 6.5% at \u00c2\u00a311.11p \u00e2\u20ac\u201c adding pressure on the already embattled ad group.

                "bodyText":"Time for a quick recap. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workers have received their first inflation-beating pay rise in a year. Wages rose by 2.8% per year in the three months to February, meaning they narrowly overtook inflation. In a solid set of data, the UK unemployment rate hit a new 42-year low of 4.2% and the employment rate climbed to a record high. But.... workers are still around \u00c2\u00a3800 per year poorer than before the financial crisis, and real wage growth is likely to remain modest this year. Economists have also predicted that rising wages make a UK interest rate rise next month more likely. This helped to push the pound up to a new 22-month high this morning. Although it has dipped since, it is close to its highest point since June 2016 (before the EU referendum). The International Monetary Fund has sounded the alarm over rising protectionism in the global economy. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF also predicted that global growth will be solid this year and next, but it also sees a slowdown further ahead. World stock markets have gained ground today, thanks to strong financial results from Netflix and Goldman Sachs - and the absence of fresh geopolitical tensions. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today... The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning about trade wars hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spooked the financial markets. Over in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average has gained 209 points, or 0.85%, to 24,782. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq indices are also enjoying gains, as investors shrug off the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worries about looming problems in the global economy. Instead, Wall Street has been cheered by forecast-beating results from Netflix last night, and both Goldman Sachs and Johnson &amp; Johnson today. Why do the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term forecasts suggest Britain might outperform some EU members, despite Brexit? Maurice Obsfeld says the Fund is using a rather optimistic model for Brexit, in which no new tariffs are imposed between the UK and the European Union and there is broad equivalency between the two sides. This best-case scenario assumes that both sides aim for an agreement n their own interests. So, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if all goes well...things do not look so bad\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the UK economy, Obsfeld said. But, there will still be losses compared to staying in the EU, he adds. Chris Giles of the FT points out that the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Economic Outlook is rather more positive than Maurice Obstfeld\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy statement today. Is that because recent economic data, and spiralling trade tensions, mean the report is already out of date? Obstfeld agrees that some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high frequency data\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that suggests slowing economic growth has been released in recent weeks, since the report was completed. That includes various Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) reports, which have fallen back from recent highs. The IMF is taking questions on its World Economic Outlook now. Our economics editor Larry Elliott asks the Fund what it wants creditor nations (such as Germany and China) to do to help tackle trade imbalances. Maurice Obstfeld replies that Germany has the ability to spend more on infrastructure, and also boost private investment - measures that would close its trade surplus. On the other side of the coin, America should be more concerned about the sustainability of its public finances (the annual budget deficit could hit a staggering $1 trillion in 2020). Some reaction to the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report: The IMF has upgraded its forecast for UK growth by 0.1% this year to 1.6%, from 1.5% last October. But growth in 2019 has been lowered by 0.1% to 1.5%. That would see Britain lag behind the eurozone, which is expected to grow by 2.4% this year and 2% in 2019. The IMF has also warned America against triggering a trade war with China. In an unusually forthright comment, Maurice Obstfeld said the recent tariffs pushed through by Donald Trump will push America deeper into the red: He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These initiatives will do little\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 to change the multilateral or overall US external current account deficit, which owes primarily to a level of aggregate US spending that continues to exceed total income. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recent US fiscal measures will actually widen the US current account deficit. NEWSFLASH: The International Monetary Fund has warned that the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade system is in peril, as the showdown between America and China over tariffs threatens to boil over. The warning comes in the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest assessment of the global economy, which is being released in Washington now. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic counsellor, singled out the dangers of protectionism, saying: The first shots in a potential trade war have now been fired.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The multilateral rules-based trade system that evolved after world war two and that nurtured unprecedented growth in the world economy needs strengthening. Instead, it is in danger of being torn apart.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Obstfeld also took aim at populism, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The renewed popularity of nationalistic policies is another after-effect of the financial crisis and its prolonged aftermath.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But despite these concerns, the IMF expects the global economy to grow by 3.9% in 2018 and 2019 -- 0.2 percentage points higher than six months ago. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market figures: Confusingly, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some disagreement over whether Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living squeeze has actually ended. It all depends which inflation measure you choose -- the benchmark Consumer Price Index (CPI), or CPIH, which includes housing costs. Then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the choice between basic pay, and total pay (including bonuses). Fortunately, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures both came in at +2.8% for February. Once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve cleared that hurdle, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the question of whether to take the most recent monthly inflation figure, or the average of the last three months. The Office for National Statistics favours CPIH, which was 2.7% in December and January and 2.5% in February - comfortably below February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage growth. Thus, the ONS says that real wages are rising. But the Treasury prefers to use the average of CPI over the last three months - which, at 2.9%, is still slightly above nominal earnings. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not heard the government celebrating the end of the pay squeeze. The media, though, are generally taking February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CPI reading (2.7%) and declaring that real wages are back (just!). Over in the eurozone, German investor confidence has tumbled into negative territory. The German economic sentiment index, calculated by research institute ZEW, has slumped to -8.2 this month, from +5.1 in March. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest reading since November 2012, when the eurozone crisis was hurting confidence. ZEW blamed the decline on fears of a global trade war, and recent data showing that German exports and production output have both fallen sharply earlier this year. Carsten Brzeski of ING called today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ZEW reading a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disastrous outcome\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which bolsters fears that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth is slowing. He added: The German economy had a start to forget in the first two months of the year. In fact, while the weakening of soft data could still be labelled as a levelling off from record highs, hard data in Germany and the entire Eurozone have clearly disappointed. At least in Germany, it would require a strong rebound in March to prevent an unexpected weak first quarter. Nevertheless, there are good reasons to blame exceptional factors like the weather, the timing of vacation and the flu for weaker economic activity in the first two months. Sound fundamentals still bode well for growth in the coming months. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also not forget that up to now, trade tensions are noise for the economic outlook and central banks, rather than hard reality. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Margaret Greenwood MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs data: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After nearly eight years of austerity, average wages are still lower than they were before the financial crash a decade ago. It is shameful that over 4 million children are growing up in poverty. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While we welcome that there are more people in work, these figures mask serious inequalities in the labour market, including the employment gap faced by women, disabled people and BAME groups who have too often borne the brunt of austerity cuts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A Labour government will make tackling poverty an immediate priority with a real Living Wage of \u00c2\u00a310 per hour by 2020, an end to the public sector pay cap and urgent reforms to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deeply flawed Universal Credit programme.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With unemployment at a 42-year low, many firms are struggling to fill vacant positions. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report shows there were 815,000 job vacancies in the last quarter, which is 44,000 more than for a year ago. Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg is hopeful that this gives workers the upper hand in wage negotiations (despite the IoD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s misgivings). He writes~: Accelerating wage growth, low and stabilising unemployment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the UK seems to be approaching full employment. Employment gains are slowing despite record high labour demand. Instead, wage growth is edging up nicely as the degree of mismatch between the skills of the remaining workers and the skills demanded by firms increases. With inflation expected to fall back towards 2% this year (from 2.7% in February) Pickering reckons real weekly earnings growth can rise towards 1.0% by the end of the 2018. The pound has slipped back from the 22-month high struck this morning, and is now down 0.2% against the US dollar at $1.4319. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little surprising, given this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick-up in basic pay. It may reflect the fact that total pay (including bonuses) only rise by 2.8% -- weaker than the 3% expected. Anthony Gillham, Old Mutual Wealth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of multi-asset, points out that wage growth is still rather anaemic - leaving some households vulnerable to an interest rate rise: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although symbolic, wage growth is still only marginally above the rate of inflation and the 2.8% increase has actually come in under expectations. This relatively sluggish wage growth is despite unemployment falling to its lowest level in over 40 years. It is somewhat disappointing that wage growth hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come through more powerfully given that there is really very little room for unemployment to fall any further. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although wage growth does strengthen the outlook for the UK fractionally, it does not change the fact that over the long-term consumers have still seen real pay suffer since the financial crisis. And it is worth bearing in mind that with increased minimum pension contribution rates coming into effect this month, disposable income may even come down. The Institute of Directors has poured a little cold water over today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, by warning that bosses will struggle to keep raising workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pay. The IoD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior economist, Tej Parikh, says the worst of the pay squeeze seems to be over - but questions whether the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forward momentum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on hiring and wage growth can be sustained. With skilled labour in short supply, productivity - long the bugbear of the UK economy - is crucial, Parikh explains: Many employers are already straining to fill vacancies due to chronic labour shortages, which have been compounded in a number of sectors, including social care and hospitality, by the notable drop in the number of migrants coming to the UK. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A further pick-up in salaries will also be restrained by the limited ability of SMEs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which employ 60 percent of the workforce \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to compete for a shrinking pool of labour. As such, small business owners will need greater support in managing regulatory costs and raising their productivity if wage growth is to become a long-lasting facet of our economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Via Resolution Foundation, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation that real pay (wage increases minus inflation) is rising fastest in the financial world but still shrinking in the public sector, and beyond.... The small boost from the pick-up in wages could be wiped out for many borrowers if the Bank of England raises interest rates. Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, says people should tackle their spending before the next rate hike lands: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the time to start splashing the cash, you should make hay while the sun shines and keep control of your spending. Create a budget and make sure you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spending any more than you need too. Spend 30 minutes looking at where you could make savings, from switching where you do your weekly shop to changing your energy supplier. Half an hour of research and admin could save you hundreds, if not thousands a year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This chart shows how wages have caught up with inflation, after around a year of falling real pay: And this one shows how the jobless rate is the lowest since Harold Wilson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premiership: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unions have welcomed the news that workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pay has finally caught up with rising prices - but warned that earnings are still too weak: TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says the government must do more: Unions have negotiated pay rises for workers across the UK, from the counters at McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to the factory floor at Ford. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But wage growth is still weak. Workers are \u00c2\u00a314 a week worse off than they were in 2007 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with pay packets not expected to return to their pre-crisis level until 2025. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is why tens of thousands of people will march through London on Saturday 12 May as part of the TUC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA New Deal for Working People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 demonstration. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government must get the economy working again for working people. Ministers need to increase the minimum wage to \u00c2\u00a310 an hour, fund a proper pay rise for all public servants, and give workers stronger rights to negotiate fair pay deals.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (That 0.2% figure is based on CPIH - a measure of inflation including housing costs. If you use the Consumer Prices Index, real wages are up by 0.1%). Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Esther McVey, has hailed the news that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment rate has hit a new all-time high. She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Another milestone for employment has been reached under this Government as employment reaches a record high, up 3.2 million since 2010 - the 16th time the employment record has been broken in the same period. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That means on average, over 1,000 people have moved into work every day since 2010, and credit has to be given to the businesses who have created those jobs and the individuals who are taking those opportunities. This chart, from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report, shows how the employment rate has climbed to 75.4%: Tara Sinclair of George Washington University tweets: All this talk of pay rises may have a hollow ring in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public sector, where the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity programme has kept wage growth pinned on the mat for several years. The Resolution Foundation points out that pay is not rising uniformly across the UK - instead, those in the City have been enjoying inflation-busting pay rises for a while: Real pay (adjusted for inflation) has been rising by almost 2.8 per cent for those in finance for the past year, and 1.5 per cent for those in construction, yet the squeeze continues in the public sector. Stephen Clarke, Senior Economic Analyst at the Resolution Foundation, adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures confirm that Britain passed an important living standards milestone in early 2018 as its 12-month pay squeeze finally ended. Wages should continue to strengthen over the course of the year as inflation falls back. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good to see pay finally back in positive territory, but Britain has a lot of ground to make up after an awful decade of pay squeezes, stagnation and all too fleeting recoveries. On average, people are still taking home less than they did before the crisis. My colleague Richard Partington points out that falling inflation, rather than bumper pay rises, is behind the pick-up in real wages: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the slump in the pound since the EU referendum has now largely passed through the economic system, especially given sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent rally. Geraint Johnes, research director at the Work Foundation and Professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School, says the UK jobs market is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gradually returning to a healthy state\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He adds: These trends seem to confirm that the labour market is gradually returning to a more stable state following a period in which many workers took on gig employment as a stop-gap in the aftermath of the recession.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Borrowers beware! While the pick-up in wages is welcome, it could also prompt the Bank of England to raise interest rates from 0.5% to 0.75% next month. Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the first time in more than a year, British workers are not feeling progressively poorer month by month.... Wage growth has been the missing piece of the puzzle in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long, slow recovery from the financial crisis. With the final piece now in place the Bank of England now has the catalyst to be able to follow through on its plans to raise interest rates at the next MPC meeting in May and start the move back towards monetary normality. Jeremy Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst, says the real wage squeeze on the average UK worker is coming to an end (and not before time!). While most of this improvement has been due to a collapse in inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something that should be shown to have continued tomorrow \u00e2\u20ac\u201c businesses are paying higher wages as the labour market in the UK tightens. Unemployment is currently at its lowest level since the mid-1970s and hopefully, that will propel higher wages for months to come. As we have noted before, real wage gains are the silver bullet for the UK economy. Real wage growth is significant because it relies on optimistic employers being happy with business conditions, it allows consumers to re-balance spending figures from credit uptake and it promotes growth in generalised output with a central bank more comfortable to normalise monetary policy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In another boost, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate has hit a new 42-year low of just 4.2%, as more people find jobs. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report shows that there are now 32.26 million people in work, 427,000 more than a year ago. The number of people classed as unemployed has dropped by 136,000 over the last year, and now stands at 1.42 million. And the employment rate has hit 75.4%, the highest since records began in 1971. Basic pay in the UK is now rising at its fastest rate since August 2015, as this chart from the ONS shows: Pay including bonuses also rose by 2.8% over the last quarter. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker than the 3% which economists expected, but is still just ahead of February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate (we get March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures tomorrow). BREAKING: Pay increases in the UK have finally overtaken inflation, after a year-long wage squeeze. Basic earnings rose by 2.8% per year in the three months to February, new figures from the Office for National Statistic show. That means they rose a little faster than inflation, which dipped to 2.7% in February. This is the first time in around a year that wages have risen faster than the cost of living - and means real wages are now rising by 0.1%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small but important step towards ending the cost of living squeeze. The Office for National Statistics says: Latest estimates show that average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain in real terms (that is, adjusted for price inflation) increased by 0.2% excluding bonuses, and by 0.1% including bonuses, compared with a year earlier. More to follow.... You can get up to speed on the UK labour market with these tweets from economist Rupert Seggins: Just over 15 minutes to go until the UK labour market report is released, and tension is growing in the City. Viraj Patel, FX strategist at ING, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It seems that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re back to good old-fashioned U.K. data watching to determine the short-term direction for the currency. A 3% wage growth print in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s U.K. jobs report should seal the deal for a May BOE hike.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound is continuing to strengthen, and just touched a new 22-month high of $1.4376 against the US dollar. Sterling had now risen for eight trading days in a row, as the City braces for UK interest rates to rise in May. It may also show that worries over a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 are easing. Speaking of China....Beijing has hit back at America after Donald Trump accused it of currency manipulation. A China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign ministry spokeswoman told reporters that information coming out of United States regarding the Chinese currency is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bit chaotic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, following the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on Twitter. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the tweet in question: This is part of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-running claim that other countries are cheating America by keeping their currencies too low. But.... one could argue that Trump is actually guilty of currency manipulation, as his wilder moves can prompt traders to sell the dollar: As Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale puts it: What matters now is the nervousness induced by both President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late-cycle fiscal largesse and his twitter feed. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s observation that Russian and China are playing the currency devaluation game was an eyebrow-raiser. Overnight, China reported that its economy grew by 6.8% in the first three months of this year. That broadly matched estimates, calming worries that the Chinese economy might be cooling. However, separate date showed that industrial output missed expectations and company investment has slowed. European stock markets have risen in early trading, taking their cue from Wall Street which rallied yesterday. Royal Bank of Canada are also eagerly awaiting today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK labour market report. They say: It is expected that the unemployment rate holds at 4.3% for what would be the seventh month in the last eight. Of most interest though is likely to be the news on average earnings growth. The including-bonus measure looks as though it could hit 2.9% 3m/y from 2.8% 3m/y, and if the ex-bonus measure reaches 2.8% 3m/y, as expected, then it will be the highest rate since August 2015 and help reinforce the case for a May Bank Rate hike Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group predicts that the today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK jobs report could drive the pound higher - if wages have indeed picked up in recent weeks: Traders are looking optimistically towards today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK jobs data, with expectations that it will support a Spring rate rise by the central bank [Bank of England]. Whilst UK unemployment is forecast to remain constant at 4.3%, average earnings are forecast to hit 3% in the three months to February. Given that inflation was 2.7% in February we could start to finally see the pressure of falling wages in real terms ease for the UK consumer. A strong reading could pile the pressure on the BoE to hike rates as good inflationary pressures pick up, potentially pushing GBP/USD to $1.45. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After a year of pain, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living squeeze could finally be easing. New earnings figures released this morning are expected to show that pay has overtaken inflation, for the first time since last spring. Economists predicts that average basic pay grew by 2.8% per year in the three months to February. Chuck in bonuses too, and pay packets may have grown by up to 3%. That would overtake inflation, which dropped to 2.7% in February, meaning pay packets are no longer being totally eroded by the cost of living. This would be welcome news for hard-pressed households....and would also raise the chances that the Bank of England hikes interest rates next month. The pound has already reacted, by hitting a 22-month high this morning. At $1.4360, sterling is its strongest against the US dollar since the Brexit vote of June 2016. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: It has already been established that a significant number of Bank of England policymakers are expecting wages to start outstripping headline inflation in the coming months, and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s average earnings number for the three months to February, could well be the first sign post on the way to that becoming a reality. The jobs data may also show that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate has stuck at just 4.3%, a 42-year low. Also coming up today... The International Monetary Fund will release its latest assessment of the global economy, as its Spring Meeting gets underway in Washington. Investors will also be watching the situation in the Middle East closely, following last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strikes in Syria. Any signs that the situation is escalating could hit stocks: On the corporate front, Associated British Foods has reported a pick-up of sales at its Primark operation. It adds: Primark performed well with profit growth of 4% achieved against a backdrop of unseasonable weather in Europe and a margin decline following the adverse effect of currency on purchases. High street retailer JD Sports has also defied the high street gloom, by reporting a 24% increase in profits for the last year. Drinks retailer Majestic Wine has announced a new growth strategy. It is planning to invest up to \u00c2\u00a312m to win new customers - which will make a dent in its short-term profits: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9.30am BST: UK labour market report 10am BST: The ZEW institute publishes its survey of German economic sentiment 2pm BST: IMF releases its World Economic Outlook",

Productivity growth remains sluggish, with GDP rising not much above the rate of employment growth. Wage increases are also picking up - and could easily reach 3%per annum in the second half of this year.</p> <p>In addition, a buoyant global economy is likely to continue to push up food and energy prices, with the oil price now already above $70/barrel.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank of England should not therefore treat this latest fallback in inflation as a dovish signal for interest rate policy. The MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach has normally been to look through short-term fluctuations and focus on the longer term influences on the inflation outlook. With unemployment at its lowest level since the mid-1970s, continued UK economic growth, a strong global economy, and inflation likely to remain above-target, there is still a very strong case for a rise in interest rates to 0.75% at next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MPC meeting.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>So, next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England meeting - on 10th May - will be rather exciting....</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BruceReuters/status/986537044796215296\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Looking at reactions to today&#39;s CPI, fair to say most economists think the BoE will press on with a May rate hike, despite weaker-than-expected inflation and so-so wage growth.<br><br>But among some of them, certainly a pang of... <a href=\"https://t.co/RBJfN4D1SH\">pic.twitter.com/RBJfN4D1SH</a></p>&mdash; Andy Bruce (@BruceReuters) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BruceReuters/status/986537044796215296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 18, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-04-18T10:18:25.247Z\">at 11.18am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ad70f9de4b0d4b06ccb4e8d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-18T09:36:49.691Z\">10.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">London house prices fall for first time since 2009</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no inflation in London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property market right now.</strong></p> <p>Instead, house prices in the capital have fallen by 1% year-on-year -- the first annual decline since 2009 (when Britain was in recession).</p> <p>This makes London the only region where house prices have dropped in the last year; on average, UK house prices rose by 4.4% in the year to February.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"070f4fc8e28e5bf6c03772a79b4d69c9ff978790\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/070f4fc8e28e5bf6c03772a79b4d69c9ff978790/0_0_678_500/500.png\" alt=\"London house prices\" width=\"500\" height=\"369\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">London house prices</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ONS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NobleFrancis/status/986524448953192448\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">ONS/Land Registry average house inflation in the year to February 2018 by region.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap Britain has been given some relief from the spectre of inflation, after the cost of living eased last month. The UK consumer prices index only rose by 2.5% in March, down from 2.7% in February. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for households, as wages rose by 2.8% per year in the last three months. The Office for National Statistics said the drop in inflation was due to weaker-than-usual price rises for women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothing, and the lack of new duties on alcohol and tobacco also helped (because the budge has been moved to the Autumn). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Retail Price Index rose by 3.3% - meaning that student loans will rise by up to 6.3% from September. The government, though, says relatively few people will earn enough to be affected by the change. Economists are split over whether falling inflation will deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates next month. The International Monetary Fund has warned that global debt levels are now higher than before the 2008 crisis, as it urges governments to get a grip. America, though, is on track for higher borrowings thanks to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts: The Fund also warned that the world economy faces a bumpy road, with risks of a downturn rising. The slowdown in London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market has driven prices down, year-on-year, for the first time since 2009. Oil prices have hit a three-year high, thanks to falling stocks and reports that Saudi want prices to head higher, perhaps to $100. In the City, the FTSE 100 is up 88 points - or 1.2% - its highest level since late February. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Newsflash: Oil has hit a new three-year high, as new figures show a surprise fall in US energy stocks. Brent crude has jumped over 2% to $73.30, the highest level since November 2014. US crude oil has also risen sharply, to $68.48. The surge came after America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Energy Information Administration reported that crude supplies fell by 1.1 million barrels last week. Oil was also boosted by speculation that Saudi Arabia is keen for crude to rise to $80 or even $100 per barrel. Reuters reported: Over the past year, Saudi Arabia has emerged as OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading supporter of measures to boost prices, a change from its more moderate stance in earlier years. Iran, once a keen OPEC price hawk, now wants lower prices than Saudi Arabia. Industry sources have linked this shift in Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance to its desire to support the valuation of state oil company Aramco ahead of the kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned sale of a minority stake in an initial public offering.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have come full circle,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a separate high-level industry source said of the change in Saudi thinking. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would not be surprised if Saudi Arabia wanted oil at $100 until this IPO is out of the way.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Exclusive: OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new price hawk Saudi Arabia seeks oil as high as $100 - sources The Department for Education has got in touch about the rise in student loan interest rates to up to 6.3%. They confirm that March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s RPI inflation figure will indeed be used to calculate repayments from September, but they also insist that relatively few people will be affected by the change. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because only the better-paid borrowers will clear their debts within the 30-year timescale anyway, due to the way they are repaid. For everyone else, it will simply affect the total that is eventually written off. A government spokesperson said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our decision to raise the minimum repayment threshold for student loans to \u00c2\u00a325,000 is saving 600,000 graduates up to \u00c2\u00a3360 per year from this month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This change in interest rate will make no impact on a borrowers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 monthly repayments and very few people are likely to be affected by the increase. Once the loans are in repayment, only borrowers earning over \u00c2\u00a345K are charged the maximum rate. This ensures that they make a fair contribution to the system. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s review of post-18 education and funding is also underway and will look at how students and taxpayers are getting value for money, including the role of interest rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy table showing the new repayment rates, depending on how much one earns. Under \u00c2\u00a325K: 3.30% (March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Retail Price Index reading) \u00c2\u00a330K: 4.05% \u00c2\u00a335K: 4.80% \u00c2\u00a340K: 5.55% Over \u00c2\u00a345K: 6.30% Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warnings on global debt, and bitcoin: Newsflash: The IMF has issued a stark warning that country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s need to tackle their debt levels, before the next crisis strikes. From Washington, our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: The global economy is more deeply indebted than before the financial crisis and countries need to take immediate action to improve their finances before the next downturn, the International Monetary Fund has said. The IMF said a prolonged period of low interest rates had stimulated a build-up of debt worth 225% of world GDP in 2016, 12 points above the previous record level reached in 2009. China was responsible for much of the increase, the IMF said, but noted that developed, emerging market and low-income countries all now looked vulnerable. The Washington-based institution used its half-yearly fiscal monitor to single out the US for particular criticism, saying that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal stimulus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a package of tax cuts and spending increases \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was leading to a bigger budget deficit at a time when it should be on the way down. More here: Over in Washington, the International Monetary Fund is warning that the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system faces a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbumpy road\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. In its new Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR), the IMF says that the short-term risks have risen, thanks to rising geopolitical tensions and fears of a trade war. ...and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even a (small) danger that the entire global economy suffers a contraction in the medium term. The Fund says: Given current financial conditions, risks to financial stability and growth are high over the medium-term. This reflects the fact that recent years of low interest rates\u00e2\u20ac\u201dneeded to support economic growth\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhave provided an environment in which vulnerabilities have been building. These vulnerabilities could exacerbate the next economic downturn and could also make the road ahead bumpy. The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns include: Weaker credit quality: as companies with more dubious credit records have borrowed heavily in the market External debt in emerging-market and low-income countries: the ultraloose monetary conditions in advanced economies sent a flood of funds into the developing world, and there could be turbulence if it flows out again. The Fund is also worried about the rise of crypto assets such as bitcoin, saying they could destabilise the global economy unless regulators are alert: Some of the technologies behind these assets could make financial market infrastructures, such as payment systems, more efficient. But they have also been afflicted by fraud, security breaches, and operational failures\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand have been associated with illicit activities. While the limited size of crypto assets suggests they currently pose little risk to financial stability, risks could grow if their use became more widespread without appropriate safeguards. The fall in the pound today has helped to push shares in London to a six-week high. The FTSE 100 has gained 63 points to 7289, its highest level since the end of February. A weaker sterling will, all things being equal, push up the value of exporters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 income from overseas, and thus their share price. Mining companies are leading the risers, thanks to a rise in the price of commodities today. Nickel is surging, on predictions that it could be included in any further sanctions against Russia. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report is bad news for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s students - and anyone paying off a student loan. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Retail Prices Index, another inflation measure, is used to calculate the repayment rate on student debt. The system uses a sliding scale -- those earnings less than \u00c2\u00a321,000 per year are charged RPI, then there is a sliding scale up to RPI +3% (6.1%) where income is \u00c2\u00a341,000 or more. Current students are also charged RPI +3% on their loans. RPI rose by 3.3% in March - high than the 3.1% recorded in March 2017. So, the interest rate on student debt is going to be as much as 6.3% from this autumn (up from 6.1%). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eye-wateringly steep, given Bank of England base rate is just 0.5%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a complicated situation -- only the wealthier ex-students will ever end up earning enough to clear their debts (MoneySavingExpert have a good explanation here) The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sean Coughlan thinks the government might intervene.... Those affected may feel aggrieved that RPI, rather than the (lower) CPI, is used. And they have a good case. The ONS itself has ruled that RPI is flawed and over, and should not be designated as a National Statistic at all! Paul Johnson, the well-respected head of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, says RPI is simply not up to the job: Danielle Haralambous, UK Analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, also suspects the Bank of England will hike borrowing costs next month: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation was softer than expected, but the decline in the headline rate won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a complete surprise to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy-setting committee, which expects annual inflation to ease this year as the impact of the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s past depreciation fades. But the committee is also looking at other data showing domestic price pressure still in the pipeline, notably a pick-up in wage growth and firm input prices. We expect these factors to keep inflation well above the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target for much of this year and support the case for a gradual normalisation of UK monetary policy. In our view, there is still a high chance that the bank raises interest rates again next month.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Viraj Patel points out that weaker inflation might make two rate hikes in 2018 less likely: The pound is continuing to slide, as traders ponder what this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop in inflation means for UK interest rates. Sterling has now fallen by a whole cent against the US dollar, to $1.419. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also down 0.7% against the euro, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.147. At the start of this week, a May rate hike looked to be nailed on. But the news that the Consumer Prices Index has fallen back towards the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target is prompting a rethink. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool suspects that the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee might vote for a rate hike, to 0.75%.... but he also thinks it would be a mistake. He tells us: Despite the drop in inflation, I still suspect MPC members might hike. After all they have done it in the past: From my database, MPC members voted in July 2007 for a hike (to 5.75%) despite CPI inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdropping like a stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by recording three (!) successive falls from 3.1% in March 2007 to 2.8% in April, to 2.5% in May and to 2.4% in June 2007! But, they shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as my colleague Michael Ellington from Liverpool University and I show in a brand new paper (available here) that interest rate hikes are more powerful in reducing inflation when inflation exceeds 3%. Far from a done deal next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision! However, Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, argues that the BoE should raise borrowing costs, as inflation is likely to remain above target this year. Though the impact of a weakened pound appears to be dropping out of the inflation numbers, three other factors are likely to exert an offsetting upward pressure on the pace of price increases. Productivity growth remains sluggish, with GDP rising not much above the rate of employment growth. Wage increases are also picking up - and could easily reach 3%per annum in the second half of this year. In addition, a buoyant global economy is likely to continue to push up food and energy prices, with the oil price now already above $70/barrel. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank of England should not therefore treat this latest fallback in inflation as a dovish signal for interest rate policy. The MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach has normally been to look through short-term fluctuations and focus on the longer term influences on the inflation outlook. With unemployment at its lowest level since the mid-1970s, continued UK economic growth, a strong global economy, and inflation likely to remain above-target, there is still a very strong case for a rise in interest rates to 0.75% at next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MPC meeting.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So, next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England meeting - on 10th May - will be rather exciting.... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no inflation in London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property market right now. Instead, house prices in the capital have fallen by 1% year-on-year -- the first annual decline since 2009 (when Britain was in recession). This makes London the only region where house prices have dropped in the last year; on average, UK house prices rose by 4.4% in the year to February. The Office for National Statistics blames the decline on the increase on stamp duty on more expensive houses, and the long-running affordability challenge with buying a house in London. It says: This is the lowest annual growth in London since September 2009, when it was negative 3.2%. London has shown a general slowdown in its annual growth rate since mid-2016. The second-lowest annual growth was in Yorkshire and The Humber, where prices increased by 3.1% in the year to February 2018. At \u00c2\u00a3472,000, the average London house price is more than double the UK average (\u00c2\u00a3225,000). Inflation across the eurozone has risen, but by less than expected. Figures just released by Eurostat show that prices in the euro area rose by 1.3% per year last month. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.1%, but weaker than expected (\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash data\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 suggested a rise of 1.4%, closer to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of almost 2%). Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady, general secretary of the TUC, is urging the Bank of England not to raise borrowing costs next month: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wages are still worth less than before the financial crisis, leaving many working people struggling to get by. A hike in interest rates is the last thing they need, and the fall in inflation shows the Bank of England should hold off. Tej Parikh, Senior Economist at the Institute of Directors, says the drop in inflation could spur growth in the UK economy: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures show a significant drop in inflation, and it is expected to continue to fall over the course of this year. This will be welcomed by the business community who have seen high inflation act as a major speed bump on economic growth ever since the beginning of last year. The drop in inflation will also offer much-needed breathing space for households who have been wedged between weak wage growth and rising price levels, which in turn will hopefully bolster consumer confidence and sales activity. The drop in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate is welcome news for UK households. Many have suffered a cost of living squeeze, as wages failed to keep pace with the cost of living for the last year. Philip Smeaton, chief investment officer at wealth manager Sanlam UK, points out that the jump in inflation last year forced many people deeper into debt: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With inflation falling back towards the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target and wage growth overtaking inflation for the first time in over a year, it finally looks like the squeeze on living is easing. These positive signs of a strengthening economy could be all the Bank of England needs to pull the interest rate lever in May \u00e2\u20ac\u201c moving policy back towards monetary normalisation. However, the MPC should consider what impact this could have on consumer debt. Since the shock vote to leave the EU, consumers have continued to spend despite immense pressure on their pockets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning they have likely accumulated debt. Should too much pressure be applied through higher interest rates this could impact consumers ability to spend, which is a vital element of the UK economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Alistair Wilson, Head of Retail Platform Strategy at Zurich, points out that savers have also found times tough: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While households can breathe a sigh of relief thanks to another easing of inflationary pressures, family disposable income remains squeezed, particularly after the news that disposable income has fallen for the first time in six years. Even with the inevitable rate rise, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that more needs to be done to help make what little savings people can afford to put away, go that bit further. This is the first time since summer 2015 that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has fallen for two months running. The inflationary impact of the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump, after the EU referendum, seems to be fading. Jeremy Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153CPI is at its lowest in a year and March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline is the 2nd consecutive month of weaker price rises \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen that since August \u00e2\u20ac\u201c September 2015. The majority of the slip is courtesy of the continual pricing out of the devaluation of sterling post the EU referendum, lower clothing prices as well as idiosyncratic changes courtesy of the rescheduling of the Budget until Autumn.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The absence of new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsin taxes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on booze and cigarettes this spring helped to keep inflation down (because the government has moved the annual Budget statement to the autumn). Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the Office for National Statistics, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation fell to its lowest rate in a year, with women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothing prices rising slower than usual for this time of year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Alcohol and tobacco also helped ease inflation pressures, with tobacco duty rises linked to the Budget not appearing this March, thanks to its new autumn billing. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, says the drop in inflation undermines the case for raising UK interest rates next month: The TUC agrees: The pound is sliding, as the City of London reacts to March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpectedly weak inflation figures. Sterling has dropped by three quarters of a cent against the US dollar to $1.42. Tat shows that traders think a May interest rate rise is now less likely. If inflation is falling back towards the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target, then the central bank might decide to leave borrowing costs unchanged. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has fallen to 2.5%, a one-year low. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 2.7% in February, and another sign that the cost of living crisis is easing, given that wages are currently rising at 2.8%. The Office for National Statistics says: The largest downward contribution to the change in the rate between February 2018 and March 2018 came from prices for clothing and footwear rising by less than they did a year ago, with the effect coming mainly from a range of items of women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothing. Price movements for alcoholic drinks and tobacco also made a downward contribution to the change in the rate; this in part reflects changes to the Budget cycle that were introduced in 2017, with tax changes for tobacco being announced in November 2017 instead of March 2018. More to follow! The Unite union are demanding answers from De La Rue, following its decision not to appeal over the UK passport contract. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tony Burke, Unite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assistant general secretary. After a strong run, European car sales have suffered their biggest fall in five years. New car registrations across the EU fell by 5.2% in March, new figures show, driven by drops in the UK, Germany and Italy. Industry body ACEA, which compiled the data, warns: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Momentum is starting to slow in some markets and especially in the United Kingdom.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It could be another sign that growth in the eurozone economy is slowing, after a strong 2017. Bloomberg says: Auto sales dropped in March at eight of the 10 top-selling carmaking groups, with the steepest declines at Ford Motor Co., Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, BMW AG and Nissan Motor Co. A planned merger to create Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest property company has been abandoned, in the face of UK retail gloom. Hammerson, which owns Bicester Village and Birmingham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bullring, has ditched its takeover of smaller rival INTU, which owns a string of shopping centres around the UK. Hammerson walked away after concluding that the deal was too risky, given the weakness in the UK retail sector at present. It says: The Board of Hammerson reassessed the proposed acquisition of Intu in light of updated information on current market dynamics in the UK. Over the last five months, the financial strength of retailers and other tenants in the UK has softened and a number of retailers have entered into administrations or CVAs, while consumer confidence has also remained subdued. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an embarrassing u-turn for the company, which really ought to have spotted such problems in its own sector. But given the recent collapse of Toys R Us and Maplin, and profit warnings at Debenhams and Mothercare, it also feels like the right decision. Shares in Hammerson have risen by almost 3% this morning, while Intu have slumped almost 6%. There are red faces at banknote printer De La Rue this morning, as it counts the cost of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit blue passport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 farrago. De La Rue has abandoned its attempt to appeal against the decision to award the contract to print Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new passports to French-Dutch rival Gemalto. In an unscheduled announcement to the City, De La Rue hit shareholders with a profits warning - the second in a month - and revealed it is taking a \u00c2\u00a34m hit on the UK passport contract. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: The company, which also makes the new polymer bank notes, warned that underlying operating profit was now expected to be in low to mid \u00c2\u00a360m range for the year to 31 March. It followed a profits warning less than month ago, when De La Rue predicted profits of between \u00c2\u00a371m and \u00c2\u00a373m. The firm said the lower profits expectation reflected \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the write off of the [about] \u00c2\u00a34m bid costs related to the UK passport tender and delays in the shipment of certain contracts in the last week of the period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Shares in De La Rue have fallen 5% in early trading. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK inflation report could send traders racing to buy, or sell, the British pound. It all depend whether the data make an early interest rate rise more likely, as Konstantinos Anthis, Head of Research at ADS Securities, explains: Inflation in Britain is one of the key data investors and traders are following as it relates to how fast and aggressively the Bank of England will hike rates. We know that the BoE want to raise their key interest rate levels during their next two meetings but the actual timing of the move is still under debate. The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price action largely depends on when market participants believe the British central bank will pull the trigger and the pace of inflation is key in gauging when this will be. The pound is trading at $1.429 this morning - a weak inflation report could send it sliding to $1.425, Anthis says. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the global economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Inflation is centre-stage today as we find out how the cost of living changed in the UK and the eurozone last month. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer prices index is tipped to come in around 2.7% in March, matching February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading and away from January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3% peak. If so, that would confirm that the cost of living squeeze is easing - yesterday we learned that UK wages rose by 2.8% in the last quarter. The data may also influence the chances of the Bank of England raising interest rates next month, which has already driven the pound to 22-month highs yesterday. Royal Bank of Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysts predict that inflation might actually drop to 2.6% today, given the recent easing in petrol prices. They add: The recently announced price increases by British Gas, of 5.5% for both gas and electricity, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take effect until the end of May so won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any impact on the forthcoming release, however, in the second half of 2018, factoring in this utility bill hike will add an estimated 0.05-0.1ppts to annual CPI rates. It remains to be seen whether other energy providers follow British Gas, but in any case it reaffirms expectations that inflation will remain above the 2% target into 2019. Inflation is rather lower in the eurozone, of course. The annual euro area consumer prices index is expected to remain at 1.4% for March, although prices probably picked up during the month. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation data from the eurozone could show signs of a pickup having been lacklustre for the past year. Whilst CPI is forecast to be 1.4% on an annualised basis, on a monthly basis an uptick to 1% from 0.2% is forecast. Weak eurozone inflation is great for consumers in the region, of course, but it could also make it harder for the European Central Bank to end its massive money-printing Quantitative Easing stimulus programme this autumn. The International Monetary Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Spring Meeting is continuing in Washington; two new reports on the state of the global economy will be released later. Plus, the Bank of Canada is setting interest rates today; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to leave borrowing costs unchanged at 1.25%.

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nick Fletcher on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s action in the commodity market: Oil has hit a new three-and-a-half-year peak, and other commodity prices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c notably nickel and aluminium \u00e2\u20ac\u201c moved sharply higher as Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sanctions and the continuing conflict in Syria fuelled fears of supply shortages. Brent crude rose 1.7% to $74.74 (\u00c2\u00a352.67) a barrel on Thursday, the highest level since November 2014 when oil group Opec began increasing production to protect its market share, a move that subsequently led to a supply glut and a price slump to $27 a barrel just over a year later. More recently Opec had agreed with Russia, another major supplier, to cap output and protect prices, even though growing production from US shale companies threatened to undermine this strategy. However a surprise drop in US oil inventories this week, along with concerns about Middle Eastern supply following the military strikes on Syria by the US, the UK and France, have kept crude prices buoyant. Meanwhile, ahead of an Opec meeting on Friday, Reuters reported that Saudi Arabia wanted to see prices as high as $100 a barrel. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Friday sees a host of energy ministers from some of the most influential oil producing nations meet in the Saudi city of Jeddah, heightening anticipation of what could be yet another production freeze/cut extension in the offing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Goodnight! GW At the risk of being cynical.... Saudi Arabia do have a particular motive to keep the oil price high - the impending flotation of energy giant Aramco. If crude is trading at three-year highs, Saudi might get a better price from investors for a stake in its domestic operator. But the team at FXPro say traders should be cautious, in case the stratgy changes: The main focus today is on oil prices, which, since late 2014, have continued to rise to new heights. Saudi Arabia announced their desire to see the prices reach $80-100 per barrel on Wednesday, causing oil to jump $2 (3%) to $73.40. Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments were seen as an intent to continue limiting oil production, although oil stores are currently close to the 5-year average. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth mentioning that Saudi Arabia plans to sell a 5% stake in their largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, and launch the biggest IPO in history, valued at $100Bln. Higher oil prices would likely increase demand for these shares, providing the opportunity to earn more money. Nevertheless, this pre-sale price pumping tactic could easily turn into a time bomb. After the deal, Saudi Arabia could return to the strategy they used in 2014, refusing to balance supply and pushing prices to multi-year lows by increasing output. Nickel continues to post strong gains, due to that speculation about new US sanctions on Russian metal producers. Fiona Cincotta, Senior Market Analyst at City Index, says: Aluminium is at a 6-year high, up 32% just this month, whilst nickel has surged 20% this week alone as concerns over Russian sanctions and supply issues dominate. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official: Allergan says it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the early stages of considering a possible offer for Shire\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It adds: No offer has been made. There can be no certainty an offer will be made nor as to the terms on which any such offer would be made. A further announcement will be made as appropriate. So the City might get one of its favourite things - a takeover battle, between Takedo and Allergan to take control of Shire, whose shares are now 9% higher #developing The Shire takeover battle takes another twist! Over in Washington, INF chief Christine Lagarde has been channelling JFK as she urges world leaders to take advantage of the current relative calm: The IMF is particularly concerned about America, and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to cut taxes and boost the US deficit [the equivalent of ignoring that leak in the attic, and splashing out on a new swimming pool instead] Oil is continuing to climb, with Brent now trading at $74.40 per barrel. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a gain of 1% today, and its highest level since last 2014. Traders are citing recent falls in oil inventories, and signs that Opec members such as Saudi Arabia will continue to rein in production to prevent prices falling. This chart shows how prices picked up after Opec agree to curb supplies in 2016. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs market continues to sizzle. The number of US citizens filing new claims for unemployment benefit fell to 232,000 last week, from 233,000. That suggests that job creation and retention remains strong, with the labor market close to full employment. Now we have a statement from Shire... confirming that it has rejected Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advances. But significantly, Shire also says the two sides are still talking, suggesting a takeover is still possible. The company says it has: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153entered into a dialogue with Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advisers to discuss whether a further, more attractive, proposal may be forthcoming and to understand the basis on which such a proposal would be made. The Board and management of Shire remain committed to enhancing shareholder value and are focused on fully evaluating internal and external opportunities to maximise value for shareholders, including any further proposals from Takeda. Shares in Shire have now dropped back to \u00c2\u00a338.98, leaving them around 3.7% higher today. Newsflash: Takeda has confirmed that it has approached Shire with a takeover bid -- but its advances was rejected. In a statement to the City, the Japanese pharma firm says it suggested buying Shire for \u00c2\u00a346.50 per share -- \u00c2\u00a317.75 in cash (US dollars) and \u00c2\u00a328.75 of new Takeda shares. However, Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board rejected the proposal. However, this story isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over! Takeda says that discussions between the two sides are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcongoing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, suggesting another offer could come before next Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deadline. Takeda insists that it will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remain disciplined\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over any formal offer -- a nod to Shire shareholders not to expect the moon on a stick. As previously stated, Takeda intends to maintain its well-established dividend policy and investment grade credit rating. Takeda also argues that merger with Irish-headquartered Shire would make sense: Building on Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existing momentum, the acquisition of Shire would accelerate its transformation and result in a global, value-based, R&amp;D-driven biopharmaceutical leader headquartered in Japan, with a balanced geographic footprint, a robust, modality-diverse pipeline and enhanced financial strength. Back in the City, shares in pharmaceutical firm Shire has jumped almost 7% as traders anticipate a takeover battle. Reuters is reporting that Japanese firm Takeda Pharmaceuticals has made an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcindicative takeover proposal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for Shire - which produces the ADHD drug Adderall - worth \u00c2\u00a343bn, or \u00c2\u00a346.50 per share. Last month, Takeda said it was considering making an offer for Shire, so the City has been waiting for the next move. Under takeover rules, Takeda has until 25 April to bid, or walk away. Shire was founded in Hampshire, but is now based in Ireland for tax purposes. Takeda is particularly interested in its rare diseases portfolio, where it has 40 programmes in its drug pipeline. Shire are currently up 256p at \u00c2\u00a340.12, to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. Russia has launched an attempt to win compensation over America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs on steel and aluminium. Moscow has filed an official complaint to the World Trade Organisation, arguing that the 25% tariff on steel, and 10% on aluminium, are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsafeguard measures\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - ie, designed to protect the US economy, not for national security. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important distinction - as major exporters can ask for compensation under WTO rules if they are penalised by such safeguards. As Russia puts it: Although the United States presented the measures at issue as being adopted to address the threat that imports of steel and aluminium pose to the US national security, they are in essence safeguard measures, and the Agreement on Safeguards and Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994) are applicable to them. The United States did not provide notification under paragraph 1(c) of Article 12 of the Agreement on Safeguards on taking a decision to apply the safeguard measures to the WTO Committee on Safeguards. The Russian Federation is a WTO Member that has a substantial interest as exporter of the products subject to the safeguard measures. Therefore, the Russian Federation requests consultations with the United States under paragraph 3 of Article 12 of the Agreement on Safeguards and paragraph 2 of Article XIX of the GATT 1994. So, Russia now joins China, India and the EU in opposing these tariffs: Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, says the 1.2% fall in retail sales last month is disappointing - but there are some reasons for optimism: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With snow and rain right through March including in the critical run up to Easter, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise that shoppers avoided the high street. So, while online retailers benefited to some extent, last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales were particularly disappointing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Footfall was significantly impacted by the weather, and the first of retailers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 spring/summer fashion and home product ranges would have been of little consolation to shoppers looking to stay warm. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all doom and gloom. This week, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already seen evidence of wages growing in real terms as inflation has eased. Moreover, our most recent survey* shows that consumer sentiment is recovering and is higher than it was both in December and this time last year. This is particularly true of younger people, with more under 45s saying they think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be better off next year. Keith Richardson, managing director retail sector at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, also blames the icy blast of grim weather for keeping shoppers off the streets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While Mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day and an early Easter provided some respite for retailers in March, the impact of two Beasts from the East was brutal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The high street felt the worst of the chill as shoppers simply stayed at home to avoid the snow. But it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just the weather to blame. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fashion clearly suffered as nobody wants to buy spring clothing during a blizzard, even from the comfort of their sofa. Economist Rupert Seggins says the retail sector will have a slight negative impact on growth in the last quarter: Economics journalist Dharshini David says the weak spending figures might deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates next month: Rhian Murphy, ONS Senior Statistician, says the wintery weather in March hurt Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high street stores, but boosted web retailers: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Retail sales fell in the first quarter due to a large decline in March with petrol sales seeing a significant slump as a result of the poor weather keeping many shoppers indoors. However, the snow actually helped boost online spending with department stores in particular seeing growth in their web sales. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Various shops also reported increased spending on gifts in the run-up to Easter and Mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day, which also helped boost online sales.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: UK retail sales suffered an unexpectedly sharp fall last month, as the Beast from the East hit the sector. Sales volumes fell by 1.2% on March, much worse than the 0.5% which economists had expected. The Office for National Statistics blames bad weather for the decline - backing up what Debenhams reported this morning. The figures also show that Britain has suffered its weakest quarter for retail sales in a year, with volumes down 0.5% in January-March. The ONS says: In the three months to March 2018 (Quarter 1), the quantity bought in retail sales fell by 0.5% when compared with Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2017, with declines in all sectors except for department stores and non-store retailing. The month-on-month growth rate fell by 1.2% due to a large fall of 7.4% from petrol sales; a likely consequence of adverse weather conditions, which impacted travel. Department stores were the only sector to show positive growth in March at 0.8%, with feedback from retailers suggesting that online offers for Mothering Sunday and Easter boosted internet sales more than usual during the adverse weather. The quantity bought in supermarket stores declined in March, while specialist food stores saw strong growth; possibly due to the easier access to these stores during snow. Reaction to follow... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on how the nickel price has soared as investors anticipate new sanctions on Russian metal producers: Nickel surged more than nine percent on Thursday to its strongest level since late 2014 on fears U.S. sanctions on major Russian aluminium producer Rusal may be broadened and could hit key Russian nickel supplier Nornickel. It was the second straight session of sharp gains for nickel, adding to Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 7.5-percent spike, spurred by worries over tighter global supply for a commodity already in deficit. Three-month nickel on the London Metal Exchange rallied as much as 9.3% percent to $16,690 a tonne, the highest since December, 2014. The metal, used to make stainless steel, was up 7.3 percent at $16,395 by 0702 GMT. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pretty clearly there is a lot of smoke. And pretty clearly the U.S. has Russia in its sights for a number of reasons known to them,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said UBS analyst Lachlan Shaw. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A logical extension would be if you were to broaden sanctions, then Norilsk would fall under that remit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Norilsk Nickel, or Nornickel, is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-biggest nickel producer. An official for Nornickel this week dismissed the idea of the prospect of sanctions on the company driving up the nickel price. The FTSE 100 has hit a 10-week high, as the commodity rally pushes up shares in mining giants and oil producers. The Footsie is up 17 points at 7334, as it recovers from last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Energy and raw materials companies are leading the way, with Anglo American up 1.6% and Royal Dutch Shell gaining 0.5%. Over in the City, shares in Debenhams have slumped by 10% to its lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis. Traders are unimpressed by its latest financial results, showing an 85% slump in pre-tax profits and a warning that full-year earnings will be lower than many brokers expected. The company also blamed the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBeast from the East\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for hitting sales in March, saying it had to close almost 100 stores as icy, snowy weather gripped the UK. That followed on from a disappointing Christmas, which had already prompted a profits warning in January. Debs says it is accelerating its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Debenhams Redesigned\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd strategy - an attempt to boost digital sales, cut costs, and lure more customers through the doors by billing shopping as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fun leisure activity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But...finance director Matt Smith isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hanging around to see the results - he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moving to Selfridges. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor, says Saudi Arabia is pushing for a high oil price to prop up its fiscal plans: Despite the influence of US shale, Saudi Arabia still calls the shots on global oil markets, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasingly obvious the Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are comfortable with oil at $80 or more. Add a drop in weekly US oil reserves to the mix and the only way for crude prices is up. Saudi bullishness should be no surprise given it must somehow bankroll Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expensive reforms and modernisation at home. Even lumber is being swept higher by the surge in commodity prices: The rubber price has, umm, bounced by 5% today, after China announced temporary anti-dumping measures on imports. The measures will affect halogenated butyl rubber imported from the United States, European Union and Singapore, Reuters reports The surge in commodity prices this month is quite astonishing: Shares in Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mining sector has hit a three-month high this morning, following the rally in commodity prices: Oil isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only commodity to rally today. Nickel has surged by 9% this morning, hitting its highest level since December 2014. That follows reports that Russian mining firm Norilsk Nickel could be caught up in US sanctions against Moscow. That could have serious consequences for manufacturers, as nickel is a key component in rechargeable batteries used in mobile phones and electric cars, for example. Earlier this month the US imposed sanctions on aluminium-producer United Co. Rusal. That has caused drama in the commodities markets, with aluminium up another 5% today. Bloomberg explains: Consumers, manufacturers and traders are scrambling to secure supply cut off by Rusal, the largest aluminum producer outside China. Aluminum reached a six-year high and nickel jumped the most intraday since 2009. Alumina, a raw material needed to make aluminum, notched a fresh record. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It really is unprecedented in terms of the turmoil it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unleashed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Robin Bhar, a metals analyst at Societe Generale SA, said by phone from London. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s amazing to watch.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, agrees that supply worries and geopolitical tensions are pushing oil up: Oil found support after data from the Energy Information Administration showed that crude inventories dropped 1.1 million barrels in the week to 13 April, while gasoline and distillate stockpiles fell by more than 3 million barrels. Now it is OPEC and Co.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turn to capitalize on the bullish report as they meet in Jeddah on Friday. While the elimination of oversupply has been a critical factor pushing oil prices, I still believe there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a significant risk premium being priced in, specifically the fear of supply disruption from the Middle East and possible renewed sanctions on Russia and Iran. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The oil price is on a tear this morning, hitting its highest levels since late 2014 as stockpiles fall and worries about geopolitical tensions in the Middle East weigh on the markets. Brent crude has crashed over the $74 per barrel mark this morning, following data yesterday showing a surprise drop in US oil inventories. US crude (West Texas Intermediate) is also rising, hitting a three-year high of $68.95. Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US-UK-French military strikes in Syria have also pushed oil prices higher, amid worries that supplies from the region could be disrupted. In addition, a Reuters report that Saudi Arabia is pushing for higher prices -- perhaps even $100 per barrel -- has caught traders attention. It may show that the Opec cartel will push on with its supply curbs, to keep prices buoyant. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Traders are starting to get excited that the oil market is finally rebalancing with the global supply glut evaporating. Whilst it may be premature for the OPEC led group implementing supply cuts to cheer, the numbers are certainly pointing to a potential end in sight. Also coming up today... We get a new healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sector, with sales figures for March released this morning. Economists predict that they fell by 0.5% month-on-month, as grim weather kept shoppers away from the high streets. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales numbers for March could shatter the perception of consumers feeling a little better about their spending habits. So far this year consumers have been in a fairly cautious mood with retail sales in January and February rising 0.1% and 0.8% respectively. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s March numbers could reverse all or most of these gains with expectations of a decline of 0.5%. High street chain Debenhams, broadcaster Sky and pest control firm Rentokil are also reporting to the City. The news from Debenhams isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great - pre-tax profits slumped by almost 85% in the last six months: Sky has reported a 5% rise in like-for-like revenues, and are speaking to the press now....

The system is behind the times. King is right \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time ministers addressed a playing field that is unfairly tilted. Alarm over Unilever \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We remain highly confident of achieving the required level of shareholder support,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Graeme Pitkethly, Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief financial officer, talking about the proposal to abandon the Anglo-Dutch corporate structure and go wholly Dutch. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see how that works out but the mood music among UK investors is not good. Only Columbia Threadneedle has dared to announce its concerns but the FT reports that three top-20 investors and one top-40 house are also alarmed. One cannot be surprised. Unilever would retain a listing in London but, crucially, it would exit the FTSE 100 index. That would create huge selling pressures among those funds that track the blue-chip index or are obliged to hold a given percentage in UK-indexed stocks. Why would any fund in that position be in favour of Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rejig? The only logical vote would be against a proposal that requires a 75% majority of shareholders in the plc class of share. This tale may not be over.",

                "bodyText":"TSB customers must wait until Tuesday morning to find out if they can get into their online bank accounts. The bank itself seems to have gone quiet (customer service shut down at 11pm and reopens at 7am). So we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to wrap up for the day too. Goodnight, and good luck to everyone affected by these problems. GW Photographer, and Green Party candidate, Nicola Albon confirms that the problems still aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resolved.... TSB customer Nick Mays says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finally got online.....but is still planning take his business elsewhere. Other customers are worried that the problems won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be fixed by Tuesday morning.... One TSB mortgage-holder got a rather nasty shock when she managed to log into her account: Becky Dracup of Liverpool is another less-than-satisfied customer tonight, after struggling to speak to anyone at TSB: TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IT woes make the front page of the Financial Times tomorrow. The FT focuses on the prospect that City and data watchdogs will savage the bank, saying: Regulators are probing computer problems at TSB that left many customers of the UK bank unable to check their accounts and gave some access to other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money after it switched to new systems over the weekend. The problems, which provoked a flurry of complaints on social media, followed a scheduled shutdown of TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online and mobile banking applications over the weekend while it transferred 1.3bn customer records from its former parent Lloyds Banking Group. The Information Commissioner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the UK privacy watchdog \u00e2\u20ac\u201d said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Financial Conduct Authority said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153aware of the issue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153liaising with the firm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... More here. As we head into the night, TSB are still telling customers that they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know when the IT outage will be fixed. TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive Paul Pester has kept a low profile today - he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not tweeted about the IT problems at all. Liberal Democrat peer Paul Scriven has laid into Pester on Twitter this evening, calling for answers about what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gone wrong: Bookseller Isabel MacNeill would also like to hear from Pester: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now 27 hours since TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s migration to a new IT platform was meant to conclude - and some users, such as GMB official Rachelle Wilkins, are still in the dark: Data visualisation firm Bright Analytics is worried that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to pay its employees, or settle other bills, until TSB fixes its problems: Many users are still reporting that TSB is refusing to accept their login details, including PR and social media executive Cara Elizabeth: Time for a quick recap, for anyone tuning in or seeking the latest information. UK bank TSB is struggling to get to grips with a botched system upgrade that has left some customers unable to use online and mobile banking services. TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services were meant to come online at 6pm Sunday night, following a major IT migration over the weekend. But scores of users report that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still unable to access banking services, more than a day later. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no clarity on when the situation will be fixed, leaving customers unable to pay bills, check they have received money, or access other banking services. Some customers have even reported seeing the wrong account details, sparking fears of a data breach. TSB has repeatedly apologised, insisting that it is working as hard as it can to fix the issue. But many customers are demanding compensation, and threatening to leave the bank. The project involved moving TSB away from systems owned by Lloyds Banking Group (who spun out TSB in 2013), and onto a new IT platform. TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owner, Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sabedell, has risked further anger by claiming that the migration has been a success - even as UK customers reported problems. UK regulators are now monitoring the situation. TSB could potentially be fined by the Financial Conduct Authority (the City watchdog) and the Information Commissioner. This is important. Any TSB customers who discover an unexpected windfall in their accounts this week should not rush out and spend it. If you do, you could be forced to pay it back... or worse. Lee Boyce of This Is Money explains: Legally, if a sum of cash is accidentally paid into your account and you know it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yours, you are liable to pay it back. Keeping and spending money wrongly placed into your account could lead to you being charged with retaining wrongful credit under the Theft Act 1968. Two sisters were sent to prison in 2008 after going on a spending spree with cash that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t theirs. The then Abbey Bank had wrongly credited \u00c2\u00a3135,000 into one of their accounts. It took the bank two weeks to spot the mistake. The official advice is to contact your bank and alert it to the mistake - but many TSB customers say that call waiting times are currently extremely long as it battles the meltdown. Criminal paralegal James Ashton has found himself caught up in TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems: TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard-pressed social media team are repeating the same generic statement to scores of customers, along the lines of: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re really sorry to hear that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re experiencing problems accessing Online Banking. Unfortunately, there are some intermittent problems affecting this service so please bear with us. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working as hard as we can to resolve this. In the meantime, please try again later and sorry once more for the inconvenience. That really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to address the concerns of customers who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make payments, or even check how much money is in their account. For example: One of the most alarming elements of this mess is that some TSB customers say they saw the account details of other customers - a potentially serious breach. One account holder, called Matthew Neal, says he logged last night and found himself looking at someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a335,000 savings account,plus an \u00c2\u00a311,000 Isa, and a business account! TSB claims to have such issues, but other customers have reported similar problems today: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial ombudsman, which mediates on complaints between customers and financial firms, is also taking an interest: TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s systems were meant to be up and running after its IT migration 24 hours ago. But instead, its social media account is being hammered by increasingly angry customers, who STILL can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get into their accounts. The list now includes a contestant from this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s series of MasterChef, furniture designer Fiona Harris: TSB risks being hit with a hefty fine for the problems suffered by its customers, says Iain Withers of the Telegraph. He writes: Both the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Information Commissioner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office (ICO) said they were monitoring the situation. The watchdogs have the power to investigate and potentially fine TSB for a system failure or data breach respectively. Research technician Cameron Hill has found a way back into his TSB account...... I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t test it myself, but it might be worth attempting..... TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, Banca Sabadell, thinks the IT migration is a success! It has released a press release trumpeting the move, even though TSB has admitted there have been problems. Apparently the new IT platform is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153milestone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the bank (although it may feel more like a millstone for some customers right now). It says: Banco Sabadell has successfully completed the TSB technology migration. The implementation of the new Proteo4UK platform represents a new milestone in the history of Banco Sabadell Group, and particularly in its progress in terms of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s internationalisation. It is also the first ever project outside of Spain in which the bank has created a new banking platform from scratch and completed a large scale migration of the platform. The Chairman, Josep Oliu, has emphasised that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with this migration, Sabadell has proven its technological management capacity, not only in national migrations, but also on an international scale. The new Proteo4UK platform is an excellent starting point for the organic growth of the business and the improvement of TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efficiency\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Oliu also stated that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more than 5.4 million customers are now integrated into the new platform, which allows us to grow in a market as mature and highly competitive as the UK market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Equally, the Chairman has also stated that the migration will provide a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153greater competitive capacity and increased value creation for our franchise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. City AM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Emma Haslett points out that TSB hopes to slash its costs through this IT move. Perhaps some of those saving could be put towards a compensation pot for those who suffer losses through today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now more than 21 hours since TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online banking systems were due to be working again... but some customers are still experiencing problems. Jewellery maker Barbara Adamiec reports that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s damaging her business today: Despite the IT disruption, TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online complaint form is still up and running. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to hear from anyone affected by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems.... The frustration of being locked out of one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own bank account is evident among TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s customer base: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Patrick Collingson on the TSB problems: The internet and mobile banking services of TSB, which has five million customers, intermittently failed on Monday morning after a system upgrade went wrong, prompting widespread concern among users. The bank, carved out of Lloyds but now part of the Spanish Sabadell group, said it was working urgently to repair what it described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intermittent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd failures in its services. The crash came hours after the bank warned account holders that some services, including online banking, making payments or transferring money, would not be possible from 4pm on Friday to 6pm on Sunday because of a system upgrade. Some customers alleged over Twitter that transactions they have not made are being logged to their accounts, with some being credited sums of money, which are later deleted. More here: TSB has just issued a statement - blaming the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclarge volumes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of customers trying to access its services for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disruption. A spokesperson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are currently experiencing large volumes of customers accessing our mobile app and internet banking which is leading to some intermittent issues with people accessing our services. We are really sorry for the inconvenience this is causing our customers and want them to know we are working as hard and as fast as we can to resolve this problem.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd TSB has around five million UK customers. And surely it expected a surge of activity this morning, after restricting services over the weekend?! Last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (botched) IT work should have been a symbolic moment for TSB -- as it finally moved the bank away from its former owner, Lloyds Banking Group. TSB was spun out of Lloyds in 2013, but it has been using its former parent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s backend technology systems ever since - even after being taken over by Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sabadell in 2015. TSB had hoped to move onto a new IT system last November, but was forced to delay it. That proved costly, as it pays Lloyds a fee for using its systems - in February, TSB warned that profits would be hit by the delay. Under these circumstances, TSB will have been keen to take the plunge and move to its new IT systems. But were they completely ready? Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems suggest perhaps not.... Christopher Pavett, pastor of Calvary Church in Clydach, Wales, spoke for many customers caught up in the disruption last night: The Sun is also reporting that TSB customers have been left in limbo by its technology problems: Mark Ezeabasili, 24 a student from London studying sport science at Bedfordshire University told The Sun he hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had access to his account since 6pm yesterday. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am a student and I tried to move some money from my TSB ISA to my current account so I would have money for the week.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t what I am going to do for money for the week now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I now have to all the way to town to get my money which really disrupts my life as I have exams and assignments and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really have time to go all the way to the bank.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some TSB customers report that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IT problems are causing serious inconvenience, and even costing them money: Small businesses who use TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking service are also worried.... I suspect TSB will be facing some claims for compensation, once this mess is sorted out.... TSB had warned customers that there might be disruption over the weekend, as it carried out its IT upgrade. However, that work was meant to be finished last night - before many customers headed back to work today. But as Sky News points out, something has clearly gone wrong: One customer said he could see other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accounts totalling more than \u00c2\u00a320,000, while another reportedly discovered he had been wrongly credited with \u00c2\u00a313,000 after logging back in. It came several hours after the bank had warned its account holders that some of its services, including online banking, making payments or transferring money, would not be possible over the weekend because of a system upgrade. The upgrade window was scheduled between Friday at 4pm and Sunday at 6pm. However, a message on the TSB website on Monday morning said there were still \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intermittent issues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with its services, while a number of customers reported they were still unable to access their money. UK \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchallenger bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 TSB is suffering some challenging - and alarming - technical problems this morning, following IT changes over the weekend. Customers are taking to social media to complain that they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t access their accounts, or even see how much money is available to them. The problems have arisen following weekend IT work. There are even reports that some customers are seeing other customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 balances when they log in.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some examples of the problems being reported: TSB have apologised, and say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working hard to fix the problems.... Shares in outsourcing giant Capita have surged by 13% this morning, after it announced plans to raise \u00c2\u00a3700m in fresh capital. This cash injection should help the company overhaul its operations, and avoid the same fate as Carillion - which slumped into liquidation three months ago. More here: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are soporifically quiet this morning - perhaps traders have been lulled to sleep by the sunny weather. Most European indices have dipped into the red, following this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news that exports are being hit by the stronger euro. In the City, the FTSE 100 is basically flat. Wall Street is expected to dip when trading begins at 2.30pm BST - as the rise in US bond yields keeps investors cautious. I must confess that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expected shares to rise this morning, after North Korea announced on Saturday that it will end its tests of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of a relief rally, as Fiona Cincotta, Senior Market Analyst, at City Index, explains: Despite Wall Street closing a solid 0.8% lower at the end of last week and mixed trading in Asia overnight, the FTSE stumbled out of the blocks on Monday in a subdued start to the week. Some geopolitical developments over the weekend, including a further easing of fears of a US china trade war and North Korea agreeing to suspend missile testing and close a nuclear site failed to lift sentiment as much as might have been expected. Eurozone exporters will be pleased to hear that the euro has fallen against the US dollar this morning. The single currency has shed almost half a percent to $1.2235, as the dollar enjoys a strong morning - tracking the rise in US bond yields. The pound has also dropped against the dollar, to a two-week low of $1.3976. Back in the City, excitement is building as the interest rate (yield) on American 10-year government debt threatens to hit 3% for the first time since January 2014. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really quite close now.... The 3% mark is turning into a psychologically important barrier, as it will highlight how US bond prices have dropped from recent record highs (yields rise as prices fall). Falling bond yields suggest that traders are expecting US inflation to pick up, forcing America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank - the Federal Reserve - to keep raising interest rates. Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet is concerned by the slowdown among companies in smaller eurozone nations - and the impact of the stronger euro: Economist Nadia Gharbi says the eurozone is struggling to keep up with its recent expansion, as supply chains are being stretched hard: We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get separate data from Italy and Spain until early next month; economist Ulrik Bie suspects they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be great Danske Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Aila Mihr predicts that the eurozone PMIs will remain at their current levels for some time: Although France and Germany are holding up well, the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s periphery is suffering a sharper slowdown -- to a 18-month low. This chart from Markit shows the details: Newsflash: growth among eurozone companies remained steady this month, as the strength of the euro hits export growth. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurozone PMI was unchanged this month at 55.2, comfortably over the 50-point mark separating expansion from contraction. This leaves the eurozone economy in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lower gear\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Markit says, after the strong growth in 2017. The service sector picked up, with activity rising to two-month high of 55.0 (from 54.9 in March). But...manufacturing growth slowed to a 14-month low of 56.0 ( from 56.6 in March). Factories reported the smallest gains in both total goods orders and export orders for 18 months, partly due the recent strength of the euro against the US dollar. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, says growth has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153downshifted markedly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in recent months: The Eurozone economy remained stuck in a lower gear in April, with business activity expanding at a rate unchanged on March, which had in turn been the slowest since the start of 2017. However, he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any signs that Europe is flirting with recession: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The April data are running at a level broadly consistent with Eurozone GDP growth of approximately 0.6% at the start of the second quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decline in the PMI from January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high is neither surprising nor alarming: such strong growth as that seen at the start of the year rarely persists for long, not least because supply fails to keep up with demand. With recent months seeing record delivery delays for inputs to factories and growing skill shortages, output is clearly being constrained. In France, strikes were also reported to have disrupted growth, and may continue to do so in coming months. But, the strength of the euro may hold growth back in the months ahead, Williamson adds: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also clear that underlying demand has weakened, in part due to exports being hit by the stronger euro. With companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 future optimism having slipped to the lowest since last year, it looks likely that growth may well slow further in coming months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Financial blogger Jeroen Blokland is also encouraged by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data: Financial portfolio manager Mario Cavaggioni is also encouraged by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output data from the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two biggest members: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is stabilising this month after suffering a slowdown earlier this year, according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI report. Phil Smith, Principal Economist at IHS Markit explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Growth of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector steadied in April, to arrest the loss of momentum seen in February and March. With both manufacturing and services seeing slightly quicker increases in output, the data show the economy making a solid start to the second quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was also a welcome pick-up in the rate of private sector job creation in April. Employment levels rose strongly on a broad-based basis by sector, albeit with the rate of hiring among manufacturers easing from the recent elevated levels. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, a further slowdown in new order growth to its weakest for over a year-and-a-half does raise some concerns. This seemed to be reflected in the survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measure of business confidence, which slipped further from the highs seen in 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more reaction: Newsflash: German\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector is growing a little faster than expected, matching France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Germany Composite Output Index has risen to 55.3 in April, up from March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 55.1 - beating forecasts of a fall to 54.8. However, Markit warns that German business leaders are less optimistic, with new orders rising at their weakest level in18 months. They say: The rate of job creation picked up to its highest for three months; however, there was less optimism among businesses towards the outlook for activity in the year ahead amid a further slowdown in new order growth. After a stellar 2017, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector does seem to have eased back a little. Reaction to follow.... The increase in the French PMI data this month should ease fears that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is weakening. Alex Gill, economist at IHS Markit, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The French private sector remained firmly in expansionary mode according to latest flash data. Indeed, at 56.9, the headline composite output figure signalled a sharper rate of growth than in March, and one that remained well above its long-run average (53.9). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After having shown signs of slowing in recent months, the data will buoy hopes that the renaissance in the French economy has far from run its course. Further encouragement can be garnered from the broad-based nature of the acceleration, with sharper growth evident in both the manufacturing and services sectors, the former on the back of marked moderations in the prior two months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd His colleague, Chris Williamson, says France seems to be growing at a solid rate: Newsflash: Growth across France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector has picked up this month, defying worries that the euro area is slowing. Data firm Markit has just reported that its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 PMI survey on the French economy has risen to 56.9 in April, up from 56.3 in March. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a stronger reading than expected - with many economists predicting that growth slowed this month. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Markit reports that growth accelerated in the service sector, although manufacturing growth did slow a little. Companies repotted that new orders have picked up this month, encouraging them to keep hiring staff. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key findings: Flash France Composite Output Index at 56.9 in April from 56.3 in March (2-month high) Flash France Services Activity Index rises to 57.4 in April (56.9 in March), 2-month high Flash France Manufacturing Output Index up to 54.7 (53.9 in March), 2-month high Flash France Manufacturing PMI drops to 53.4 (53.7 in March) 13-month low More to follow... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceuroboom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 alive and well? A new healthcheck on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s businesses this morning will highlight whether growth has slowed in 2018, as geopolitical tensions and trade spats hit confidence. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 eurozone PMI, calculated by data firm Markit, is expected to dip to 54.8 this month, down from March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 55.2. That would still show an expansion, but at a slightly slower pace. Investors would like to see a strong set of PMI data, to ease concerns that Europe might be entering a soggier patch. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains why City investors will be examining the data: Over in Europe there has been some concern that economic activity has hit its high-water mark in recent months with the only debate over whether it is merely a pause for breath or an early indication of a more significant slowdown. Investors certainly appear concerned if last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s April investor sentiment ZEW reading was any indication coming in at a 5 year low of -8.2. Despite this scepticism markets in Europe are still sitting near a one month high, with the recent slide in the euro also helping a little. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s publication of the latest German and French flash PMI data in manufacturing and services could well add further fuel to the debate about economic activity in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. These have shown signs of slowing in recent months and while it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been particularly alarming in terms of the overall headline readings the lack of inflation does speak to a lack of demand on a wider scale. The data will be closely watched by the European Central Bank, which meets later this week to set monetary policy across the eurozone. ECB policymakers are pondering whether to end their QE stimulus programme, so weakening growth would create a headache for them. Also coming up today.... Investors are also looking edgily at the bond market this morning. US government debt has been selling off in recent days, pushing up the yield (or interest rate) on 10-year Treasury bills towards 3% - a crucial level for market confidence. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, explains why it matters: Higher interest rates mean higher borrowing cost for corporates, and another sharp spike would eat away a significant element of their profitability by increasing interest expense. Investors will also readjust their required cost of capital as risk-free rates rise, which could make equities less attractive.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap: The IT crisis at TSB Bank is heading towards its eighth day, as the company continues to struggle to fix problems created by a botched IT migration last weekend. TSB has called in experts from IBM, who are now trying to fix the issues that are still preventing 50% of customers from accessing its internet banking services. CEO Paul Pester has told IBM to find a solution by Saturday - and admitted that the bank is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcon its knees\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, following the move onto new IT kit from its parent company Sabadell. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are on our knees, we will get up, and come back fighting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Sabadell has predicted that the mess won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be fixed until next week -- one reader has been told it could take five working days. The bank has begun compensating customers, with a \u00c2\u00a340 payment to a couple. It has also waived all overdraft fees in April, and pledged to raise the interest rate on its current account from 3% to 5% - worth up to \u00c2\u00a330 a year to customers. We understand the measures will cost at least \u00c2\u00a320m. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some good news for small businesses - HMRC have said they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be understanding if people can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get into their accounts to make VAT payments. Several readers have told us that they intend to close their accounts, suggesting TSB will suffer long-term damage from the IT fiasco. Some have also expressed support for TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s frontline staff, who have been through a very rough week. I may pop back later if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big breaking news. Until then, thanks for reading and commenting. Goodnight! GW Our latest news story on the TSB crisis is now live. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: TSB customers have spent their seventh successive day battling to access their accounts as the bank admitted that the crisis could run into next week. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boss, Paul Pester, said TSB will waive \u00c2\u00a310m in overdraft fees and pay extra interest on current accounts. He has hired a new team of IT experts from IBM who have been told the problems must be fixed by Saturday. However, Jaime Guardiola, the chief executive of TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Spanish owner, Banco Sabadell, said customers may have to wait until next week before normal service returns. The Guardian has uncovered images on LinkedIn of IT workers in Spain who handled the botched transfer celebrating with sparkling wine and exclaiming \u00e2\u20ac\u0153TSB transfer done and dusted!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hell of a team!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The pictures were posted just as the meltdown was beginning, and up to 1.9 million customers were subsequently locked out of their accounts. Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, writes that relations between TSB and its Spanish parent company look rather tense this week.... Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s try to be generous to Paul Pester, TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beleaguered chief executive. His handling of the fallout from the botched IT \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upgrade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has been poor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c some of his statements and tweets have been nonsensical, others have been factually wrong \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it is already clear that the primary blame for the fiasco itself lies in Spain, at the door of Banco Sabadell, TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent. Nils thinks this may explain Pester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refusal to rule out taking a bonus this year: He should have made the gesture, but he may be wondering if the internal blame game will end with his exit and the usual contractual wrangles. The head of an overseas subsidiary usually makes a suitable fall guy. More here: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a round-up of stories from TSB customers this week: Paul Pester has told the Daily Telegraph that he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet know exactly what has caused this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IT meltdown, preventing an army of customers from accessing their accounts online. Asked what the specific issue was, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I have got IBM here. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have two datacentres, miles of fibre-optic cable and several layers of software. Somewhere among that architecture are issues causing capacity constraints. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have a team of experts that will get to the bottom of this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Richard Brittain, the TSB customer who set off today to close his account (having borrowed the petrol money from a friend), has got back in touch. Richard ended up speaking with TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kent area manager - and learned that they think it might take another five working days to clear all the technical problems. The area manager was able to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the withdrawal rules, so Richard could withdraw all his fund and put them in another bank. TSB also managed to trace money that had gone missing from the account since the IT problems began. It sounds like a good effort under the circumstances. As Richard puts it: It was actually refreshing to talk to someone senior enough who could actually deliver solutions, rather than focusing on the problems. I must say, TSB need to not only compensate their customers, but they also need to recognise their staff who have been a real asset. All of the staff I have come across are genuinely sorry and they really are trying their best to help. I have been asked by the area manager to leave the current account open, so that TSB are able to gain my trust back. At the moment, TSB are going to need to work extremely hard to get the public trust back. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happened, but the way that TSB deals with this issue will be the deciding factor as to whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to remain with them. TSB has been churning out some alarming error messages this week -- baffling customers with talk of BeanFactories (to do with programming language Java) and NullPointerExemptions ( \u00c2\u00af\\_(\u00e3\u0192\u201e)_/\u00c2\u00af ). IT expert Simon Needham suspects that the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s user authentication processes aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t scaling properly -- which is why half its internet banking customers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t getting into the service. Bradley Post, managing director of Rift Tax Refunds, says TSB customers should certainly pursue the bank for compensation, and tell HMRC of any problems too. Small business using TSB may struggle to pay HMRC due to the recent problems the bank is facing with their IT systems. The good news is that HMRC will take the circumstances into consideration, however, customers need to record the problems they have encountered so they can put a case together and ensure they do not pay more than they should. The bigger issue now is how customer opinion will change for TSB with some people choosing to sort their finances elsewhere. According to Moneysavingexpert.com customers are now receiving compensation. If you are left out of pocket due to these issues you should look to contact TSB immediately\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Claire McAdam and Ian Roddie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a340 compensation is dwarfed by the bills which some small businesses may claim from TSB. For example, tiler Phil Rooney told BBC Hereford and Worcester that the chaos had already cost him thousands as he was unable to pay staff from his account. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had staff walk out on us, sub-contractors, tilers, electricians, because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not in a position to be able to pay them by the internet payments that we usually use so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost us so far \u00c2\u00a32,000 this week.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moneysavingexpert.com is reporting that the first compensation payments are already going out to customers who have complained. It said Claire McAdam and her partner Ian Roddie from Glasgow have been paid \u00c2\u00a340 compensation after McAdam was unable to access her bank account online or make a bank transfer from her account to repay money she owed on a credit card. The bank paid McAdam \u00c2\u00a315 to cover interest charged for delayed payments on her credit card, and a further \u00c2\u00a325 for inconvenience caused. The \u00c2\u00a340 was paid into McAdam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s TSB account just before noon on Thursday. If \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinconvenience\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 payments to affected customers match the \u00c2\u00a325 paid to McAdam, then TSB is in line for hefty payouts. It has 1.9m online and mobile customers, and if all received the payment the bill would be \u00c2\u00a347.5m. Broadcast journalist Natalia Crawford of Radio Clyde News has tweeted about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely disgraceful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd situation which TSB customers such as herself are suffering: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax authorities have told us that they will understanding if small businesses cannot make payments to them because of the TSB IT meltdown. Some business owners have warned that they cannot make cash transfers, such as VAT payments, to the authorities because they cannot currently get into their TSB account. Asked about the situation, a HMRC spokesperson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153HMRC will take the circumstances of TSB customers into account if asked to do so.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So, TSB customers should record evidence that this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s computer problems prevented them making their scheduled payments. If they have a reasonable excuse, in HMRC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view, they shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t incur any penalties for late payments - as long as they fix the situation when possible. That might reassure SME owners, such as animator Lee Johnson and entrepreneur George Lamptey, who have both tweeted TSB about the issue today: Just in: Paul Pester has told ITV News that IBM team of experts must fixed TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problem by Saturday. That suggests that the bank expects services to remain disrupted until then, but is perhaps hoping to recover by the start of next week (which chimes with Sabadell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments) He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also continuing to duck questions about his bonus, some of which has been held back until the IT migration was completed.... TSB customer Penny Simpson still cannot log into her account online - despite TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that things are running smoothly for the vast majority of customers. She reports that TSB refuses to accept her User ID and password. When she clicks \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcforgotten User ID\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, the bank sends her.... her old log-in details, and says they are now clear to use. So she tries, only to be told they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re incorrect.... Penny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also unpressed by Paul Pester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the underlying banking platform is working well - even though half of internet banking customers ares still locked out. This is like saying the kitchen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cooking up a storm but the restaurant can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get any food. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sick to death of Paul Pester and his shambolic communications. And, most of all, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sick of TSB using the word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as if this is a handful of customers. It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s millions. TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Classic Plus pays interest on the first \u00c2\u00a31,500 of money in the account. So, raising the interest rate on balances from 3% to 5% is actually only worth \u00c2\u00a330 to a customer per year, or \u00c2\u00a32.50 per month. Getting back (briefly) to the European Central Bank meeting in Frankfurt.... ECB chief Mario Draghi has warned that global risks such as protectionism have risen - a clear nod to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade spat with China. Draghi also point out that European economic growth seems to have moderated broadly recently, with some countries experiencing a loss of momentum. But growth is expected to remain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 solid and broad-based\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he adds -- suggesting the ECB isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bracing for a recession.... TSB customer Richard Brittain has has enough of TSB - he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on his way to his local branch to close his account, having borrowed money from a friend to pay for the petrol. He tells me that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s made 13 calls to TSB, only to be disconnected after waiting for up to two hours. Richard says: I am now going into town to get all my money out. TSB have now told me they need 7 working days to fix my current account. He also has sympathy for TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff, who have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153literally in tears\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve handled calls from customers. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think enough is being done to report these issues to TSB. Their number is just constantly engaged, and when you do get through they cut you off after a 2 hour wait in the queue. I have been without access to my bank since Friday... and now we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re being asked to wait even more! Time to move to a better bank! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m \u00c2\u00a3400 down at the moment, all because of TSB. Money is in my account and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being withheld from me! Just goes to show, you cant believe the news. TSB are telling everyone this issue is fixed, yet it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far from it. Another 2 hour wait on the phone to get through to someone, to just be told that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re \u00e2\u20ac\u0153working on it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We are on day seven now, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had no answer as to when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be fixing my issues. TSB have just asked me for 5 WORKING DAYS to get my current account \u00e2\u20ac\u0153un-deleted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and money returned. Meanwhile, the staff are literally in tears on the phone. Its not their fault that their employer decided to screw over two million of us. But, this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get my bills paid. I honestly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what else I can do. Their phone system is diabolical, I get disconnected after waiting in a queue for 2 hours!! Back to TSB, and Paul Pester has just tweeted a reminder of this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement: In other banking news, the European Central Bank has just voted to leave eurozone interest rates unchanged at 0.0%. It also repeated its promise to keep buying government bonds until at least the end of September, or until inflation has risen sustainably close to its target. Several more TSB customers have told us that they intend to close their accounts. David Green, 39, is the owner of a plant and machinery hire company in Birmingham and thinks heads should roll for the mess: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an absolute disgrace. How can I run two businesses with staff and suppliers who require paying from day-to-day? Some suppliers are refusing to serve us services as we cannot pay like we always have done. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not their fault, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect them to, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s diabolical that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been left like this. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruined my business week completely. I have staff who think we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to pay them. We have suppliers who think we are making excuses. I have to keep sending screenshots to people that question me. How embarrassing for a company which will turn over 10 million this year! How can I operate like this? Sackings should happen and the guy at the top needs to join the real world. Just because he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to use his bank every day doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean we are all in the same position as him. I will be closing my business accounts ASAP as I have lost all faith and cannot risk this happening again.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Textile designer, Lucie, 31, says it is very stressful not knowing if her money is safe: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve tried to log in however TSB doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recognise my password! The robotic repetition of apologies and responses on their website are so mind-numbingly bland and unhelpful. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve actually just come back from the bank where I tried to pay my rent and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go through. Their advice was to just: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Keep trying\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. As soon as this is over I will be switching my bank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 To say that Lorraine Kelly, 52, from London, is fuming is an understatement, she tells us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can honestly say that since the weekend it has been a nightmare. I urgently needed to transfer funds to top up my smart meter (as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m on prepay) but after 40 minutes on hold to TSB the line was cut. Having no choice I stupidly tried numerous times with the same outcome. In sheer anger I clicked on their status report and the final insult was a message saying that TSB have restricted some selected customers. What the hell? If I ever get to talk to anyone at TSB it will be to close my accounts and transfer all my money.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge that no customer will be left out of pocket as a result of the fiasco will come with a hefty price tag. The bank estimates that its decision to waive all overdraft fees and interest charges in April, as well as raise the interest rate on its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcClassic Plus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 account to 5% from 3%, will cost an estimated \u00c2\u00a320m. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on top of any regulatory fine the bank might face, as well as the (presumably large) bill for drafting in IBM to fix the problems. The Times is reporting that TSB was warned that its IT migration would flounder unless it spent more money. It says: A TSB adviser warned the bank against embarking on a major internet upgrade on the cheap, The Times can reveal. Consultants raised concerns in 2015 that the bank was not setting aside enough money for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incredibly complex\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd project to move customers to a new online system. One said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There have certainly been some examples of where it has cost significantly more to re-platform an entire bank. It is not overly generous as a budget for that scale of migration.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Parent company Sabadell reported this morning that it set aside \u00e2\u201a\u00ac71m in one-off IT costs to cover the TSB migration. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s roughly twice what UBS analysts had expected....but clearly it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough! Radio 5 Live have uploaded their interview with Paul Pester, in which he admits TSB is on its knees and promised to compensate customers from losses suffered through this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mess. TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to placate its customers by waiving overdraft fees and boosting its current account interest rate has come too late for some customers. Mark Ellison tells us that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moving his account to Metro Bank \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with a heavy heart\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as he had previously worked for TSB for five years. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also filed a complaint over this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disruption. IBM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team of experts have no time to waste -- TSB customers are continuing to report problems with their accounts. TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Spanish parent company has warned that services might not be back to normal until sometime next week! Jaime Guardiola, the CEO of Banco Sabadell, told analysts this morning that the migration onto its IT kit (from TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous owner, Lloyds) had been problematic: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fixing the problem took more time than expected and we were not able to reopen access until Wednesday. I expect next week we will reach something very close to normality,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is quite a u-turn. On Monday, Sabadell announced that the weekend migration was a success, only to quietly remove that press release the next day..... Guardiola also reiterated TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to compensate customers, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will make sure that no customer is left out of pocket and we are asking customers to file complaints that will be processed. Waiving overdraft fees is a good start, but it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tackle all the losses suffered by TSB customers this week. People could be hit by late fees, for example, if they fail to meet credit card bills or other loan repayments. Clea Bourne, lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London, says the whole financial sector should show some understanding . The decision to call in IBM tech experts to tackle TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IT problems suggests that the problem is bigger than the company realised and may take several days to fix. Remember, at 3.40am yesterday Paul Pester was confidently tweeting that things were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcup and running\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 again -- something that is going to haunt TSB chief for a while. Now he actually has to make it happen, declaring: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will take direct control from 8 o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122clock this morning for our platform, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve drafted in a team of global experts from IBM. They are reporting to me, directly to me and I will take control of the platform until it gets fixed. I am putting things right.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Q: Were you warned last week that you weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready for this IT migration? We were ready for the platform switch, CEO Paul Pester insists. TSB expected some turbulence, but no-one expected the issues that have hit the bank since the weekend. Q: Have you considered resigning? I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even had time to think about it, Pester replies. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the Radio 5 interview. Paul Pester is now being grilled on Radio 5 Live over TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IT mayhem. Q: Why didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you give more information to customers, and claim that everything was fixed when it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t? Pester says that the fundamentals of the bank, such as standing orders, direct debits, ATM machines, are working well. The problem is with capacity -- handling the number of customers who want to use internet and mobile banking services. Q: Why did you tweet that TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcup and running\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 , when for many customers it clearly wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t? Pester says TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IT provider (parent company Sabadell) told him it was fixed. Clearly that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the case. However, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now taken personal control - a team of experts from IBM will land at Bristol at 8am his morning, and start to tackle the problem. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unacceptable that only 50% of customers can access our internet banking, declares Pester. Q: Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it also unacceptable that you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have control of your customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accounts over the weekend? Pester ducks the question; instead, he plugs the decision to waive overdraft fees and raise the interest rate on the Classic Plus current account for current customers who \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stick with us\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This is a fight worth fighting. TSB was created to bring more competition into UK banking. Q: Will customers be properly compensated? No customer will be left out of pocket, Pester pledges. We won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be penny-pinching. Small businesses who have suffered losses because they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been able to pay suppliers or contractors should get in touch. Asked whether he would be giving up a potential \u00c2\u00a31.6m bonus, Pester told BBC Radio 4 that it was a matter for the company: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The last thing I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m worried about at the moment is bonuses and pay. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m focused on putting things right for customers. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not my decision, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a focus for them [the board]. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a decision for the remuneration committee.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Speaking on Radio 4, Paul Pester says he has taken control of TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IT platform himself - to tackle the problems that mean only 50% of its customers can get online. NEWSFLASH: TSB has announced that it will waive all overdraft fees and interest charges for retail customers and small business owners for April, as it tries to assuage the anger over its IT meltdown this week. After days of turmoil, TSB has also decided to raise the interest rate on its popular \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcClassic Plus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 account to 5% (a very decent interest rate these days), from 3% -- an attempt to prevent customers fleeing to a rival. In a statement, it says: No TSB customer will be left out of pocket as a result of these issues \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to begin to put this right we will be waiving all overdraft fees and interest charges for all of our retail and small business customers for April. As a way of saying thank you to our customers for sticking with us, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be increasing the interest rate on our Classic Plus account to 5% AER. CEO Paul Pester admits that TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s migration to new servers last weekend had been very unsatisfactory. He says: As we moved over to our new banking platform last weekend, the landing was an incredibly bumpy one for our customers, and for that I am truly sorry. This is not the level of service that we pride ourselves on providing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nor is it what our customers have come to expect from TSB.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of course, customers can rest assured that no one will be left out of pocket as a result of these problems. To begin to put things right, we will be waiving all overdraft fees and interest charges for all of our retail and small business customers for April. TSB also reveals they they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve called experts from IBM in to help fix the problems with its internet banking. In the meantime, customers still report problems: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. One of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst IT botches of recent years continues to rumble on today. TSB customers are still reporting that they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t access the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online systems, nearly a week after they were taken down for a planned IT migration. Last night, TSB admitted that its internet banking service is only running at 50% capacity - which helps explain why scores of users have been locked out. In the eurozone, the European Central Bank is meeting to set monetary policy. Investor will hope for hints about how the ECB will handle its money-printing stimulus programme, which currently runs until September. In the markets, European stocks are expected to nudge higher after Facebook posted record earning figures last night, suggesting its data privacy problems haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hurt profitability. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 12.45pm BST: ECB decision on interest rates 1.30pm BST: ECB chief Mario Draghi holds a press conference 1.30pm BST: US trade figures for March",

                "bodyText":"Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has responded to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth slowdown....by hitting its highest level in almost three months. The FTSE too jumped 80 points to close at 7,502, its highest finish since 31 January. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mainly due to the slide in the pound, which pushes up the value of exporters (as their overseas earnings are more valuable). Major multinational firms led the risers, including Burberry (+3%), Unilever (+2.5), and Diageo (+2.2%). European stock markets showed more modest gains, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX gaining 0.65% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC up 0.5%. Markets were also cheered by the remarkable scenes from Korea today, where the leaders of North and South have held talks and even hugged like a couple of old friends. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, says: The drop in the pound has helped the FTSE 100. The British equity benchmark is internationally focused and the slide in the pound has helped the market hit its highest level since early February. The geopolitical mood is improving after the historic meeting between North and South Korean leaders, as it suggest the two nations are on the road to peace. And that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to wrap up. Thanks, and have a good weekend. GW These charts help tell the (unhappy) story of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy in the last three months: Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says there are three reasons why the UK economy slowed to a near-standstill in the last three months. First, construction had a terrible start to the year, with a drop in output of more than 3%. Without that, growth would have been 0.3%, in line with City forecasts. Activity had been weak in every month, not only in late February and early March, the ONS made clear. Some analysts said the first-quarter collapse of the construction company Carillion, which had knock-on effects to smaller subcontracting firms, had a bigger impact than the weather. Second, the strong performance by manufacturing during 2017 came to an end in early 2018. Factory output was up 1.3% in the final three months of last year but by 0.2% in the latest quarter. A slowdown in the eurozone has led to weaker demand for UK exports but survey evidence suggests that manufacturers have run into capacity constraints following years of underinvestment. Third, the lack of spending power for consumers is having an impact on the service sector, which accounts for around 80% of the economy and grew by only 0.3% in the first quarter. More here: Back in the markets, the pound has hit an eight-week low as traders continue to digest Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alarmingly sharp slowdown. Sterling has shed a cent and a half, to $1.37, its lowest point since the start of March. The pound has also shed one eurocent against the euro, dropping to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.14. Investors are concluding that an early UK interest rate rise now looks a lot less likely, given the weak growth in the last quarter - and the fact that the poor weather is only partly to blame. Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM, says the UK GDP figures have undermined the pound sharply. Buying sentiment towards the British Pound was dealt a severe blow on Friday, following reports that the U.K economy grew much slower than expected in Q1. U.K GDP growth slowed to 0.1% in the first quarter, much worse than the expected 0.3%, and its weakest since 2012. While the snow had some negative impacts on GDP, the bad weather really can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bear all the blame - its effects on growth were small. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dismal GDP figures have not only dented confidence in the health of the U.K economy, but also in the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to raise interest rates in May. With the Pound notorious for its extreme sensitivity to monetary policy speculation, further downside is likely as investors heavily reduce bets of a rate hike next month. NEWSFLASH: The Bank of England and the European Central Bank are teaming up to protect the financial services industry from Brexit risks. Details are sparse, but presumably it will look at the issue of access to the EU by City banks after Brexit, passporting, regulatory equivalence, and the huge number of EU-based derivative contracts owned by UK banks. In a statement, the UK government says: Today, the European Commission and HM Treasury have asked the European Central Bank and the Bank of England to convene a technical working group on risk management in the period around 30 March 2019 in the area of financial services. The European Commission and HM Treasury will attend as observers and other relevant authorities will be invited on an issue-specific basis. This technical work is separate from the on-going negotiations on the Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and the UK and from the negotiations on the overall understanding of the framework for the future relationship between the EU and the UK. In a nutshell.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on the American growth figures: U.S. GDP growth moderated in the first quarter, but at least part of the slowdown is statistical coming from residual seasonality in the data. Real GDP grew 2.3%, better than expected but below the 2.9% in the fourth quarter and the weakest growth in a year, according to the advanced estimate from the BEA. Growth, though modest, was widespread including investment, consumer spending, trade and government. Imports and durable goods spending were drags. Real disposable income growth accelerated to 3.4% on the back of tax cuts, after rising 1.1% in the fourth quarter. The saving rate jumped to 3.1%, from 2.6% in the fourth quarter. The US GDP report shows that consumer spending, the biggest portion of the American economy, only rose by 1.1% in the last quarter. However, business investment remained solid, and trade boosted growth (having been a drag on growth at the end of last year). Growth in government spending slowed to 1.2%, from 3%, but inventory building by companies added almsost 0.5% to growth. That all added up to a growth rate of 2.3% (if the pattern in Q1 was expanded over the full year) - a little better than expected. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some snap reaction: NEWSFLASH: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew much faster than Britain in the first three months of this year. US GDP expanded by almost 0.6% between January and March, or at an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcannualised rate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of 2.3%. That beats forecasts of 2.0% annualised growth, but is a little slower than the 2.9% recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. More to follow.... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about to discover how America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy fared in the first three months of this year. But first, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the disappointing UK growth figures: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy slowed to a virtual standstill in the first three months of 2018, the weakest period of activity in more than five years. Office for National Statistics figures showed a sharp contraction in the construction sector, weaker manufacturing growth and a squeeze on consumer spending power contributed to GDP growth of 0.1% in the first quarter. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the economy was strong and that the exceptional weather in late February and early March had been partly to blame for the slowdown. The ONS, however, said the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beast from the east\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had been only a minor factor. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The truth is that the last eight years of Tory economic failure has allowed our economy to be left exposed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear to everyone except Philip Hammond that our economy is in need of increased investment and working families are struggling with the cost of living and the burden of increasing household debt.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One week of snow doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain a decade of weak growth, dismal productivity and falling wages. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the avalanche of cuts that has done the long-term damage.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The performance of the economy was much worse than the Bank of England had been expecting and almost certainly puts paid to any chance of an interest rate rise when the monetary policy committee meets early next month. City firm Fathom Consulting reckon there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an evens chance that Britain suffers two quarters of negative growth this year - the official definition of a recession. In another worrying sign, the ONS says there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153longer-term weakening\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector, particularly in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153domestic consumer-facing industries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing the details of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK GDP report: TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady blames government cutbacks for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One week of snow doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain a decade of weak growth, dismal productivity and falling wages. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the avalanche of cuts that has done the long-term damage. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to modernise Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure. The government should set up a National Investment Bank to upgrade roads and rail, and to bring high-speed broadband and clean energy to every part of Britain. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to get our public services back up to strength. Schools, hospitals and other vital services are part of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core economy. If they remain starved of resources, the rest of the economy will continue to struggle too.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Evening Standard (edited by former chancellor-turned-newspaper editor George Osborne) has pinned the blame firmly on Brexit: The latest figures out today show gross domestic product grew by just 0.1 per cent in the first three months of this year. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a sharp fall in construction, manufacturing barely grew and the consumer is squeezed by higher inflation. All this against the backdrop of a world economy that, by contrast, is going gangbusters. Two years ago, Britain was the fastest growing of the major Western economies. Then the country voted to leave the EU, and the Government said we would also leave the single market and customs union. Now we are the slowest growing of the major Western economies. Draw your own conclusions. Liz Truss, chief secretary to the Treasury, says Britain is still \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTiggerish\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 despite the slowdown (referencing a line from chancellor Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget speech) Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures also show that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has only expanded by 1.2% in the last year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much slower than average, illustrating how growth has slowed in recent quarters. Professor Costas Milas and Dr Mike Ellington of the University of Liverpool argue that such weak growth \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kills the case\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the Bank of England raising UK interest rates next month. How likely is for this first GDP estimate to be revised upwards? Our database suggests that since 2006, the ONS has produced a first annual GDP growth reading which has on average been only 0.11 percentage points lower than the revised one. Therefore, if history repeats itself, the revised GDP growth reading will be only slightly higher at 1.2%+0.11%=1.31% which is equally disappointing! MPC members cannot, and will not, ignore the fact that the latest data for GDP growth and inflation are substantially weaker than their most recent predictions. Annual GDP growth of 1.2% is far below their forecast in February 2018 that suggested 1.65% was the most likely outcome for the first quarter of 2018. Likewise, the figure for 2018Q1 CPI inflation, of 2.7%, is also far lower than their prediction of 2.92% reported in February 2018. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official spokesman has opined: Alfie Stirling, Head of Economics at the New Economics Foundation, makes an important point - the link between wages and economic growth has frayed badly since the financial crisis: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP estimates from the Office for National Statistics are again disappointing, and fall far short of what would be expected from a healthy economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But worse still is that GDP growth of any kind is no longer leading to higher real wages. Since 2010, GDP growth has become \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdecoupled\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from growth in pay with the latest estimates showing that total pay in February was the lowest monthly level seen for 2 years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This grim phenomenon is unique, both to the community of major economies and to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own historical record. It points to an economic model that is no longer working for people.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Danielle Haralambous, UK analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buying the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsnow excuse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 either. She says: Growth was surprisingly soft in the first quarter of 2018, even lower than our expectation, which factored in the impact of bad weather in February-March. This hit output in the construction sector particularly hard, but there is more to the story than snow, and the slowdown will be a big consideration in the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deliberations next month. Ivan Petrella, associate professor at Warwick Business School, says the UK economy is showing signs of weakness - and Brexit may well be to blame. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP number confirms a recent trend of slow growth and a weakening economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One is tempted to attribute a large part of that to uncertainty following the Brexit referendum. In fact, after the initial boost to growth associated to the fall of the pound, the UK economy considerably under-performed with respect to its European partners last year and shows all the signs of heading for the same trend this year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rob Kent-Smith of the Office for National Statistics on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock slowdown: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our initial estimate shows the UK economy growing at its slowest pace in more than five years, with weaker manufacturing growth, subdued consumer-facing industries and construction output falling significantly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the snow had some impact on the economy, particularly in construction and some areas of retail, its overall effect was limited with the bad weather actually boosting energy supply and online sales.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd John McDonnell MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chancellor, says Philip Hammond should blame his own government, not the weather, for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alarmingly weak growth this year. McDonnell argues that the UK urgently needs fresh investment: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing GDP figures further confirm that continued Tory austerity cuts are weakening growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Chancellor will want to blame this all on a bit of bad weather, but the ONS say this had a limited impact. The truth is that the last eight years of Tory economic failure has allowed our economy to be left exposed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is the weakest Q1 growth since 2012. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear to everyone except Philip Hammond that our economy is in need of increased investment and working families are struggling with the cost of living and the burden of increasing household debt. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The next Labour government will end austerity and provide the investment vitally needed to kick-start the economy to deliver rising living standards for the many, not the few.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd UK chancellor Philip Hammond has blamed the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBeast from the East\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak growth, saying that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exceptional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bad weather had some impact. One problem, chancellor.... the Office for National Statistics says the snow only had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153generally small\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd impact. According to the ONS, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services industries were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broadly unaffected\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the bad weather, while there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no evidence to show that the fall in the manufacturing growth was due to the effects of the snow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tej Parikh, senior economist at the Institute of Directors, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153particularly disappointing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Growth has slowed much more sharply expected, and he singles out Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU as a factor: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The icy weather slowed industrial deliveries, grounded construction projects, and pushed consumers off the high-street, so some cooling was expected. But it clear that some further underlying weakness persists in the economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It should hopefully bounce back this quarter. Some of the business activity lost due to the snow will be recovered over the coming months, leading to a rebound in the figures. Consumer spending power will also be bolstered by the fall in inflation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But, the bigger picture remains one of a safe but sluggish economy. Confidence amongst business leaders, whilst no longer outright pessimistic, remains very much on the fence, and that is largely a result of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the precise nature of Brexit. Dr Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is suffering from political paralysis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sadly, the latest GDP figures confirm what we have been saying for some time: the UK is stuck in the global growth slow lane, while other countries race ahead. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Westminster politicians need to start focusing their attention on a much stronger, more proactive drive to boost growth and investment. While the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBeast from the East\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 clearly had an impact in the first quarter, the underlying slow-growth trend is real cause for concern. Marshall adds that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153faltering infrastructure, a training system in chaos and patchy digital connectivity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are all holding the economy back. Most worryingly, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has actually shrunk - once you adjust for population increases. Although gross domestic product has risen by a meagre 0.1% in the last three months, it contracted by 0.1% on a per-capita basis. The ONS is adamant that this slowdown can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just be blamed on the icy weather that blasted Britain over the winter: There were gasps on the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading floors (and in at least one newsroom) when the unexpectedly weak UK growth figures were released. Jeremy Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst, says the slowdown in growth caused \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a sharp intake of breath\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. 0.1% is the lowest quarter on quarter growth since Q4 2012 with particular weakness seen in construction and services sectors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sectors worth over 80% of the UK economy. There are some caveats within this number of course; it is only the advance reading and therefore subject to revision and the poor weather that the UK suffered will have had a large effect on demand, particularly private consumption. That being said, March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers were horrific, are unlikely to be part of the sample yet and any revision to this advance number could easily be lower as opposed to higher.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just UK voters who could call themselves the JAMs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Just About Managing - it now seems that the wider UK economy is in that predicament too.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Marc Br\u00c3\u00bctsch, chief economist at insurance group Swiss Life, says the UK economy failed to hit expectations: Economist Howard Archer also fears that the economy is weakening: Sterling is tumbling as City traders react to the news that the UK economy barely grew in the last three months. The pound has lost a whole cent against the US dollar to $1.3815, its lowest level since 9 March. Investors are wagering that the Bank of England will be reluctant to raise interest rates next month, when the UK economy looks so fragile. The Office for National Statistics reports that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector shrank sharply in the last three months, dragging the UK growth rate down to just 0.1%. The ONS says: UK GDP growth was the slowest since Quarter 4 2012, with construction being the largest downward pull on GDP, falling by 3.3%. Production increased by 0.7%, with manufacturing growth slowing to 0.2%; slowing manufacturing was partially offset by an increase in energy production due to the below-average temperatures. The services industries were the largest contributor to GDP growth, increasing by 0.3% in Quarter 1 2018, although the longer-term trend continues to show a weakening in services growth. While some impacts on GDP from the snow in the first quarter of 2018 have been recorded for construction and retail sales, the effects were generally small, with very little impact observed in other areas of the economy. BREAKING! UK economic growth slowed sharply in the first three months of 2018, with GDP rising by just 0.1%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the weakest quarterly growth since the last three months of 2012, and a worse result than expected. More to follow.... Tensions is building as the City prepares for the first estimate of UK GDP to be released, in just three minutes... Economist Catherine Colebrook has written about the shortcomings with GDP in the Guardian today. She says it fails to measure whether poverty is being reduced, whether the environment is being protected, or if people are happier (themes that Bobby Kennedy picked up in 1968). She explains: If we want to understand whether the economy is really delivering for its citizens, we need some new indicators. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), where I am the chief economist, is proposing a dashboard of five outcome indicators, to be updated annually, which would directly measure our progress against the outcomes the public wants the economy to deliver \u00e2\u20ac\u201c broadly shared prosperity, justice and sustainability. Our chosen indicators are the distribution of the gains from growth; poverty rates among children and adults; levels of wellbeing among individuals at different income levels; the gap between the median income of the poorest region of the UK and the richest; and the gap between projected carbon emissions and the cost-effective path to decarbonisation. Suren Thiru of the British Chambers of Commerce is also expecting a UK slowdown.... Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, says there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a risk that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate slowed sharply in the first quarter of this year, to below the City forecast of 0.3%. If so, that would cut the chances that the Bank of England raises interest rates next month. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now 50 years since Robert F. Kennedy gave his now-famous speech explaining why gross domestic product is a flawed measure that tracks \u00e2\u20ac\u0153everything, except that which makes life worthwhile\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Youtube clip of the speech, given to the University of Kansas in March 1968, three months before Kennedy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assassination. As Kennedy brilliantly put it: It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts Whitman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rifle and Speck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. The UK Treasury have created a short video explaining GDP: Sylvia Walter, senior economist at insurance company Swiss Life, says the French government shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic about the slowdown: Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that the current rolling strikes on France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s railways will hurt growth this quarter. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Marcus Bensasson says bad weather hurt the French manufacturing sector: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy saw growth slow sharply in the first quarter as winter storms ripped through the country, hitting factory production. Gross domestic product expanded 0.3 percent, the weakest in more than a year and less than half the 0.7 percent pace recorded in the previous three months. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also slightly below the 0.4 percent estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Just in: Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has posted another quarter of solid growth. Spanish GDP rose by 0.7% during the first three months of this year, official figures show. That means Spain has grown by 0.7% per quarter for nine months in a row. The annual growth rate dipped slightly, to 2.9% from 3.1%, but is still fairly strong. Bad weather, falling business investment and weaker export growth have combined to slow the French economy. Statistics firm INSEE explains that a series of factors meant French growth slowed to just 0.3% in the last three months, from a bouncy 0.7% in the last three months of 2017. According to INSEE: French household consumption rose by 0.2%, the same as three months earlier Business investment (gross fixed capital formation) dropped to +0.6%, from +1.1% Exports fell by 0.1%, having risen by 2.5% in October-December. Manufacturing production shrank by 1.1%, compared with 1.5% growth previously That all adds up to a chunky slowdown - economists had expected growth to slow to +0.4%. Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a poor - but not catastrophic - result, adding: [Annual] Growth of above 2.5 per cent in the second half of 2017 was never going to be sustained for long, and one-off factors such as weather also likely dented consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 spending in Q1. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we get a major healthcheck on the global economy with new growth figures for Britain, the United States, France and Spain. Economists predict they will show a slowdown on both sides of the Atlantic in the first three months of this year, as bad weather and worries over trade wars hit growth. In the UK, quarterly growth is tipped to fall to 0.3%, from 0.4% in October-December. That would be rather weak performance in historical terms., below the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term trend growth rate. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada thinks Britain could have suffered an even sharper slowdown, given the bitter weather that gripped the country this winter. Q1 GDP is out today, but will likely be affected to the severe weather conditions in the quarter. Our economists are in line with consensus (0.3% q/q), but markets would probably be tolerant of a downside miss in particular, given the weather-related uncertainty. US growth is also expected to have slowed, from around 0.7% to 0.5% on a quarterly basis. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says the American growth figures will be closely scrutinised by investors. Economic growth in the first quarter is forecast to have slowed to 2% on an annualised basis, down from 2.9%, as consumers spending braked sharply. This is expected to more of a bump in the road rather than the start of a full on change in direction for the US economy, which remains supported by a tightening labour market and sizeable tax cut. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just learned that French growth rate slowed sharply, to just 0.3% from 0.7% in the previous quarter. That appears to confirm fears that the eurozone is slowing, after a strong 2017 (more in a moment). Also coming up today We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be watching the ongoing tech problems at TSB Bank, as customers still struggle to access their accounts a week after its IT migration. Eurozone finance ministers will be meeting to discuss Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout, which expires this summer. The Bank of England is launching a new educational resource to help young people understand how the economy works.

The big supermarkets have recently cut thousands of back-office and shopfloor jobs in a drive to cut costs.

                "bodyText":"Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Asda are in talks over a \u00c2\u00a310bn merger that would send shockwaves through the high street by creating a retailer more powerful than the current market leader, Tesco. A tie-up between the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second- and third-largest supermarket chains would create a new group with huge share of the market in food, clothing, household goods and toy retailing. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already owns Argos while Asda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s George clothing brand vies with Marks &amp; Spencer and Primark to sell the most clothing in volume terms. The enlarged supermarket group would have nearly 3,000 stores and annual sales of more than \u00c2\u00a350bn. Any proposed deal is likely to be closely scrutinised by the competition watchdog over concerns it would tighten the grip the four major supermarket chains \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Tesco, Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Asda and Morrisons \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have on the UK grocery market. Analysts also suggest the combination could lead to thousands of job losses as the two chains cut out duplication. The big supermarkets have recently cut thousands of back-office and shopfloor jobs in a drive to cut costs. They are trying to rebuild their profits, which have collapsed as the fast-growing German discounters Aldi and Lidl have stolen shoppers, while online players led by Amazon have sucked sales out of the high street. Mike Coupe, the chief executive of London-based Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, is said to be in the driving seat, making the future of Asda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Leeds head office look uncertain.

Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promised to provide more details to the stock exchange on Monday morning. It has previously been unthinkable that there would be consolidation among the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big four supermarkets because of competition concerns, but the retailers are said to have been emboldened after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) waved through the merger of Tesco and Booker, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest retailer and grocery wholesaler respectively. The deal comes at a time of major upheaval in the retail sector as Aldi and Lidl become increasingly powerful and the cost of running high street stores increases because of higher business rates and labour costs.
