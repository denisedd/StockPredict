It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still early in the US trading session however.</p> <p>The attraction of the music-streaming service probably lies in Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong market share and rapidly growing revenues. It may be some time before Spotify actually turns a profit though, as the company is resolutely prioritising growth over profit, and will be channelling money into investing in services and building further scale.</p> <p>Unlike its main competitors Apple and Amazon, Spotify is focused on music streaming, so it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t benefit from the network effects of a wider ecosystem.

                "bodyText":"And finally, Spotify has closed at $149 per share. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a drop from its opening level of $165.9, but still 13% above the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreference price\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of $132. That values Spotify at around $26.6bn, more than some analysts had suggested before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our tale of the latest tech float: Goodnight! GW A recovery rally on Wall Street has helped the US stock market recover a chunk of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls. The Dow Jones industrial average has closed 1.65% higher, up 389 points at 24,033 - having lost over 450 points yesterday. Traders were encouraged by reports that the White House was not planning action against Amazon. Spotify may have bucked the trend with its direct listing, but its ownership structure is depressingly familiar, says our financial editor Nils Pratley. Its founders are wedded to keeping vice-like control via a share structure with unequal voting rights. For unequal, read unfair: Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzen own 38.9% of the ordinary shares but they have created \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beneficiary certificates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with super-charged voting rights that only they can own. Include those holdings and Ek and Lorentzen have 80.4% of the votes. As the prospectus is obliged to concede: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If our founders act together, they will have control over the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of directors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Put another way, for as long as the duo stick together, they are unsackable. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, says Spotify has a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgreat story\u00e2\u20ac\u2122; even so, people should be cautious when investing. He explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSpotify is floating on the stock market at a pretty inauspicious time for the tech industry, which has been rocked by the Facebook data scandal and now potentially faces greater regulation as a result. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweeted attacks on Amazon don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help lift sentiment towards the sector either. Despite the downbeat mood music, Spotify shares changed hands on the market at a substantial premium to the highest price previously paid in private transactions, indicating significant investor demand for the stock. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still early in the US trading session however. The attraction of the music-streaming service probably lies in Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong market share and rapidly growing revenues. It may be some time before Spotify actually turns a profit though, as the company is resolutely prioritising growth over profit, and will be channelling money into investing in services and building further scale. Unlike its main competitors Apple and Amazon, Spotify is focused on music streaming, so it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t benefit from the network effects of a wider ecosystem. However the company has already carved out a dominant role, and has demonstrated its ability to leverage scale by renegotiating agreements with music labels, boosting its gross margin from 12% to 21% since 2015. The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Danni Hewson is impressed by the streaming service\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening debut: Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alex Webb points out that Spotify is now worth more than some established players (despite having never made a profit!) Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some video of the moment Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares joined the market: Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are bouncing around in early trading, as investors weigh up whether to buy in at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening price. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just slipped below $164, from the opening price of $165.9. Early days, though.... The Wall Street Journal says Spotify has hit the markets with a bang: Spotify Technology roared onto the public market Tuesday as the music-streaming giant pulled off an unusual method of going public. The stock opened at $165.90 and traded in a close range immediately after. With an opening value of $29.55 billion, Spotify is poised to become the third-largest U.S.-listed tech IPO on record, according to Dealogic. That \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunusual method\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 involved spurning the investment banks who would have underwritten the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares (providing a safety net for the market debut), in return for a large fee. AT LAST! Spotify is finally trading, after more than three hours of intense discussions on the Wall Street trading floor. Shares have opened for trading at $165.90, sharply higher than the $132 which had been suggested. That, by my maths, values Spotify at around $29.5bn. I imagine the company should be pretty pleased - this is a sharp jump on the value of its shares earlier this year (when they could only be traded privately between shareholders). On a lighter note, the New York Stock Exchange has confirmed that it accidentally flew a Swiss flag to mark Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing -- which is unfortunate as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually a Swedish company. More here: Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely market valuation is pushing closer to $30bn, as its unconventional \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdirect listing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 continues to play out on the trading floor There are 178.1 million Spotify shares in existence (although the company is only offering around a third to New York investors today). So if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing hits $170, as seems possible, the company could be worth several billion dollars more than forecast. Market makers on Wall Street are continuing to haggle over Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s valuation, pushing its likely share price value even higher: After a edgy day, European stock markets have closed mostly in the red. The escalation of tensions between China and the US over tariffs hit sentiment in the City, and beyond, as traders returned to their desks after the Easter break. Anxiety over the tech sector also weighed on shares, despite the interest in Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing in New York, and Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upbeat statement. The slowdown in eurozone factory growth last month also didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide traders with any fresh optimism. So, the FTSE 100 finished 26 points lower, or 0.4%, at 7,030. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX shed almost 0.7%, but France was calmer and Italy actually rallied a little. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, thinks Europe could be a safe-haven from some of the turbulence in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets. It was a rough start to the second quarter for European equities. Still, next to the losses seen on Wall Street on Monday, the damage in Europe was contained. Europe is out of the firing line for Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs for now and has a lower weighting in technology companies compared to the US. Both factors make Europe a relative haven from the current negative news flow. Higher still and higher.... Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are now seen opening at $150-$160 - indicating that its stock market listing is going well. Wall Street is pushing higher in volatile trading. The Dow is now up 256 points, or 1% -- which would recover around half of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153investors continue to process the latest chess-moves in the nascent trade war between China and the US,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, so this bounce-back might be fragile. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is 0.2% higher, partly thanks to Tesla which is rallying after sticking to its pledge to more than double production of its Model 3 by the end of June. Those early prices suggest that Spotify could be worth around $27bn, I think. Not too shabby, given the company hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t made a profit out of its 157 million customers. Ooooh - Spotify is being priced at between $145 and $155 per share. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than the $132 which had been pencilled in. This delay is because the company decided not to use investment banks to underwrite its offering -- saving it millions of dollars in fees. So, if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing goes smoothly, other companies might consider taking the same track. Donald Trump is refusing to back down in his fight against Amazon, and just fired off a new tweet: Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market listing is underway...but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what price its shares are trading at yet. Wall Street has opened a little higher, as traders hope to recovery from Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. The Dow has gained 0.5% in early trading, up 123 points at 23,767 Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some early reaction to Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new production numbers: Just in: Electric carmaker Tesla has just released its latest eagerly-awaited production figures, which confirm rumours that it has missed some of its own targets. Tesla says it produced 34,494 vehicles in the last three months, 40% more than the final quarter of 2017. This makes January-March \u00e2\u20ac\u0153by far the most productive quarter in Tesla history\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it says. This includes 9,766 Model 3s (Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new model), and 24,728 were Model S and Model X vehicles. Tesla also reveals that it has ramped up production recently -- amid reports that founder Elon Musk has taken personal control of car output in recent days (and even been sleeping at the factory). The company says: In the past seven days, Tesla produced 2,020 Model 3 vehicles. In the next seven days, we expect to produce 2,000 Model S and X vehicles and 2,000 Model 3 vehicles. It is a testament to the ability of the Tesla production team that Model 3 volume now exceeds Model S and Model X combined. What took our team five years for S/X, took only nine months for Model 3. However, Musk had previously aimed to produce 2,500 Tesla 3 cars each week by now. So Tesla hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hit that goal yet. But crucially, it says it still aims to get production of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc3\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 model up to 5,000 per week in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcabout\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 three months. Shares are rallying in pre-market trading - up around 6% Spotify logos have sprung up at Wall Street, ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing: New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market may claw back some of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses when trading resumes in under an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. The Dow Jones index is expected to rise by 0.6%, or around 140 points, judging by the futures markets. That would take a small bite out of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout, when it lost over 450 points (and was down 730 points at one stage). Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA says the markets are still nervous, though: The second quarter got off to a rough start on Monday, with trade war fears and declining tech stocks taking their toll on investor sentiment, but we are seeing a small rebound ahead of the open on Wall Street. US futures are up to half a percentage point higher on Tuesday, but this pales in comparison to the losses recorded on Monday and reflects ongoing weakness in stocks. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attacks on Amazon over the weekend put the spotlight back on the tech sector, as it tries to recover from the Facebook data scandal that threatens more regulation. Pressure on the sector doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to be going away in the near-term which will continue to act as a drag on indices. Traders might need their tin hats this spring... In less than 90 minutes, music streaming site Spotify will join the US stock exchange. You can get up to speed quickly with our explainer, which outlines why the popular service (which has never turned a profit) could be worth up to $25bn - and why today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing could be particularly lively.... Joe Weisenthal of Bloomberg is questioning whether Donald Trump has really hurt Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price (as suggested earlier). He points out that other tech companies have suffered similar falls, even though they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been spared a digital roasting from the president: However, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d suggest that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack on Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax affairs (and its implications for the digital companies) are one of several factors weighing on markets. And sometimes, investors like to have an excuse to sell -- especially if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting jittery. Bad news: another 97 workers at the collapsed UK construction and outsourcing group Carillion have lost their jobs. That take the total redundancies at the company to 1,802, since it was liquidated in January in one of the biggest UK corporate failures in years. Some 9,946 jobs have been saved (because other companies have taken on the contracts they work on). Sky is bucking today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff, after a cunning scheme to help Rupert Murdoch take full control of the broadcaster emerged. Disney has \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexpressed interest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in buying Sky News, a move that might clear the way for Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox company take control of the 61% of Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already own. 21CF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid has been hit by media plurality concerns - given Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong position in UK media (including owning the Times and Sun newspapers). But those worries might abate, if Sky News wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t part of the package. Jolly decent of Disney to offer to help, eh? Not exactly. The US giant has its own motive - namely to take over Fox (including all of Sky) in a $66bn (\u00c2\u00a347bn) deal. That takeover risks being derailed because Comcast recently launched its own takeover offer for Sky. Sky shares have risen to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, up 1.5% at \u00c2\u00a313.15. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s higher than either Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer (\u00c2\u00a312.50) or Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (\u00c2\u00a310.75), suggesting traders expect a higher bid. City firm Liberum expects Fox to strike back: We think the news and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments from Sky point to a revised bid from Fox/Disney to trump Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1250p bid. More here: Two and a half-hours into the new trading quarter, and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is still down. The FTSE 100 is currently 46 points lower or 0.6%, at 7010. Industrial stocks, utilities and telecoms firms are leading the selloff. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital blames the double-whammy of trade tensions following China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs, and the tech selloff in America: On tech\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on the market, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a case of the star performers suffering and this has a big psychological effect on sentiment. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just that they have been behind the bulk of the gains in recent years and therefore exert an outsized effect on indices when they sell off; there is also a kind of network effect on other stocks. On trade, there is hope that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to US sanctions is sufficiently moderate and contained to prevent further escalation. However we await to see where this goes and whatever happens from here, there is no \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the sense that the direction of travel is either one-way or going no further \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we are not about to see a freeing up of global trade (reversal of tariffs), which would be risk-positive. Even if there is no further escalation, the background music is risk-off. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardly unusual for Donald Trump to lash out on Twitter -- as Hillary Clinton, CNN, the FBI, several senators and the Mexican government can all testify. But still, his trenchant criticism of Amazon in recent days has caused a real stir in the markets for several reasons, helping to fuel this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market selloff. Partly, because Trump is taking the side of the old-economy - tweeting that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fully tax paying retailers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are being forced to shut stores because (he claims) Amazon is getting an unfairly good deal. Politifact, a US website, has debunked Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the US Postal Service is losing money thanks to Amazon. It says: Amazon isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t causing the United States Postal Service to lose a fortune. In fact, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contributing to its biggest growth sector, package delivery. Deals like the one with Amazon brought in $7 billion in fiscal year 2017. But still, the US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments suggest that other tech disruptors could also come under fire -- especially if changes are made to the US tax system to help traditional retailers. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the only concern. Some industry figures are concerned that Amazon (whose shares fell 5% yesterday) is being hammered because its founder, Jeff Bezos, also owns the Washington Post. Vanity Fair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gabriel Sherman is reporting that Trump is firmly focused on Bezos, thanks to the Post\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of his presidency: Sherman says: He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s off the hook on this. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s war,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd one source told me. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He gets obsessed with something, and now he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obsessed with Bezos,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said another source. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump is like, how can I fuck with him?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That sort of behaviour will unnerve Wall Street, as investors try to judge where to place their money. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also unusual to see politicians try to settle scores so publicly. Paul Donovan, UBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief global economist, fears that such \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrandom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attacks could undermine faith in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrule of law\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Just in: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing has just posted its slowest quarter growth in a year. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all bad -- growth in March picked up a little, pushing the manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Index up to 55.1 from 55.0 in February. Factory bosses reported that output growth picked up last month, but increases in new orders and employment slowed. Data firm Markit says: The average reading over the opening quarter as a whole (55.1) was the weakest in a year, suggesting that the underlying pace of expansion has been generally slower since the start of 2018. Growth across Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector has hit an eight-month low, as the recent \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceuro boom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 falters. The eurozone manufacturing PMI, which tracks activity across the sector, dropped to 56.6 in March, down from 58.6 in February. This is the third monthly drop in a row, but it still signals solid growth (50 points would show stagnation). Factory bosses reported that output, new orders and new exports grew at a slower rate last month. They also reported problems getting hold of the raw materials and parts they needed, as supply chains struggled to cope. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, is concerned that business confidence also dipped last month. The fact that business optimism about the coming year has slipped to a 15-month low suggests there are other factors that are now hitting factory order books. Export growth has more than halved since late last year, linked in part to the appreciation of the euro, and in some cases demand is being stymied by higher prices. Hopes that the markets might calm down after their volatile start to 2018 have been dashed this morning. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, says investors need to decide whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re heading into a bear market, or just a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrevaluation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of asset prices. The major fear for markets is that the imposition of retaliatory import tariffs by China could just be the tip of the iceberg and will cause a chain reaction that drags more sectors and countries into the dispute. In a world where China is not willing to turn the other cheek and where President Trump likes to get the last word, the situation is set for further turmoil and the danger for investors is that this will escalate into a broader battle, which could leave few sectors immune to trouble. Each of the major tech companies appears to have its own particular set of problems to deal with. Facebook - data security. Intel - Apple chips. Tesla - missed targets compounding fears of excessive leverage. Amazon - President Trump. However, the one thing these companies do have in common is that these stocks are held by most of the big popular global funds. This means that many investors may have substantial exposure, even if they are not direct shareholders, which makes the tech troubles a wider problem. Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff was actually Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst start to an April since 1929 -- a date etched in market memory thanks to the crash later that year. Now, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just one day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading, but its not a great open for the second quarter either... Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff means America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P 500 has now shed 3.4% since the start of the year, while the Dow is down almost 5%. That follows a remarkable 2017, which saw the US stock market surge by around 25%. European markets have fallen down across the board in nervous trading, as traders rush to catch up with events after the Easter break. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says fears of a trade war are refusing to go away: On Monday China announced that it has implemented afforementioned tariffs on 128 types of US goods. Implementing the tariffs makes China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel and aluminium tariffs official. China has to show it is serious. We still expect a settlement in trade negotiations between the two nations. Sentiment will be fragile until the result of trade negotiations become clear. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has fallen sharply at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 shed 54 points, or 0,7%, to 7001 points, as traders take their cue from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide on Wall Street. The US president appears to have unnerved the markets, with his trade war rhetoric and attacks on Amazon. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, explains: The fall in tech stocks and escalating trade tensions continued to rattle markets after the Easter break. This time, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs and tech stocks driving the selloff, and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the U.S. President is doing himself any favors before the midterm elections. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been aggressive, by imposing levies on $3 billion worth of imports from the U.S.; the question now is - what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next? A tariff \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctit for tat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is a lose-lose scenario. So, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely that after this war of nerves, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies will find a middle ground. Markets should get used to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiating style - kicking off with something dramatic, and then scaling down through negotiation. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fresh worries over a global trade war are rippling through the markets today, after China hit back against America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on steel and aluminium by targeting imports of food, wine, steel and even ginseng. The news that Beijing is imposing its own tariffs of up to 25% on more than 120 US products sparked a selloff on Wall Street last night, sending the S&amp;P into correction territory. The Dow plunged by over 700 points at one stage, before ending the day 458 points lower. With Donald Trump expected to announce new curbs on China soon, traders are worried that this tit-for-tat action could escalate. As David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Beijing decided to impose levies on approximately $3 billion worth of goods from the US. In the grand scheme of things, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been too aggressive, but dealers fear we could be starting a long trade war. The ball is now in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in court, and traders are waiting for the US President to make the next move. European markets were closed yesterday for Easter Monday, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting losses of almost 1% on the main indices this morning. Trump has also put the technology sector into a spin, after sending a series of tweets criticising Amazon for avoiding taxes and not paying the US Post Office a fair rate. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price tanked by over 5% on Monday, on concerns that the e-commerce giant is firmly in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s firing line. Music streaming site Spotify will hope to ride out the market choppiness, when it lists its shares on the New York stock exchange for the first time. Spotify has taken the refreshing decision not to employ investment banks to underwrite its listing, so the launch could be more volatile than usual.

                "bodyText":"Sir Martin Sorrell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s iron grip as chief executive of WPP is under threat after the advertising group hired a law firm to investigate an allegation of personal misconduct. Sorrell is one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best-known and most highly paid business leaders. He is also the longest-serving FTSE-100 chief executive and has run the sprawling WPP empire since starting the business in 1985. In the last five years alone Sorrell has been paid well over \u00c2\u00a3200m for running the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest advertising group thanks to lucrative and highly controversial reward schemes. His \u00c2\u00a370m payout in 2015 was one of the biggest in UK corporate history. The investigation will increase pressure on Sorrell, who is already feeling the strain as WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has tumbled almost 40% in the last year to its lowest point since 2013. The price slump has wiped \u00c2\u00a39bn off the value of the business, which owns 406 separate advertising and marketing firms in more than 100 countries, including top-flight brands such as Ogilvy &amp; Mather and J Walter Thompson. It has 134,000 staff. WPP recently reported its worst performance since the advertising recession in 2009, which Sorrell described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not a pretty year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The 73-year-old \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unreservedly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd denied the misconduct allegation, which involves the improper use of company funds and allegations of improper personal behaviour. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The board of WPP has appointed independent counsel to conduct an investigation in response to an allegation of personal misconduct against Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive officer of WPP,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the company said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The investigation is ongoing. The allegations do not involve amounts which are material to WPP.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sorrell, who is on a rare holiday, said he rejected the allegation but understood that the company had to investigate the matter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153WPP is investigating an allegation of financial impropriety by me, specifically as to the use of company funds,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sorrell said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This allegation is being investigated by a law firm. I reject the allegation unreservedly but recognise that the company has to investigate it. I understand that this process will be completed shortly. Obviously, I shall play no part in the management of the investigation under way.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd WPP has called in two top law firms, Allen &amp; Overy and Slaughter and May, to advise on the investigation. The trouble at the top has once again put a spotlight on the issue of succession at WPP amid accusations of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sorrellcentricity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the view that Sorrell runs the giant business autocratically as a personal fiefdom, dominating decision-making. The question of who will succeed Sorrell is raised every year at the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholder meeting. Sorrell has never given any indication that he may be ready to step back. Roberto Quarta, a US businessman hired as WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman two years ago, has said that succession planning has intensified, becoming \u00e2\u20ac\u0153even more focused and detailed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said there was an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exceptional team of potential candidates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top management, as well as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153constantly refined list of external candidates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There is understood to be tension about Sorrell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future among members of WPP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 12-strong board, which has been heightened by the recent performance slump. At least one director is known to be agitating to oust him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If Sorrell were to leave the company for any reason, WPP has a relatively deep bench of talent who could pick up any slack on a near-term basis,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A more significant issue relates to who would lead the company next and what strategic direction the company would pursue.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd WPP shares fell a further 2% in trading on Wednesday in response to the investigation. Sorrell has denied the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor recent performance was a result of his agencies being cut out of deals between advertisers and Google and Facebook. He said WPP spent more than $6bn (\u00c2\u00a34.4bn) of its clients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 advertising and marketing money with Google, its biggest single investment, last year, a 10% rise. Facebook received about $2.1bn of its ad spend last year, a 30% rise. Sorrell and his family trust owns a stake of about 1.8% in WPP, worth about \u00c2\u00a3250m. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a significant share-owner, my commitment to the company, which I founded over 30 years ago, remains absolute \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to our people, our clients, our shareholders and all of our many stakeholders,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sorrell said.",

With strong backing from corporate America, he launched an investigation into China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged theft of US intellectual property.</p> <p>Last Tuesday, US trade representative Robert Lighthizer announced that, as a result of that probe, the US would release a list of some 1,300 products that could be targeted with a 25% tariff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c worth a total of $50bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unless China changes its ways.</p> <p>The following day, Beijing announced that it would fight fire with fire. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/04/china-retaliates-to-trump-tariffs-with-new-levies-on-us-products\">China published a list of US imports, again worth $50bn, on which it would levy a 25% tariff.</a> China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hit list was smaller but carefully targeted to hurt sensitive US sectors, such as soya bean farming and the aerospace industries.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Beijing demands to be treated as an equal, not as a developing country that has to do Washington's bidding</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Larry Kudlow, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economic adviser, tried to calm things down by insisting that the US and China would be able to sort out their problems without a trade war. The conciliatory atmosphere did not last, however, because late on Thursday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/05/trump-china-trade-war-new-tariff-proposal-100-billion\">Trump said he had asked Lighthizer to consider imposing tariffs on another $100bn of Chinese imports.</a> Beijing responded by saying it would fight the US \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at any cost\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>For now, this is still a cold trade war. Neither side has yet imposed its threatened tariffs, and there is plenty of time for a negotiated settlement. What ought to happen is simple. China should recognise that there is some merit in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s argument. US firms have essentially been forced to cede intellectual property rights to gain access to the big and growing Chinese market. If Beijing announced an end to that practice, Trump could remove his threat of tariffs and both sides could then disarm.</p> <p>But the White House needs to create the conditions under which Beijing can do this. China is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second biggest economy and an emerging superpower. It demands to be treated as an equal rather than as a developing country that has no option but to do Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bidding.</p> <p>In a tit-for-tat tariff war, the Chinese would come off worse \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because they export more to the US than they import. But Beijing has other weapons, including its massive holding of US Treasury bills. Any move to dump these government bonds would be mutually assured destruction with a vengeance. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the danger with cold wars: in the wrong hands, they can turn hot.</p> <h2>Murdochs could still have influence</h2> <p>On the face of it, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/03/disney-offers-to-buy-sky-news-to-ease-murdochs-117bn-takeover\">prospect of Disney buying Sky News</a> to help Fox break the regulatory blockade against its Sky bid suggests Rupert Murdoch might finally win the day.</p> <p>Concerns that the Murdochs taking over Sky \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which would see them control Sky News, the <em>Times</em> and the <em>Sun</em> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would give them too much influence over UK news media has proved the thorn in the side of the deal.</p> <p>The Murdochs ( <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/25/sky-news-no-longer-critical-to-broadcaster-says-chief-executive\">and Sky</a>) have pointed out that shutting Sky News would at a stroke resolve media plurality concerns, but have so far gone the route of offering a range of independence and financial guarantees instead to try to get clearance.</p> <p>Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/14/rupert-murdochs-60bn-disney-deal-reshapes-his-media-empire\">$66bn offer for most of Fox includes it ultimately taking control of Sky News anyway</a>, so guaranteeing it to regulators now seems an elegant solution.</p> <p>But Disney, which has said it will buy Sky News even if its deal to buy Fox were to collapse, has not made the offer out of a burning desire to get into the UK news business.</p> <p>Comcast, the owner of NBC Universal, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/feb/27/comcast-murdoch-bid-sky-21st-century-fox\">preparing to gatecrash the party with a \u00c2\u00a322bn bid for Sky</a>. This is well above the \u00c2\u00a319bn that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/15/rupert-murdoch-sky-bid-pay-tv\">Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid values Sky at</a>. The City believes Sky is now worth much more \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is performing strongly and has just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/14/premier-league-tv-deal-key-questions-subscriptions-bt\">scored a significant goal in the latest Premier League TV rights auction</a>\u00e2\u20ac\u201c potentially more than \u00c2\u00a316 a share. Disney knows it has a bargain and does not want to see Fox blocked from buying Sky, thwarting its deal and opening the door to a bidding war with Comcast. As Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential saviour, Disney appears to be a good one, with proven success as a broadcaster \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it owns ESPN and the ABC network in the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a clean track record.</p> <p>But how long would it be committed to Sky News once it has got what it really wants \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Fox? And does this really solve the issue of the Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s influence?</p> <p>Following the Disney deal, Fox shareholders, which include the Murdochs, will get a 25% stake in the enlarged company. The Murdoch family trust will become Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-biggest single shareholder (mutual fund giant Vanguard is the biggest, but it is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153passive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd investor) and is likely to be actively involved.</p> <p>Bob Iger, the Disney chief executive, has refused to rule out a top job for Fox chief James Murdoch after the deal goes through. If Disney wins the day, the Murdochs could continue to wield significant influence over the very asset they sold to defuse plurality concerns.</p> <h2>Should Facebook mark its own homework?</h2> <p>It is amazing how an upcoming appearance in front of Washington legislators can encourage even the shyest of technology billionaires to start talking. Mark Zuckerberg, boss of Facebook, warmed up for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/04/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-testify-data-cambridge-analytica-house\">his first trip to Capitol Hill next week</a> by doing a round of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/04/facebook-cambridge-analytica-user-data-latest-more-than-thought\">media interviews</a> in which, in light of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/cambridge-analytica\">the Cambridge Analytica scandal</a>, he confessed to making mistakes but promised to do better in future. US congressmen need to pin him down. First, on hard details. Second, on the nature of his company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business model.</p> <p>Why did it take so long for Facebook to reveal the scale of the data breach? The company knew that information <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/11/senator-ted-cruz-president-campaign-facebook-user-data\">had been harvested by a third party in late 2015</a>. Why didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it alert users at the time? And will it commit to doing so if its new tighter controls over apps and developers fail?</p> <p>Zuckerberg has made big claims about Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new ability to protect the integrity of elections, specifically its powers to detect Russian bots. He said Facebook had not been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on top\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the problem during the US presidential election in 2016. But thanks to the use of artificial intelligence tools, Zuckerberg said, he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153much happier\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with its performance during last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elections in France.</p> <p>Why, given past failures, should Facebook be trusted to mark its own homework? And what does Zuckerberg mean why he says some regulation might be appropriate? How does he think such a system could work? And why does Facebook accept political advertising at all? Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it always at risk of being out-smarted by state-sponsored disinformation and fake news attacks?</p> <p>Would Facebook accept its platform can only be properly cleaned up if the business model is radically revised? Why not allow users to opt-out of data-sharing? Or could users elect to see only the types of adverts they choose? Facebook would be massively less profitable, but wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t such an approach be truer to the spirit of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153community\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that Zuckerberg always proclaims?</p>",

Larry Kudlow, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economic adviser, tried to calm things down by insisting that the US and China would be able to sort out their problems without a trade war. The conciliatory atmosphere did not last, however, because late on Thursday Trump said he had asked Lighthizer to consider imposing tariffs on another $100bn of Chinese imports. Beijing responded by saying it would fight the US \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at any cost\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. For now, this is still a cold trade war. Neither side has yet imposed its threatened tariffs, and there is plenty of time for a negotiated settlement. What ought to happen is simple. China should recognise that there is some merit in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s argument. US firms have essentially been forced to cede intellectual property rights to gain access to the big and growing Chinese market. If Beijing announced an end to that practice, Trump could remove his threat of tariffs and both sides could then disarm. But the White House needs to create the conditions under which Beijing can do this. China is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second biggest economy and an emerging superpower. It demands to be treated as an equal rather than as a developing country that has no option but to do Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bidding. In a tit-for-tat tariff war, the Chinese would come off worse \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because they export more to the US than they import. But Beijing has other weapons, including its massive holding of US Treasury bills. Any move to dump these government bonds would be mutually assured destruction with a vengeance. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the danger with cold wars: in the wrong hands, they can turn hot. Murdochs could still have influence On the face of it, the prospect of Disney buying Sky News to help Fox break the regulatory blockade against its Sky bid suggests Rupert Murdoch might finally win the day. Concerns that the Murdochs taking over Sky \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which would see them control Sky News, the Times and the Sun \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would give them too much influence over UK news media has proved the thorn in the side of the deal. The Murdochs ( and Sky) have pointed out that shutting Sky News would at a stroke resolve media plurality concerns, but have so far gone the route of offering a range of independence and financial guarantees instead to try to get clearance. Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $66bn offer for most of Fox includes it ultimately taking control of Sky News anyway, so guaranteeing it to regulators now seems an elegant solution. But Disney, which has said it will buy Sky News even if its deal to buy Fox were to collapse, has not made the offer out of a burning desire to get into the UK news business. Comcast, the owner of NBC Universal, is preparing to gatecrash the party with a \u00c2\u00a322bn bid for Sky. This is well above the \u00c2\u00a319bn that Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid values Sky at. The City believes Sky is now worth much more \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is performing strongly and has just scored a significant goal in the latest Premier League TV rights auction\u00e2\u20ac\u201c potentially more than \u00c2\u00a316 a share. Disney knows it has a bargain and does not want to see Fox blocked from buying Sky, thwarting its deal and opening the door to a bidding war with Comcast. As Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential saviour, Disney appears to be a good one, with proven success as a broadcaster \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it owns ESPN and the ABC network in the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a clean track record. But how long would it be committed to Sky News once it has got what it really wants \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Fox? And does this really solve the issue of the Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s influence? Following the Disney deal, Fox shareholders, which include the Murdochs, will get a 25% stake in the enlarged company. The Murdoch family trust will become Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-biggest single shareholder (mutual fund giant Vanguard is the biggest, but it is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153passive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd investor) and is likely to be actively involved. Bob Iger, the Disney chief executive, has refused to rule out a top job for Fox chief James Murdoch after the deal goes through. If Disney wins the day, the Murdochs could continue to wield significant influence over the very asset they sold to defuse plurality concerns. Should Facebook mark its own homework? It is amazing how an upcoming appearance in front of Washington legislators can encourage even the shyest of technology billionaires to start talking. Mark Zuckerberg, boss of Facebook, warmed up for his first trip to Capitol Hill next week by doing a round of media interviews in which, in light of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he confessed to making mistakes but promised to do better in future. US congressmen need to pin him down. First, on hard details. Second, on the nature of his company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business model. Why did it take so long for Facebook to reveal the scale of the data breach? The company knew that information had been harvested by a third party in late 2015. Why didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it alert users at the time? And will it commit to doing so if its new tighter controls over apps and developers fail? Zuckerberg has made big claims about Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new ability to protect the integrity of elections, specifically its powers to detect Russian bots. He said Facebook had not been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on top\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the problem during the US presidential election in 2016. But thanks to the use of artificial intelligence tools, Zuckerberg said, he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153much happier\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with its performance during last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elections in France. Why, given past failures, should Facebook be trusted to mark its own homework? And what does Zuckerberg mean why he says some regulation might be appropriate? How does he think such a system could work? And why does Facebook accept political advertising at all? Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it always at risk of being out-smarted by state-sponsored disinformation and fake news attacks? Would Facebook accept its platform can only be properly cleaned up if the business model is radically revised? Why not allow users to opt-out of data-sharing? Or could users elect to see only the types of adverts they choose? Facebook would be massively less profitable, but wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t such an approach be truer to the spirit of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153community\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that Zuckerberg always proclaims?",

                "bodyText":"From Syria to social media, world leaders have many urgent matters to discuss when they congregate at international gatherings. But it is the threat to the world economy from Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade dispute with China that is poised to dominate the annual spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank this week. Opening in Washington on Monday and hosted by the IMF, the meetings will be attended by leaders and central bankers, including Mark Carney of the Bank of England and the chancellor, Philip Hammond. Both organisations are chiefly concerned with the global economy. The IMF is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lender of last resort, helping to bail out struggling countries and promote financial stability. The World Bank is focused on lending to poor and middle-income countries; its meetings in the US capital will be attended by international development ministers, including the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Penny Mordaunt. The gatherings are taking place at a difficult moment for the world economy, which is starting to show signs of faltering after the best year for growth since the financial crisis. The IMF meeting comes nearly three months after Trump spoke at Davos, when there was less news from the global economy to worry the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elite. The intervening weeks have been marked by a rollercoaster ride for financial markets, rattled by fears over rising inflation as well as weaker economic data and tougher talk from the White House on trade tariffs. Alongside the prospect of a breakdown in global trade, other items likely to be on the agenda are the mounting tensions in the Middle East and the prospect of a new cold war between the west and Russia, as well as the possibility of central banks raising interest rates more quickly than expected in order to curb inflationary pressures. Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s control of personal data and the role of big technology companies in society, as well as gender equality and the divide between rich and poor, will also feature. How high-stakes are this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meetings? Lucy O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Carroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a fair amount of competition over the past 10 years, when IMF meetings have been important at many points.

                "body":"<p>Russian oligarchs, the rouble and the Moscow stock market <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/09/russian-firms-and-rouble-hit-heavily-by-trump-sanctions\">all felt the pain of US sanctions last week</a>. The share price slumps at Oleg Deripaska\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s En+ and Rusal companies, the steepest daily fall in the national currency for three years, and a double-digit hit to the dollar-denominated RTS index all showed that it is possible to punish Vladimir Putin and his associates.</p> <p>But the international community needs to be vigilant. At the same time that US sanctions were wiping billions of pounds off the value of Russian companies, Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president was preparing a consolatory gift to sugar the pill. The Kremlin has, according to multiple reports, drawn up plans for two new domestic tax havens aimed at Russian millionaires and billionaires who may be considering whether to repatriate their wealth and take shelter from tit-for-tat sanctions.</p> <p>Amid this manoeuvring, the big question for Theresa May, as the UK considers its own toolkit of measures, is whether sanctions will cause genuine discomfort to the Kremlin. Some informed observers say knocking a few billion off the personal wealth off an oligarch class that few ordinary Russians have any love for will not play too badly for Putin, even if it is ordinary workers who end up losing their jobs.</p> <p>It is also unclear why some oligarchs are deemed to be worthy of sanctions by virtue of their closeness to the Kremlin, but others are not. Why target the owner of an aluminium giant, which competes with US industry, but not the owner of a football club, which does not?</p> <p>London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position as a playground for Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elite means the opportunities available to May are more subtle. The so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/17/russian-elite-must-reveal-how-they-paid-for-uk-property-say-mps\">Magnitsky measures</a>, named after the anti-corruption whistleblower who met his death in a Russian jail, could be used to bar suspect figures from entering the UK.</p> <p>Some politicians, notably the Liberal Democrat leader and former business minister Vince Cable, have suggested deploying new unexplained wealth orders, introduced in February. These could be used to force people suspected of using dirty money to buy stately homes and Kensington townhouses to explain where they got the cash.</p> <p>Russian figures with ties to the Putin regime own British properties worth nearly \u00c2\u00a31.1bn, according to recent estimates, most of it in London. The true value is likely to be far greater because buyers can take advantage of offshore secrecy loopholes left open under May.</p> <p>That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one reason why Labour has asked for British overseas territories to be forced to disclose the ownership of offshore companies more quickly than the current deadline of 2021. Any or all of these measures would hurt individuals with at least some influence in various corners of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labyrinthine political corridors.</p> <p>But the big question mark hanging over the path ahead is whether the City of London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lobbying heft will ultimately prove telling. Russian oligarchs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 business is highly lucrative for lawyers and investment bankers. One major bank in the City is said to have a team of more than 20 people dedicated to managing $1bn on behalf of a well-known oligarch. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil giant BP derives a huge slice of its income from its stake in Moscow-based Rosneft.</p> <p>The economic uncertainty of Brexit has raised fears that the capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standing as a financial centre could be on the wane.

                "bodyText":"Russian oligarchs, the rouble and the Moscow stock market all felt the pain of US sanctions last week. The share price slumps at Oleg Deripaska\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s En+ and Rusal companies, the steepest daily fall in the national currency for three years, and a double-digit hit to the dollar-denominated RTS index all showed that it is possible to punish Vladimir Putin and his associates. But the international community needs to be vigilant. At the same time that US sanctions were wiping billions of pounds off the value of Russian companies, Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president was preparing a consolatory gift to sugar the pill. The Kremlin has, according to multiple reports, drawn up plans for two new domestic tax havens aimed at Russian millionaires and billionaires who may be considering whether to repatriate their wealth and take shelter from tit-for-tat sanctions. Amid this manoeuvring, the big question for Theresa May, as the UK considers its own toolkit of measures, is whether sanctions will cause genuine discomfort to the Kremlin. Some informed observers say knocking a few billion off the personal wealth off an oligarch class that few ordinary Russians have any love for will not play too badly for Putin, even if it is ordinary workers who end up losing their jobs. It is also unclear why some oligarchs are deemed to be worthy of sanctions by virtue of their closeness to the Kremlin, but others are not. Why target the owner of an aluminium giant, which competes with US industry, but not the owner of a football club, which does not? London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position as a playground for Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elite means the opportunities available to May are more subtle. The so-called Magnitsky measures, named after the anti-corruption whistleblower who met his death in a Russian jail, could be used to bar suspect figures from entering the UK. Some politicians, notably the Liberal Democrat leader and former business minister Vince Cable, have suggested deploying new unexplained wealth orders, introduced in February. These could be used to force people suspected of using dirty money to buy stately homes and Kensington townhouses to explain where they got the cash. Russian figures with ties to the Putin regime own British properties worth nearly \u00c2\u00a31.1bn, according to recent estimates, most of it in London. The true value is likely to be far greater because buyers can take advantage of offshore secrecy loopholes left open under May. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one reason why Labour has asked for British overseas territories to be forced to disclose the ownership of offshore companies more quickly than the current deadline of 2021. Any or all of these measures would hurt individuals with at least some influence in various corners of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labyrinthine political corridors. But the big question mark hanging over the path ahead is whether the City of London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lobbying heft will ultimately prove telling. Russian oligarchs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 business is highly lucrative for lawyers and investment bankers. One major bank in the City is said to have a team of more than 20 people dedicated to managing $1bn on behalf of a well-known oligarch. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil giant BP derives a huge slice of its income from its stake in Moscow-based Rosneft. The economic uncertainty of Brexit has raised fears that the capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standing as a financial centre could be on the wane. With the government keen to prevent the feared decline \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the concomitant impact on tax revenue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bargaining power is substantial. The financial industry can argue that being seen to reject Russian cash would simply see the money diverted elsewhere and spook other foreign investors, who fear the murkiest corners of their wealth may no longer be safe in London. That is a practical approach but not a moral one. Money will always follow the path of least resistance and it is not clear that the UK has the stomach to offer any at all. Streaming puts song in heart of music biz With UK record labels enjoying the biggest growth surge in revenues in more than two decades, the music industry has finally put the once-looming threat of a piracy apocalypse behind it. Digital formats have moved from being the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bete noire to its saviour: royalties from subscriptions to streaming services underpinned record growth last year. A 10.6% rise in record-label earnings, to \u00c2\u00a3839m, came thanks to a 45% increase to \u00c2\u00a3347m in income from services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music.

Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bikes are not a sign of back-pedalling Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s acquisition of US bike-hire firm Jump looks rather pedestrian by the standards of its own vaulting ambition, at least at first glance.

                "bodyText":"The founder of JD Wetherspoon has said a decision to close all the pub chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s social media accounts was not a publicity stunt. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move to shut Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts for its 900 outlets was greeted with widespread scepticism. Tim Martin, who is also chairman of the company, said it was a business decision because social media had become a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153distraction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the company. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You would have to be completely off your rocker to do a publicity stunt ... which banned the medium which is supposed to give you the most publicity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told BBC News. Martin claimed that he was making a stand against social media because it had become a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153waste of time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for him and his pubs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On a personal level many of us are fed up with social media and think it has got damaging effects and a lot of people are on it far far too much,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do them any good it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do the country any good. He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The people who aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on social media wish that their friends weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t either, because they seem to be obsessed by it. And people who are on it feel they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get off it because they are addicted.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked if he could rule out rejoining social media platforms in future, Martin said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If I have to crawl back to Facebook my goodness me that will be a catastrophe. It is not impossible, you have to keep your options open in business. But if I do it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what humiliation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Martin, who was a significant backer of the Vote Leave campaign, was also asked whether the controversy about the alleged use of Facebook data in the referendum had influenced his decision. He replied: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In politics and business people vastly overestimate social media. I campaigned very vigorously for leave and I did it through writing articles, speaking to the press and the television. I think tweets and Facebook underestimate the intelligence of the public and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all a bit of marketing hype really.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In a tweet that is no longer available, Martin said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are going against conventional wisdom that these platforms are a vital component of a successful business. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that closing these accounts will affect our business whatsoever, and this is the overwhelming view of our pub managers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Martin is said to have taken the decision following recent publicity over the use of social media to criticise MPs and others, especially those from religious or ethnic minorities. However, the chain has failed to attract much of a following online, with 44,000 followers on Twitter and 100,000 on Facebook. Much of its activity on social media has been devoted to fending off complaints. Martin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement said customers could use the Wetherspoon website and app to contact the company, or speak to pub managers. Media commentators predicted that the move would backfire. The chain has also been targeted by pro-Europeans for its support of Brexit, with calls from some to boycott its pubs. The company has often had to deal with hoax statements posted on social media. In November last year, the company was forced to refute a claim that staff had been banned from wearing Remembrance Day poppies while at work. Many of its 900 pubs have Facebook pages with fewer than 1,000 likes, meaning that anything they post is unlikely to be seen by users in their news feed. They are, however, still a magnet for bad reviews, which Facebook displays prominently. One pub, which has an overall star rating of 3.7, still has a review section headed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People talk about terrible service\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and both reviews on display are one-star complaints. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate HQ location page on Facebook has also attracted one-star reviews, including one in which a customer claims that her lost glasses were retrieved from a bin. The company has confirmed that no jobs will be affected by the move.",

The Nikkei in Tokyo closed 0.26% higher while Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng was 1.7% lower.</p> \n  <p><strong>There is relief that western missile strikes on Syria on Friday did not prompt a response from Russia, Syria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main ally, although traders will be watching cautiously for any signs of escalation of the conflict.</strong></p> \n  <p>Oil prices are slipping, with Brent crude in London down 1% to $71.83 a barrel while US crude is 0.9% lower at $66.79 a barrel.</p> \n  <p>Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One of the main concerns last week was around the extent of the response by the US backed coalition on president Assad of Syria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forces and any Russian reaction to it. The firing of over 100 cruise missiles over the weekend on various targets, with little in the way of casualties, appears to be tempered with relief that while it may reduce the risk of an escalation in the short term, it in no way means that we might not get a counter response further down the line. As such markets here in Europe look set to open cautiously higher this morning after shares traded slightly firmer in Asia.</p> \n   <p>The US also appears to be complementing its military approach by focusing on the additional sanctions route, after UN ambassador Nikki Haley announced that further sanctions were being discussed on Russian companies who have dealings with Assad and the use of chemical weapons, with details likely to be announced by US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin later today.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Geopolitical developments and corporate earnings remain the main focus, in the absence of major economic news apart from US retail sales data for March, out at 13:30 BST. </p> \n  <p>In the UK, we will get the latest labour market stats tomorrow, followed by inflation on Wednesday and retail sales on Thursday, but today the calendar is barren.

Dow Jones up 0.5% S&amp;P 500 up 0.5% Nasdaq up 0.66% However, European stock markets have slipped after starting the day in positive territory. The FTSE 100 index in London has fallen more, dragged down again by the stronger pound. Sterling is trading 0.57% higher at $1.4323, the highest since 25 January, and the second-highest level since the Brexit vote. UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index down 0.8% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax down 0.15% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC down 0.09% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB down 0.05% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex down 0.03% Oil prices are falling today. Brent crude in London has lost 1.3% to $71.64 a barrel while US crude is down 1.4% at $66.43 a barrel. With this, we are closing the blog. Thank you for reading and for your great comments. We will be back tomorrow. Since Trump became president in January 2017, the dollar has weakened substantially against most major currencies, including China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yuan and, until the US sanctions against Russia in the last few weeks, the rouble. Against the yuan, the dollar has fallen 8.6% since 20 January 2017, Reuters data show. It has risen 4.5% against the rouble, although it was down 4% against the Russian currency until new US sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs were announced 1 1/2 weeks ago. The US dollar index which measures its value against a basket of major trading partner currencies has lost 11.2% since Trump took office. Back to currencies. US president Donald Trump has tweeted In Greece, the central government ran up a primary budget surplus of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.3bn in the first three months of the year, beating its target, Reuters reports. According to finance ministry data, the surplus was boosted by higher tax revenues. The government was targeting a primary budget surplus, which excludes debt servicing costs, of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.09bn. The central government surplus excludes the budgets of social security organisations and local administration. It is not the measure monitored by Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU and IMF lenders but is a good health indicator of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances. While the pound is still up nearly half a percent against the dollar, Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rouble has stabilised following a steep drop earlier in the day. The dollar now buys 62.33 units of the Russian currency, compared with 63.15 in early London trading. Last week, the rouble weakened beyond 65 against the dollar for the first time since late 2016 after new US sanctions against a number of Russian oligarchs and officials. More sanctions are looming today, in retaliation for Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support for the Syrian regime which is thought to be bhind the chemical weapons attack in Ghouta two weeks ago. Over in the US, retail sales bounced back in March after three months of falling sales, with households buying cars and other big-ticket items. The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.6% last month from the previous month, following declines of 0.1% and 0.2% in February and January respectively. Sales were up 4.5% from a year earlier. Excluding cars, petrol, building materials and food services, which can be volatile, retail sales rose 0.4% compared with an unchanged reading in February. Economists have blamed the weakness in consumer spending at the start of the year on delays in processing tax refunds, which have held back households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 spending power. Bookmaker Betway has suspended betting on the next governor of the Bank of England after a flurry of bets on Andrew Bailey. The next governor, who will succeed Mark Carney in June 2019, is expected to be announced towards the end of the year. Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority had been relatively unfancied at 9/1, but the online bookie received a sudden influx of bets on him succeeding Carney and has suspended betting as a result. Bailey had been tipped by City economists as the most likely candidate to succeed Carney. Betway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alan Alger said: There had been some speculation that Andrew Bailey was a leading candidate to replace Mark Carney as the new Governor of the Bank of England and in the last few days we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen huge support for him taking the role. The current Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority was available at 9/1, but as a result of the weight of support towards him, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had no choice but to suspend the market. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Xi Jinping has said rising protectionism adds risks and uncertainty to the world economy, according to state media. His comments were made to Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum. Xi also said it was necessary for both sides to strengthen cooperation and work together to find new driving forces for global economic growth. Sterling has climbed above $1.43 for the first time since 25 January, and only the second time since the Brexit vote in June 2016. The pound climbed as high as $1.4318, up 0.54%, as technical meetings between UK and EU negotiators got under way in Brussels, followed by talks over the Irish border issue on Wednesday. Brian Martin, head of global economics at ANZ, said there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong vested interest on both sides to agree on a workable trade deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, Jane Foley, senior currencies strategist at Rabobank, cautioned that hopes that a trade deal can be hammered out by October 2018 may be too ambitious, with the north Ireland border remaining a particular area of concern. Markets also have their eyes on key UK labour market, inflation and retail sales data in coming days. The Bank of England is widely expected to raise interest rates next month but if there are further signs of an economic slowdown, a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dovish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rate hike would put pressure on sterling, analysts say. Octavio Marenzi, CEO of capital markets management at consultancy Opimas, has sent us his thoughts on Bank of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first-quarter results. We are seeing a very favorable environment for banking currently and Bank of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings reflect this. Overall, BofA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results are good, and pushed RoE [return on equity] above 10%, even if they are not as strong as arch-rival JPMorgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Consumer Banking and Wealth Management registered solid, sustainable growth in revenues. However, investment banking fees pulled Global Banking into slightly negative territory. BofA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results in fixed-income trading were not as strong as we expected and declined compared to Q1 last year, but handily beat the last quarter of 2017. EU foreign ministers have threatened to impose new economic sanctions on Syria over the recent chemical attack on civilians in Ghouta near Damascus, but held off from joining anticipated new US sanctions against Russia. The 28 foreign ministers said in a joint statement after talks in Luxembourg: The European Union will continue to consider further restrictive measures against Syria as long as the repression continues. In the US, the bank earnings season continues. Bank of America has reported a 34% rise in first-quarter profit after the lender benefited from higher interest rates. The second-biggest US bank by assets said net income rose to a record $6.5bn in the three months to March from $4.5bn a year earlier. Earnings per share climbed to 62 cents from 45 cents. Wall Street analysts had expected 59 cents per share. Total revenues rose 4% to $23.3bn. Consumer banking, Bank of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest business, posted 9% growth in revenues to $9bn. It relies heavily on higher interest rates to maximise profits because it has a large amount of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities. Chief executive Brian Moynihan said: Strong client activity, coupled with a growing global economy and solid US consumer activity, led to record quarterly earnings. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank JPMorgan Chase and Citi also reported strong earnings on Friday. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, has looked at the Footsie. The FTSE was dealing with duel pressures this Monday, both in its commodity sector losses and the success of sterling. While the rest of the markets held strong, the FTSE dropped 35 points to send it towards a one week low. Part of that decline is being informed by the chunky drop suffered by BP and Shell, which slipped 1.5% and 0.8% respectively. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because Brent Crude itself fell 1.2%, the black stuff in retreat in response following the contrast between the actually military engagement seen in Syria over the weekend and the supply-worrying rhetoric used by Trump last week. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the only thing upsetting the FTSE \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the index also had to deal with the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest increase. Against the dollar sterling shot up half a percent, sending cable above $1.43 to its highest price in almost a year and a half. The currency was less robust against the euro, and even then it lifted it towards a fresh 11 month peak. Turning to this afternoon and the US open may inject a bit more positivity into a fairly stagnant session. The Dow Jones is expected to surge 150 points after the bell, a move that would lift the index back above 24500. As for data, the focus will be on retail sales, with analysts expecting a rise from -0.1% to 0.4% month-on-month. Stock markets have got off to a (cautiously) positive start to the week despite air strikes carried out by the US, UK and France in Syria over the weekend, in response to a chemical weapons attack a couple of weeks ago. The missile strikes had been well-flagged and Russia did not retaliate. UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index down 0.41% at 7234.83 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax up 0.18% at 12,465.78 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC flat at 5315.57 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB up 0.22% at 23,382.52 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex up 0.16% at 9782.50 Oil prices are falling. Brent crude in London has lost nearly $1 to $71.63 while US crude is down 86 cents at $66.53 a barrel. Spot gold has steadied at 1,344.38 an ounce, down 0.1%, after hitting an earlier peak of $1,348.69. The dollar continues to weaken, while sterling is strengthening ahead of key economic data this week. Russian stocks are falling ahead of likely new US sanctions. The rouble-dominated RTS index has slipped 0.4% while the rouble-based MOEX index is down 0.6%. The US is due to announce new economic sanctions against Russia today aimed at companies that are believed to be involved in equipment linked to chemical weapons, according to Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations. The EU has already imposed a range of economic sanctions on the Assad regime, cutting off most diplomatic and economic sanctions, but with very limited impact. Russia is Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest energy supplier. While the EU imposed sanctions against Moscow over the crisis in Ukraine, it is cautious about new punitive measures. It appears unlikely that the European Union will join the US in imposing new sanctions on Russia or Syria over the chemical weapons attack that prompted the first co-ordinated western air strikes in Syria at the weekend. EU foreign ministers are putting the emphasis on diplomacy at a meeting in Luxembourg. Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok, who met his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Moscow on Friday, told reporters as he arrived at the meeting today: We have to keep pushing to get a ceasefire and humanitarian aid through the [UN] Security Council and eventually a peace process. The only solution is a peace process through the Security Council. British foreign secretary Boris Johnson told reporters: It is very important to stress [the strikes are] not an attempt to change the tide of the war in Syria or to have a regime change. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid the Syrian war will go on its horrible, miserable way. But it was the world saying that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had enough of the use of chemical weapons. Sterling has touched an intra-day high of $1.4304 against the dollar, up 0.5%, the highest level since 25 January. Stock market futures are still suggesting a higher open on Wall Street, with the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 seen opening 0.6% while the Nasdaq is expected to rise 0.7%. The EU has called on Russia and Iran to use their influence on the Syrian government to prevent it from using chemical weapons again. The EU said in comments released to a meeting of the global chemical weapons watchdog, seen by Reuters: The EU calls upon all countries, notably Russia and Iran, to use their influence to prevent any further use of chemical weapons, notably by the Syrian regime. And here is our story on Wetherspoon closing all its social media accounts, a move that has been met with scepticism. Matthew Weaver writes: The pub chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision was reportedly in response to the trolling of some MPs, but many commentators suspected it was a publicity stunt by the chairman, Tim Martin. Commercial real estate agency and consultancy Colliers International says 15 major UK retailers or restaurant groups have gone into CVA (company voluntary arrangement) or administration in the past 12 months. Colliers has calculated that around 12,000 jobs have been lost or are on the line. The most recent business failure was Conviviality, the company behind Bargain Booze and Wine Rack. We wonder how many more retailers are going to get into trouble or people lose their jobs before someone decides to tackle the problem properly. John Webb, head of business rates at Colliers, says: These figures are as bad, if not worse than the crash of 2008/9 when 16 companies went into administration- 12 in 2008 and 4 in 2009- and we are only in April now. Data from Visa card released overnight shows a steep fall in consumers on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high streets in March. The number of people visiting UK shops dropped 6% compared with the same month last year, the biggest fall in shopper numbers since the end of 2010. UK pub chain JD Wetherspoon is shutting all its social media accounts in protest against the mis-use of personal data and the failure to tackle online bullying. Wetherspoon said it was closing Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts for its head office and almost 900 pubs in Britain and Ireland. Mark Zuckerberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Facebook is under huge pressure after it emerged that the personal information of millions of users was gathered by Cambridge Analytica, the data analytics firm that worked with Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election team and the winning Brexit campaign. Zuckerberg has admitted that the data breach included his own Facebook profile. Social media platforms have also been criticised for doing too little to crack down on bullying and hate speech. Wetherspoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman and founder Tim Martin said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s becoming increasingly obvious that people spend too much time on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, and struggle to control the compulsion. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that closing these accounts will affect our business whatsoever, and this is the overwhelming view of our pub managers. Martin has also been vocal in his support of Brexit. Last year Wetherspoon was forced to issue a denial after a spoof Twitter account falsely claimed the company did not allow staff to wear poppies at work to commemorate fallen service men and women. Sterling has fared better than the dollar. The pound is up 0.28% to $1.4276, continuing a two-week rally against the dollar that saw it push towards a new post-Brexit referendum high on Friday. Against the euro, sterling has slipped 0.1% to 86.49p but remains at its highest level since late May 2017. Key economic data on British unemployment, wages, inflation and retail sales are due this week. Markets expect the Bank of England to hike interest rates by a quarter point next month. Marc Ostwald, global strategist at ADM Investor Services International in London, said: With markets almost fully discounting a BOE rate hike, this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s run of monthly indicators are anticipated to give the hike a green light. Japan and China agree that a trade war will have serious consequences for the world economy, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign minister Taro Kono has said today following high-level talks between the two countries. Kono told reporters after the first such dialogue in nearly eight years, according to Reuters: We have shared understanding that a trade war, no matter which country has brought it about, would have a very large impact on the prosperity of the international economy. There are fears that a trade row between China and the US could escalate, with the two nations threatening each other with higher tariffs. On currency markets, the dollar is struggling. It is flat against a broad basket of major currencies but has weakened 0.3% so far this month, and lost 2.5% since the start of the year. The euro is steady, trading at around $1.23. Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit Agricole, told Reuters: The military strikes were well telegraphed and we are seeing a continuation in the broad market theme from lat week of a weaker dollar and favourable conditions for risk taking. European stock markets have given up some of their earlier gains. FTSE 100 index down 0.14% at 7254.60 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax up 0.12% at 12,457.13 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC up 0.03% at 5316.83 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB up 0.17% at 23,369.72 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex up 0.19% at 9785.50 The rouble and Russian stocks are heading lower, dragged down by the threat of new US sanctions and falling oil prices. Washington said on Sunday it would impose further sanctions against Russia on Monday over Moscow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support for Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Details are expected later today. The rouble has lost 0.3% against the dollar to 62.24 and 0.4% against the euro to 76.85 Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dollar-denominated RTS index has fallen 0.66% while the rouble-based MOEX Russian index is down 0.35%. Oil prices have extended their losses, with Brent crude in London down more than $1 a barrel at $71.51, a 1.5% fall. Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sale of its oncology business includes leukaemia therapy Oncaspar, the rights to pancreatic cancer treatment Onyvyde outside the US and other drugs in development. Jefferies analysts Peter Welford, David Steinberg and Lucy Codrington believe the deal will boost Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiating position in any talks with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest drugmaker Takeda, which has disclosed that it is considering a bid. We see the possible strategic fit given the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus therapeutic areas of oncology, gastrointestinal and neuroscience, with Shire bolstering the latter two franchises. Furthermore, Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading global position in rare diseases would likely be attractive for most large pharma/biotech, particularly given the long duration assets in immunoglobulin and enzyme replacement therapy Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current market value is around $37bn, down 6% since disclosing its interest in Shire, against the London-listed company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $47bn. The Jefferies analysts say: Hence, we presume Takeda would need a significant equity raise to acquire Shire, suggesting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153merger\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is perhaps better terminology, which may raise hurdles to the successful completion of any future deal. Analysts are cautious about whether WPP will be broken up, now that Sorrell is gone. Citi analysts Thomas Singlehurst and Catherine O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill reckon the main question is whether a new WPP chief executive goes for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quick fix\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or sticks with the existing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slow fix\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In the last year, WPP has been seen by many to be losing its way. Against the backdrop of an improving macro environment, organic growth has been slowing. In practice this slowdown has been happening for years and has a multitude of explanatory factors. Anyone coming in to take over the CEO role at WPP will be entirely focused on turning this round. The debate is now whether a new CEO goes for a Quick Fix vs. (the existing) Slow Fix. Paul Richards, media analyst at Numis, says Sorrell will be hard to replace with one person. The succession has led to questions over the size and scope of WPP and we can see a change of management accelerating the current process of reducing overlap and increasing flexibility. Richards views Sorrell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tragic end to a remarkable career which saw the creation of WPP as a global leader in marcoms [marketing communications]\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. WPP has bought other holding companies (Y&amp;R, Grey, Cordiant) as well as agencies and accordingly has grown to employ over 200,000 people in 400 businesses across 3,000 offices in 112 countries. In response to industry pressures including clients in-sourcing activity, pressure on CPG and structural challenges from the duopoly of Facebook &amp; Google, WPP was already working to simplify its business and increase flexibility. We expect a new CEO to continue and accelerate this process and a strategic review could lead to the group slimming its operations by a quarter to a third in our view. WPP is due to report first-quarter results on 30 April. Sorrell is free to start a new advertising venture because he has never had a non-compete agreement, the Financial Times reports. In a farewell note to staff, Sir Martin underscored the role WPP had played in his career, saying the company was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not just a matter of life or death, it was, is and will be more important than that\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He also hinted at his next step when he signed off saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Back to the future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd WPP shares dropped as much as 5% in early trading and are now down 1.7% at \u00c2\u00a311.67, with investors worried that Sorrell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure leaves the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest advertising group rudderless at a time when it might be broken up. European stock markets have opened higher, apart from the London stock market which has slipped slightly. UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index down 0.12% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax up 0.27% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC flat Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB up 0.13% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex up 0.08% Shares in Whitbread have surged nearly 8%, replacing Shire as the top riser on the FTSE 100 index in early trading. Whitbread is under mounting pressure from hedge funds to break up its business by spinning off the Costa Coffee chain, after activist investor Elliott Advisors built up a stake of more than 6%. Shares in Shire have opened 2.6% on the news, making it the biggest riser on the FTSE 100. Shares in WPP have dropped 5% after the departure of chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell. London-listed drugmaker Shire, which specialises in rare diseases, is selling its oncology business to French drugmaker Servier for $2.4bn. The division generated revenues of $262m last year. Shire, which is a potential bid target for Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest drugmaker Takeda, said it would consider returning the proceeds of the sale to shareholders through a share buyback. Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive Flemming Ornskov hailed the sale as a key milestone for the company. While the oncology business has delivered high growth and profitability, we have concluded that it is not core to Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longer-term strategy. We will continue to evaluate our portfolio for opportunities to unlock further value and sharpen our focus on rare disease leadership with selective disposals of non-strategic assets. The proceeds from the transaction increase optionality and Shire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Board will consider returning the proceeds of the sale to shareholders through a shareholder-approved share buyback after the current offer period regarding Takeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible offer for Shire concludes. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Following another week of gains last week, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax and the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index hitting six-week highs on Friday, European stock markets are set to open higher today. US stock futures are also up, pointing to a higher open on Wall Street later. Asian markets were mixed. The Nikkei in Tokyo closed 0.26% higher while Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng was 1.7% lower. There is relief that western missile strikes on Syria on Friday did not prompt a response from Russia, Syria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main ally, although traders will be watching cautiously for any signs of escalation of the conflict. Oil prices are slipping, with Brent crude in London down 1% to $71.83 a barrel while US crude is 0.9% lower at $66.79 a barrel. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: One of the main concerns last week was around the extent of the response by the US backed coalition on president Assad of Syria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forces and any Russian reaction to it. The firing of over 100 cruise missiles over the weekend on various targets, with little in the way of casualties, appears to be tempered with relief that while it may reduce the risk of an escalation in the short term, it in no way means that we might not get a counter response further down the line. As such markets here in Europe look set to open cautiously higher this morning after shares traded slightly firmer in Asia. The US also appears to be complementing its military approach by focusing on the additional sanctions route, after UN ambassador Nikki Haley announced that further sanctions were being discussed on Russian companies who have dealings with Assad and the use of chemical weapons, with details likely to be announced by US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin later today. Geopolitical developments and corporate earnings remain the main focus, in the absence of major economic news apart from US retail sales data for March, out at 13:30 BST. In the UK, we will get the latest labour market stats tomorrow, followed by inflation on Wednesday and retail sales on Thursday, but today the calendar is barren. The International Monetary Fund holds its spring meetings of central bankers and finance ministers in Washington this week. The main corporate news at the weekend was the resignation of WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell. He is leaving the advertising group he founded more than three decades ago ahead of the findings of an investigation into alleged personal misconduct. He is in line for almost \u00c2\u00a320m in payouts. His departure is seen as paving the way for a breakup of WPP. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a round-up of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s front pages.",

The watchdog said consumers understood \u00e2\u20ac\u0153natural\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to mean foods made with ingredients straight from nature. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is misleading to use the term to describe foods or ingredients that employ chemicals,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it said in its ruling. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We considered that because some of Pret a Manger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foods contained E-numbers \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 those foods did not constitute \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnatural\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 foods for the purposes of the [food labelling] guidance.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The decision followed a complaint by the Real Bread Campaign, which is calling for an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153honest crust act\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that would force manufacturers to list all their ingredients. Some are left out on the basis they are just part of the processing. Pret says its sandwich bread contains three E-numbers: E472e (diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides) to strengthen the dough and leave fewer large holes in the bread, E471 (mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids) to soften the crumb and E300 (ascorbic acid or vitamin C) to help the dough rise. The additives are widely used in the industry to make sandwich bread, it said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We would really like to find a solution, and our food team has been working hard trialling recipes that do not use emulsifiers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a Pret spokeswoman said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They have not yet found one that meets the standards our customers expect.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Real Bread Campaign\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coordinator, Chris Young, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We welcome this ban, which sets a precedent that sends a clear message to food companies that unless they walk the natural food walk, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s misleading to talk the natural food talk. This ruling is good for shoppers ... and for the small, independent bakery and eatery owner who serve genuinely all-natural real bread sandwiches.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pret was founded in 1986 by the entrepreneur Julian Metcalfe, who went on to create the Itsu restaurant chain and Metcalfe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s skinny popcorn. It is now an ubiquitous presence on the British high street, a favourite of office workers who appreciate its ability to spot the latest food trends, from the rise of the avocado to vegan-friendly options such as sweet potato falafel. The company has become a global sandwich empire, with more than 500 stores and sales approaching \u00c2\u00a3800m in 2017 as it conquered new markets including the US. It is controlled by the private equity firm Bridgepoint and there has been speculation it is preparing for a stock market flotation in New York that could value it at more than \u00c2\u00a31.5bn. Pret\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food and coffee director, Clare Clough, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since day one, Pret has been on a mission to create handmade, natural food, avoiding obscure chemicals and preservatives. The ASA has upheld in part a complaint about our use of the word natural in two instances online. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We do, of course, take on board the views of the ASA and have already made the requested changes. We believe we represent Pret\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food honestly and we always welcome feedback.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ASA said the two ads should not appear again in their current form. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We told Pret a Manger to ensure their ads did not claim or imply that their food was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153natural\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, unless their products and ingredients were in line with consumer expectations of the term,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it said. Rising levels of obesity and concerns about food provenance and the environment have led to growing scrutiny of how food manufacturers and retailers run their businesses. Recent research by global nutrition experts found that people in Britain buy more ultra-processed food than any other European country. The Real Bread Campaign first approached Pret in 2015, urging the company to remove artificial additives or alter its marketing claims. After no progress was made the campaign, which is part of the charity Sustain: the alliance for better food and farming, complained to the ASA at the end of 2016.",

                "bodyText":"It has not been a good week for the government. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that in the standard, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153poor optics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sense that often is used when commentators talk about who won or lost the week. Yes that too has been poor. After all this is a government led by a prime minister and treasurer who stridently criticised calls for a banking royal commission, and whose judgement on that matter has been shown to be utterly inept. And their response this week has been to double down on the ineptness. The line from the government has been to demand praise by ludicrously suggesting that the terms of reference they proposed were broader than what the ALP or the Greens wanted, and are actually the reason why we have heard testimony this week from AMP, CBA and Westpac. Scott Morrison told reporters that the evidence this week \u00e2\u20ac\u0153demonstrate that the Government was right to ensure that when the Commission was put in place that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just looking at the banks, that it needed to be a broader inquiry which looked certainly at these issues and also superannuation which is yet to appear before the Commission.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The prime minister in London parroted this idiocy as well, telling reporters the royal commission \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was established on very broad terms of reference, much broader than those that have been proposed by our opponents.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday The revenue and financial services minister, Kelly O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Dwyer, was also very much in step, telling the ABC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sabra Lane that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it is right that we have a broad inquiry that can look into all aspects of misconduct in the financial services sector. The ALP had argued for a very narrow one: simply into the banks. The revelations that, obviously, we have heard about AMP are included in scope because of the inquiry that we have put in place.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The line is not even just misleading, it contradicts what O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Dwyer said just four months ago in December. Responding to criticism of the inclusion of superannuation funds into the terms of reference she noted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153previous calls for a Royal Commission by both the Labor Party and by the Greens had also called for superannuation to be included in a banking inquiry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So in December she highlighted the ALP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s argument for a broad terms of reference, but now she, Turnbull and Morrison would have us believe the ALP did not want a broad terms of reference. One day perhaps this government will not treat voters like fools, but it seems we shall have to wait a bit longer. But the real problem for the government is not just that they look shifty, or that they are losing airtime in what should be a time when the talk is about their budget. The problem is that the past two weeks have provided ample evidence to show that their foundational belief about how the economy should operate is in complete tatters. Yes, it was a bad week for the government, but it was an even worse one for unfettered capitalism. What we have seen this past fortnight with the banking royal commission and the revelations about the live sheep trade is what happens when so called free markets operate without, or with no fear of, regulatory control. There is no benevolent invisible hand leading companies to produce optimal outcomes for the economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c merely a hand that drives action towards higher profits at whatever cost. 2,400 dead sheep? Charging dead people for financial advice? This is not a shock, it is capitalism working as intended. It is businesses who lobby for lower regulations (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a competitive burden, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you know!) taking advantage of lower regulations. This is not just an Australian phenomenon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is why this week Facebook announced it was shifting responsibility for its non-North American users from Ireland to the US to avoid the strict privacy regulations in place in the EU. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry, the company said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we apply the same privacy protections everywhere.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yes, and they just happen to want to move to a jurisdiction where those privacy protection standards are lower. It is the same with those who argue for the removal of penalty rates and the minimum wage \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regulations holding back employment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, they cry! And yet we already have a plethora of cases of wage theft where low-paid workers are being underpaid. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take a genius to figure what will happen to their wages should the minimum wage and penalty rates be removed. Businesses don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t argue for less regulations so they can spend more on wages. Capitalism is founded on corporations taking advantage of having more power and information than their workers and customers. It underpins the fraudulent reasoning for the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed company tax cut for big businesses. Do you really think these businesses, which have consistently ripped off their own customers, will be using such a tax to reward their workers and customers, or will they use it to reward themselves?

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap: The IT crisis at TSB Bank is heading towards its eighth day, as the company continues to struggle to fix problems created by a botched IT migration last weekend. TSB has called in experts from IBM, who are now trying to fix the issues that are still preventing 50% of customers from accessing its internet banking services. CEO Paul Pester has told IBM to find a solution by Saturday - and admitted that the bank is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcon its knees\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, following the move onto new IT kit from its parent company Sabadell. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are on our knees, we will get up, and come back fighting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Sabadell has predicted that the mess won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be fixed until next week -- one reader has been told it could take five working days. The bank has begun compensating customers, with a \u00c2\u00a340 payment to a couple. It has also waived all overdraft fees in April, and pledged to raise the interest rate on its current account from 3% to 5% - worth up to \u00c2\u00a330 a year to customers. We understand the measures will cost at least \u00c2\u00a320m. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some good news for small businesses - HMRC have said they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be understanding if people can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get into their accounts to make VAT payments. Several readers have told us that they intend to close their accounts, suggesting TSB will suffer long-term damage from the IT fiasco. Some have also expressed support for TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s frontline staff, who have been through a very rough week. I may pop back later if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big breaking news. Until then, thanks for reading and commenting. Goodnight! GW Our latest news story on the TSB crisis is now live. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: TSB customers have spent their seventh successive day battling to access their accounts as the bank admitted that the crisis could run into next week. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boss, Paul Pester, said TSB will waive \u00c2\u00a310m in overdraft fees and pay extra interest on current accounts. He has hired a new team of IT experts from IBM who have been told the problems must be fixed by Saturday. However, Jaime Guardiola, the chief executive of TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Spanish owner, Banco Sabadell, said customers may have to wait until next week before normal service returns. The Guardian has uncovered images on LinkedIn of IT workers in Spain who handled the botched transfer celebrating with sparkling wine and exclaiming \u00e2\u20ac\u0153TSB transfer done and dusted!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hell of a team!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The pictures were posted just as the meltdown was beginning, and up to 1.9 million customers were subsequently locked out of their accounts. Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, writes that relations between TSB and its Spanish parent company look rather tense this week.... Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s try to be generous to Paul Pester, TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beleaguered chief executive. His handling of the fallout from the botched IT \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upgrade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has been poor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c some of his statements and tweets have been nonsensical, others have been factually wrong \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it is already clear that the primary blame for the fiasco itself lies in Spain, at the door of Banco Sabadell, TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent. Nils thinks this may explain Pester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refusal to rule out taking a bonus this year: He should have made the gesture, but he may be wondering if the internal blame game will end with his exit and the usual contractual wrangles. The head of an overseas subsidiary usually makes a suitable fall guy. More here: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a round-up of stories from TSB customers this week: Paul Pester has told the Daily Telegraph that he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet know exactly what has caused this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IT meltdown, preventing an army of customers from accessing their accounts online. Asked what the specific issue was, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I have got IBM here. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have two datacentres, miles of fibre-optic cable and several layers of software. Somewhere among that architecture are issues causing capacity constraints. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have a team of experts that will get to the bottom of this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Richard Brittain, the TSB customer who set off today to close his account (having borrowed the petrol money from a friend), has got back in touch. Richard ended up speaking with TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kent area manager - and learned that they think it might take another five working days to clear all the technical problems. The area manager was able to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the withdrawal rules, so Richard could withdraw all his fund and put them in another bank. TSB also managed to trace money that had gone missing from the account since the IT problems began. It sounds like a good effort under the circumstances. As Richard puts it: It was actually refreshing to talk to someone senior enough who could actually deliver solutions, rather than focusing on the problems. I must say, TSB need to not only compensate their customers, but they also need to recognise their staff who have been a real asset. All of the staff I have come across are genuinely sorry and they really are trying their best to help. I have been asked by the area manager to leave the current account open, so that TSB are able to gain my trust back. At the moment, TSB are going to need to work extremely hard to get the public trust back. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happened, but the way that TSB deals with this issue will be the deciding factor as to whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to remain with them. TSB has been churning out some alarming error messages this week -- baffling customers with talk of BeanFactories (to do with programming language Java) and NullPointerExemptions ( \u00c2\u00af\\_(\u00e3\u0192\u201e)_/\u00c2\u00af ). IT expert Simon Needham suspects that the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s user authentication processes aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t scaling properly -- which is why half its internet banking customers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t getting into the service. Bradley Post, managing director of Rift Tax Refunds, says TSB customers should certainly pursue the bank for compensation, and tell HMRC of any problems too. Small business using TSB may struggle to pay HMRC due to the recent problems the bank is facing with their IT systems. The good news is that HMRC will take the circumstances into consideration, however, customers need to record the problems they have encountered so they can put a case together and ensure they do not pay more than they should. The bigger issue now is how customer opinion will change for TSB with some people choosing to sort their finances elsewhere. According to Moneysavingexpert.com customers are now receiving compensation. If you are left out of pocket due to these issues you should look to contact TSB immediately\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Claire McAdam and Ian Roddie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a340 compensation is dwarfed by the bills which some small businesses may claim from TSB. For example, tiler Phil Rooney told BBC Hereford and Worcester that the chaos had already cost him thousands as he was unable to pay staff from his account. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had staff walk out on us, sub-contractors, tilers, electricians, because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not in a position to be able to pay them by the internet payments that we usually use so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost us so far \u00c2\u00a32,000 this week.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moneysavingexpert.com is reporting that the first compensation payments are already going out to customers who have complained. It said Claire McAdam and her partner Ian Roddie from Glasgow have been paid \u00c2\u00a340 compensation after McAdam was unable to access her bank account online or make a bank transfer from her account to repay money she owed on a credit card. The bank paid McAdam \u00c2\u00a315 to cover interest charged for delayed payments on her credit card, and a further \u00c2\u00a325 for inconvenience caused. The \u00c2\u00a340 was paid into McAdam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s TSB account just before noon on Thursday. If \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinconvenience\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 payments to affected customers match the \u00c2\u00a325 paid to McAdam, then TSB is in line for hefty payouts. It has 1.9m online and mobile customers, and if all received the payment the bill would be \u00c2\u00a347.5m. Broadcast journalist Natalia Crawford of Radio Clyde News has tweeted about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely disgraceful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd situation which TSB customers such as herself are suffering: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax authorities have told us that they will understanding if small businesses cannot make payments to them because of the TSB IT meltdown. Some business owners have warned that they cannot make cash transfers, such as VAT payments, to the authorities because they cannot currently get into their TSB account. Asked about the situation, a HMRC spokesperson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153HMRC will take the circumstances of TSB customers into account if asked to do so.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So, TSB customers should record evidence that this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s computer problems prevented them making their scheduled payments. If they have a reasonable excuse, in HMRC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view, they shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t incur any penalties for late payments - as long as they fix the situation when possible. That might reassure SME owners, such as animator Lee Johnson and entrepreneur George Lamptey, who have both tweeted TSB about the issue today: Just in: Paul Pester has told ITV News that IBM team of experts must fixed TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problem by Saturday. That suggests that the bank expects services to remain disrupted until then, but is perhaps hoping to recover by the start of next week (which chimes with Sabadell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments) He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also continuing to duck questions about his bonus, some of which has been held back until the IT migration was completed.... TSB customer Penny Simpson still cannot log into her account online - despite TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that things are running smoothly for the vast majority of customers. She reports that TSB refuses to accept her User ID and password. When she clicks \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcforgotten User ID\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, the bank sends her.... her old log-in details, and says they are now clear to use. So she tries, only to be told they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re incorrect.... Penny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also unpressed by Paul Pester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the underlying banking platform is working well - even though half of internet banking customers ares still locked out. This is like saying the kitchen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cooking up a storm but the restaurant can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get any food. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sick to death of Paul Pester and his shambolic communications. And, most of all, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sick of TSB using the word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as if this is a handful of customers. It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s millions. TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Classic Plus pays interest on the first \u00c2\u00a31,500 of money in the account. So, raising the interest rate on balances from 3% to 5% is actually only worth \u00c2\u00a330 to a customer per year, or \u00c2\u00a32.50 per month. Getting back (briefly) to the European Central Bank meeting in Frankfurt.... ECB chief Mario Draghi has warned that global risks such as protectionism have risen - a clear nod to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade spat with China. Draghi also point out that European economic growth seems to have moderated broadly recently, with some countries experiencing a loss of momentum. But growth is expected to remain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 solid and broad-based\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he adds -- suggesting the ECB isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bracing for a recession.... TSB customer Richard Brittain has has enough of TSB - he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on his way to his local branch to close his account, having borrowed money from a friend to pay for the petrol. He tells me that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s made 13 calls to TSB, only to be disconnected after waiting for up to two hours. Richard says: I am now going into town to get all my money out. TSB have now told me they need 7 working days to fix my current account. He also has sympathy for TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff, who have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153literally in tears\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve handled calls from customers. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think enough is being done to report these issues to TSB. Their number is just constantly engaged, and when you do get through they cut you off after a 2 hour wait in the queue. I have been without access to my bank since Friday... and now we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re being asked to wait even more! Time to move to a better bank! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m \u00c2\u00a3400 down at the moment, all because of TSB. Money is in my account and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being withheld from me! Just goes to show, you cant believe the news. TSB are telling everyone this issue is fixed, yet it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far from it. Another 2 hour wait on the phone to get through to someone, to just be told that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re \u00e2\u20ac\u0153working on it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We are on day seven now, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had no answer as to when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be fixing my issues. TSB have just asked me for 5 WORKING DAYS to get my current account \u00e2\u20ac\u0153un-deleted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and money returned. Meanwhile, the staff are literally in tears on the phone. Its not their fault that their employer decided to screw over two million of us. But, this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get my bills paid. I honestly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what else I can do. Their phone system is diabolical, I get disconnected after waiting in a queue for 2 hours!! Back to TSB, and Paul Pester has just tweeted a reminder of this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement: In other banking news, the European Central Bank has just voted to leave eurozone interest rates unchanged at 0.0%. It also repeated its promise to keep buying government bonds until at least the end of September, or until inflation has risen sustainably close to its target. Several more TSB customers have told us that they intend to close their accounts. David Green, 39, is the owner of a plant and machinery hire company in Birmingham and thinks heads should roll for the mess: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an absolute disgrace. How can I run two businesses with staff and suppliers who require paying from day-to-day? Some suppliers are refusing to serve us services as we cannot pay like we always have done. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not their fault, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect them to, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s diabolical that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been left like this. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruined my business week completely. I have staff who think we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to pay them. We have suppliers who think we are making excuses. I have to keep sending screenshots to people that question me. How embarrassing for a company which will turn over 10 million this year! How can I operate like this? Sackings should happen and the guy at the top needs to join the real world. Just because he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to use his bank every day doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean we are all in the same position as him. I will be closing my business accounts ASAP as I have lost all faith and cannot risk this happening again.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Textile designer, Lucie, 31, says it is very stressful not knowing if her money is safe: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve tried to log in however TSB doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recognise my password! The robotic repetition of apologies and responses on their website are so mind-numbingly bland and unhelpful. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve actually just come back from the bank where I tried to pay my rent and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go through. Their advice was to just: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Keep trying\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. As soon as this is over I will be switching my bank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 To say that Lorraine Kelly, 52, from London, is fuming is an understatement, she tells us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can honestly say that since the weekend it has been a nightmare. I urgently needed to transfer funds to top up my smart meter (as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m on prepay) but after 40 minutes on hold to TSB the line was cut. Having no choice I stupidly tried numerous times with the same outcome. In sheer anger I clicked on their status report and the final insult was a message saying that TSB have restricted some selected customers. What the hell? If I ever get to talk to anyone at TSB it will be to close my accounts and transfer all my money.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge that no customer will be left out of pocket as a result of the fiasco will come with a hefty price tag. The bank estimates that its decision to waive all overdraft fees and interest charges in April, as well as raise the interest rate on its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcClassic Plus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 account to 5% from 3%, will cost an estimated \u00c2\u00a320m. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on top of any regulatory fine the bank might face, as well as the (presumably large) bill for drafting in IBM to fix the problems. The Times is reporting that TSB was warned that its IT migration would flounder unless it spent more money. It says: A TSB adviser warned the bank against embarking on a major internet upgrade on the cheap, The Times can reveal. Consultants raised concerns in 2015 that the bank was not setting aside enough money for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incredibly complex\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd project to move customers to a new online system. One said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There have certainly been some examples of where it has cost significantly more to re-platform an entire bank. It is not overly generous as a budget for that scale of migration.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Parent company Sabadell reported this morning that it set aside \u00e2\u201a\u00ac71m in one-off IT costs to cover the TSB migration. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s roughly twice what UBS analysts had expected....but clearly it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough! Radio 5 Live have uploaded their interview with Paul Pester, in which he admits TSB is on its knees and promised to compensate customers from losses suffered through this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mess. TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to placate its customers by waiving overdraft fees and boosting its current account interest rate has come too late for some customers. Mark Ellison tells us that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moving his account to Metro Bank \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with a heavy heart\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as he had previously worked for TSB for five years. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also filed a complaint over this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disruption. IBM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team of experts have no time to waste -- TSB customers are continuing to report problems with their accounts. TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Spanish parent company has warned that services might not be back to normal until sometime next week! Jaime Guardiola, the CEO of Banco Sabadell, told analysts this morning that the migration onto its IT kit (from TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous owner, Lloyds) had been problematic: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fixing the problem took more time than expected and we were not able to reopen access until Wednesday. I expect next week we will reach something very close to normality,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is quite a u-turn. On Monday, Sabadell announced that the weekend migration was a success, only to quietly remove that press release the next day..... Guardiola also reiterated TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to compensate customers, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will make sure that no customer is left out of pocket and we are asking customers to file complaints that will be processed. Waiving overdraft fees is a good start, but it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tackle all the losses suffered by TSB customers this week. People could be hit by late fees, for example, if they fail to meet credit card bills or other loan repayments. Clea Bourne, lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London, says the whole financial sector should show some understanding . The decision to call in IBM tech experts to tackle TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IT problems suggests that the problem is bigger than the company realised and may take several days to fix. Remember, at 3.40am yesterday Paul Pester was confidently tweeting that things were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcup and running\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 again -- something that is going to haunt TSB chief for a while. Now he actually has to make it happen, declaring: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will take direct control from 8 o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122clock this morning for our platform, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve drafted in a team of global experts from IBM. They are reporting to me, directly to me and I will take control of the platform until it gets fixed. I am putting things right.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Q: Were you warned last week that you weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready for this IT migration? We were ready for the platform switch, CEO Paul Pester insists. TSB expected some turbulence, but no-one expected the issues that have hit the bank since the weekend. Q: Have you considered resigning? I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even had time to think about it, Pester replies. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the Radio 5 interview. Paul Pester is now being grilled on Radio 5 Live over TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IT mayhem. Q: Why didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you give more information to customers, and claim that everything was fixed when it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t? Pester says that the fundamentals of the bank, such as standing orders, direct debits, ATM machines, are working well. The problem is with capacity -- handling the number of customers who want to use internet and mobile banking services. Q: Why did you tweet that TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcup and running\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 , when for many customers it clearly wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t? Pester says TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IT provider (parent company Sabadell) told him it was fixed. Clearly that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the case. However, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now taken personal control - a team of experts from IBM will land at Bristol at 8am his morning, and start to tackle the problem. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unacceptable that only 50% of customers can access our internet banking, declares Pester. Q: Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it also unacceptable that you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have control of your customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accounts over the weekend? Pester ducks the question; instead, he plugs the decision to waive overdraft fees and raise the interest rate on the Classic Plus current account for current customers who \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stick with us\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This is a fight worth fighting. TSB was created to bring more competition into UK banking. Q: Will customers be properly compensated? No customer will be left out of pocket, Pester pledges. We won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be penny-pinching. Small businesses who have suffered losses because they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been able to pay suppliers or contractors should get in touch. Asked whether he would be giving up a potential \u00c2\u00a31.6m bonus, Pester told BBC Radio 4 that it was a matter for the company: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The last thing I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m worried about at the moment is bonuses and pay. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m focused on putting things right for customers. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not my decision, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a focus for them [the board]. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a decision for the remuneration committee.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Speaking on Radio 4, Paul Pester says he has taken control of TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IT platform himself - to tackle the problems that mean only 50% of its customers can get online. NEWSFLASH: TSB has announced that it will waive all overdraft fees and interest charges for retail customers and small business owners for April, as it tries to assuage the anger over its IT meltdown this week. After days of turmoil, TSB has also decided to raise the interest rate on its popular \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcClassic Plus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 account to 5% (a very decent interest rate these days), from 3% -- an attempt to prevent customers fleeing to a rival. In a statement, it says: No TSB customer will be left out of pocket as a result of these issues \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to begin to put this right we will be waiving all overdraft fees and interest charges for all of our retail and small business customers for April. As a way of saying thank you to our customers for sticking with us, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be increasing the interest rate on our Classic Plus account to 5% AER. CEO Paul Pester admits that TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s migration to new servers last weekend had been very unsatisfactory. He says: As we moved over to our new banking platform last weekend, the landing was an incredibly bumpy one for our customers, and for that I am truly sorry. This is not the level of service that we pride ourselves on providing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nor is it what our customers have come to expect from TSB.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of course, customers can rest assured that no one will be left out of pocket as a result of these problems. To begin to put things right, we will be waiving all overdraft fees and interest charges for all of our retail and small business customers for April. TSB also reveals they they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve called experts from IBM in to help fix the problems with its internet banking. In the meantime, customers still report problems: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. One of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst IT botches of recent years continues to rumble on today. TSB customers are still reporting that they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t access the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online systems, nearly a week after they were taken down for a planned IT migration. Last night, TSB admitted that its internet banking service is only running at 50% capacity - which helps explain why scores of users have been locked out. In the eurozone, the European Central Bank is meeting to set monetary policy. Investor will hope for hints about how the ECB will handle its money-printing stimulus programme, which currently runs until September. In the markets, European stocks are expected to nudge higher after Facebook posted record earning figures last night, suggesting its data privacy problems haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hurt profitability. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 12.45pm BST: ECB decision on interest rates 1.30pm BST: ECB chief Mario Draghi holds a press conference 1.30pm BST: US trade figures for March",

                "body":"<p>It was all so different for Paul Pester last December. Unveiling TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new banking platform, he claimed that it had created \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a more digital, agile and flexible TSB\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Before last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s switch to the new system, TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press office said that almost everything was running on the new platform; there was only the little matter of transferring 1.3bn account details for 5&#xa0;million customers, and all would be done.</p> <p>Now, Pester finds himself presiding over another example of a great British IT failure. In the same week, outsourcing company Capita, which has had problems with contracts with GP surgeries and London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s congestion charge, said it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/23/capita-losses-worsen-debt-outsourcing-carillion\" title=\"\">seeking a \u00c2\u00a3701m rights issue</a> as part of an overhaul that includes rebuilding its technology and IT infrastructure. Meanwhile, the government has found itself in even further trouble over the Windrush scandal due to the Home Office\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inability to digitise a set of landing cards from 70&#xa0;years ago. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s before we talk about the stuttering, long-delayed rollout of universal credit.</p> <p>Is it that Britain is just bad at IT projects? You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to look far to find examples at the banks: each of NatWest, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds and RBS have had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153glitches\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of greater or lesser impact in the past few years. BT took a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/apr/12/bt-writedowns-nhs-computer-upgrade\" title=\"\">big writedown on a calamitous NHS computerisation</a> nearly a decade ago. In the private or public sector, there seems to be a record of messing up.</p> <p>But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to get the wrong impression. We generally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear about all the projects that go right, because we just expect ATMs to serve us money, or tills to work, or unseen globe-spanning search engines to return results, or apps on our phones to open. TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s customers had already been using the platform behind last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crisis for almost everything, apart from their accounts; Sabadell, the Spanish parent of TSB, built the technology over nearly three years, building on earlier technology from Accenture. This wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a rush job.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Managers who insist on hitting calendar targets probably aren't familiar with the endless testing computer systems need</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chiefs may have forgotten the longstanding rule of IT projects: completing the first 80% of it takes 80% of your time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the last 20% takes another 80%. Managers who insist on hitting calendar targets probably aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t familiar with the endless testing that computer systems and code need.</p> <p>To think that the UK excels at being bad at IT projects, though, is unnecessary self-flagellation. In the US, public and private mess up too: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/26/barack-obama-obamacare-website-republicans\" title=\"\">launch of the Healthcare.gov</a> site in 2013 was calamitously bad, with only a tiny percentage of people able to use it at first. It improved, but there were red faces all round. In September 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/24/apple-ios8-update-withdrawn-iphones-bugs\" title=\"\">Apple pushed out a software update</a> for the iPhone that killed its phone capability (it was quickly reverted). And Facebook, of course, allowed the personal data of more than 80 million people to be scraped from its site.</p> <p>The difficulty is that software, unlike a steel beam, is hard to test for use in different environments; Nasa has managed to write error-free code, but it takes years of effort for comparatively short programs. The general level of sophistication in how software is written is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the hunter-gatherer stage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to one professor studying it: professional code is full of bugs which have to be fixed, which often exposes other underlying bugs. The interaction between code on different systems can be unpredictable. And meanwhile managers want it done to a budget and a date.</p> <p>In fact, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life in the IT project business. Capita says it will now focus on five outsourcing areas rather than 40; two of the survivors are software and IT outsourcing. Its results show that both had better profit margins than other divisions. Software is the future; and we aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that bad at it.</p> <h2>Powerful case for UK to get on board with onshore windfarms</h2> <p>When the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/24/uk-power-generation-coal-free-gas-renewables-nuclear\" title=\"\">UK went without coal for three days this week</a>, it was wind turbines that provided much of the power to keep the lights on. Contrary to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/18/tories-end-onshore-windfarm-subsidies-2016\" title=\"\">what the Conservative party might have you think</a>, people like windfarms.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/energy-and-climate-change-public-attitudes-tracker-wave-25\" title=\"\">New government polling</a> shows support for offshore windfarms is at a record high, with 83% of the public backing them. Even onshore windfarms, which energy minister Claire Perry said the Tories had blocked because they were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just so controversial\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, are now more popular than ever. For the first time, more than three-quarters of the public (76%) say they support them. Solar energy has 87% in&#xa0;favour.</p> <p>During the coal-free run, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/beisgovuk/status/988763398694428675\" title=\"\">the government boasted</a> that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153world-leading renewables\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd were going from strength to strength. Yet while there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/12/uk-puts-energy-efficiency-at-heart-of-climate-change-strategy\" title=\"\">more billpayer subsidy earmarked for offshore windfarms</a>, there is still no support for solar and onshore wind power. Perry said she was now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153looking carefully\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at helping onshore windfarms to be built in Scotland and Wales.</p> <p>More offshore wind is great. The UK is reaping the rewards for its leadership there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c witness <a href=\"https://ore.catapult.org.uk/press-releases/ge-renewable-energy-and-ore-catapult-sign-five-year-rd-agreement-to-advance-offshore-wind-technologies-in-the-uk/\" title=\"\">GE choosing the UK to test its new 12MW turbine</a>, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful. But onshore windfarms are still significantly cheaper. Research <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/23/drop-in-wind-energy-costs-adds-pressure-for-government-rethink\" title=\"\">has found</a> they could be built without consumers paying any subsidy and for the same price as new gas power plants. Big firms are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/20/uk-subsidy-free-renewable-energy-projects-set-soar-aurora-energy-research-analysts\" title=\"\">lining up</a> to say they want to build more onshore wind power. Innogy, Vattenfall, SSE and ScottishPower are among the firms keen to develop windfarms in Scotland and Wales. Unlike nuclear plants, onshore windfarms can be built quickly.</p> <p>Public and political debates on energy are dominated by the cost of bills, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/feb/26/households-could-save-100-a-year-as-energy-price-cap-moves-closer\" title=\"\">of price caps</a>. What better time to unblock the cheapest source of green power?</p> <h2>Beast from the east isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t to blame for GDP slump \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the frozen wages</h2> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to read too much into a single set of figures, but Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s combination of almost zero GDP growth and rising personal insolvencies presents the British government with a gloomy economic health check.</p> <p>Back in 2015 there were fewer than 20,000 personal insolvencies. In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/27/uk-gdp-growth-rate-slows-first-quarter\" title=\"\">first quarter of 2018 the total reached 27,388</a> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which was the highest quarterly figure recorded since 2012.</p> <p>A fall in GDP growth from 0.4% in the last three months of 2017 to 0.1% in the first three months of 2018 was even more disturbing. This first estimate of economic output showed that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building industry is struggling and the manufacturing sector becalmed. The service industries continue to expand, especially banks in the Square Mile, but not at the pace seen at the height of the recovery in 2015.</p> <p>One-off factors may have played a part, though apparently not the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beast from the east\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd cold snap that chancellor Philip Hammond reached for as an&#xa0;explanation.</p> <p>A more convincing explanation is the damaging effect of falling real wages over the last year. Without inflation-busting pay rises, it was little surprise that household spending, for so long the heart of the economy, would start to wane.</p> <p>The Treasury, meanwhile, is sitting pretty. It has refused to give government employees and welfare recipients an income increase of any significance and continued the squeeze on departmental spending, capping its costs. Yet it has benefited from the modest rise in private-sector wages, which have boosted PAYE tax receipts, while higher prices in the shops have lifted VAT receipts. As result the budget deficit at the end of March <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/24/boost-for-hammond-as-budget-deficit-hits-lowest-level-since-2007\" title=\"\">fell to its lowest level since 2007</a>.</p> <p>Labour and the unions are right to complain that this situation is unsustainable. By sapping middle- and low-income households of funds, it might boost its own finances, but it undermines the long-term strength of the British&#xa0;economy.</p>",

Before last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s switch to the new system, TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press office said that almost everything was running on the new platform; there was only the little matter of transferring 1.3bn account details for 5 million customers, and all would be done. Now, Pester finds himself presiding over another example of a great British IT failure. In the same week, outsourcing company Capita, which has had problems with contracts with GP surgeries and London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s congestion charge, said it was seeking a \u00c2\u00a3701m rights issue as part of an overhaul that includes rebuilding its technology and IT infrastructure. Meanwhile, the government has found itself in even further trouble over the Windrush scandal due to the Home Office\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inability to digitise a set of landing cards from 70 years ago. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s before we talk about the stuttering, long-delayed rollout of universal credit. Is it that Britain is just bad at IT projects? You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to look far to find examples at the banks: each of NatWest, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds and RBS have had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153glitches\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of greater or lesser impact in the past few years. BT took a big writedown on a calamitous NHS computerisation nearly a decade ago. In the private or public sector, there seems to be a record of messing up. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to get the wrong impression. We generally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear about all the projects that go right, because we just expect ATMs to serve us money, or tills to work, or unseen globe-spanning search engines to return results, or apps on our phones to open. TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s customers had already been using the platform behind last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crisis for almost everything, apart from their accounts; Sabadell, the Spanish parent of TSB, built the technology over nearly three years, building on earlier technology from Accenture. This wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a rush job. However, TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chiefs may have forgotten the longstanding rule of IT projects: completing the first 80% of it takes 80% of your time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the last 20% takes another 80%. Managers who insist on hitting calendar targets probably aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t familiar with the endless testing that computer systems and code need. To think that the UK excels at being bad at IT projects, though, is unnecessary self-flagellation. In the US, public and private mess up too: the launch of the Healthcare.gov site in 2013 was calamitously bad, with only a tiny percentage of people able to use it at first. It improved, but there were red faces all round. In September 2014, Apple pushed out a software update for the iPhone that killed its phone capability (it was quickly reverted). And Facebook, of course, allowed the personal data of more than 80 million people to be scraped from its site. The difficulty is that software, unlike a steel beam, is hard to test for use in different environments; Nasa has managed to write error-free code, but it takes years of effort for comparatively short programs. The general level of sophistication in how software is written is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the hunter-gatherer stage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to one professor studying it: professional code is full of bugs which have to be fixed, which often exposes other underlying bugs. The interaction between code on different systems can be unpredictable. And meanwhile managers want it done to a budget and a date. In fact, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life in the IT project business. Capita says it will now focus on five outsourcing areas rather than 40; two of the survivors are software and IT outsourcing. Its results show that both had better profit margins than other divisions. Software is the future; and we aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that bad at it. Powerful case for UK to get on board with onshore windfarms When the UK went without coal for three days this week, it was wind turbines that provided much of the power to keep the lights on. Contrary to what the Conservative party might have you think, people like windfarms. New government polling shows support for offshore windfarms is at a record high, with 83% of the public backing them. Even onshore windfarms, which energy minister Claire Perry said the Tories had blocked because they were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just so controversial\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, are now more popular than ever. For the first time, more than three-quarters of the public (76%) say they support them. Solar energy has 87% in favour. During the coal-free run, the government boasted that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153world-leading renewables\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd were going from strength to strength. Yet while there is more billpayer subsidy earmarked for offshore windfarms, there is still no support for solar and onshore wind power. Perry said she was now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153looking carefully\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at helping onshore windfarms to be built in Scotland and Wales. More offshore wind is great. The UK is reaping the rewards for its leadership there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c witness GE choosing the UK to test its new 12MW turbine, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful. But onshore windfarms are still significantly cheaper. Research has found they could be built without consumers paying any subsidy and for the same price as new gas power plants. Big firms are lining up to say they want to build more onshore wind power. Innogy, Vattenfall, SSE and ScottishPower are among the firms keen to develop windfarms in Scotland and Wales. Unlike nuclear plants, onshore windfarms can be built quickly. Public and political debates on energy are dominated by the cost of bills, of price caps. What better time to unblock the cheapest source of green power? Beast from the east isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t to blame for GDP slump \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the frozen wages It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to read too much into a single set of figures, but Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s combination of almost zero GDP growth and rising personal insolvencies presents the British government with a gloomy economic health check. Back in 2015 there were fewer than 20,000 personal insolvencies. In the first quarter of 2018 the total reached 27,388 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which was the highest quarterly figure recorded since 2012. A fall in GDP growth from 0.4% in the last three months of 2017 to 0.1% in the first three months of 2018 was even more disturbing. This first estimate of economic output showed that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building industry is struggling and the manufacturing sector becalmed. The service industries continue to expand, especially banks in the Square Mile, but not at the pace seen at the height of the recovery in 2015. One-off factors may have played a part, though apparently not the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beast from the east\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd cold snap that chancellor Philip Hammond reached for as an explanation. A more convincing explanation is the damaging effect of falling real wages over the last year. Without inflation-busting pay rises, it was little surprise that household spending, for so long the heart of the economy, would start to wane. The Treasury, meanwhile, is sitting pretty. It has refused to give government employees and welfare recipients an income increase of any significance and continued the squeeze on departmental spending, capping its costs. Yet it has benefited from the modest rise in private-sector wages, which have boosted PAYE tax receipts, while higher prices in the shops have lifted VAT receipts. As result the budget deficit at the end of March fell to its lowest level since 2007. Labour and the unions are right to complain that this situation is unsustainable. By sapping middle- and low-income households of funds, it might boost its own finances, but it undermines the long-term strength of the British economy.",
