It may be some time before Spotify actually turns a profit though, as the company is resolutely prioritising growth over profit, and will be channelling money into investing in services and building further scale.</p> <p>Unlike its main competitors Apple and Amazon, Spotify is focused on music streaming, so it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t benefit from the network effects of a wider ecosystem.

                "bodyText":"And finally, Spotify has closed at $149 per share. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a drop from its opening level of $165.9, but still 13% above the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreference price\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of $132. That values Spotify at around $26.6bn, more than some analysts had suggested before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our tale of the latest tech float: Goodnight! GW A recovery rally on Wall Street has helped the US stock market recover a chunk of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls. The Dow Jones industrial average has closed 1.65% higher, up 389 points at 24,033 - having lost over 450 points yesterday. Traders were encouraged by reports that the White House was not planning action against Amazon. Spotify may have bucked the trend with its direct listing, but its ownership structure is depressingly familiar, says our financial editor Nils Pratley. Its founders are wedded to keeping vice-like control via a share structure with unequal voting rights. For unequal, read unfair: Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzen own 38.9% of the ordinary shares but they have created \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beneficiary certificates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with super-charged voting rights that only they can own. Include those holdings and Ek and Lorentzen have 80.4% of the votes. As the prospectus is obliged to concede: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If our founders act together, they will have control over the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of directors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Put another way, for as long as the duo stick together, they are unsackable. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, says Spotify has a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgreat story\u00e2\u20ac\u2122; even so, people should be cautious when investing. He explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSpotify is floating on the stock market at a pretty inauspicious time for the tech industry, which has been rocked by the Facebook data scandal and now potentially faces greater regulation as a result. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweeted attacks on Amazon don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help lift sentiment towards the sector either. Despite the downbeat mood music, Spotify shares changed hands on the market at a substantial premium to the highest price previously paid in private transactions, indicating significant investor demand for the stock. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still early in the US trading session however. The attraction of the music-streaming service probably lies in Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong market share and rapidly growing revenues. It may be some time before Spotify actually turns a profit though, as the company is resolutely prioritising growth over profit, and will be channelling money into investing in services and building further scale. Unlike its main competitors Apple and Amazon, Spotify is focused on music streaming, so it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t benefit from the network effects of a wider ecosystem. However the company has already carved out a dominant role, and has demonstrated its ability to leverage scale by renegotiating agreements with music labels, boosting its gross margin from 12% to 21% since 2015. The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Danni Hewson is impressed by the streaming service\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening debut: Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alex Webb points out that Spotify is now worth more than some established players (despite having never made a profit!) Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some video of the moment Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares joined the market: Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are bouncing around in early trading, as investors weigh up whether to buy in at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening price. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just slipped below $164, from the opening price of $165.9. Early days, though.... The Wall Street Journal says Spotify has hit the markets with a bang: Spotify Technology roared onto the public market Tuesday as the music-streaming giant pulled off an unusual method of going public. The stock opened at $165.90 and traded in a close range immediately after. With an opening value of $29.55 billion, Spotify is poised to become the third-largest U.S.-listed tech IPO on record, according to Dealogic. That \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunusual method\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 involved spurning the investment banks who would have underwritten the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares (providing a safety net for the market debut), in return for a large fee. AT LAST! Spotify is finally trading, after more than three hours of intense discussions on the Wall Street trading floor. Shares have opened for trading at $165.90, sharply higher than the $132 which had been suggested. That, by my maths, values Spotify at around $29.5bn. I imagine the company should be pretty pleased - this is a sharp jump on the value of its shares earlier this year (when they could only be traded privately between shareholders). On a lighter note, the New York Stock Exchange has confirmed that it accidentally flew a Swiss flag to mark Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing -- which is unfortunate as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually a Swedish company. More here: Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely market valuation is pushing closer to $30bn, as its unconventional \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdirect listing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 continues to play out on the trading floor There are 178.1 million Spotify shares in existence (although the company is only offering around a third to New York investors today). So if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing hits $170, as seems possible, the company could be worth several billion dollars more than forecast. Market makers on Wall Street are continuing to haggle over Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s valuation, pushing its likely share price value even higher: After a edgy day, European stock markets have closed mostly in the red. The escalation of tensions between China and the US over tariffs hit sentiment in the City, and beyond, as traders returned to their desks after the Easter break. Anxiety over the tech sector also weighed on shares, despite the interest in Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing in New York, and Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upbeat statement. The slowdown in eurozone factory growth last month also didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide traders with any fresh optimism. So, the FTSE 100 finished 26 points lower, or 0.4%, at 7,030. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX shed almost 0.7%, but France was calmer and Italy actually rallied a little. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, thinks Europe could be a safe-haven from some of the turbulence in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets. It was a rough start to the second quarter for European equities. Still, next to the losses seen on Wall Street on Monday, the damage in Europe was contained. Europe is out of the firing line for Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs for now and has a lower weighting in technology companies compared to the US. Both factors make Europe a relative haven from the current negative news flow. Higher still and higher.... Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are now seen opening at $150-$160 - indicating that its stock market listing is going well. Wall Street is pushing higher in volatile trading. The Dow is now up 256 points, or 1% -- which would recover around half of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153investors continue to process the latest chess-moves in the nascent trade war between China and the US,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, so this bounce-back might be fragile. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is 0.2% higher, partly thanks to Tesla which is rallying after sticking to its pledge to more than double production of its Model 3 by the end of June. Those early prices suggest that Spotify could be worth around $27bn, I think. Not too shabby, given the company hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t made a profit out of its 157 million customers. Ooooh - Spotify is being priced at between $145 and $155 per share. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than the $132 which had been pencilled in. This delay is because the company decided not to use investment banks to underwrite its offering -- saving it millions of dollars in fees. So, if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing goes smoothly, other companies might consider taking the same track. Donald Trump is refusing to back down in his fight against Amazon, and just fired off a new tweet: Spotify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market listing is underway...but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what price its shares are trading at yet. Wall Street has opened a little higher, as traders hope to recovery from Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. The Dow has gained 0.5% in early trading, up 123 points at 23,767 Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some early reaction to Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new production numbers: Just in: Electric carmaker Tesla has just released its latest eagerly-awaited production figures, which confirm rumours that it has missed some of its own targets. Tesla says it produced 34,494 vehicles in the last three months, 40% more than the final quarter of 2017. This makes January-March \u00e2\u20ac\u0153by far the most productive quarter in Tesla history\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it says. This includes 9,766 Model 3s (Tesla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new model), and 24,728 were Model S and Model X vehicles. Tesla also reveals that it has ramped up production recently -- amid reports that founder Elon Musk has taken personal control of car output in recent days (and even been sleeping at the factory). The company says: In the past seven days, Tesla produced 2,020 Model 3 vehicles. In the next seven days, we expect to produce 2,000 Model S and X vehicles and 2,000 Model 3 vehicles. It is a testament to the ability of the Tesla production team that Model 3 volume now exceeds Model S and Model X combined. What took our team five years for S/X, took only nine months for Model 3. However, Musk had previously aimed to produce 2,500 Tesla 3 cars each week by now. So Tesla hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hit that goal yet. But crucially, it says it still aims to get production of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc3\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 model up to 5,000 per week in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcabout\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 three months. Shares are rallying in pre-market trading - up around 6% Spotify logos have sprung up at Wall Street, ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing: New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market may claw back some of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses when trading resumes in under an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. The Dow Jones index is expected to rise by 0.6%, or around 140 points, judging by the futures markets. That would take a small bite out of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout, when it lost over 450 points (and was down 730 points at one stage). Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA says the markets are still nervous, though: The second quarter got off to a rough start on Monday, with trade war fears and declining tech stocks taking their toll on investor sentiment, but we are seeing a small rebound ahead of the open on Wall Street. US futures are up to half a percentage point higher on Tuesday, but this pales in comparison to the losses recorded on Monday and reflects ongoing weakness in stocks. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attacks on Amazon over the weekend put the spotlight back on the tech sector, as it tries to recover from the Facebook data scandal that threatens more regulation. Pressure on the sector doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to be going away in the near-term which will continue to act as a drag on indices. Traders might need their tin hats this spring... In less than 90 minutes, music streaming site Spotify will join the US stock exchange. You can get up to speed quickly with our explainer, which outlines why the popular service (which has never turned a profit) could be worth up to $25bn - and why today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listing could be particularly lively.... Joe Weisenthal of Bloomberg is questioning whether Donald Trump has really hurt Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price (as suggested earlier). He points out that other tech companies have suffered similar falls, even though they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been spared a digital roasting from the president: However, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d suggest that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack on Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax affairs (and its implications for the digital companies) are one of several factors weighing on markets. And sometimes, investors like to have an excuse to sell -- especially if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting jittery. Bad news: another 97 workers at the collapsed UK construction and outsourcing group Carillion have lost their jobs. That take the total redundancies at the company to 1,802, since it was liquidated in January in one of the biggest UK corporate failures in years. Some 9,946 jobs have been saved (because other companies have taken on the contracts they work on). Sky is bucking today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff, after a cunning scheme to help Rupert Murdoch take full control of the broadcaster emerged. Disney has \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexpressed interest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in buying Sky News, a move that might clear the way for Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox company take control of the 61% of Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already own. 21CF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid has been hit by media plurality concerns - given Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong position in UK media (including owning the Times and Sun newspapers). But those worries might abate, if Sky News wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t part of the package. Jolly decent of Disney to offer to help, eh? Not exactly. The US giant has its own motive - namely to take over Fox (including all of Sky) in a $66bn (\u00c2\u00a347bn) deal. That takeover risks being derailed because Comcast recently launched its own takeover offer for Sky. Sky shares have risen to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, up 1.5% at \u00c2\u00a313.15. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s higher than either Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer (\u00c2\u00a312.50) or Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (\u00c2\u00a310.75), suggesting traders expect a higher bid. City firm Liberum expects Fox to strike back: We think the news and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments from Sky point to a revised bid from Fox/Disney to trump Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1250p bid. More here: Two and a half-hours into the new trading quarter, and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is still down. The FTSE 100 is currently 46 points lower or 0.6%, at 7010. Industrial stocks, utilities and telecoms firms are leading the selloff. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital blames the double-whammy of trade tensions following China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs, and the tech selloff in America: On tech\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on the market, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a case of the star performers suffering and this has a big psychological effect on sentiment. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just that they have been behind the bulk of the gains in recent years and therefore exert an outsized effect on indices when they sell off; there is also a kind of network effect on other stocks. On trade, there is hope that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to US sanctions is sufficiently moderate and contained to prevent further escalation. However we await to see where this goes and whatever happens from here, there is no \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood news\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the sense that the direction of travel is either one-way or going no further \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we are not about to see a freeing up of global trade (reversal of tariffs), which would be risk-positive. Even if there is no further escalation, the background music is risk-off. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardly unusual for Donald Trump to lash out on Twitter -- as Hillary Clinton, CNN, the FBI, several senators and the Mexican government can all testify. But still, his trenchant criticism of Amazon in recent days has caused a real stir in the markets for several reasons, helping to fuel this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market selloff. Partly, because Trump is taking the side of the old-economy - tweeting that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fully tax paying retailers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are being forced to shut stores because (he claims) Amazon is getting an unfairly good deal. Politifact, a US website, has debunked Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the US Postal Service is losing money thanks to Amazon. It says: Amazon isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t causing the United States Postal Service to lose a fortune. In fact, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contributing to its biggest growth sector, package delivery. Deals like the one with Amazon brought in $7 billion in fiscal year 2017. But still, the US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments suggest that other tech disruptors could also come under fire -- especially if changes are made to the US tax system to help traditional retailers. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the only concern. Some industry figures are concerned that Amazon (whose shares fell 5% yesterday) is being hammered because its founder, Jeff Bezos, also owns the Washington Post. Vanity Fair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gabriel Sherman is reporting that Trump is firmly focused on Bezos, thanks to the Post\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of his presidency: Sherman says: He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s off the hook on this. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s war,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd one source told me. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He gets obsessed with something, and now he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obsessed with Bezos,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said another source. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump is like, how can I fuck with him?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That sort of behaviour will unnerve Wall Street, as investors try to judge where to place their money. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also unusual to see politicians try to settle scores so publicly. Paul Donovan, UBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief global economist, fears that such \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrandom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attacks could undermine faith in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrule of law\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Just in: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing has just posted its slowest quarter growth in a year. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all bad -- growth in March picked up a little, pushing the manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Index up to 55.1 from 55.0 in February. Factory bosses reported that output growth picked up last month, but increases in new orders and employment slowed. Data firm Markit says: The average reading over the opening quarter as a whole (55.1) was the weakest in a year, suggesting that the underlying pace of expansion has been generally slower since the start of 2018. Growth across Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector has hit an eight-month low, as the recent \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceuro boom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 falters. The eurozone manufacturing PMI, which tracks activity across the sector, dropped to 56.6 in March, down from 58.6 in February. This is the third monthly drop in a row, but it still signals solid growth (50 points would show stagnation). Factory bosses reported that output, new orders and new exports grew at a slower rate last month. They also reported problems getting hold of the raw materials and parts they needed, as supply chains struggled to cope. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, is concerned that business confidence also dipped last month. The fact that business optimism about the coming year has slipped to a 15-month low suggests there are other factors that are now hitting factory order books. Export growth has more than halved since late last year, linked in part to the appreciation of the euro, and in some cases demand is being stymied by higher prices. Hopes that the markets might calm down after their volatile start to 2018 have been dashed this morning. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, says investors need to decide whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re heading into a bear market, or just a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrevaluation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of asset prices. The major fear for markets is that the imposition of retaliatory import tariffs by China could just be the tip of the iceberg and will cause a chain reaction that drags more sectors and countries into the dispute. In a world where China is not willing to turn the other cheek and where President Trump likes to get the last word, the situation is set for further turmoil and the danger for investors is that this will escalate into a broader battle, which could leave few sectors immune to trouble. Each of the major tech companies appears to have its own particular set of problems to deal with. Facebook - data security. Intel - Apple chips. Tesla - missed targets compounding fears of excessive leverage. Amazon - President Trump. However, the one thing these companies do have in common is that these stocks are held by most of the big popular global funds. This means that many investors may have substantial exposure, even if they are not direct shareholders, which makes the tech troubles a wider problem. Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff was actually Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst start to an April since 1929 -- a date etched in market memory thanks to the crash later that year. Now, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just one day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading, but its not a great open for the second quarter either... Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff means America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P 500 has now shed 3.4% since the start of the year, while the Dow is down almost 5%. That follows a remarkable 2017, which saw the US stock market surge by around 25%. European markets have fallen down across the board in nervous trading, as traders rush to catch up with events after the Easter break. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says fears of a trade war are refusing to go away: On Monday China announced that it has implemented afforementioned tariffs on 128 types of US goods. Implementing the tariffs makes China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel and aluminium tariffs official. China has to show it is serious. We still expect a settlement in trade negotiations between the two nations. Sentiment will be fragile until the result of trade negotiations become clear. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has fallen sharply at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 shed 54 points, or 0,7%, to 7001 points, as traders take their cue from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide on Wall Street. The US president appears to have unnerved the markets, with his trade war rhetoric and attacks on Amazon. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, explains: The fall in tech stocks and escalating trade tensions continued to rattle markets after the Easter break. This time, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs and tech stocks driving the selloff, and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the U.S. President is doing himself any favors before the midterm elections. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been aggressive, by imposing levies on $3 billion worth of imports from the U.S.; the question now is - what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next? A tariff \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctit for tat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is a lose-lose scenario. So, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely that after this war of nerves, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies will find a middle ground. Markets should get used to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiating style - kicking off with something dramatic, and then scaling down through negotiation. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fresh worries over a global trade war are rippling through the markets today, after China hit back against America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on steel and aluminium by targeting imports of food, wine, steel and even ginseng. The news that Beijing is imposing its own tariffs of up to 25% on more than 120 US products sparked a selloff on Wall Street last night, sending the S&amp;P into correction territory. The Dow plunged by over 700 points at one stage, before ending the day 458 points lower. With Donald Trump expected to announce new curbs on China soon, traders are worried that this tit-for-tat action could escalate. As David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Beijing decided to impose levies on approximately $3 billion worth of goods from the US. In the grand scheme of things, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been too aggressive, but dealers fear we could be starting a long trade war. The ball is now in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in court, and traders are waiting for the US President to make the next move. European markets were closed yesterday for Easter Monday, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting losses of almost 1% on the main indices this morning. Trump has also put the technology sector into a spin, after sending a series of tweets criticising Amazon for avoiding taxes and not paying the US Post Office a fair rate. Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price tanked by over 5% on Monday, on concerns that the e-commerce giant is firmly in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s firing line. Music streaming site Spotify will hope to ride out the market choppiness, when it lists its shares on the New York stock exchange for the first time. Spotify has taken the refreshing decision not to employ investment banks to underwrite its listing, so the launch could be more volatile than usual. We also get a new healthcheck on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector: The agenda 9am BST: Eurozone manufacturing PMI survey for March 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI survey for March 2.30pm BST: Spotify joins the US stock market",

The notebook on which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m writing this was designed in California, but probably assembled in China, with many of the components coming from South Korea and Japan. Apple could produce it entirely in North America, and probably would in the face of 30 percent tariffs. But the factories it would take to do that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t (yet) exist.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the factories that do exist were built to serve globalized production \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and many of them would be marginalized, maybe even made worthless, by tariffs that broke up those global value chains. That is, they would become stranded assets. Call it the anti-China shock.</p> <p>Of course, it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just be factories left stranded by a trade war. A lot of people would be stranded too. The point of the famous \u00e2\u20ac\u0153<a href=\"https://www.ddorn.net/papers/Autor-Dorn-Hanson-ChinaShock.pdf\">China shock</a>\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd paper by Autor et al wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that rapid trade growth made America as a whole poorer, it was that rapid changes in the location of production displaced a significant number of workers, creating personal hardship and hurting their communities. The irony is that an anti-China shock would do exactly the same thing. And I, at least, care more about the impact on workers than the impact on capital.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/981529499539050496\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Some thoughts on trade wars and the stock market that doesn&#39;t like them <a href=\"https://t.co/4PoalWlx7a\">https://t.co/4PoalWlx7a</a></p>&mdash; Paul Krugman (@paulkrugman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/981529499539050496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 4, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ac500e8e4b0dec03f4a8aea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-04T17:48:05.801Z\">6.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Analysts at Capital Economics have warned that President Donald Trump could raise the stakes further, possibly by labelling China a currency manipulator later this month.</strong></p> <p>In a note to clients, they say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The next flashpoint may be the US Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s semi-annual currency report, due out this month.

There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already backchannel talks going on. So look, I understand the stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anxiety. I get that. But on the other hand, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over react. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see how this works out.</p> <p>My view Stu, look, you know I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a growth guy, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a Reagan supply side growth guy. I think that at the end of this whole process, that at the end of the rainbow, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pot of gold. And if you open up that pot, you will see better economic growth, more trading going on, improved wages for both sides.</p> <p>Anytime you lower barriers, anytime you lower barriers, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key, the president will say this, lower barriers is the key, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raise the barriers. Anytime you do that, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for growth. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for American growth and American workers, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for the rest of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ac4f43de4b099ccac8cd46f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-04T15:54:34.839Z\">4.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a volatile morning on the New York stock exchange, as traders saw shares slide sharply at the open before recovering some ground...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f2cf21a647b6789115d63a7e324e59793cfbe03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f2cf21a647b6789115d63a7e324e59793cfbe03/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trader Peter Tuchman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trader Peter Tuchman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7214ff2a005b76d9a7c72d8c9a09b1c0fcbde5b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7214ff2a005b76d9a7c72d8c9a09b1c0fcbde5b7/0_0_3500_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traders react as they work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., April 4, 2018.

                "bodyText":"Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report on Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise rebound: Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three major indexes staged a comeback to close around 1 percent higher on Wednesday as investors turned their focus to earnings and away from a trade conflict between the United States and China that wreaked havoc in earlier trading. After investors fled equities in the morning due to proposed retaliatory tariffs from China, their concerns about a potential trade war eased by the afternoon after Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the administration was in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negotiation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with China rather than a trade war. Investors said they were comforted by the fact that any tariffs would not take effect immediately, if at all. Strategists also cited the S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bounce above a key technical support level and said they expect equities to rise further around the first quarter earnings season, due to start in mid-April. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re starting to feel that while markets hate uncertainty, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bark is worse than his bite when it comes to trade,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas. In a surprise twist, shares have surged back in New York. The Dow has closed up 230 points, bouncing back from its early slump. Why? Well, markets are mysterious and sometimes random things, but Larry Kudlow can take some credit after his efforts telling investors not to panic. Paul Krugman, the Nobel-prize wining economist (and trade expert) has written an article for the New York Times, outlining why a trade war would be highly disruptive. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Since about 1990 corporate America has bet heavily on hyperglobalization \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on the continuance of an open-market regime that has encouraged complex value chains that sprawl across borders. The notebook on which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m writing this was designed in California, but probably assembled in China, with many of the components coming from South Korea and Japan. Apple could produce it entirely in North America, and probably would in the face of 30 percent tariffs. But the factories it would take to do that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t (yet) exist. Meanwhile, the factories that do exist were built to serve globalized production \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and many of them would be marginalized, maybe even made worthless, by tariffs that broke up those global value chains. That is, they would become stranded assets. Call it the anti-China shock. Of course, it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just be factories left stranded by a trade war. A lot of people would be stranded too. The point of the famous \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China shock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd paper by Autor et al wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that rapid trade growth made America as a whole poorer, it was that rapid changes in the location of production displaced a significant number of workers, creating personal hardship and hurting their communities. The irony is that an anti-China shock would do exactly the same thing. And I, at least, care more about the impact on workers than the impact on capital. Analysts at Capital Economics have warned that President Donald Trump could raise the stakes further, possibly by labelling China a currency manipulator later this month. In a note to clients, they say: The next flashpoint may be the US Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s semi-annual currency report, due out this month. As a candidate, Trump promised to label China a currency manipulator \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on day one\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but so far has resisted. In and of itself, that would not trigger any action, but it would be a signal that the trade spat is escalating. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story on the US/China trade spat, for anyone just tuning in: China has raised the stakes in the escalating trade showdown with the United States by unveiling tariffs on a wide-ranging list of American imports in response to levies on Chinese goods put forward by Donald Trump. Beijing will impose additional tariffs of 25% on 106 American products from 14 separate categories, including soybean, cars and chemical products, covering imports to China worth up to $50bn (\u00c2\u00a336bn), Chinese state news agencies said on Wednesday. The measures come after the US announced details of new 25% tariffs on $50bn worth of imports from China drawn up by the Trump administration. The list of more than 1,300 products targets China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial base, covering everything from industrial robots and electronics to metal alloys and aircraft parts. Washington said the levies were in response to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unfair trade practices related to the forced transfer of US technology and intellectual property,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd adding that the list of products had been designed to target China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial plans while minimising the impact on the US economy. The array of Chinese products that would be affected is lengthy and varied, covering everything from aircraft jets and tyres, to uranium and nuclear reactor parts, poultry incubators, haymaking machines and guns and ammunition. Technology products are also hit, including TV cameras, jukeboxes and cassette players. The proposed list will undergo a public review process before trade officials ultimately decide which products should be hit by tariffs. The Chinese state news agency Xinhua said the country would only implement its tariffs on American goods once the US government imposed levies on imports from China. Some types of aircraft, lubricants, tobacco and orange juice are on the list of products targeted by Beijing, along with some trucks and SUVs. The inclusion of agricultural and food and drink products such as soybeans, whisky, beef, corn and wheat is likely to raise eyebrows for targeting southern American states where Trump drew much of his support while running for the presidency. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also pulled together a full list of the products which could be landed with new tariffs: Wall Street is looking calmer now, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back with any major developments.... Other countries could benefit if China hits US exporters with new tariffs. As Dutch financial group bank Rabobank puts it: There aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough soybeans in the world to meet China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demands without US supplies. They suspect that farmers in Australia and Brazil might benefit, at the expense of US farmers, if American agricultural products become uncompetitively priced in China. European stock markets have closed for the night, with trade jitters weighing on shares. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the biggest companies across Europe, has lost 0.5% today, with losses in Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market did a little better, though, with the FTSE 100 finishing 3 points higher (up a meagre 0.05%). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a transcript of Larry Kudlow, the US National Economic Council Director, telling Fox Business why a trade war won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t break out between the US and China. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Absolutely not. Absolutely not. And let me just say right at the top, number one, blame China, not President Trump. Because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been going on for many years. Trump is really the first president to fight back and to put a shot across the bow, stealing intellectual property rights, technology transfers, high barriers, investment limitations, high tariffs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this stuff really is not just unfair, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlawful. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outside the boundaries of the WTO. Every country in the world knows this. Every analyst knows this is the case. Somebody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got to deal with it. President Trump is going to deal with it. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no trade war here. What you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got is the early stages of a process which will include tariffs, comments on the tariffs, then ultimate decisions and negotiations. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already backchannel talks going on. So look, I understand the stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anxiety. I get that. But on the other hand, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over react. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see how this works out. My view Stu, look, you know I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a growth guy, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a Reagan supply side growth guy. I think that at the end of this whole process, that at the end of the rainbow, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pot of gold. And if you open up that pot, you will see better economic growth, more trading going on, improved wages for both sides. Anytime you lower barriers, anytime you lower barriers, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key, the president will say this, lower barriers is the key, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raise the barriers. Anytime you do that, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for growth. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for American growth and American workers, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for the rest of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a volatile morning on the New York stock exchange, as traders saw shares slide sharply at the open before recovering some ground... Jonathan Butcher, principal economist at consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie, reckons a full-blown trade clash between America and China would hurt global growth badly. He says the mere risk of trade disputes will make people reluctant to spend, and discourage firms from investing in new equipment and factories. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The risk of a trade war developing is a threat to the global economy. We are currently enjoying a period of robust global growth, but sentiment plays a big part in maintaining economic momentum. The threat of a trade war could dampen sentiment, slowing consumer spending and business investment. Should a trade war escalate between the US and China, Wood Mackenzie estimates that global economic growth could slow from 2.9% to 2.2% over the next 4 years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wall Street is clawing its way back from its early slump. The Dow is still in the red, but only by 150 points (-0.6%) while the Nasdaq is only 0.5% lower lower. Traders may be heeding the soothing words of economics advisor Larry Kudlow, and reassessing the risks of a trade war. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also received some decent economic news today. US companies created 241,000 private sector jobs last month, more than expected. That indicates the labor market is still strong, and could mean a strong Non-Farm Payroll jobs report on Friday. Commodity prices are still suffering, though; the soybean future contract is down almost 3%. Larry Kudlow, the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new top economic advisor, has embarked on a mission to calm the markets. Speaking to reporters on the White House driveway, Kudlow insisted that America wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t about to lose a trade war with China. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it that way. This is a negotiation, using all the tools\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kudlow has also popped up on Fox Business, to tell the markets not to panic. He claims that the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal is to get rid of trade barriers, and create a genuine level-playing field of free and fair trade. As Kudlow puts it: I think that at the end of this whole process, the end of the rainbow, there is a pot of gold. If you open up that pot, you will see better economic growth, more trading going on, improved wages for both sides. Any time you lower barriers....it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for growth. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for American growth and American workers. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good for the rest of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth. The US president has tweeted again: $500bn is a nice round number, but officially the US only ran a trade in goods deficit of $375.2bn with China last year. Any farmer planning to sell his soybean crop may not agree either...... Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff means the Dow is now 11% off its record high, leaving it in correction territory. That record high, of 26,616 points, was set on Friday 26th January - the day Donald Trump addressed the World Economic Forum, and boasted that the US stock market was up 50% since he won the election. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never been higher since.... This is turning into a broad-based rout. Each of the 30 blue-chip companies which makes up the Dow has fallen into the red. Chemicals maker DowDuPont has lost 2.8%, Intel has lost 2.5%, General Electric and Goldman Sachs is down 2%. Every sector of the S&amp;P 500 has also fallen. Boeing is also being hit hard. Its shares are down over 4% in early trading. Bloomberg explains why China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new 25% tariffs could be bad news for the airline maker: In a tit-for-tat response to tariffs from Trump, China announced the planned levy on aircraft weighing between 15,000 kilograms (33,000 pounds) and 45,000 kilograms, which would include some variants of Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 737 family of passenger jets. Single-aisle jets, dominated by the 737 and Airbus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s A320 family, both with sticker prices of about $100 million, are likely to account for three quarters of the global market over the next two decades, according to Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s estimates. Shares in automobile manufacturers are falling in New York, following the news that China is proposing a 25% tariff on imports of some US cars. Fiat Chrysler is down 2.6%, electric carmaker Tesla has lost 3.7%, and Ford has dipped by 1.5%. The opening bell of the New York stock market is ringing, and shares are taking a bath. The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen by 480 points at the start of trading, as 2% was swiftly wiped off the benchmark index. The S&amp;P 500 index (which includes more companies than the Dow) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index are also sliding, as investors express their anxiety over the tit-for-tat trade clashes between China and the US. Details to follow.... Just time for a quick peek at the European markets...and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all in the red, as trade war fears bite. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says investors have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply disturbed by the speed and extent of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs. Tin hats on... Traders in New York are getting ready for a rough open to the trading session, in just over 10 minutes. The Dow Jones is currently on track to fall by almost 550 points, according to the futures markets, as Wall Street gives its verdict on the latest US-China tariffs. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says trade war fears are gripping the financial markets today. Investors are diving out of shares, and putting money into safe-haven assets like gold, he says: Dow futures have collapsed 500 points and other global indices were sharply lower at the time of writing after China retaliated overnight to a slate of trade measures launched by the US government hours earlier aimed at narrowing China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vast trade surplus with America. China said it will apply tariffs on 106 US-produced goods, ranging from aeroplanes to soya beans. While the escalation of trade wars have weighed heavily on commodity prices such as corn, soya beans, crude oil and copper, gold on the other hand has been able to climb higher thanks to its safe haven status. Gold is up 1% today, at $1,325 per ounce. Jared Bernstein, former economic advisor to vice-president Joe Biden, argues that America and China might not actually impose these tariffs for months, or indeed ever: Economist George Magnus, of Oxford University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s China Centre, believes these new tariffs are only a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfoothill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the history of trade wars. But the situation could become a lot worse, he told Bloomberg TV, if the two sides announce further tariffs. Potentially, almost all US exports to China could face new tariffs, which would hurt both country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economies. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweeted about this fear: Guy Foster, head of research at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, points out there is time for America and China to step back from their new tariffs: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The important thing to note about the current spat between China and the US is that the US has built a timescale for negotiation into their plans. Seven weeks of consultation with the public will follow before US tariffs bite. The Chinese announcement today was to make sure agricultural and aeronautic businesses and workers have the longest time possible to lobby for a climbdown from this confrontation while they engage to find mutually beneficial ways of reducing the bilateral trade deficit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. With an hour to go until the open, the Dow is expected to fall by around 2% - a fairly chunky decline. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details of the Wilbur Ross interview: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs \u00e2\u20ac\u0153amount to about three-tenths of a percent of our GDP. So, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardly a life-threatening activity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ross said in an interview with CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Squawk Box.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relatively proportionate to the tariffs we put on based on the intellectual property.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wilbur Ross, the US Commerce secretary, says we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised that China has hit back today. He told CNBC it would have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremely embarrassing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Beijing if it hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t retaliated, and that markets shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too alarmed. Ross said: They are very good at arithmetic. They know we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about fractions of 1% of the respective economies. So, this is not World War 3. America is waking up to the news that China and the US have taken another step closer to a trade war that could hurt the global economy badly. A few hours ago, China announced plans to impose 25% tariffs on a swathe of US goods, worth $50bn last year. The list includes soybeans, cars and aircraft -- three key export areas. Beef, cigars and whiskey are all on the list too. Economists say the tariffs are tougher than expected. They would hit American exporters, such as farmers, hard, as Beijing puts the US agricultural sector in the firing line. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy finance minister has insisted that China doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a trade war, as it would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclose-lose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 situation. But Beijing has also made it clear that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back down. As its eEmbassy in Washington, put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As the Chinese saying goes, it is only polite to reciprocate. The retaliation came hours after America announced tariffs on over 1,300 Chinese products. The wide-ranging list covered machinery, electronics - even uranium and flamethrowers. The office of the US trade representative said the measures would target products that benefitted from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theft of US intellectual property. President Trump has responded to Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move - he tweeted that America lost its trade war with China many years ago, so must take new measures to close its trade deficit. Angel Gurria, Secretary General of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, has called the latest developments \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery worrysome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He told an audience in London: You are talking about the number one and number two traders in the world,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not good for anyone, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lose-lose situation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US Soybean Export Council has said it \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcregrets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision, warning that companies in the US and China will both suffer. Financial markets have reacted badly, with the price of soybeans tumbling by 5%. European stock markets have fallen into the red, and Wall Street is bracing for a sharp selloff in 90 minutes time. In the futures market, aircraft-maker Boeing are down 4%, and machinery giant Caterpillar has lost 3.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average is expected to fall by over 500 points, or around 2%. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, says investors fear that relations between Washington and Beijing could deteriorate further: Despite hopes of success in negotiations between the US and China last week, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation from China is likely to cement fears amongst analysts of a trade war. The tariffs represent the U.S.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful challenge in decades to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic practices, with 25% tariffs unless Beijing makes major trade and investment concessions. China has announced retaliatory measures today, with 25% tariffs on US goods, leading the markets in Europe to slump this morning. The uncertainty in the markets over the heightening trade tensions also weighed on the oil markets. Traders will be bracing themselves for further volatility in the coming days.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: President Trump has declared that America has already lost the trade war with China: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a change of position from Trump. Last month, he tweeted that trade wars were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood, and easy to win\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - for a country in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position. Christopher Balding, associate professor of business and economics at the HSBC Business School in Shenzhen, reckons China has a clear warning to America -- back down over trade, or else: Last year, the US-China Business Council issued a report explaining why exports to China were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vital to US economic growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They pointed out that China is America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-largest goods export market (behind Canada and Mexico), while service exports swelled over 400% between 2006 and 2015. The report argued that trade with China supports a lot of US jobs: US goods exports to China come from a wide range of industries including transportation equipment, agriculture, computers and electronics, and chemicals. These exports also sustain logistics jobs in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ports and throughout the country. US services exports to China included travel and education, royalties, transportation, business and professional services, and financial services. The Council also explains how States across America have a stake - and could thus suffer from a trade war: Most states have seen significant increases in exports of goods and services to China since 2006. Thirty states experienced at least triple-digit goods export growth to China since 2006, and four states saw growth of more than 500 percent over the same period: Alabama, Montana, North Dakota, and South Carolina. Every US state had triple-digit services export growth to China since 2006, 16 states had export growth of more than 400 percent. China is among the top five goods and services export markets for most states. China was a top three goods export market for 39 states in 2016, and among the top five for another eight states. That includes states that are not usually associated with strong China trade ties, including Alabama, Arizona, Minnesota, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, South Carolina, and Tennessee Wendy Chen, an economist at Nomura, has told my colleague Lily Kuo that America and China can still avoid a trade war: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think there is still room for negotiation between the two economies, although the risk of a full-blown trade war is rising,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that the Chinese government isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t messing about with its new tariffs. By including aircraft, soybeans and cars, Beijing is targeting the three largest exports from America to China last year (according to the US Census Bureau). China has released a list of the 106 US products which will incur a new 25% tariff (unless Donald Trump backs down and abandons America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed tariffs on Chinese goods). The list includes: Yellow soybeans black soybeans other corn corn flour uncombed cotton durum wheat fresh and cold beef (whole head or half) fresh and cold beef with bones frozen boneless beef unstemmed tobacco tobacco cigars tobacco cigarettes cigar and cigarettes with tobacco substitute hookah materials frozen orange juice whiskey various types of cars and trucks aircrafts of more than 15000kg but less than 45000 kg weight Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full list China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy commerce minister, Wang Shouwen, has blamed the US government for triggering the latest tit-for-tat tariffs. Shouwen told reporters in Beijing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It must be said, we have been forced into taking this action. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our action is restrained.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wang was speaking alongside deputy finance minister Zhu Guangyao, as he insisted that China didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a trade war. The future market is now indicating that the Dow Jones industrial average will tumble by 600 points, or more than 2%. Such a sharp selloff would confirm that Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation is firmer than many investors expected (or hoped). Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics, says the strength and scale of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation is somewhat unexpected: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The assumption was China would not respond too aggressively and avoid escalating tensions. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response is a surprise for some people. Evans-Pritchard adds that the two sides could still avert a trade war: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more of a game of brinkmanship, making it clear what the cost would be, in the hopes that both sides can come to agreement and none of these tariffs will come into force.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that China hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t said when these new tariffs on $50bn of US imports will come into effect. The Ministry of Finance says it depends when the $50bn of tariffs outlined by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration last night are implemented. So, unless both sides back down, there will soon be 25% tariffs on $100bn of trade between the two countries: Shares in major American industry giants are expected to take a tumble when Wall Street opens at 2.30pm BST: The soybean selloff is deepening, as traders anticipate weaker demand for this crucial product. Corn and wheat are also being hit by worries of a trade war between China and the US: Back in Beijing, deputy finance minister Zhu Guangyao says China will not give in to pressure for America over intellectual property rights. Reuters has more details: External pressure will instead promote China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s development and innovation, Zhu told reporters in Beijing. Friction is hard to avoid in fast-growing China-U.S. trade, and huge challenges face the two sides, but Zhu said he still hoped relations could return to a healthy track, since a trade war could hurt all sides. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliation is more forceful than the financial markets had expected, says Gao Qi, Singapore-based strategist at Scotiabank. That explains why shares fell immediately in Europe, with Wall Street on track for losses too. He told Bloomberg: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response was tougher than what the market was expecting -- investors didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t foresee the country levying additional tariffs on sensitive and important products such as soybeans and airplanes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors believe a trade war will hurt both countries and their economies eventually.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to slap a 25% tariff on soybean imports from America looks like a real shot over the bows of the Trump administration. Soybeans are a crucial part of the global food chain, used as a source of oil and also to feed livestock such as pigs and chicken. The World Wildlife Fund calls it the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcking of beans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, saying: It contains 38% protein \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 2x as much as pork, 3x more than eggs, and 12x more than milk. Also the protein in soybean has a more complete range of essential amino acids than most other foods. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also used in vegetarian food products like tofu (which comes from soy milk). China is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest import of soybeans; American farms sold around $14bn of soybeans to China companies last year. So farmers in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agricultural belt - which is typically Republican-supporting - may have deep concerns about the tit-for-tat tariffs. NBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Janis Mackey Frayer says China had this in mind when it drew up today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs... Soybean tariffs could also hurt Chinese farmers - pushing up their import prices and making pork more expensive. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign ministry has urged the US to abandon its plan to impose tariffs on 1,300 Chinese products. At a daily press briefing, the ministry said the two countries should resolve trade differences through dialogue. Geng Shuang, a foreign ministry spokesperson, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those who attempt to make China surrender through pressure or intimidation have never succeeded before, and will not succeed now. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy finance minister, Zhu Guangyao, is holding a press conference now. Zhu tells reporters in Beijing that the Chinese government doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a trade war -- despite having just announced retaliatory tariffs on $50bn of American goods. A trade war would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclose-lose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for China and America, he says. Co-operation is the only right choice for both countries, Zhu insists. He says China wants to resolve the issues with America in a constructive way. Analyst John Kemp fears that Beijing and Washington won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to stop the situation escalating into a full-blown trade war: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs are aimed firmly at America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agricultural industry, says John Ross, senior fellow at Renmin University of China: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s swift retaliation against the US has hit the financial markets. The Chinese yuan has fallen 0.4% against the US dollar, its biggest fall in two weeks, according to Reuters data. European stock markets have also slumped into the red; Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is down 0.5%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has shed 1.4%. US stock market is expected to fall sharply when trading begins in around five hours. The Dow is down 1.3% in the futures market. The Chinese finance ministry has released more details of the new 25% tariffs which it will impose on US imports, in retaliation to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs on its exports. It confirms that the reciprocal measures cover 106 different US products. The list includes soybeans, chemicals, whisky, cigars, some types of beef, corn and wheat. Some types of aircraft, lubricants, tobacco and orange juice are also targeted, along with some trucks and SUVs. Crucially, these imports were worth $50bn in 2017 -- that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same value as the 1,300 Chinese goods which America is targetting with its new tariffs. Newsflash: China has just announced a fresh wave of tariffs on American goods, in retaliation to the US tariffs released last night. Chinese state TV is reporting that 106 US products are affected, including a 25% tariff on soybeans, automomobiles and chemicals. In total, the goods affected are worth $50bn per year. So, Beijing hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wasted any time in delivering on its pledge to hit back against the new proposed US tariffs on 1,300 of its products. Many US farmers rely on sales of soybeans to China, so this could have a significant impact on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agriculture sector. The soybean price has taken an immediate hit. The array of Chinese products that would be affected by America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new 25% tariffs is lengthy, and varied. It includes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153compounds of depleted uranium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, nuclear reactor parts, a wide range of vaccines and medical products, aircraft tyres, stainless steel and aluminium in various sizes, and aircraft jets and tyres, domestic and commercial dishwashers, storage water heaters, and sewing machines. On the agricultural side, poultry incubators, haymaking machines and milking devices are all hit -- suggesting US farmers could suffer from these tariffs. Cranes, snowploughs and locomotive parts are all on the list too. Technology products are also hit, including TV cameras, a range of televisions, and even fuses. Even weapons are covered - including rocket launchers, flame-throwers, rifles, shotguns, pistols and military weapons. The US will now hold a consultation on whether to impose these tariffs. The full list is online here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of a trade war between China and America are swirling this morning as both sides ratchet up the pressure. Last night, the US government announced details of new 25% tariffs on $50bn worth of imports from China. The list of over 1,300 products targets China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial base, covering everything from industrial robots and electronics to metal alloys and aircraft parts. America claims these new 25% tariffs is prompted by Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-running \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcintellectual property theft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of valuable technology and ideas developed by US companies. It says: The proposed list of products is based on extensive interagency economic analysis and would target products that benefit from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial plans while minimizing the impact on the US economy. The move comes two days after China hit back against America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on steel and aluminium by imposing new trade hurdles on 120 US products - including fresh food and steel. And there are already signs that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest move could trigger fresh retaliations. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambassador to the World Trade Organisation, Zhang Xiangchen, has declared this morning that his country will retaliate \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immediately\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, claiming that the Trump administration is breaking WTO rules. In a punchy statement, Zhang says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The findings of the U.S. Section 301 investigation are a willful distortion of facts and full of selective assertions and allegations, turning a blind eye to the actual progress that China has achieved in the market-oriented reforms, further opening-up and enhanced intellectual property protection.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Chinese Embassy in Washington was also quick to condemn this latest move - saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As the Chinese saying goes, it is only polite to reciprocate. The Chinese side will resort to the WTO dispute settlement mechanism and take corresponding measures of equal scale and strength against US products in accordance with Chinese law.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That raises the danger that China imposes its own tariffs on a wider range of US goods, taking the global economy a little bit closer to protectionism. Also coming up today: We get a new healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building sector this morning, which may show the impact of last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wintery weather. Plus, new jobs data from the Eurozone and America. Markets are expected to be subdued, given the trade tensions swirling around: Advertising giant WPP is also in the spotlight, after launching an investigation into an allegation of personal misconduct against its chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell. He denies the allegations \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unreservedly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but investors may be concerned.
