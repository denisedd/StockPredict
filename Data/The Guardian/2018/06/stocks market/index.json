Economist James Smith says the jobs data means a June rate hike is still on the cards. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Rising employment and an above-consensus wage growth figure will reinforce expectations for a rate rise in a couple of weeks, although Fed voters will also have a firm eye on the latest trade developments.</p> <p>President Trump said shortly before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs report that he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153looking forward\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to seeing the numbers. And with the economy having added 223k jobs in May, he is likely to be fairly chuffed.</p> <p>The unemployment rate fell to 3.8%, a new post-crisis low, and in fact came within spitting distance of 3.7% once rounding is taken into consideration. This decline came as almost 300,000 job hunters found employment in May according to the household survey.</p> <p>But for the Fed, the key positive in this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report is that wage growth beat estimates, taking the year-on-year rate back up to 2.7%. This comes as firms appear to be finding it harder to fill positions. The proportion of small businesses finding it hard to fill job openings continues to flirt with all-time highs, while it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taking around twice as long to fill vacancies than it did during depths of the financial crisis. We think wage growth could test 3% again this year as these skill shortages gradually filter through to the official numbers.</p> <p>All of this means that a rate hike is still highly likely from the Fed in a couple of weeks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time. Our base case is that the committee will hike a further two times after that in 2018, although of course there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no doubt that Fed officials will be keeping a firm eye on the brewing global trade war, and this is the main risk to our view.</p> <p>As far as the jobs numbers are concerned, we suspect it is probably too early to see the effect of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s metal tariffs in this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, but things could start to look a little more concerning over coming months.</p> <p>There are reportedly only around 300,000 workers directly employed in both the steel and aluminium production industries. By comparison, some estimates have put the number of jobs in companies reliant on steel/aluminium inputs at around 6.5 million \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in industries covering aircraft to beer cans. On this basis, the risks stemming from the metals tariffs are likely to be a net negative for the overall jobs market.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b114008e4b022a3efa0e979\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-01T12:46:29.148Z\">1.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ING strategist Viraj Patel on the US jobs numbers:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/VPatelFX/status/1002530147659124736\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hard to find a -ve in the US jobs report.

Of course, political uncertainty is never welcome, but it has been telling that Spanish bond yields have fallen again today. It seems that Italian politics are more important for Spanish markets than Spanish politics.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b1113eee4b003306906203b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-01T09:39:23.741Z\">10.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is Sanchez receiving the applause after becoming prime minister elect:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca48dd996174d7c8237900526901f7340058669c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca48dd996174d7c8237900526901f7340058669c/0_0_471_256/471.jpg\" alt=\"spain1june\" width=\"471\" height=\"256\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b1112ece4b069235b5cfb8b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-01T09:33:38.333Z\">10.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Rajoy ousted as Spanish prime minister</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mariatad/status/1002483066235998208\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Its done.

We suspect it is too early to see any tariff impact in these figures, but the slowdown in the Eurozone that we saw through the first quarter may be playing a role. The gradual strengthening in the trade-weighted pound since last summer could also be beginning to hit demand at the margin.</p> <p>Of course, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector only makes up around 10% of the economy, so we suspect the Bank of England will be paying closer attention to next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services index as it tries to gauge whether growth is rebounding after the weaker first quarter.</p> <p>After a couple of months of dismal weather, May finally saw the sun come out and this should have given the struggling high street a much needed boost. That said...we think consumer-facing sectors are not out of the woods just yet. Households remain cautious in the face of rising petrol prices, stagnant real wages, as well as economic uncertainty more generally.</p> <p>For that reason, a rate hike over the summer is still far from guaranteed. However our feeling from recent Bank of England commentary is that the committee has a preference to hike rates sooner rather than later if the data allows, in part to combat the risk of rising wage growth and underlying inflation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b110a1ee4b0033069061fe2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-01T08:56:14.464Z\">9.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier we also had the German manufacturing PMI:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MarkitEconomics/status/1002472619202043904\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Germany?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Germany</a> Manufacturing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PMI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PMI</a> hits 15-month low in May.

UBS analyst Bosco Ojeda explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In a quick succession of events the Spanish parliament will vote this Friday June 1st a vote of no confidence which could remove from power president Mr. Rajoy (Partido Popular) and appoint Mr. Sanchez (PSOE)...</p> <p>Mr. Sanchez (PSOE) has indicated that he aims to call for early elections but the exact timing is uncertain. Current polls show weak support for PSOE, while there is increasing support for [rival] Ciudadanos. So incentives to call elections are unclear and may extend towards the 2020 limit. Mr. Sanchez has reiterated a commitment with European orthodoxy and budget control in Spain. His plan includes the acceptance on the current 2018 budget. Going forward it may be more expansive on spending but there is not much room. Attempts to reverse reforms may not find a majority in parliament.A complete u-turn in policy seems unlikely.</p> <p>Assuming, for the time being, a high degree of policy continuity, we do not anticipate a substantial impact on the pace of growth. Usually elections have a mild impact on GDP with delays in confidence and investments. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP growth at 3% YTD is solid but may slow moderately over the coming quarters, with full year growth of 2.8% in 2018 and 2.3% in 2019. According to polls the 3 largest parties (PP, Ciudadanos and PSOE) have c70% of vote intentions and support pro-European orthodox policies which in our view are unlikely to drive a u-turn in economic policy. Far left party Podemos according to polls does not have enough support to lead the economic policies. Overall, Spanish equities and bonds have lately suffered and discount a high level of uncertainty. Only contagion from Italy would represent a real risk to risk premium levels, in our view. Latest correction on equities offer opportunities, particularly on banks and largecaps.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"148fac528bc31ce03917faab8939226432d3b4be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/148fac528bc31ce03917faab8939226432d3b4be/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mayoress of Barcelona, Ada Colau, on the second day of the no-confidence motion debate against Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy at the Lower House in the Spanish Parliament in Madrid.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mayoress of Barcelona, Ada Colau, on the second day of the no-confidence motion debate against Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy at the Lower House in the Spanish Parliament in Madrid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EMILIO NARANJO POOL / POOL/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b10ff38e4b0033069061f99\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-01T08:12:47.171Z\">9.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third biggest, grew by 0.3% in the first quarter of the year, in line with initial estimates.</p> <p>The annual increase was 1.4%.

Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After a strong year of economic activity in 2017 the manufacturing sector got off to a slightly softer start at the beginning of this year, across the board. In some of the recent April data there is evidence that this softness has evened out a little and started to stabilise. In Europe activity was able to rebound a little in part, while in the US we also saw increasing evidence of rising prices with prices paid at 7-year highs. If this trend continues in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers then that should be supportive of a rebound in Q2. Expectations for Spain, Italy, France and Germany manufacturing are for 54, 53, 55.1 and 56.8. </p> <p>In the UK we also saw a decent rebound after a soft March number, which may well have been weather related. Activity in May is expected to have steadied at around 53.5, a slight decline from the modest rebound seen in the April numbers with particular attention likely to be on cost price inflation which still looks fairly robust.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally the non-farm payrolls, where around 190,000 jobs are expected to have been created in May after a weak 164,000 figure in April. Wages are forecast to grow by around 2.8%, up from 2.6%.</p> <p>Even if the numbers are disappointing, analysts believe this will not stop the Federal Reserve raising US interest rates in June.</p> <p><strong>Agenda:</strong></p> <p>9.00 BST Eurozone Markit manufacturing PMI</p> <p>9.00 BST Italian GDP</p> <p>9.30 BST UK Markit manufacturing PMI</p> <p>13.30 BST US non-farm payrolls</p> <p>14.45 BST US Markit manufacting PMI</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-06-01T09:06:41.810Z\">at 10.06am BST</time></p>  </div>",
                "bodyText":"Investors pretty much knew that the US was about to slap steel and aluminium tariffs on the EU, Mexico and Canada, so in true market fashion, it was sell on the rumour and buy on the fact. The EU however said it was pressing ahead with a complaint to the World Trade Organisation about the US move, and had also opened a challenge against China over intellectual property. News that a week of political turmoil in Italy had ended with a new coalition government also helped sentiment, while the no confidence vote in Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (now ex) prime minister Rajoy was helped by the fact that a new euro-friendly administration was in place almost immediately. So markets are ending the week on a positive note, with Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB up 2.53%, Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex 1.83% better and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax ahead by 1.4%. In the UK the FTSE 100 is 0.5% higher, while on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 221 points or 0.9%. On the economic front, the US created more jobs than expected in May, something previewed by a Trump tweet ahead of the official release. In Europe, eurozone manufacturing fell to a 15 month low. In the UK, however, the latest manufacturing PMI survey came in slightly betteer than expected, although the recovery was said to be unconvincing. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the week. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. US factories grew strongly again last month, but slightly more slowly than expected. The final Markit manufacturing PMI came in at 56.4 compared to the intial estimate of 56.6 and April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure of 56.5. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has spoken about the Trump tweet on the jobs figures: Despite the growing trade tensions after the US imposed its tariffs on the EU, Canada and Mexico, Wall Street has followed European markets higher, helped by a better than expected jobs figure. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 210 points or 0.86% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.6% higher. Here is our story on the US jobs data, and the president commenting on the figures before their official release: Donald Trump broke with years of protocol on Friday, commenting on the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest jobs report an hour before its official release. The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced at 8.30am that the US had added 223,000 new jobs in May as the unemployment rate slid t0 3.8%, its lowest level since April 2000 and one of the lowest levels since after the second world war. Trump, who has taken credit for job market growth despite the fact that it began under Obama, said on Twitter he was looking forward to the release of the monthly jobs report just over an hour ahead of its release. Following his tweet, treasury yields moved sharply higher. The monthly report is one of the most market sensitive pieces of economic information released by the government and is carefully guarded ahead of its release. For anyone other than the president, the comment would likely lead to an investigation or likely firing. The report is given to senior White House officials the day before its release but is usually closely protected. Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Obama, said Trump should never again be given sight of the figures before their release. Our full story is here: And more Trump. The president has turned his attention back to trade, and Canada: Former US treasury secretary Summers has strong views on the Trump tweet which came ahead of the official announcement of the jobs numbers: More from ING Bank. Economist James Smith says the jobs data means a June rate hike is still on the cards. He said: Rising employment and an above-consensus wage growth figure will reinforce expectations for a rate rise in a couple of weeks, although Fed voters will also have a firm eye on the latest trade developments. President Trump said shortly before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs report that he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153looking forward\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to seeing the numbers. And with the economy having added 223k jobs in May, he is likely to be fairly chuffed. The unemployment rate fell to 3.8%, a new post-crisis low, and in fact came within spitting distance of 3.7% once rounding is taken into consideration. This decline came as almost 300,000 job hunters found employment in May according to the household survey. But for the Fed, the key positive in this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report is that wage growth beat estimates, taking the year-on-year rate back up to 2.7%. This comes as firms appear to be finding it harder to fill positions. The proportion of small businesses finding it hard to fill job openings continues to flirt with all-time highs, while it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taking around twice as long to fill vacancies than it did during depths of the financial crisis. We think wage growth could test 3% again this year as these skill shortages gradually filter through to the official numbers. All of this means that a rate hike is still highly likely from the Fed in a couple of weeks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time. Our base case is that the committee will hike a further two times after that in 2018, although of course there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no doubt that Fed officials will be keeping a firm eye on the brewing global trade war, and this is the main risk to our view. As far as the jobs numbers are concerned, we suspect it is probably too early to see the effect of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s metal tariffs in this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, but things could start to look a little more concerning over coming months. There are reportedly only around 300,000 workers directly employed in both the steel and aluminium production industries. By comparison, some estimates have put the number of jobs in companies reliant on steel/aluminium inputs at around 6.5 million \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in industries covering aircraft to beer cans. On this basis, the risks stemming from the metals tariffs are likely to be a net negative for the overall jobs market. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ING strategist Viraj Patel on the US jobs numbers: The US unemployment rate has fallen to a new 18 year low of 3.8%, slightly better than the 3.9% expected. April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs figure was revised down from 164,000 - already weak - to 159,000 but March was higher than originally reported, up from 135,000 to 155,000. On the wages front, year on year earnings were up 2.7% compared to 2.6% in April, in line with forecasts. Month on month, wages grew by 0.3%, a little higher than the expected 0.2%. Perhaps no surprise given Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive tweet, but the US jobs figures are much better than expected. Some 223,000 jobs were created in May compared to expectations of a 190,000 increase. Back with the EC, and commissioner Malmstrom says we are not in a trade war yet but in a very difficult situation brought on by the US. It is a very worrying situation, she says, it could escalate and the economic recovery risks being diminished by this. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 The US is playing a dangerous game here.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meanwhile, on the US jobs data which is due shortly, President Trump has tweeted about them ahead of time: On the US tariffs, she says the EU is talking to Canada, Mexico, as well as Japan. There might be others as well who will react. Malmstrom says the WTO| complaint about the US tariff will be made in the next few days, and the EU is also making a challenge against China on intellectual property. She says: We are not choosing any sides. We are determined to deal with the root causes of the current tension in the trade system. But we need to do that within the rules. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a link to the European Commission press conference by Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom on the response to the US tariffs. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable on the US tariffs, courtesty PA: As well as being petty and most probably illegal, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war is ultimately self-defeating. In the inevitable retaliation, there will end up being tariffs on a plethora of US products from jeans to Trump Tower merchandise. This shows how absurd it is for the likes of [UK international trade secretary Liam] Fox to pin their hopes on - and entrust our economic future to - a bilateral trade deal with the US. We know he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s illogical and stubborn, but he claims to be a good businessman. Trump must back down. Following the news of the US move, Fox had told Sky News the tariffs were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153patently absurd\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but said they would not affect a post-Brexit trade deal between the US and UK. He said: The US administration has made clear again this week that they are very keen to see an agreement with the UK but regard steel imports as an EU issue. The European Union is pressing ahead with its retaliation to the US trade tariffs: The EU is opening a case at the World Trade Organisation, after the US imposition of a 25% duty on European steel and a 10% duty on European aluminium came into force this morning. Cecilia Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m, the EU trade commissioner, is also expected to announce retaliatory tariffs on classic American products, such as Levi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jeans, bourbon whiskey, cranberries and peanut butter, at a press conference later on Friday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The European Union will today proceed with the WTO dispute settlement case adding those additional duties on a number of imports from the United States,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Federica Mogherini, the EU high representative on foreign policy, told journalists this morning. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The European Union measures will be reasonable, proportionate and in full compliance with WTO rules and obligations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She was the latest European politician to hit back at the US decision, which has was described by President Emmanuel Macron of France as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mistake\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153patently absurd\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Speaking on Friday morning, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy minister Peter Altmaier said he hoped that a decisive response from the EU would prompt the US president to think again. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We hope that the European response will result in a process of reflection in the USA,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Altmaier told German broadcaster ARD, adding that the EU may look to work with Mexico and Canada on trade, also hit by the new tariffs. Bernd Lange, the German socialist MEP who chairs the European parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international trade committee, said the tariffs were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153illegal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and insisted the EU would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153make some countermeasures, no doubt about\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We chose also some symbolic products like Harley-Davidson to make clear here is a red card.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here is the full story: Markets so far continue to be fairly relaxed about the prospect of a global trade war, and the ousting of Mariano Rajoy as Spanish prime minister. The resolution of the turmoil in Italian politics certainly seems to be helping sentiment, with Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB now up 2.5%. Elsewhere Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex is up 1.77% following the vote against Rajoy, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has risen 0.9% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 1.24%. In the UK, the FTSE 100 is 0.65% better. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open nearly 120 points higher. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda said: The imposition of steel and aluminium tariffs by the US on Europe, Canada and Mexico has drawn plenty of criticism from officials but maybe in a sign of how markets can become less sensitive to certain issues, the response has so far been fairly muted. Focus will now be on the retaliatory measures that these countries have lined up and whether that in turn triggers a larger and quite unnecessary trade war. Investors currently appear at ease with the situation but that could quickly change. And a handy guide to the potential global trade war from ING Bank: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a US Federal Reserve member on the trade tariffs: The voting in Spain by the way showed 180 in favour of ousting prime minister Rajoy, 169 against, and one abstention. The Spanish vote has had less impact than the turmoil in Italy, says Seema Shah, global investment strategist at Principal Global Investors: Much of the market panic around Italy was about the threat to its membership of the Euro area but, by contrast, all of the main Spanish political parties are supportive of the single currency. Presuming Sanchez does not try to hang on to power, Spain is likely to see new elections later this year and a market-friendly, pro-European government should materialise from there. In the meantime, given that the support of Basque nationalist MPs required a promise to not change the budget, Sanchez is unlikely to make sweeping changes to the budget. Material economic progress has been made in recent years - Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal position has improved; unemployment has fallen; and the banking system has been strengthened - the latest political disruption does not upset the generally positive outlook for the Spanish economy. Of course, political uncertainty is never welcome, but it has been telling that Spanish bond yields have fallen again today. It seems that Italian politics are more important for Spanish markets than Spanish politics. Here is Sanchez receiving the applause after becoming prime minister elect: The confidence vote is underway in Spain and here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a link: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick summary of some of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMIs: Back with UK manufacturing, and despite the unconvincing outlook, ING Bank economist James Smith believes the Bank of England is still inclined to raise interest rates this summer: At 54.4, the latest UK manufacturing PMI is a little better than hoped but is still a far cry from the levels seen towards the end of last year. Whilst Markit/CIPS noted the weakness partly reflected a slower pace of domestic orders, we also wonder whether the steadier global growth over the past few months is starting to weigh. We suspect it is too early to see any tariff impact in these figures, but the slowdown in the Eurozone that we saw through the first quarter may be playing a role. The gradual strengthening in the trade-weighted pound since last summer could also be beginning to hit demand at the margin. Of course, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector only makes up around 10% of the economy, so we suspect the Bank of England will be paying closer attention to next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services index as it tries to gauge whether growth is rebounding after the weaker first quarter. After a couple of months of dismal weather, May finally saw the sun come out and this should have given the struggling high street a much needed boost. That said...we think consumer-facing sectors are not out of the woods just yet. Households remain cautious in the face of rising petrol prices, stagnant real wages, as well as economic uncertainty more generally. For that reason, a rate hike over the summer is still far from guaranteed. However our feeling from recent Bank of England commentary is that the committee has a preference to hike rates sooner rather than later if the data allows, in part to combat the risk of rising wage growth and underlying inflation. Earlier we also had the German manufacturing PMI: The Spanish confidence vote is due in around 15 minutes (10am BST), and it seems Mariano Rajoy is resigned to leaving, with socialist Pedro Sanchez set to take over as prime minister. British factory growth was stronger than expected in May, according to a survey of the sector, but the increase masks its underlying weakness. The Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI came in at 54.4, up from 53.9 in April and above expectations of a figure of 53.5. Markit director Rob Dobson said: At first glance the mild acceleration in the rate of output growth and rise in the headline PMI would appear positive. However scratch beneath the surface and the rebound in PMI from April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 17 month low is far from convincing. Raw material prices rose more sharply in May, but manufacturers were less able to pass on these increases and also faces supply issues. Dobson said: These price and supply headwinds, combined with a further slowdown in new order growth, could jeopardise any further expansion of the manufacturing sector. The International Monetary Fund has called for countries to work together on trade. In response to the US tariff moves, IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said: Everybody loses in a protracted trade war, we encourage countries to work constructively together to reduce trade barriers and to resolve trade disagreements without resort to exceptional measures. It is unfortunate that trade tensions are rising at a moment where the global recovery is being supported by trade. For the first time in a long time, trade is growing faster than global GDP, and spreading recovery around the world. Because of trade and innovation, billions of people today enjoy longer, healthier, and more prosperous lives. Earlier IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, tweeted from the G7 Symposium in Canada: Markets seem to be unmoved, not only by the US tariffs, but also the political uncertainty in Spain. UBS analyst Bosco Ojeda explains: In a quick succession of events the Spanish parliament will vote this Friday June 1st a vote of no confidence which could remove from power president Mr. Rajoy (Partido Popular) and appoint Mr. Sanchez (PSOE)... Mr. Sanchez (PSOE) has indicated that he aims to call for early elections but the exact timing is uncertain. Current polls show weak support for PSOE, while there is increasing support for [rival] Ciudadanos. So incentives to call elections are unclear and may extend towards the 2020 limit. Mr. Sanchez has reiterated a commitment with European orthodoxy and budget control in Spain. His plan includes the acceptance on the current 2018 budget. Going forward it may be more expansive on spending but there is not much room. Attempts to reverse reforms may not find a majority in parliament.A complete u-turn in policy seems unlikely. Assuming, for the time being, a high degree of policy continuity, we do not anticipate a substantial impact on the pace of growth. Usually elections have a mild impact on GDP with delays in confidence and investments. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP growth at 3% YTD is solid but may slow moderately over the coming quarters, with full year growth of 2.8% in 2018 and 2.3% in 2019. According to polls the 3 largest parties (PP, Ciudadanos and PSOE) have c70% of vote intentions and support pro-European orthodox policies which in our view are unlikely to drive a u-turn in economic policy. Far left party Podemos according to polls does not have enough support to lead the economic policies. Overall, Spanish equities and bonds have lately suffered and discount a high level of uncertainty. Only contagion from Italy would represent a real risk to risk premium levels, in our view. Latest correction on equities offer opportunities, particularly on banks and largecaps. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third biggest, grew by 0.3% in the first quarter of the year, in line with initial estimates. The annual increase was 1.4%. Fourth quarter growth was revised up quarter on quarter to 0.4% from 0.3%. Meanwhile the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing PMI came in below expectations: The GDP figure and the PMI survey both came before the latest Italian political turmoil, of course. Eurozone factory growth was subdued in May, falling to a 15 month low, and the weakness looks set to continue. The IHS Markit final manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 55.5, in line with an initial estimate but below the April figure of 56.2. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at Markit, said: Some of the weakness may have been related to a higher than usual number of holidays during the month, but risks appear tilted towards growth remaining subdued or even cooling further in the coming months. There are signs the soft patch has further to run. Despite the production trend slowing markedly in recent months, the order book slowdown has been even sharper. Although growth is slowing, it may still be strong enough for the European Central Bank to press on with its plans to reduce its economic stimulus programme, due to finish by the end of 2018. Away from trade for a moment, and here is a handy round-up of predictions for the non-farm payroll numbers later: We expect to hear more details of the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to the US tariffs at lunchtime (1pm BST) when the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade commissioner gives a press conference. With European markets moving higher, taking their cue from Italy not tariffs, Wall Street is also expected to open in positive territory, with IG indicated a 90 point or so rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Setting aside the trade war tensions between the US and EU, for now anyway, the European indices got off to a strong start on Friday as the Italian political crisis appeared to come to an end. Though not exactly the ideal government in the eyes of the markets, with a combination of ministers from the anti-establishment Five State Movement and the right-wing League, the formation of any Italian government is something to celebrate given how pronounced fears were that the situation would result in a Eurosceptic snap election... The euro wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as enthused, its joy tempered by the brewing transatlantic trade issues, the nature of the Italian government and the fact today could see Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy receive a vote of no confidence. This meant the single currency only managed a 0.1% rise against both the dollar and the euro, crossing $1.17 against the former and \u00c2\u00a30.88 against the latter. Legal proceedings against the US measures are due to be triggered at the World Trade Organisation today. The EU wants the US actions declared illegal, but under WTO rules it will have to wait until mid-June to implement any balancing - i.e. retaliatory - measures. The US tariffs, of course, came into effect at midnight on Thursday. A new reaction from China to the US tariffs, courtesy Reuters: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign ministry said on Friday all countries should protect the normal trade order, when asked about United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum exports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico. Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying made the comments at a regular briefing in Beijing. On Tuesday the White House imposed 25% tariffs on $50bn of Chinese goods with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153industrially significant technology.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The threat of a trade war does not seem to have spooked European investors too much, so far at least. The FTSE 100 has climbed 0.6%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up a similar amount. News of the new government in Italy has helped the FTSE MIB gain 2.14% while Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex has added 1% despite the prospect of prime minister Rajoy being ousted. The EU, Canada and Mexico have said they will take the trade dispute to the World Trade Organisation. Europe has a list of products which will be subject to retaliatory measures, including peanut butter, Levi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jeans, Harley-Davidson motor bikes and bourbon whiskey. Canada plans tariffs on \u00c2\u00a39.6bn worth of goods, from steel to orange juice. Mexico plans to target a range of products including lamps, sausages, cranberries and cheese. Former White House Press Secretary Anthony Scaramucci said there was still room for negotiation. He said President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s action was a measure to correct the uneven and unbalanced trade system. He told Radio 4: If you need to put up protective tariffs to protect your farming industry or parts of your industrial base, the United States is just basically saying \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcokay that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not fair to us because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re accepting your goods and services into our country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to give us an opportunity to compete in your country. I am sure that there are chips on both sides that can get traded to make the problem go away. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always room in a negotiation with him, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the type of person that will walk from a negotiation. Back with the US move on steel and aluminium, and Gareth Stace, from trade body UK Steel, told BBC Radio Five Live that the US tariffs were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153illegal and protectionist.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added: This unilateral decision beggars belief. It is the last thing we need given that we are coming out of the worst steel crisis in a generation. He said the claims that the tariffs were being imposed for national security reasons was a smokescreen, given only 3% of steel in the US is used for defence products. And he warned that UK manufacturers exporting to the US not only faced a direct hit, but also there would be a glut of steel which would otherwise have gone to the US flooding the European market. He said: Twenty to twenty five million tonnes could flood our market. Deutsche Bank, which on Thursday reportedly saw its US business put on a Federal list of problem banks, has now had its credit rating cut by S&amp;P. The agency said: S&amp;P Global Ratings today lowered its long-term issuer credit ratings on Deutsche Bank AG and its core subsidiaries to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBBB+\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA-\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The outlook is stable. We removed the ratings from CreditWatch negative. .. The lowering of our long-term issuer credit rating reflects that Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s updated strategy envisages a deeper restructuring of the business model than we previously expected, with associated non-negligible execution risks. While we consider management is taking tough, although likely inevitable, actions and proposes a logical strategy to successfully restore the bank to more solid, sustainable profitability over the medium to long term, the bank appears set for a period of sustained underperformance compared with peers, many of whom have now finished restructuring. Over the coming 18 months, we will look in particular for robust delivery against 2019 objectives, such as the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac22 billion cost target, and evidence that the bank retains the solid support of its clients, something that would help underpin the revenue base in the CIB division amid a period of downsizing. While we regard capital markets earnings as inherently more volatile than retail and commercial banking, we consider a well-balanced blend of profitable businesses to be supportive of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditworthiness. Therefore the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to preserve its global capital markets franchise, focused in particular on Europe, underpins our stable outlook. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Normally on a day like today, markets would be focused on the US jobs figures due later and the manufacturing surveys which will give the first snapshots of how the global economy performed last month. But there are a few other distractions for investors to worry about, notably the prospect of a global trade war now that the US has confirmed it will slap steel and aluminium tariffs on the EU, Canada and Mexico. Traders are now waiting to see how the move, and the threatened retaliation will play out. Here is our latest story on the US action: Wall Street fell by 1% and European markets ended lower but the general reaction was more restrained than might have been expected (Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax was one of the biggest losers but that has as much to do with fears about Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial health as anything else.} Asian market seem to have taken the news in their stride, given that the move was widely expected. The Nikkei 225 is down just 0.14% and the indications are that European markets will open mostly higher: Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: The expected tit for tat response from the EU, Mexico and Canada is setting the scene for a trade war, which is not conducive to global growth. However, the losses have not been as large as we would have expected just a few months ago. The market is becoming more familiar with this administrations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 negotiating tactics and as a result, rather than seeing a move straight into risk off trading, we are seeing some investors take a wait and see approach. The traditional safe haven Japanese yen moved lower versus the dollar, as did gold and European bourses are pointing to a stronger start on the open. There are other things on the agenda too. Markets slumped earlier in the week on fears of a new Italian election, but those fears have now been eased with the formation of a populist government and that appears to be helping investor sentiment. Indeed, as far as Europe goes, Spain has taken over the mantle of immediate problem child. Prime minister Mariano Rajoy is facing a vote of no confidence and according to the latest reports, he may well lose. As far as the manufacturing surveys are concerned, there could be some signs of a slight rebound from April. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: After a strong year of economic activity in 2017 the manufacturing sector got off to a slightly softer start at the beginning of this year, across the board. In some of the recent April data there is evidence that this softness has evened out a little and started to stabilise. In Europe activity was able to rebound a little in part, while in the US we also saw increasing evidence of rising prices with prices paid at 7-year highs. If this trend continues in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers then that should be supportive of a rebound in Q2. Expectations for Spain, Italy, France and Germany manufacturing are for 54, 53, 55.1 and 56.8. In the UK we also saw a decent rebound after a soft March number, which may well have been weather related. Activity in May is expected to have steadied at around 53.5, a slight decline from the modest rebound seen in the April numbers with particular attention likely to be on cost price inflation which still looks fairly robust. Finally the non-farm payrolls, where around 190,000 jobs are expected to have been created in May after a weak 164,000 figure in April. Wages are forecast to grow by around 2.8%, up from 2.6%. Even if the numbers are disappointing, analysts believe this will not stop the Federal Reserve raising US interest rates in June.

But this optimism is unlikely to last, says Ingvild Borgen Gjerde at Capital Economics:</p> <blockquote> <p>Global equities extended their recent rebound on Monday, which has occurred despite renewed tensions between the US and the rest of the world over international trade. We can think of three key reasons why this has happened. None of them, however, is especially reassuring.</p> <p>The first reason is that investors have acclimatised to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153megaphone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd diplomacy. Despite the tariffs imposed by the US on steel and aluminium imports from the EU, Mexico and Canada, investors presumably see it as a negotiating tactic, rather than the start of a full-blown trade war that could have serious ramifications for economic growth. Although we share this view, the risk of a trade war is greater now than it has been for many years. So at the very least, the risk ought to continue to curb investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 enthusiasm for equities.</p> <p>The second reason is that the political situation in Italy has calmed down, as evidenced by the sharp fall in the 10-year government bond yield there since last Tuesday. But while the government sworn in by the president on Friday was arguably more market friendly than many might have feared, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems are over and expect yields there to rise once more in due course. If we are right, global equities will probably come under pressure again.</p> <p>The third reason is that US economic data released on Friday were upbeat, with both the employment report and ISM manufacturing index for May coming in stronger than expected. Although growth in the US economy is likely to remain healthy this year, we think that it will falter in 2019 as monetary tightening bites and fiscal stimulus fades. Growth is also likely to slow elsewhere, if not as rapidly. This is significant because the rally in global equities since mid-2016 has been mainly driven by an upturn in the global economy.</p> <p>The upshot is that we doubt that the recent rebound in global equities will continue. On the contrary, we think that their peak has already passed, and that they will move gradually lower during the rest of the year and in 2019. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b154975e4b00330690639d0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-04T14:19:37.815Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Weak US factory orders in April</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US factory goods orders fell by more than expected in April, dragged down by weak demand for aircraft and machinery.</p> <p>Orders dropped by 0.8%, worse than the forecast decline of 0.5%.

                "bodyText":"The latest RBS stake sale by the UK government could hit the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price in the short term, says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: The RBS share price has bounced back from its slump after the EU referendum, but the taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability, but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge. We will learn more when details of the share price attained in the sale are released. In August 2015 the government sold 5.4% of the bank at \u00c2\u00a33.30 per share, which the National Audit Office estimated crystallised a loss of \u00c2\u00a31.1 billion, or \u00c2\u00a31.9 billion if you include the cost of financing. RBS has cleared several obstacles which have now unblocked the road to re-privatisation, in particular settling claims for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities in the US. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share sale is good news for private investors in RBS because it is a step towards becoming a normal bank again, though government sales may put downward pressure on the share price in the near term. As a business RBS remains a work in progress, and consequently an investment for recovery investors with a long term investment horizon. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. As if to emphasise the market uncertainty facing the RBS share sale - which should be priced overnight after gauging demand from institutions- European markets have lost their early gains. However they still ended, for the most part, in positive territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 39.52 points or 0.51% at 7741.29 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 0.37% to 12,770.75 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.14% to 5472.91 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.45% to 22,009.95 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 1.22% at 9750.3 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.76%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the RBS share sale: Philip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost \u00c2\u00a32.6bn to City investors. The chancellor, through UK Financial Investments, which owns RBS stake on behalf of the government, kickstarted the sale of 925 million shares, representing about 7.7% of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock. The government, which will still own a majority stake in RBS almost a decade after the bailout during the financial crisis, said it would reduce the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ownership of the bank from about 70.1% to 62.4%. The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when George Osborne sold a first tranche at a loss of about \u00c2\u00a31bn. The report is here: The share sale is due to take place this evening with an offering to institutional investors. Here is the full announcement from UK Government Investments, the body which manages the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s RBS stake: UKGI announces that it intends to sell part of HM Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholding in The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc. The disposal of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ordinary shares will be by way of a placing to institutional investors. The price at which the Shares are sold will be determined by way of an accelerated bookbuilding process. The book will open with immediate effect following this announcement. The Placing is expected to comprise of approximately 925 million Shares, representing approximately 7.7% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company. As a result of the Placing, the overall size of HM Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholding in the Company will be reduced from approximately 70.1% to approximately 62.4%. UKGI and HM Treasury have undertaken to the Bookrunners named below not to sell further shares in the Company for a period of 90 calendar days following the completion of the Placing without the prior written consent of a majority (by participation) of the Bookrunners. Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Goldman Sachs International, J.P. Morgan Securities plc (which conducts its UK investment banking activities under the marketing name J.P. Morgan Cazenove) and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. International plc have been appointed to act as joint bookrunners in connection with the Placing. N M Rothschild &amp; Sons Limited is acting as Capital Markets Adviser. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP is acting as legal counsel to UKGI in respect of English and US law. Details of the Placing Price and the number of Shares sold will be announced in due course. Settlement and delivery of the Shares is expected to take place on 7 June 2018. At last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual meeting, the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance director did not seem keen on the government selling shares at the moment. UK Government Investments has announced it will place 925m shares in RBS with institutional investors, representing about 7.7% of the bank. The move cuts its stake from the current 71%. Following last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual meeting of Royal Bank of Scotland , the government has announced it plans to sell \u00c2\u00a32.6bn worth of shares in the taxpayer-owned bank. Wall Street is holding onto its gains but the picture is slightly different in Europe. Most markets have come off their best levels as we head to the close, while Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is in negative territory, down 0.33%. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Stocks have held on to some of their gains today, but the day has not gone entirely the bulls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 way. While Italian concerns have receded from view, trade wars remain the big concern. Given the performance of US equities, which have outpaced their European brethren today, it looks like the market is, for now at least, more concerned that European stocks will be harder hit than their US counterparts. Overall however, risk appetite appears pretty solid for the day, especially when the lack of macro data is factored into the equation. Particularly encouraging has been the continued strength in tech stocks, with the Nasdaq 100 only 1% away from its previous record high. Despite the renewed trade tensions, markets are making a good start to the week. But this optimism is unlikely to last, says Ingvild Borgen Gjerde at Capital Economics: Global equities extended their recent rebound on Monday, which has occurred despite renewed tensions between the US and the rest of the world over international trade. We can think of three key reasons why this has happened. None of them, however, is especially reassuring. The first reason is that investors have acclimatised to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153megaphone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd diplomacy. Despite the tariffs imposed by the US on steel and aluminium imports from the EU, Mexico and Canada, investors presumably see it as a negotiating tactic, rather than the start of a full-blown trade war that could have serious ramifications for economic growth. Although we share this view, the risk of a trade war is greater now than it has been for many years. So at the very least, the risk ought to continue to curb investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 enthusiasm for equities. The second reason is that the political situation in Italy has calmed down, as evidenced by the sharp fall in the 10-year government bond yield there since last Tuesday. But while the government sworn in by the president on Friday was arguably more market friendly than many might have feared, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems are over and expect yields there to rise once more in due course. If we are right, global equities will probably come under pressure again. The third reason is that US economic data released on Friday were upbeat, with both the employment report and ISM manufacturing index for May coming in stronger than expected. Although growth in the US economy is likely to remain healthy this year, we think that it will falter in 2019 as monetary tightening bites and fiscal stimulus fades. Growth is also likely to slow elsewhere, if not as rapidly. This is significant because the rally in global equities since mid-2016 has been mainly driven by an upturn in the global economy. The upshot is that we doubt that the recent rebound in global equities will continue. On the contrary, we think that their peak has already passed, and that they will move gradually lower during the rest of the year and in 2019. US factory goods orders fell by more than expected in April, dragged down by weak demand for aircraft and machinery. Orders dropped by 0.8%, worse than the forecast decline of 0.5%. This is the worst April since 2012. The March figure was revised up from a 1.6% increase to 1.7%. The decline could be temporary, however, given some positive manufacturing surveys in May. Wall Street has followed the global trend, shrugging off trade war fears and moving higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 187 points or 0.76%, as investors continue to celebrate Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than expected jobs numbers. The S&amp;P 500 is up 0.45% while the Nasdaq Composite is 0.37% higher. One of the companies moving higher is Apple, heading closer to a $1trn valuation: Over in Argentina, the International Monetary Fund has said talks about it giving financial support to the country were well advanced: Alejandro Werner, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Director of the Western Hemisphere department, said: IMF staff and the Argentine authorities have been engaged in a very constructive and close dialogue in response to the authorities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 request for financial support for their economic plan. Talks are well advanced. As we have said all along, this will be a plan driven by the Argentine government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s priorities, with a particular focus on protecting the most vulnerable, and strengthening the local economy in light of the recent financial market turbulence. Donald Trump has defended his new tariffs, arguing that he is actually fixing the playing field on global trade. The president has been rather active on Twitter this morning. Remarkably, he claimed he has the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolute right\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to pardon himself (but won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, as he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done nothing wrong....). Investors should stay alert; Trump may be heading towards a titanic clash with special counsel Robert Mueller.... Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund is signalling (finally) that it will not be signing up to Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third bailout programme, which is due to expire this summer. With less than three months before the debt-stricken county exits its current programme, the Fund says the likelihood of it contributing to the rescue package financially is fading fast. The Washington-based body had promised to boost the programme \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third since May 2010 - with a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.6bn credit line if euro area creditors agreed to far-reaching debt relief for Athens. Talks on the issue, conducted on the sidelines of this weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G7 meeting in Canada, failed to make progress with both the EU and IMF agreeing to return to negotiations later this week in Paris. Speaking to Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state-run news agency late on Sunday, the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Greek representative Michalis Psalidopoulos said since the organisation \u00e2\u20ac\u0153probably does not have enough time to activate its program\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it would continue to contribute only in its capacity as technical advisor. But Mario Centeno, the Portuguese chairman of the euro group of euro zone finance ministers said the EU is still determined to reach a debt relief deal for Greece by the June 21 euro group \u00e2\u20ac\u201c giving it enough time to keep to its planned bailout exit on August 20. IMF participation is crucial if the deal is to be credible to markets, he told Reuters at the weekend. Talks in Paris on Thursday are likely to explore several options including prolonging maturities on loans from Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second bailout program. Separately, Greece has taken another step towards normality by relaxing some of the capital controls introduced three years ago: Good news: The sale of Aunt Bessie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to Nomad Foods shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lead to job cuts at its production operation in Hull. Wayne Hudson, MD of Birds Eye UK, has suggested the 400 jobs at the site should be safe. He told the Hull Daily Mail that: We have no plans whatsoever to close the factory in Hull. We will be working with the team there to understand how we can continue the great job they have done. The US stock market is expected to follow Europe and Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead when it opens in two hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is on track to gain 140 points, or over 0.5%. Wall Street is still taking comfort from last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stronger-than-expected jobs report, which suggests the US economy is in good shape. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA explains: The jobs report on Friday was yet another reminder of how well the US economy is doing and why the Federal Reserve is continuing to tighten monetary policy despite constantly being questioned about the need to do so when inflation is only accelerating at a moderate pace. Strong job gains combined with a drop in the unemployment rate to 3.8% and a slight uptick in wage growth was welcome at a time when people are generally fretting about the threat posed by an unnecessary trade war. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little surprising that investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t more concerned about the hoofing delivered to Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin at last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G7 finance minister meeting. This tweet-thread, from Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mike McKee, explains just how badly relations between America and the rest have deteriorated: William Jackson Food Group chairman Nicholas Oughtred says Aunt Bessie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s could have a great long-term future under its new owners: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aunt Bessie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has come a long way with us. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve invested heavily in developing the business and the brand, and Nomad Foods is well placed to take the business even further. Nomad Foods is a well-known food group with a strong commitment to the frozen category, incredible experience, scale and investment capabilities and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure Aunt Bessie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s will continue to thrive. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are exceptionally proud of everyone who works at Aunt Bessie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and are grateful to them for helping it become the much-loved household name that it is today.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: Where there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s puds, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brass! Aunt Bessie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, maker of frozen Yorkshire puddings and roast potatoes has just been sold to Nomad Foods, for the princely sum of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac240m (\u00c2\u00a3210m). Nomad already owns Birds Eye, Findus, Iglo and Goodfella\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, so this deal helps to tighten its grip on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s frozen foods aisles. In a statement just released, Nomad say that acquiring Aunt Bessie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s will expand their portfolio into the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153major eating occasion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of roast dinners. Stefan Descheemaeker, Nomad Foods\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Chief Executive Officer explains: Aunt Bessie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significantly expands our presence within potatoes, one of the largest categories in frozen food, while adding another dimension to our growing portfolio in the United Kingdom.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Aunt Bessie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is being sold by William Jackson &amp; Son Limited (which also owns veg box supplier Abel &amp; Cole). Back in 2015, CEO Norman Soutar explained that the company appealed to cooks who fear getting their roast puds and spuds wrong [one trick is to get the oil really hot....] Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market continues to shrug off the trade war anxiety. The FTSE 100 is now up 61 points, or 0.8%, at 7762 - a one-week high. United Utilities, Severn Trent and easyJet are all topping the risers, after City analysts raised their price targets for their respective shares. UK cardboard box maker DS Smith is also in demand. Its shares are up 3% after announcing a \u00c2\u00a31.7bn takeover of Spanish packaging rival Europac. Back in the markets, Italian government is recovering in value this morning - pulling down the yield (or interest rate) on the debt. That shows that fears that Italy might quit the euro are fading, after its new populist government was sworn in last week. But... the coalition between the League and the Five Star Movement is surely heading for clashes with Brussels over their spending and migration plans. Last weekend, Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio said he hoped to introduce a universal basic income for poorer Italians while League\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader Matteo Salvini vowed to cut spending on asylum seekers and deport migrants. The sharp decline in eurozone investor confidence may be a sign that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is faltering. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some snap reaction from economists: Investor optimism across the eurozone has fallen to its lowest level since October 2016, thanks to trade war fears and the Italian political crisis. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to Sentix, the German research group. Sentix\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index of eurozone investor morale has tumbled to just 9.3 this month, down from 19.2 in May. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much worse than expected, and extends the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent losses. Investors told Sentix they are less optimistic about future prospects, and that current conditions have deteriorated. Last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chaos in Italy over its new government helped to drag down economic prospects in the eurozone, says Manfred H\u00c3\u00bcbner, managing director at Sentix. He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The new government in Italy is causing great concern about the euro zone among investors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd H\u00c3\u00bcbner added that investors are also concerned about America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153punitive tariffs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while still hoping that a full-blown trade war can be avoided. Howard Archer of EY ITEM Club is disappointed that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI was unchanged at 52.5 last month. He says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that building firms are struggling to gain any momentum: Fuelling concerns about the construction sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficulties in building momentum, new orders contracted anew in May, confidence was at a 7-month low and employment growth slowed. This suggests that a marked upturn in construction activity is likely to remain conspicuous by its absence The construction sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficulties in recent months has clearly been influenced by economic and Brexit uncertainties fuelling clients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 caution over committing to new projects. Lacklustre economic activity in some sectors of the economy (such as retail) has also weighed down on construction, as has a shortage on new infrastructure projects. It is also evident that construction sector has suffered from some fall-out from the collapse of Carillion early in the year. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders are suffering from political uncertainty, which has helped to undermine new business opportunities. The monthly survey of UK construction, from data firm Markit, shows that new order books shrank in May, for the fourth time in five months. Optimism about growth prospects also shrank, to a seven-month low, with bosses blaming fears of political and economic uncertainty. This dragged back growth in housebuilding and civil engineering last month, although commercial construction accelerated. This left Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI, which measures activity, unchanged at 52.5 (any reading over 50 shows growth). Sam Teague, economist at IHS Markit, says UK building firms are making an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunderwhelming\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 recovery from the snow-related disruption last winter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflows of new business slipped back into decline, signalling the resumption of the downward trend in demand seen during the opening quarter. Companies frequently noted that Brexit uncertainty and fragile business confidence led clients to delay building decisions in May. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With new order books deteriorating and cost pressures picking back up, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not surprising to see construction firms taking a dimmer view of prospects and pulling-back on hiring, all of which makes for a shaky-looking outlook.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Donald Trump loves tweeting about rising stock markets, so he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be delighted that trade war fears haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sparked a wave of sell orders. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, reckons today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mild market reaction will encourage Trump to stick to his guns.... but the rally could end in tears: The two main benchmarks President Trump appears to use to gauge the success of his policies are his grassroot supporters and the US equity market. His blue-collar followers are hugely supportive of tariffs, and with equity markets currently also choosing to dismiss the problem and in positive territory, this is reinforcing President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view that he is doing the right thing, making it less likely that he will back away from his current stance. This chicken and egg position, where markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that tariffs are a credible threat, combined with President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position that markets are not worried about the issue could lead to an unpleasant reality for both sides eventually. However, for the moment investors are benefitting from positive sentiment. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, Emmanuel Macron, could have a showdown with Donald Trump over trade at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G7 summit, according to French officials. Reuters has the details: The work agenda for the G7 summit in Quebec, Canada this week has been complicated by the United State\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance on trade, climate change and foreign policy, a source at the French president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office said on Monday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The U.S. position on certain issues could make negotiations on the final conclusion (of the summit) tricky,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the source said, citing foreign policy moves such as the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the transfer of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The source said President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Donald Trump could hold talks on the sidelines of the summit. The latest trade war tensions have had \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcremarkably little\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 impact on the markets, says Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx: Carrying over last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s robust relief rally, investors continued to ignore the trade tensions sprouting out of the US in favour of celebrating the improved political situation in the Eurozone. A feisty G7 meeting over the weekend, with US Treasury secretary having to fend-off his furious European and Canadian peers as they vented about last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariff announcement from Trump, and news that the US and China made no progress in their latest negotiations, had remarkably little impact on Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, says there are plenty of events that could spook the markets this week. The list includes this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G7 leaders meeting, central bank meetings in Turkey and Australia, a confidence vote for Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new populist government, and further trade war developments. But, the strength of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs data may set the tone for the start of the week, he adds. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest stock markets have all opened higher, as traders take their cue from last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong US jobs report: European stock markets are rallying, despite the double-dose of trade war worries. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 37 points (or 0.5%) in early trading to 7740. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stoxx 600 index, which tracks Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest companies, is also 0.5% higher. Two banks, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Societe Generale and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Unicredit, are leading the rally following reports they are considering a merger. In another worrying development, talks between America and China over trade have ended without a breakthrough. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Liu He, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic czar, led the weekend negotiations in Beijing over the weekend. The talks centred on China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise to buy more American agricultural and energy products, to help lower the US trade deficit. Negotiators have hit a sticking point - Beijing won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sign up to buy more US goods until the Trump administration have promised not to impose further tariffs on Chinese exports. The US, though, want China to make the first move. This has raised the danger that talks collapse, and that both sides impose tariffs on $50bn of each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exports. The New York Times says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the United States introduces trade measures, including an increase of tariffs, all the economic and trade outcomes negotiated by the two parties will not take effect,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd China said in a statement distributed by the state-controlled news media. The apparent impasse left the Trump administration with the issue of what to do about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial policies. It also left unresolved an awkward issue for both sides: the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE, which had violated sanctions against North Korea and Iran. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance and economy minister was particularly scathing about America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs on certain imports, including steel and aluminium from Europe. Bruno Le Maire revealed that last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G7 finance ministers meeting was much chillier than usual, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has been a tense and tough G7 - I would say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been far more a G6 plus one than a G7. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We regret that our common work together at the level of the G7 has been put at risk by the decisions taken by the American administration on trade and on tariffs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of a global trade war are looming over the financial markets as investors return to their desks for the new week. Over the weekend, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top finance ministers lined up to criticise America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, at a G7 meeting in Canada. US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin faced a barrage of attacks, with fellow ministers warning that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153collaboration and cooperation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between the G7 was now at risk. The official statement following the meeting is remarkably blunt, stating that: Concerns were expressed that the tariffs imposed by the United States on its friends and allies, on the grounds of national security, undermine open trade and confidence in the global economy. Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors requested that the United States Secretary of the Treasury communicate their unanimous concern and disappointment. Attendees had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153frank exchange\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the benefits of an open rules-based trading system -- which is a diplomatic way of saying there were verbal fisticuffs. The statement concluded by saying that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153most\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd G7 finance ministers and Central Bank governors regret the uncertainty created by America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade actions, which threatens global co-operation. The international community is faced with significant economic and security issues, which are best addressed through a united front from G7 countries. Members continue to make progress on behalf of our citizens, but recognize that this collaboration and cooperation has been put at risk by trade actions against other members. The issue is certain to dominate the upcoming meeting of G7 leaders later this week. The markets, though, are holding their nerve. Shares have risen in Asia overnight, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei gaining almost 1.4% - its best day in six weeks. European markets are also expected to rally, following last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong US employment data - which showed a pick-up in wage growth and job creation. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says this has cheered investors: Wall Street ended the previous week on a positive footing, lifted by a better than expected US jobs report; 223k jobs created in May vs. expectations of 200k, unemployment unexpectedly fell to an 18 year low of 3.8% and wages managed to creep up to 2.7%, better than the 2.6% forecast and a 4-month high. The solid jobs report overshadowed any trade war concerns which had been brewing and lifted the S&amp;P over 1%. Coming up today, we get a new healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector - which suffered a fall in output earlier this year, plus US factory orders and eurozone construction data. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK construction PMI for May 10am BST: The Sentix survey of eurozone investor confidence 3pm BST: US factory orders for April",

The likes of Thames, Yorkshire and Anglian are dismantling their Cayman Islands subsidiaries to try to defuse the charge of financial engineering. Some of the worst offenders are also reducing their debt levels, partly under pressure from Ofwat and partly because they recognise the mood has turned against extreme financial leverage. But boardroom rewards, unless the companies are about to surprise us, remain stuck at levels that are a gift to the nationalisation lobby. Shareholders and owners, unless they wish to continue to present Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s front-bench with an open goal, ought to wake up.</p> <p>As it is, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nationalisation plan is gloriously vague since the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet explained which model of public ownership he prefers (there are many to choose from) or how he would tackle investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (including pension funds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and employees\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) legal claims for compensation if he attempts nationalisation at less than market value. Nor is it possible to tell if Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boast that bills would fall after nationalisation by \u00c2\u00a3100 per household is just achieved by shoving the difference into general taxation.</p> <p>The GMB, note, also ignored such detailed questions as it launched its campaign for public ownership of the English water industry. It is simpler, from where it stands, to point to excesses in the boardroom, on which (almost) everyone can agree. The water companies, if they want to prepare properly for a nationalisation debate that is not going away, need to shape up on pay and stop offering such a soft target.</p> <h2>Why couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the Treasury wait a while for RBS sale?</h2> <p>Here we go, then, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/04/uk-government-to-sell-stake-in-rbs-worth-almost-26bn\">the big sale of Royal Bank of Scotland has begun</a>, or rather re-started, since a small slice went in 2015. Some 925m shares, of 7.7% of the total, will be sold overnight and the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stake will be cut to 62.4%. </p> <p>The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has got one thing right: he has ignored any thought of mounting a flashy sale of shares to retail investors complete with loyalty bonuses. His predecessor, George Osborne, was tempted by that idea when he was disposing of shares in Lloyds Banking Group, but eventually thought better of it. Quite right too: the Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sole job is to get the best possible price for the public purse, which inevitably means selling to City institutions in a competitive market process.</p> <p>The Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s timing, though, looks odd. Banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 share prices across Europe have been upset by the political confusion in Italy. Even RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 finance director, Ewen Stevenson, said last week that now is probably not the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153optimum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd time for the government to start selling stock. Indeed so. RBS was within pennies of 300p a fortnight ago, which would have been a neat hurdle to clear, but closed last night at 280.4p.</p> <p>Perfect timing is impossible, of course, and the break-even price in any case is about 500p. But the Treasury, advised by UK Government Investments, could still have waited a few weeks to see if the Italian influence on the bank stocks fades fully. The government wants to get on with the job \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but, really, where was the harm in waiting a fortnight?</p>",

The likes of Thames, Yorkshire and Anglian are dismantling their Cayman Islands subsidiaries to try to defuse the charge of financial engineering. Some of the worst offenders are also reducing their debt levels, partly under pressure from Ofwat and partly because they recognise the mood has turned against extreme financial leverage. But boardroom rewards, unless the companies are about to surprise us, remain stuck at levels that are a gift to the nationalisation lobby. Shareholders and owners, unless they wish to continue to present Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s front-bench with an open goal, ought to wake up. As it is, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nationalisation plan is gloriously vague since the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet explained which model of public ownership he prefers (there are many to choose from) or how he would tackle investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (including pension funds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and employees\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) legal claims for compensation if he attempts nationalisation at less than market value. Nor is it possible to tell if Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boast that bills would fall after nationalisation by \u00c2\u00a3100 per household is just achieved by shoving the difference into general taxation. The GMB, note, also ignored such detailed questions as it launched its campaign for public ownership of the English water industry. It is simpler, from where it stands, to point to excesses in the boardroom, on which (almost) everyone can agree. The water companies, if they want to prepare properly for a nationalisation debate that is not going away, need to shape up on pay and stop offering such a soft target. Why couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the Treasury wait a while for RBS sale? Here we go, then, the big sale of Royal Bank of Scotland has begun, or rather re-started, since a small slice went in 2015. Some 925m shares, of 7.7% of the total, will be sold overnight and the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stake will be cut to 62.4%. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has got one thing right: he has ignored any thought of mounting a flashy sale of shares to retail investors complete with loyalty bonuses. His predecessor, George Osborne, was tempted by that idea when he was disposing of shares in Lloyds Banking Group, but eventually thought better of it. Quite right too: the Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sole job is to get the best possible price for the public purse, which inevitably means selling to City institutions in a competitive market process. The Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s timing, though, looks odd. Banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 share prices across Europe have been upset by the political confusion in Italy. Even RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 finance director, Ewen Stevenson, said last week that now is probably not the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153optimum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd time for the government to start selling stock. Indeed so. RBS was within pennies of 300p a fortnight ago, which would have been a neat hurdle to clear, but closed last night at 280.4p. Perfect timing is impossible, of course, and the break-even price in any case is about 500p. But the Treasury, advised by UK Government Investments, could still have waited a few weeks to see if the Italian influence on the bank stocks fades fully. The government wants to get on with the job \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but, really, where was the harm in waiting a fortnight?",

Competition clearance from the EU is now the final pre-condition. A decision will be made by 15 June according to the EC Competition website. Comcast has said that it will issue an Offer Document within 28 days all pre-conditions being met (implicitly by 13 July). Within 60 days of this, Sky must convene the shareholder meeting at which the Comcast proposal is to be voted on (by 11 Sep).</p> <p>Assuming it is not blocked by the Culture Secretary, Fox would announce a firm offer around 19 June. High Court approval would then be sought and the Scheme of Arrangement document would be posted out within 28 days of the offer announcement (around 17 July). Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholder meeting would need to take place within 21 days (7 Aug) with court approval after that.

The commitment by Fox to let go of Sky News always looked like it be sufficient to assuage the media plurality concerns. For Comcast there were never any media plurality worries as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got little European presence. </p> <p> A bidding war looms of course. The bid on the table from Comcast is an all-cash offer worth \u00c2\u00a312.50 per share, so an increased offer is priced in already. But the fact that the shares are not roaring higher suggests investors are displaying some hesitation about whether Murdoch will significantly increase his offer. He may not have to - the option for Fox is to switch from the current Scheme of Arrangement to a Takeover Offer, which would allow it to use its 39% of shares in the vote. </p> <p> Then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up to Comcast and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see just deep the pockets are - how badly does it want to diversify from the US and get exposure to Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attractive recurring revenues in Europe? The fact it thinks the deal would be accretive to free cash per share from year one suggests it can. And all this is muddied by the fact that Comcast has admitted it is in advanced stages of preparing an offer for the businesses that Fox has agreed to sell to Disney. </p> <p> A bidding war seems on the cards but we just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how far either side will push this. Comcast shares are down a touch and are around 25% lower from their highs this year, indicative of investor fears about it paying over the odds. Disney shares were also a shade lower and are around 10% off their 2018 highs. Either way it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shaping up to be a battle royale between Comcast and Disney this summer and Sky shareholders will be winners now the deals have been cleared by the government.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b16a0e0e4b069235b5d1f7f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-05T14:44:32.875Z\">3.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ben Bird, media sector specialist at management consultancy Vendigital, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The culture secretary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to allow the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Fox bid to go ahead, subject to a request that Sky News is divested, is essentially good news for the consumer as the consolidation is all about safeguarding content.</p> <p>It will be especially heartening for others in the media sector that the CMA is not intending to block the bid.

                "bodyText":"In a busy day for corporate news, two events dominated. This morning the UK government sold a 7.7% stake in the bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland, raising \u00c2\u00a32.5bn but crystallising a \u00c2\u00a32.1bn loss on the price originally paid to rescue the bank. The final cost of the bailout could be \u00c2\u00a330bn... or perhaps even more. The government defended the timing of the sale but some analysts suggested it was done to get it out of the way before the Brexit vote next week. Critics said it was a wasted opportunity to help reform the banking sector. The other big development was culture minister Matt Hancock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision on the bids for Sky. He gave the go-ahead to the Comcast offer, and also the bid from 21st Century Fox, provided the Murdoch-controlled business agreed to sell Sky News to Disney or another buyer. Sky welcomed the news, which is likely to prompt a full takeover battle for the business while 21st Century Fox said it had already submitted plans to sell Sky News to Disney. But Labour expressed concerns about the sale of Sky News, saying its independence must be protected. Elsewhere the latest snapshot of the UK services sector showed stronger than expected growth which lifted the pound - on the basis it puts an interest rate rise back on the agenda - and sent the FTSE 100 0.7% lower. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Here is a handy run-through of the possible timetable for the Sky bids, courtesy of Jefferies analyst Jerry Dellis: Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rule 2.7 announcement of 25 Apr outlined its intention to make a Takeover Offer for Sky subject to pre-conditions being met. Competition clearance from the EU is now the final pre-condition. A decision will be made by 15 June according to the EC Competition website. Comcast has said that it will issue an Offer Document within 28 days all pre-conditions being met (implicitly by 13 July). Within 60 days of this, Sky must convene the shareholder meeting at which the Comcast proposal is to be voted on (by 11 Sep). Assuming it is not blocked by the Culture Secretary, Fox would announce a firm offer around 19 June. High Court approval would then be sought and the Scheme of Arrangement document would be posted out within 28 days of the offer announcement (around 17 July). Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholder meeting would need to take place within 21 days (7 Aug) with court approval after that. In reality, Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board will need to manage timetables such that shareholders are able to give adequate consideration to both offers. Sky shares have edged up 0.29% to \u00c2\u00a313.54 after the US government cleared the Comcast and Fox bids for the company, albeit the latter was given the go-ahead on the condition that Sky News was sold. Meanwhile Royal Bank of Scotland has closed down 5.3% at 266p, compared to the 271p a share the government received in the sale of the latest tranche of its shares. Overall the FTSE 100 finished down 0.7% at 7686.8, undermined by a rise in sterling after better than expected service sector figures put a possible interest rate rise back on the agenda. Elsewhere the US tech boom continues: A bidding war for Sky is now on the cards but it is hard to judge how much higher the offers will go, says Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com: Sky shares traded up about half a per cent [on the day] at \u00c2\u00a313.55 as the Fox and Comcast bids were effectively waved through by culture secretary Matt Hancock. The commitment by Fox to let go of Sky News always looked like it be sufficient to assuage the media plurality concerns. For Comcast there were never any media plurality worries as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got little European presence. A bidding war looms of course. The bid on the table from Comcast is an all-cash offer worth \u00c2\u00a312.50 per share, so an increased offer is priced in already. But the fact that the shares are not roaring higher suggests investors are displaying some hesitation about whether Murdoch will significantly increase his offer. He may not have to - the option for Fox is to switch from the current Scheme of Arrangement to a Takeover Offer, which would allow it to use its 39% of shares in the vote. Then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up to Comcast and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see just deep the pockets are - how badly does it want to diversify from the US and get exposure to Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attractive recurring revenues in Europe? The fact it thinks the deal would be accretive to free cash per share from year one suggests it can. And all this is muddied by the fact that Comcast has admitted it is in advanced stages of preparing an offer for the businesses that Fox has agreed to sell to Disney. A bidding war seems on the cards but we just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how far either side will push this. Comcast shares are down a touch and are around 25% lower from their highs this year, indicative of investor fears about it paying over the odds. Disney shares were also a shade lower and are around 10% off their 2018 highs. Either way it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shaping up to be a battle royale between Comcast and Disney this summer and Sky shareholders will be winners now the deals have been cleared by the government. Ben Bird, media sector specialist at management consultancy Vendigital, said: The culture secretary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to allow the 21st Century Fox bid to go ahead, subject to a request that Sky News is divested, is essentially good news for the consumer as the consolidation is all about safeguarding content. It will be especially heartening for others in the media sector that the CMA is not intending to block the bid. This could be a sign that the organisation has recognised that there is a real need for medium and large-scale companies in the sector to leverage their scale. Sky is not immune to the disruption facing the industry, with the rise of agile competitors such as Amazon and Netflix. Attracting the attention of consumers has become more difficult and the business needs to reduce costs where it can, whilst continuing to produce quality content. Other media companies will be willing the bid to complete successfully \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly with the outcome of the CMA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation into Trinity Mirror\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed takeover of Northern &amp; Shell still pending. More from the CMA: The full CMA report is available here. From the 414 page Competitions and Markets Authority report on the possible Sky bids, here is its view on the timetable for a Sky News sale: Sky shares have done little since Hancock unveiled his decision on both the Comcast and 21st Century Fox bids. They stood at \u00c2\u00a313.53 when Hancock stood up, and are now almost imperceptibly higher at \u00c2\u00a313.56. That compares with the \u00c2\u00a310.75 a share on offer from Fox, and the better offer from Comcast of \u00c2\u00a312.50 a share. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a link to the full statement from Matt Hancock on both bids for Sky: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key section from Matt Hancock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement -- outlining why 21 Century Fox must sell off Sky News in return for the government approving its takeover for Sky. I agree with the CMA that divesting Sky News to Disney, as proposed by Fox, or to an alternative suitable buyer, with an agreement to ensure it is funded for at least ten years, is likely to be the most proportionate and effective remedy for the public interest concerns that have been identified. The CMA report sets out some draft terms for such a divestment, and Fox has written to me to offer undertakings on effectively the same terms. The proposals include significant commitments from Fox. But there are some important issues on the draft undertakings which still need to be addressed. I need to be confident that the final undertakings ensure that Sky News: remains financially viable over the long-term; is able to operate as a major UK-based news provider; and is able to take its editorial decisions independently, free from any potential outside influence. As a result, I have asked my officials to begin immediate discussions with the parties to finalise the details with a view to agreeing an acceptable form of the remedy, so we can all be confident Sky News can be divested in a way that works for the long term. Under the legislation, I am required to consult formally for 15 days on the undertakings. Subject to the willingness of the parties to agree the details, I aim to publish this consultation within a fortnight. I am optimistic that we can achieve this goal, not least given the willingness 21st Century Fox has shown in developing these credible proposals. However, if we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree terms at this point, then I agree with the CMA that the only effective remedy now would be to block the merger altogether. This is not my preferred approach. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clip of Chris Bryant suggesting that Kay Burley will drive Matt Hancock out of parliament if Sky News hits the buffers. Anything Martin Bell can do, Kay can do too..... Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine says her party has concerns about Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed takeover of Sky. She welcomes the plan for Sky News to be divested... but wonders if rival bidder Comcast will give similar reassurances about media independence if it wins the battle for Sky. Matt Hancock replies that Comcast has given undertakings and assurances. By law, he looked at its bid for Sky because of its material size. He concluded that Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid did not raise public interest concerns, so the government will not issue an intervention notice. Hancock adds that he hopes the Sky takeover battle will reach a conclusion that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153demonstrates with confidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that Sky News will be independent and viable, so parliament can be content with the state of media plurality in future. Back in parliament, Labour MP Chris Bryant has criticised the proposal for Sky News to be sold off if 21st Century Fox wins the takeover battle for Sky. He warns that Sky News could be starved of money by whoever buys it (either Disney or another owner). So, in a few years they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll come back to the government and ask to be subsumed back into Fox. To laughter, Bryant suggests that Matt Hancock could even find himself facing a TV news veteran at the polling booth. Kay Burley will be out of a job, and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll stand in West Sussex and defeat him, because most people in this country would prefer a diversity of ownership of media and we want to keep Sky as independence as possible. Hancock replies that he relishes the prospect of a contest in West Sussex with anyone (!) but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept that Sky News will be starved of funds in the future. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clip of Tom Watson telling parliament that Labour has serious concerns about the proposed sale of Sky News, and that the channel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcindependent and rigorous\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 independence must be protected. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our media editor, Jim Waterson, on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement: The UK government has approved a bid from US media giant Comcast to take over Sky, while indicating it is minded to approve a rival bid from Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox providing it sells Sky News to another organisation. The decisions are likely to set up a multibillion-pound bidding war for the British broadcaster. Fox is attempting to buy the 61% of Sky that it does not already own, in a deal valuing the company at \u00c2\u00a318.5bn, but the bid has been complicated by concerns that it would leave Murdoch with too much control over the UK media. Comcast, which owns US TV network NBC and Universal Studios, made a rival bid earlier this year that valued Sky at \u00c2\u00a322bn. The culture secretary, Matt Hancock, approved the Comcast deal in a statement in the House of Commons, while indicating he will also approve the Murdoch deal if Sky News is offloaded to an appropriate buyer in order to avoid excessive influence by the the mogul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family over the UK news business. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his full story: Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox has also welcomed the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. In a statement to shareholders, 21CF says it has already submitted plans to sell Sky News to Disney (to address those concerns about media plurality). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its statement: 21st Century Fox (\u00e2\u20ac\u015321CF\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) welcomes today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement by the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport that he has cleared 21CF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed acquisition of the remaining shares in Sky on broadcasting standards, as recommended by the Competition and Markets Authority (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153CMA\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). Regarding the effects on media plurality we note that the CMA recommended to the Secretary of State that divestiture is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the most effective and proportionate remedy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. 21CF has already submitted proposed undertakings to achieve the divestiture of Sky News to Disney. We note that the Secretary of State agrees with this solution and has instructed officials from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153DCMS\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) to agree final undertakings that he would be prepared to accept and consult on within the two-week timeframe. We now look forward to engaging with DCMS and we are confident that we will reach a final decision clearing our transaction. Sky says it welcomes Matt Hancock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcements (not a surprise, as it paves the way for a full-blooded takeover battle for the company). It adds: In respect of 21CF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed acquisition of Sky, Sky notes that the Secretary of State considers that the undertakings provided by 21CF have provided a good starting point to overcome the adverse public interest effects of the proposed merger that he has identified, and that DCMS Officials have now been instructed to seek to agree final undertakings with 21CF. The Secretary of State has stated that, dependent on the outcome of these discussions, he would hope to be in a position to consult on any agreed final undertakings within the next two weeks. Shadow culture secretary Tom Watson is responding to Hancock now. He warns that selling Sky News to Disney could backfire, if the planned takeover of 21 CF by Disney should collapse. This could leave Sky News vulnerable. The CMA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Hancock have concluded that that the takeover would not threaten broadcasting standards. Watson, though, queries this view. He suggests that upcoming court cases brought against The Sun could show maladministration by Fox, which might make the minister change his view. Now onto 21 Century Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover bid for Sky. Matt Hancock tells MPs that the Competition and Markets Authority has concluded that 21CN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid could operate against the public interest, for two reasons: potential erosion of Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s editorial independence. Increased influence of Murdoch family trust on public opinion and the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political agenda. Hancock says various remedies have been proposed. He says that the idea of divesting Sky News to Disney [which is hoping to take over 21st Century Fox] or to an alternative provider with funding for at least 10 years, is the most proportionate and effective remedy to address these concerns. Hancock is saying he will approve 21 Century Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid for Sky can proceed - if he is satisfied that Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 independence is guaranteed. Hancock says he has asked officials to begin immediate discussions with 21 CF to draw up a final proposal for Sky News to be divested in a satisfactory way. Culture minister Matt Hancock says he has considered Comcast and 21 Century Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bids for Sky separately. Comcast first.... Hancock rules that the deal does not does not raise public interest concerns. So, he will not be issuing an intervention notice. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a green light for Comcast! Heathrow questions are finally over. Matt Hancock has descended from his holding pattern and is giving his statement on the Sky takeover now. Matt Hancock will give his decision on the Sky takeover once transport secretary Chris Grayling finishes answering questions from MPs about Heathrow Airport. The government has decided to back plans to build a third runway at Heathrow, after years of prevarication. Plenty of MPs want their say. Some support the plan -- as do unions and business groups. But other MPs (especially with constituencies in or near West London) are very worried about the environmental impact. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also ironic that London is getting another runway while the railways network in the North of England suffers severe disruption after decades of under-investment. Our Politics Live blog has the details: The Financial Times predicts that both Sky takeover offers will get the green light from the government today. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Matthew Garrahan explains: The fate of competing bids for Sky by 21st Century Fox and Comcast will become clear today when culture secretary Matt Hancock delivers the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s verdict on whether to block or clear each offer. Fox, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, has been embroiled in regulatory scrutiny for 18 months with its bid to take full control of Sky, offering \u00c2\u00a310.75 a share, valuing the company \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which was founded by Mr Murdoch \u00e2\u20ac\u201d at about \u00c2\u00a318.5bn. Comcast made a competing offer earlier this at \u00c2\u00a312.50 a share, which valued Sky at about \u00c2\u00a322bn. Mr Hancock is expected to clear both bids \u00e2\u20ac\u201d possibly with some conditions attached \u00e2\u20ac\u201d setting the scene for a bidding war for Sky. Separately, Fox and Comcast are embroiled in another takeover tussle: Walt Disney is attempting to buy Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entertainment assets \u00e2\u20ac\u201d including its 39 per cent stake in Sky \u00e2\u20ac\u201d in a deal worth $66bn including debt. More here. Breaking away from the RBS share sale, the UK government is about to rule whether either Rupert Murdoch or US conglomerate Comcast - or both - should be allowed to take full control of broadcaster Sky. Culture minister Matt Hancock will make a statement on the situation in parliament shortly. Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21 Century Fox (21CF) currently owns 39% of Sky, and launched a full takeover bid in December 2016. However, the bid has been held up by concerns that it will give Murdoch too much control on the UK media landscape. In January, the Competition and Markets Authority said 21st Century Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid was not in the public interest due to concerns about media plurality. Fox has since offered some concessions, such as making Sky News a legally separative business. Comcast launched its own bid for Sky in April. It could potentially derail Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to sell most of 21CF to Disney in a $66bn (\u00c2\u00a347bn) deal. So Hancock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision could be extremely significant for Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future, and the wider media landscape.... If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor Larry Elliott on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s RBS share sale: Philip Hammond has been forced to defend the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to sell part of its stake in RBS after an overnight sale of shares left taxpayers nursing a \u00c2\u00a32bn loss. The chancellor said the offloading of almost 8% of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares for \u00c2\u00a32.5bn was a significant step in returning the high street bank \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bailed out by Labour during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to the private sector. But the sale of 925m shares at 271p each was at a price significantly lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago and led to criticism that ministers had sold at the wrong time. Hammond said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This sale represents a significant step in returning RBS to full private ownership and putting the financial crisis behind us. The government should not be in the business of owning banks. The proceeds of this sale will go towards reducing our national debt. This is the right thing to do for taxpayers as we build an economy that is fit for the future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares. There should be no sales of RBS shares, full stop. But particularly with such a large loss to the taxpayers who bailed out the bank. Prem Sikka, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Essex, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why sell? Taxpayers bailed out the bank and when there is a glimpse of recovery and profits, the government sells it at a loss to ensure that profits are collected by its friends in the City.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares in RBS have not traded above the price the government bought them at since 2010 and never once hit the 625p-a-share break-even price calculated by the National Audit Office (NAO) to take into account the cost of finance. More here: Hammond forced to defend RBS shares sale after \u00c2\u00a32bn loss to taxpayers Laith Khalaf, Senior Analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, reminds us JUST HOW BIG Royal Bank of Scotland had become after years of dealmaking under the leadership of Fred Goodwin. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now clear the losses sustained by the taxpayer on the RBS bailout are going to be substantial, though this really reflects the price paid for financial stability in the depths of the global banking crisis. In essence the RBS bailout cushioned the blow of the financial crisis, and spread the pain across many years, a decision which is now beginning to become more measurable. We will never know what the outcome would have been if RBS had been allowed to fail, though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to recognise the scale of RBS at the time. The bank may have its roots in the cobbled streets of Edinburgh, but it became one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest banks, with a \u00c2\u00a32.4 trillion balance sheet at the height of its power. To put that number in context, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bigger than the annual output of the whole UK economy and compares with the $639 balance sheet of Lehman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brothers just before it filed for bankruptcy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just possible therefore that the collapse of RBS could have taken all the other dominos with it. Clearly the losses that are now being sustained on the government shareholding are deeply unwelcome, but the alternative to a bailout might have been far worse.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 My colleague Richard Partington has been crunching the numbers... The Unite union have blasted the government over today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share sale. Rob MacGregor, Unite national officer, says Philip Hammond and colleagues should use their power as majority shareholders to improve the bank, not sell out at a loss: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government is attempting to wash its hands with Royal Bank of Scotland at the expense of the taxpayer. This bargain basement sale of over seven per cent of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares is a betrayal of public finances and represents a total loss of over \u00c2\u00a33 billion for taxpayers since the original bail-out in 2008. Staff are clear that the government should be focusing its attentions on keeping RBS bank branches open and improving the corporate governance of this institution. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The catalogue of failures across the bank ranging from thousands of staff cuts, closing hundreds of bank branches and also the sale of financial products which resulted in the $4.9 billion US fine demonstrates the systematic failures by the management to effectively run this organisation. Staff across the business are continuing to pay for the mistakes at the top whilst the government merely looks the other way.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow City minister, Jonathan Reynolds, argues that the government is selling up at precisely the wrong moment: He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referring to the $4.9bn (\u00c2\u00a33.6bn) penalty which the US Department of Justice hit RBS with last month, for misselling toxic securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. That fine was smaller than expected, so one of the biggest clouds over RBS has finally lifted. That should give the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares a lift in the coming months. Then again.... there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still the risk that the UK economy falls into recession, especially if Brexit turns out badly. Jane Sydenham, Investment Director at City firm Rathbones, argues that Philip Hammond is wise to sell some shares while he can: With the economy in relatively good shape and interest rates likely to rise in the not-too-distant future, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good time for the government to start selling the RBS stock. Although the sale of stocks is still loss-making for the tax payer, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important that the government gets as much back as possible while they can, instead of waiting too long and potentially seeing the economy move into trouble again. With this risk in mind, there is no point waiting even if it does mean accepting a loss. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just realised that the true break-even price of the RBS bailout is even higher than I thought. The 625p break-even point was set by the National Audit Office last summer, when it assessed the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first sale of RBS shares in 2015. It is based on the cost of the government borrowing \u00c2\u00a345bn to fund the RBS bailout (the NAO estimated that UK bonds were being sold at 3.7% per year at the time.) So, that figure includes the financial cost of the rescue. But, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cover the additional cost of repaying the debt since 2015. As this NAO chart shows, the true cost of the bailout keeps rising the longer the taxpayer holds onto its shares. So the break-even price could already be closer to \u00c2\u00a37.... In City jargon, the government sold part of its stake in RBS through an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153accelerated bookbuilding process to institutional investors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In practice, that means 925m shares were sold to banks, hedge funds, pension funds, insurance companies, and other organisations who manage our money. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan all acted as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbookrunners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the placing, which means they persuaded the institutional investors to take part (readers can speculate why it takes THREE investment banks to handle this sort of thing.....). Economics journalist Dharshini David points out that the buyers will probably make a profit (once RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares rise above 271p). Some critics say the government is wasting a great opportunity by simply selling their stake in Royal Bank of Scotland. Labour MP Gareth Thomas argues that the Treasury could turn the bank into a building society with a remit to help the UK economy: Positive Money, a group which campaigns for a fairer banking system, argues that RBS should be broken up. Fran Boait, executive director of Positive Money, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share selloff is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccolossal wasted opportunity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. As well as losing the taxpayer billions of pounds, the government is also losing the ability to reshape Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking system. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Instead of selling off its majority stake, the government should use its position to break up RBS into smaller, regional banks, with alternative business models that emphasise lending to SMEs and productive industry. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Such innovation is needed to direct lending to the real economy, which has been been starved of investment in recent years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Graham Spooner, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, recommends that RBS investors hold onto their shares. Spooner argues that the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial performance is improving, so it should resume paying dividends to investors soon. Spooner says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Institutional shareholders paid more or less the market price [in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sale] so they must have some confidence in the banks longer-term recovery. As well as this, the bank could be a step nearer to paying a dividend. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The negative is that the government still have a large holding of 62.4% which is set to overhang the market for some time; the government cannot sell any more for 90 days. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While shares are up slightly from a year ago off the back of improved performance and improved confidence leading to a change in our recommendation from a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, shares in early trading this morning have fallen by 3.4%. We maintain our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 recommendation due to the increased likelihood of a dividend payment and the CEO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restructuring plans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nearly 10 year ago, there were suspicions that taxpayers would never recover the tens of billions of pounds that were injected into Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks as the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system was shaking at its foundations. The Labour government announced the bailout of RBS, Lloyds and HBOS on 13 October 2008 - one of many dramatic days during the crisis. Prime minister Gordon Brown declared that taking stakes in the banks would create a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrock of stability\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to help Britain through the unfolding crisis. But George Osborne, then the shadow chancellor, warned that the financial consequences would be severe, telling parliament: But, of course, the scale of what the taxpayer is on the hook for is only just starting to dawn on the British people: this is the biggest bail out in the world so far, paid for by the biggest increase in debt by any peacetime Government and funded by the \u00c2\u00a311,000 of extra borrowing that will now be heaped on every family in the country. Chancellor Alastair Darling insisted that the government would sell its shares \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcin due course\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: In relation to ordinary shares, we will get a dividend when dividends are payable, and when we sell our shares the money will come back to the taxpayer. There was no suggestion then that Britain would still be a majority shareholder in RBS a decade later.... Prem Sikka, Emeritus Professor of Accounting at the University of Essex, argues that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sale is a mistake: Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, fears the UK government will suffer further losses on its RBS shareholding: Even with carefully timed sales the government may not be able to regain the full sum it put into keeping the bank afloat. RBS is currently working through a turnaround plan designed to build it back up to its pre-financial crisis strength. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 columnist Jamie McGeever agrees: Economist Shaun Richards pins the blame on the former Labour chancellor, Alastair Darling for bailing out RBS in 2008: The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Joe Lynam flags up that RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have fallen this morning, as the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stake hits the market. Newsflash: The British economy is showing signs of having come through the worst of its recent slowdown triggered by bad weather, as the dominant services sector grew more quickly than expected. The reading on the Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI rose to 54.0 in May from 52.8 a month earlier. Economists had forecast 53.0 on a scale where anything above 50 indicates expansion. The pound has jumped by half a percent against the US dollar to $1.337, on expectations that the Bank of England might raise interest rates in August. But growth at eurozone companies has slowed to its lowest rate in one-and-a-half years, Markit reports. More on this later.... Unless Royal Bank of Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price rallies in the next few years, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taxpayers are going to suffer a massive loss on the 2008 bailout. The government still owns around 7.5 billion RBS shares. If they were all sold at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price of 271p, it would create an additional loss of \u00c2\u00a317bn compared to the 502p purchase price. If you include today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sale, and the one in 2015, and the total loss would be around \u00c2\u00a320bn. But using the NAO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s break-even price of 625p, the loss on our remaining RBS shares would actually be \u00c2\u00a326.5bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on top of the \u00c2\u00a33bn loss crystallised today, and the \u00c2\u00a31.9bn loss on the 2015 share sale - taking the potential loss over \u00c2\u00a330bn. These are immense sums of money -- not far short of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entire schools budget of \u00c2\u00a339bn. But we need to consider the counter-factual -- what would have happened if the government had allowed RBS to fail in 2008? Alastair Darling, the then-chancellor, later revealed that RBS was about to run out of money unless he stepped in, thanks to its disastrous takeover of Dutch rival ABN Amro, and huge losses thanks to the US subprime crisis. Darling and Brown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a345bn bailout may have helped avoid a major economic disaster, as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: If the rest of the government stake is sold at a similar price then the total loss comes to something in the region of \u00c2\u00a321bn, a sizeable loss indeed from the original \u00c2\u00a345bn, but nonetheless probably needs to be measured against what the economic cost might have been if the bank had been allowed to fail. Ultimately taxpayers and politicians of whatever persuasion need to ask themselves if a \u00c2\u00a32-3bn loss on this particular stake is a price worth paying for a smaller safer bank, as well as banking system, with the upside that the billions of pound it unlocks can be better used for things like the NHS, and other public services. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 This block was amended on 6 June 2018 because an earlier version referred to England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s school budget as that for the UK. Gordon Brown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government invested \u00c2\u00a345bn into Royal Bank of Scotland to maintain financial stability following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, not in search of a quick profit. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no argument that RBS has proved a disappointing investment. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t traded above the 502p (the taxpayers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 purchase price) since 2010. And they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never hit the NAO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 625p break-even price since the bailout was finalised at the end of 2008. Back in 2015, the government sold its first tranche of RBS shares at 330p each (creating a loss of \u00c2\u00a31.9bn according to the National Audit Office). The NAO also concluded that the 2015 sale achieved value for money - and indeed, it looks like a steal compared to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price..... Philip Hammond is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moving to cash in his chips\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by selling some Royal Bank of Scotland shares before the Brexit negotiations reach their climax, says analyst Neil Wilson of Markets.com. Wilson also points out that RBS looks to be in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdecent shape\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, compared to a few years ago. Crucially, it has also settled its long-running legal problems in America (over misconduct in the run-up to the financial crisis. He explains: RBS has come a long way in recent years. From racking up c\u00c2\u00a350bn in losses in ten years due in large part to mega restructuring charges and impairment charges, the bank has turned a corner. As noted a month ago, the settling of the DoJ case was key, removing the last big overhang and paving the way for the government to sell off its stock and for dividends to return. Attributable profits in the last quarter tripled to \u00c2\u00a3792m, versus \u00c2\u00a3259m in the same period in 2017, whilst the pre-tax operating profit was up 70% at \u00c2\u00a31.2bn. The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s critics will look at these figures, and conclude that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re selling up at the wrong time. Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland have fallen by 3.3% in early trading to 271p -- matching the price which the government sold its shares this morning. The UK government is defending its decision to sell part of its RBS stake for around half the price they paid for it. Treasury Economic Secretary John Glen says it is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunrealistic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to think that Britain should hold onto all its RBS shares until taxpayers can recoup their full investment in the bank. Glen told Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today Programme that: I would love it if we could sell the shares at a much higher price, obviously, that is what everyone would like to do, but we need to be realistic and look at the market conditions. Glen argues that RBS is in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153much healthier position\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than a decade ago, and that this is the right time to recover some money for taxpayers. Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, is pleased that his largest shareholder has cut its stake: McEwan says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am pleased that the government has decided the time is now right to re-start the share sale process This is an important moment for RBS and an important step in returning the bank to private ownership. It also reflects the progress we have made in building a much simpler, safer bank that is focussed on delivering for its customers and its shareholders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Nearly 10 years after the worst financial crisis in decades, Britain has managed to reduce its stake in Royal Bank of Scotland - but at a hefty loss. The UK government has sold 925 million RBS shares this morning, at 271p each. This lowers the taxpayers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stake in the bank from 70.1% to 62.4%, raising \u00c2\u00a32.5bn for the public coffers. Chancellor Phillip Hammond has hailed the move, saying: This sale represents a significant step in returning RBS to full private ownership and putting the financial crisis behind us. The government should not be in the business of owning banks. The proceeds of this sale will go towards reducing our national debt - this is the right thing to do for taxpayers as we build an economy that is fit for the future. However, the move also crystallises a hefty loss for taxpayers. Gordon Brown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government bought its majority stake in RBS for around 502p in autumn 2008, to protect the bank from collapsing (and possibly taking the UK economy with it). So, Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sale price of 271p means the UK has lost just over \u00c2\u00a32bn on these shares. And the damage is arguably even worse. Last year, the National Audit Office estimated that the break-even price for an RBS share sale was 625p -- once you factor in the financing costs of acquiring the shares. By the NAO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s logic, that means a loss of nearly \u00c2\u00a33.3bn today! Opposition MPs are lining up to criticise today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share sale. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares. There should be no sales of RBS shares, full stop. But particularly with such a large loss to the taxpayers who bailed out the bank.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking reaction to the sale this morning.... Also coming up today: Data firm Markit is releasing its regular healthcheck on the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services companies across the globe. Economists predict that the UK services PMI will come in at 53.4, slightly higher than April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 53.2, indicating growth accelerated a little. We also get the latest UK car registration figures - analysts predict a small rise, for the second month running. The agenda: 9am BST: Eurozone services PMI for May 9am: UK car registration figures for May 9.30am BST: UK services PMI for May 3pm BST: US services PMI for May",

                "bodyText":"TSB bosses faced another bruising session in front of the Treasury select committee as they were quizzed about the continuing IT meltdown which hit 1.9m of its customers. Chief executive Paul Pester said 2,200 customers had suffered fraudulent attempts to access their accounts since the IT problems first surfaced. Of these 1,300 had received compensation. Earlier FCA boss Andrew Bailey mentioned a figure of 10,600 incidents, but Pester clarified that the figure referred to alerts sent to accounts when suspicious activity was detected by the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s systems. Pester said the bank had set up a dedicated fraud line to deal with the overwhelming number of enquiries, and waiting times were only a few minutes. But committee chair Nicky Morgan said she had received reports during the meeting of people holding on for nearly 30 minutes before hanging up. MP John Mann expressed amazement when Pester and TSB chair Richard Meddings professed ignorance of a case when someone had received a letter giving details of someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bank account. He also slammed the level of compensation - \u00c2\u00a3100 - awarded to a constituent for their ruined wedding. With Pester profusely apologising several times during the course of the meeting, Mann said the level of compensation amounted to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00c2\u00a31 per apology\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Morgan described the level of compensation as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely inadequate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Overall Pester said the bank had spent \u00c2\u00a370m on compensation and additional resources to cope with fixing the problems so far. He was also forced to deny he had deliberately misled the committee at its previous hearing. Mann asks if heads will roll, but Meddings says that will depend on the outcome of an investigation by Slaughter and May into the causes of the fiasco. Pester says he will not fall on his sword since he wants to fix the problems, while on the thorny question of possible golden parachutes, Meddings says if people are found to be grossly negligent that will be taken into account in the terms of their departure. The meeting ended with Nicky Morgan saying she expected the TSB executives to be called back again to update the committee on the progress in fixing the problems. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. In her closing remarks Morgan says unfortunately the saga goes on. The FCA letter says ... TSB has not been open and transparent. The committee cannot remember such a letter from the FCA. She says, you have confirmed the IT migration has lead to people being fraudulently deprive of their money, life experiences such as weddings and house purchases ruined, the compensation is absolutely inadequate and the problems continue. This cannot be something you want, ultimately it is not only damaging to TSB but also to other banks in the sector and to online banking. Unfortunately, although we are grateful to you for your time... it did take an hour and half for you to thank your staff. I suspect we will ask you to come back again, because we will be keeping a very close eye on what is going on to put all of this right. Question: will it look at culpability of individuals and the role of the Spanish bank? Meddings says it will look at the relationship with the platform supplier. Question: what is the scope of the instructions to Slaughter and May? Medding says we can provide the terms of reference. The reason it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a law firm is that part of the terms is about the governance around the decision made to migrate. Question: how many people have switched to TSB? Pester says we have not been attracting many new customers to our current accounts. Morgan asks how much overtime are staff having to do in branches? Pester says he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give figures. Branch transactions are taking longer than we would like. Branches are not operating normally. Morgan says some of the fraud is done with sim cards so is TSB in contact with the mobile companies? Pester says yes they have been. Morgan says there are people trying to call the fraud line and have waited 15 minutes and 27 minutes and given up. She asks when the Slaughter and May report will be published. Meddings says there is no date but they have started work. He says he hopes it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s several weeks, not longer than that. But not before the summer holidays. They haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given me a deadline date. Montes is asked if Sabadell should be paid by TSB for this failure? He says, we are quite conscious about the damage to TSB customers. We know most of it came from bad functioning of the system after migration. We have committed resources to work to a solution. There have not been any kind of discussions about payments,. There won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be until the solution is finished. Question: who was really in charge here during this process? Pester: The responsibility and decision was with the TSB board. Question: Was the timing, decision making, risk management controlled by TSB? Pester: Ultimately yes although we used a range of suppliers to opine whether we were in a position to migrate. Question: clerks here found a forum with customers complaining of receiving letters for other people. Why are you not prepared to make sure your customers are not being defrauded? Pester says he has acknowledged TSB has sent multiple letters in the same envelope. Again he apologises. Question: how many customers have left the bank? Pester: 12,500 customers have switched away, but I do not know causes. Question: how many staff have you recruited? Pester: 2,200 Question: are you paying them full overtime? Pester: yes, we are paying twice normal rate for overtime. Question: so why weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t they adequately resourced in the first place? Pester: we did increase resource before migration, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect this level of problems. We would never have done the migration if we had known we would have these issues. Question: Payments to Sabadell for migration were delayed until completion. Why? Pester: To account for any cost overruns. Question: will the payments be made? Pester: it will depend on the report into what happened. On compensation, Pester says if people are not happy they can come back to us. He says it is easy to register a complaint. But Pester is accused of not taking on board how serious some of these problems (eg the ruined wedding) are. Question: can you give a guarantee on a minimum amount? Pester says he will write to the committee with the figures. Pester is asked about TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits which he says are around \u00c2\u00a3200m. He says money should not be an object for resources. Question: and should not be an object for compensation? Pester says of course not. Question: how much have you employed for resources and compensation? Pester says we have no set amount. Meddings says we will set an appropriate compensation framework. To date bank has cancelled charges worth \u00c2\u00a329m. Have compensated people for fraud of \u00c2\u00a311.2m, and backlog means it is probably \u00c2\u00a320m year to date. Incremental resources, overtime and people, IBM etc, about another \u00c2\u00a320m. Montes says the figures are consolidated into Sabadell accounts. Question. You have dealt with 24,094 complaints out of 95,063. This is not a significant number. Should you be adding more resources to address this problem? Pester says we have added 466 extra complaints handlers, over the last week. We dealt with the 24,000 before this, our aspiration is to close this down as quickly as possible. Every complaint we attempt to deal with within eight weeks of receiving it. Question: are you prepared to put in extra staff? Meddings says absolutely yes. We are adding resource as fast as it is possible to do. We have taken more people into branches and call centres, they have to be trained so we are bringing on resources and will continue to do so. Question: the compensation figures are extraordinarily small. Will anyone who is forced out get golden parachutes? Meddings says we will look at conclusions, take necessary action. It will depend on outcome and nature of the fault. If they are found to have been grossly negligent that will be taken into account in the terms of their departure. Question about the letters written by TSB to direct debit companies when customers wanted to switch, saying customers had died. Pester says there were 370 people affected and caused by an error in the software. Pester says they are speaking to the customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 new banks to contact customers and offer them compensation. Pester says they are correcting the error with the direct debit companies. Morgan says you talk about things being resolved but they may not be resolved to the satisfaction of the customers. Mann says you are in breach of data protection law, you are paying pitiful levels of compensation which I find deeply disturbing, you pay yourselves massive amounts of money. Can we be certain some heads are going to roll? Meddings says it would be wrong to prejudge. But depending on what investigation we will take action. Mann asks them - especially Pester - if they will fall on their swords before they are pushed. Pester says his focus is on fixing this for customers, I am passionate about TSB, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think anyone else will be as committed as me, when we get to end of this procedure we will see. Mann says where is the leadership? Meddings says senior seats carry responsibility and we have chosen these seats. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to establish what went wrong and where there is culpability we will act on it. Mann asks how many heads will roll? Meddings says it is important not to prejudge. Slaughter and May are conducting an independent review, we will publish it and take action on the basis of its findings. If I am found to be culpable then the actions will attach to me. John Mann asks how could one of his constituents receive someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s details. Pester says he apologies. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how it happened, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the circumstances. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not something we do intentionally. Mann asks Meddings the same question. Meddings says I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t answer without knowing details. Mann asks if this an ongong problem. Pester said he is not aware of it. Mann says his constituent wrote to TSB and heard nothing back. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re saying you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not aware and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s astonishing. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m struggling that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re even aware of the problem. Mann asks about a constituent whose wedding was ruined and how much she received. Meddings says she has been compensated but can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say how much. But it would compensate for distress. Mann says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a3100. [Silence] Medding says he apologises. Mann says its \u00c2\u00a31 per apology in this session. Mann now asks why Sabadell chief operating officer Miguel Montes is still in his job. Montes also apologies, and admits not all problems have been solved. Mann asks how embarrassed is he that his bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation has been sullied by people who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how people received other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s details. Montes says, we are very embarrassed. Mann: How embarrassed are you about the level of compensation for someone who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wedding has been ruined? Montes: I have no competence to answer this question. Mann: Do you have confidence in working with people who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother compensating someone when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s raised in parliamentary committee. Is that good for your brand reputation. Montes: our brand reputation has been damaged. We have worked night and day, we have progress but not enough. Paul and his team have been clear we will do whatever it takes to compensate customers. Mann says Meddings reputation is on the line as well. How long will this take? Meddings says, we are working vigilantly. We are digging ourselves out of a hole. We have challenges with the call lines, and occasionally in the branches. Mann says the branches are bailing you out, and you have put the call centre staff in a difficult situation. Meddings thanks the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff for having to deal with the situation. Question: The FCA has never written such a letter. Do you accept you should take more personal responsibility. Pester says, I am taking complete and utter responsibility.. All I can do is focus on fixing the situation. Question: Many on the committee believe you have misled the committee. Pesters says, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry if you feel that, I have given the best information I had. Morgan says in a letter on 25 April you wrote everything it running smoothly for vast majority of customers. FCA said this was an example of poor communication. Do you regret that phrase? Pester apologies if he misled anyone. The use of that phrase was to show credit card, debit payments [etc] key parts were working well but we had serious problems with customer access. He says we have tried to communicate as well as we can. Question about whether Pester made confusing statement about IBM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role. Are IBM doing a full review or are they there just to help the situation? Pestere says they are there to help us fix problems, then perform a review to help us understand how this could have occurred. I apologise for my loose use of wording. Question: this is not the only loose use of wording. You said it was middlewear but it was more than this and you seem to know this from the IBM slides. Pester said the IBM findings are early findings and observations and say most of the problems are related to the applications, middleware and network ather than the underlying infrastructure. I tried to explain this in the first session. [Pester is asked to hand over the slides and does so.] Question: The FCA reminded TSB that communications should be fair and not misleading. Do you accept you misled customers and the committee. Pester says he does not accept he misled committee. The FCA did ask TSB to change and improve communications on 25 April. We did that a day later, and then the FCA said our communications were excellent. Question: Bailey wrote on 30 May and said the TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s use of figures risked giving too positive a view. Do you accept he feels you have not been frank? Pester says Bailey also said there is no reason to believe TSB has made misleading statements and I apologise if you think. Question: This is your MO, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re saying its not that bad. This infuriates everyone, people feel they are being misled. Pester says this is not my intent. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m apologetic if you feel I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m trying to spin the information. Question: Bailey says your quoting of averages is misleading. Pester says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sorry if he appears to be unhelpful but he is telling the facts as he sees them. Question: In how many cases since the migration, when there has been an investi of the customer being liable, has there been a delay in compensation. Pester says we said we are not challenging or investigating customers as we created the uncertainty. To the best of my knowledge the answer is zero. MPs are giving more examples of customers suffering problems. Pester apologises if he gave the impression he was downplaying the seriousness of the problems facing the bank. He also says he is sorry if the committee thinks he is not keeping his customers up to date. Question: Either you knew about the scale of the issues with the fraud line [at the time of the previous committee session] and you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell us or you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know there was a serious problem with fraud line. Pester says I told you the information I had at the time. Question: Banks should refund by the end of the following day when there is fraud. Has TSB done that? Pester admits TSB has not done that. Morgan talks about a self employed printer who wanted to access his money. He talks to TSB, gets another call from a mobile, is advised to talk to the person on the mobile. Then he thinks he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been defrauded, finds \u00c2\u00a324,550 been taken from his account and TSB say he does not know how long it will be to get his money back. He has problems contacting TSB, finally gets his money back, changes account. Then he gets a letter, saying TSB is not at fault, and it offered \u00c2\u00a3192. Is that a fair outcome. Pester says the details are distressing and I apologise. We will of course look at this case, and address them. He was caught up in that attack, I would like to take his case further. Chairman Richard Meddings also apologies, says its difficult to comment on whether the payments are sufficient. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily seem to be a correct calculation, but we are attempting to set a framework of compensations taking into account stress and consequential loss. Morgan says the more important point, and where TSB is tone deaf, where the letter suggests customer has to prove the point. Meddings says, I get your point. When fraudsters raid accounts, banks can says customers are negligent but we are trying to compensate in full without asking about liability. Morgan says during last hearing, the TSB twitter account said fraud lines were experiencing higher than usual levels. If twitter knew that why didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you? Pester apologies (again!) and says the number he gave in good faith was the number he had at the time. Morgan says does TSB deserve nickname of Terribly Shambolic Bank? Pester says this whole situation has been a terrible situation for TSB customers. All I can do is work hard to fix this situation. Morgan says Pester had said in a letter yesterday that between 23 April to 31 May, some 2,200 TSB customers had experienced attempts to access their accounts and 1300 suffered financial loss. But the FCA mentioned 10,000 incidents. For some customers this is not happening once but several times. Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it typical that every time TSB is asked, you try to be clever with the numbers. Pester says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sorry if that seems to be the case. The FCA number refers to alerts on accounts, pointing out unusual transaction patterns, which trigger text messages to see if they are genuine. If we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear we block the accounts until we are able to speak to the customer. The 2,200 number is number of customers who had attempts to defraud. Morgan says how many fraud incidents where people had money taken out of their accounts were there? Pester says 1300 had money taken out of their account by fraudsters, and we have refunded them. Morgan points out Pester said at the last hearing that people were waiting only three minutes on the fraud line. Pester says at the last meeting we had not been subject to fraud attacks at that level, it started on the first bank holiday in May, peaked on 15 May, then came under control since. At first meeting we were not subject to those levels of attack. That was the true statement of the situation at the time. I am sorry if I appear to have been unforthright in evidence. Pester says the system tracking fraud still blocks accounts if it detects unusual patterns etc, so there are other ways than just customer reporting fraud. Morgan says fraud system hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been working properly though. Pester says the volume of attacks were 70 times the normal level of attacks. That overwhelmed TSB. So we put in a dedicated line. Fraud is a terrible experience. That fraud line has a two to three minute wait time. I apologise profusely to those customers who have suffered fraud. Pester says it is still the same team, but we recruited more partners so we could respond more quickly. Morgan asks how long people have waited over recent weeks. Pester says it is a priority line so it is a matter of minutes. We have tightened up our fraud defences, and now volume is two or three times normal level. Morgan says people are talking about waiting for hours. Pester says that was before the new line. He apologises again and says it was unacceptable. The level of fraud was unprecedented. But Morgan says in your planning you anticipated an increase in fraudulent activity, so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t unprecedented. Pester says sadly yes, we had our teams on high intensity when we migrated but it was higher than expected. I have been shocked to read of customers waiting five, seven, nine hours. When I saw that I said we had to fix this. Putting a new line in was very important. Now TSB are up and Nicky Morgan begins with the issue of fraud. Question: Have conditions create a spate of fraudulent activity? Pester says he regrets but the situation gave an opportunity for fraudsters to target customers. Morgan says they have to phone a dedicated fraud line, and is the route to get compensation. Pester agrees but they says customers can report fraud to branches or online, but there is a dedicated line. Ultimately though it all ends up with fraud team. The FCA session ends on that note. John Mann ask who should be held to account? Bailey says that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the purpose of the investigation. But at the moment the most important thing is to dig out of hole. Mann says will you use the full range of your powers? Bailey says we will use the powers. Question: The last IT meltdown was Co-op. How many other banks are at similar risks with antiquated IT systems? Bailey says there are major IT changes going on most weekends in the banking systems. This year in particular there has been ringfencing. In this case it was a complete replatforming, from the Lloyds sytems to a new one. Most institutions are operating on systems which have evolved over years. [In terms of risk for other banks] Bailey says he hopes not but you never know. There is a lot still to learn about this one, he says. What would it take for us to observe this in a way TSB management did not, what level of intrusion would be needed? We were involved in the Visa incident, that was a hardware failure. We seek to learn but can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give an assurance these things will never happen again. Question: Will you set out what minimum compensation should be? Bailey says we will want to see how they set it up and calibrate it. There should be a minimum standard below which compensation applies. Services have not been affected evenly, this is one of the problems. Bailey is told the FCA should set down the law otherwise people will not have confidence, especially given the problems small businesses have faced with banks, especially GRG. Bailey says he hopes they appreciate how much the FCA has been involved with TSB. He says the FCA put a team on site very quickly. Question: TSB have appointed Deloitte to look at compensation, how is it going? Bailey says we are pleased they have brought in outside resources, they have been overwhelmed. They are taking it seriously but we want to see it up and running. Howard says they are recruiting staff to deal with compensation. They have started to resolve and settle complaints. Bailey says this should happen quite quickly, it is not very complex. The timeline is short in terms of when things went wrong. Question: In some cases when customers asked to switch, bank has written to some of their direct debit accounts saying they had died, are you aware of this? Bailey says that is another example of putting in a fix in to solve a problem and another part sends out a letter. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they did that intentionally. Question: Does it undermine the system if people see this happening and are reluctant to switch. Bailey says longer term we will have to see the level of switching and if it is happening effectively. Question: are you confident no other banks do this? Bailey says I think we would know that. Sutherland says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a TSB issue. Question: Who controlled the timing of migration of IT systems {TSB or parent company?] Bailey says that will be a major part of the investigation. It was utilising [parent company] Sabadell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s platform but the responsibility rests with TSB managment... But this can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t descend into finger pointing [between TSB and Sabadell] On the question of accountability, Bailey says in this case there is a relationship with an outsourcer (in this case part of the parent company). You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t outsource responsibility, and it rests with the management of the TSB. Question: have TSB now got it right? Bailey says they have improved considerably. The days of the rather generalised and rosy statements, we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen them so often. But it is still important, there are a lot of things going wrong in branches, quite basis and important things. These things still need fixing and it will take time. Question: were your expectations on communications reflected in Pester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony. Bailey says it should have been a more thorough and balances communications situation. My bias would be tell it as it is and communicate extensively. Question: have you ever issued a letter quite like this before, including saying Pester was too optimistic and statements to the public were poor? Bailey says we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have these situations too often. Some parts of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service are functioning, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fair enough to point that out but there is a danger of overemphasis of that which gets away from the fact there are parts that are troubled. Sutherland says they have a torrid time with the branch systems, leading to very busy branches. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite clear those systems problems still exist. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the bits that are not working we are not hearing so much about. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what FCA chief Andrew Bailey told MPs about the fraud attempts on TSB customers (at 2.40pm) I\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdm going to be a little bit circumspect about what we say about fraud\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6as we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to give information that fraudsters could use against the firm. We think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been just over 10,000, 10,600, incidents, and that has resulted in a level of payout. FCA special advisor John Sutherland then explained how the number of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcalerts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of possible fraud are still rising. These alerts lead to customer accounts being blocked or stopped while the situation is investigated - but TSB is struggling to cope. Sutherland said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153TSB is resourcing up to clear those alerts as soon as they can, but they are still on an upward trend. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t indicate so much that there is an increasing amount of fraud, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just that they not resourcing themselves yet to clear them fast enough. Sutherland then talked about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153huge variability\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to handle calls from customers who may have been defrauded, with just one in 10 getting through at the busiest times. Clearly that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not acceptable. Question: Do you feel TSB has adhered to the requirements on communcating the situation. Bailey says we have had some frank conversations about communications, and we said in our letter we were not satisfied. There is an onus of overcommunication, to tell customers what is happening. There is uncertainty at the start about what the situation is. Looking at the daily service levels, they were very volatile. Looking at averages doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give the entire picture. There should have been more communication and it needed to be more reflective of the fact it was a volatile and uncertain situation. Its not easy to communicate volatile. But otherwise you see a lot of criticism from customers. A more straightforward recognition of what the situation was would have been helpful. Has TSB always co-operated? Bailey says yes, they are working very hard, I do not want to call into question their hard work. They are in a hole and they are trying to get out of it. That is not the issue. The issue is how did you get in and how do you get out of it and protect the interests of customers. Bailey is asked about the suggestion that TSB chief executive Paul Pester had some information including slides from IBM which he did not share with the previous hearing. Bailey says IBM were brought in on the Wednesday, by the following Sunday they had produced slides of the issues. We saw those on Sunday, the hearing followed on Wednesday. They are not definitive but they do point to things. At the hearings, Pester said IBM believe issues are in the middleware. But it appears to be not just in the middleware, which the IBM slides show. Question: where are we in timeline for having a coherent plan for the recovery of services? Sutherland says there is a rolling fortnight forward plan for fixing faults in IT, but we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen a plan for getting back to where we were before migration. Bailey says one of the reasons they brought IBM in was they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have that plan, IBM are helping put that plan in. Question: does TSB understand the problems, and have the root causes been found? Bailey says the understanding of the problem has evolved over time. It is still evolving, I do not regard that as particularly negligent. The rate of emerging faults is falling off, as you would expect. It would be wrong to speculate [about our investigation] but testing will be one of the key questions. How robust and rigorous was it. They have put a fix in, and something else happens elsewhere in the architecture, and messages are sent to customers which shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be. So that gets back to testing. Question: when was FCA first told about the TSB problems? Bailey says the first warning that the FCA got was on the Sunday evening, we were notified at one minute to nine o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122clock. They were going live at 6 o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122clock, they first identified problems at 6.20. We heard just before 9,. we had the first call just around midnight. The FCA response was activated the next day. Morgan says FCA says they had not met standard for repaying fraud, why was that? Bailey says they were initially overwhelmed. The FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sheree Howard says, they have now prioritised that. Morgan says is there a pattern of TSB trying to argue the case before refunding. The FCA says no. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, says one in ten fraud-related calls being answered is not up to FCA standards, and the FCA agrees. TSB set up a dedicated fraud line, with the idea that customers would be able to get through more quickly. People can use either line. Sutherland said the fraud problem didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come up in the first ten days. Bailey is asked about fraud but says he will be circumspect. He says there have been around 10,600 incidents, which have resulted in a level of payout. The FSA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s John Sutherland is talking about TSB being alerted to the prospect of fraud, which could lead to customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 accounts been locked. These are still on an upward trend, as TSB is not resourcing themselves. There is a huge variability between one in ten calls answered to practically all, depending on time of time. This has led to customers complaining about how long they have been waiting. The TSB session has begun, with the Financial Conduct Authority underway. Chief executive Andrew Bailey says they have had a full time presence at TSB for some time but they have scaled that back a little now. A reminder. The parliamentary session on the TSB problems can be seen live here, due to start in less than ten minutes. First up is the Financial Conduct Authority\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive Andrew Bailey and two of his colleagues. The FCA has issued a strong criticism of the performance of TSB and its chief executive Paul Pester over the IT fiasco. Meanwhile Pester and his team will be quizzed separately once the Treasury Committee is finished with the FCA. TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubles shine a spotlight on the problems facing much of the banking sector, says professor Pinar Ozcan of Warwick Business School, that is, outdated technology: Many established banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 complicated and siloed IT infrastructures, which were built in the 1970s, make it difficult for them to form a platform that would make sense of the data that is currently stored in a disorganised and non-standard way in separate databases. Banks typically have vertically integrated pillars, which are all for different products and which don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really talk to one another. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why, when you call your bank for something, they sometimes tell you, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got great rates for a mortgage, and you say, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbut I actually have a mortgage with you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122! The recent troubles at TSB provide a great example of a nightmare scenario that can arise as banks update their legacy IT systems. And this is a chicken and egg problem in that in order to avoid security breaches like in the case of TSB, banks have been avoiding major overhauls of their systems, but of course, the more they stay in avoidance mode, the less they will be able to provide digital platforms that make sense of data and offer competitive services. The parliamentary session on TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IT problems kicks off off in 30 minutes, so here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick reminder/preamble. The Treasury committee is holding its second hearing into the TSB IT meltdown. MPs will demand answers about the problems that prevented millions of TSB customers from accessing their accounts in recent weeks - and which still aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fully fixed. MPs will hear from CEO Paul Pester at 3.30pm. Pester has been accused of complacency last month for not grasping the full extent of the disruption. The Financial Conduct Authority has put more pressure on Pester. The FCA has told MPs suggesting that he was too optimistic about the situation and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give MPs a proper account four weeks ago. The FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Andrew Bailey, will give his assessment of the situation at 2.30pm Treasury committee chair Nicky Morgan has said she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very concerned about the communication failures at TSB. Labour shadow City minister Jonathan Reynolds has accused the bank of serious failings. Some TSB customers continue to report problems accessing services, and some are struggling to getting through to the bank to report problems..... After widespread condemnation, the boss of Qatar Airways has apologised for saying only a man could do his job because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s such a tricky job. Akbar Al Baker has now backtracked, claiming he is committed to gender equality and blaming the media for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsensationalising\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 his comments. Frankly I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure they needed sensationalising. If you missed the story, Al Baker declared that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of course, it [Qatar Airways] has to be led by a man, because it is a very challenging position.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here. Peter Praet has also hit eurozone bonds. Bond prices are down, sending yields (interest rates up), following Praet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hint that the European Central Bank could decide to stop its asset-purchase programme soon. Praet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments suggest the ECB isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panicking about the new populist government in Italy. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says: Everyone in Europe seems to be in a terrific rush at the moment. Italian political developments continue at a rapid pace as the new Government flexes muscles and outlines it strategy. The ECB, widely assumed to be in ait-and-see mode, reluctant to rush towards policy normalisation until the BTP [Italian bond] market, at least, calms down, is also in too much of a hurry for such niceties. Back in the markets, the euro is rallying after a senior policymaker hinted that the European Central Bank could wind down its bond-buying stimulus programme soon. ECB chief economist Peter Praet told a conference in Berlin this morning that the governing council will debate whether to gradually unwind bond purchases at its meeting next week. Praet cited the (long-awaited) recovery in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market; the Eurozone unemployment rate fell to 8.5 percent in April, a 10-year low. That should push inflationary pressures higher, and give the ECB confidence to rein in its money-printing scheme. The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is currently committed to buying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30bn of eurozone government bonds each month with newly created money, until at least September. Praet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments suggest that the ECB will discuss ending QE in three months, although a final decision might not come until July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. The euro has jumped by half a cent against the US dollar to $1.177, a two-week high. The Labour party have added their voice to the chorus of criticism of TSB. Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow City Minister, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is deeply worrying that one month on from these issues, some TSB customers are still having difficulties. Labour echo the concerns of the FCA that communications have simply not been good enough. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There has plainly been a serious failure here, both in contingency preparations for a meltdown and in assuring an adequate level of customer communication.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems worsened last week when the bank sent letters of apology to the wrong customers. Some of the letters included other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s names, addresses and customer reference numbers. That means they could breach Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new data privacy laws, the General Data Protection Regulation. Andy Barratt, UK managing director of cyber security consultancy Coalfire, thinks TSB could be fined by the Information Commissioner for the breach. The ICO was also concerned that hundreds of TSB customers saw the wrong account details in the hours after April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s migration. Barratt explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The apology letter glitch is the latest development in this ongoing TSB saga. MPs are clearly taking this issue seriously but, crucially, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re yet to see the ICO weigh in following its own investigations. The regulator will be particularly concerned that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdata breaches\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of this magnitude have now happened more than once \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both immediately before and then again after the implementation of GDPR. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The power to hand out major fines that GDPR affords the regulator means that the price of poor data protection is about to become far easier to quantify. TSB customers are still reporting problems accessing their accounts to the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s social media unit, six weeks after the IT problems began. Many are saying they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get through to TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s telephone helplines.... Others report that they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see their accounts online, or make certain payments. The Financial Conduct Authority appears to have put Paul Pester in a real spot, by accusing him of being too optimistic about the state of TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tech problems. If the Treasury committee feel Pester wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t straight with them last month, they could put him under serious pressure. Pester has already given up one bonus - for completing the IT migration. Could his job be at risk? The Times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking editor, Katherine Griffiths, suggests TSB may needed to be rebranded as Sabadell (the Spanish company which bought TSB in 2015). But Pester might not oversee such a change, if he finds himself \u00e2\u20ac\u0153up against the wall\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over his handling of the crisis, she adds. The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kevin Peachey agrees that the FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public criticism of a serving bank boss is pretty rare: MoneySavingExpert have put together a few questions for Paul Pester to answer at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hearing: The number of customers that have been affected by the online and mobile banking problems and the number that are still facing problems. The number of customers that have lost money to fraudsters, whether TSB feels that after this event its account security processes are still sufficient, and the steps that are being taken to improve this. The number of customers that have switched away from the bank, and how many have reported problems - for example, being unable to switch or cancelled direct debits after switching. The minimum amount of money affected TSB customers can expect to be paid as compensation for their loss and inconvenience \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this needs to be more specific than \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcon a case-by-case basis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. How will it let people proactively know what they are due? The number of complaints the bank has received from customers, the number that have now been resolved, and the average wait time these customers have experienced, both when ringing the phone lines and overall before their complaint is resolved. When TSB expects the IT problems to be fully fixed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if a date cannot be given, why not? The Treasury committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first hearing into the TSB crisis, last month, was a very bruising experience. MPs lost patience with the bank as Paul Pester repeatedly argued that much of the IT migration had gone well (even if customers couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually access their accounts). Nicky Morgan eventually let rip, telling Pester he was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153staggering example of a chief executive who seems unwilling to acknowledge the scale of the problem\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clip from the May 2nd hearing: TSB is still suffering problems, more than six weeks after the ill-fated migration from its former owner Lloyds to its current owned Sabadell. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service status page warns that some customers are still having issues logging into internet banking, or having difficulties making payments. Also, some Direct Debit payments weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken for TSB credit card customers this month. TSB also admits that some customers calling Telephone Banking are experiencing long wait times, and that its branches are busier than usual too. Nicky Morgan MP, the chair of the Treasury Committee, has piled more pressure on Paul Pester ahead of this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interrogation. Morgan says she is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply concerned by TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor communications\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over its IT problems. Last week, the Financial Conduct Authority told the Committee it is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdissatisfied\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s communications with its customers. For example, FCA chief Andrew Bailey says that TSB claimed that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the vast majority\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of customers could access their online account, when in reality only 50% could successfully log in the first time they tried. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one reason Bailey is accusing Pester of giving an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153optimistic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd view of the situation when he faced MPs last month, rather than a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more rounded view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the problems suffered by customers. Morgan says this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t acceptable: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The regulator does not make such criticisms lightly. I am deeply concerned by TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor communications about the scale and nature of the problems it has faced; by its response to customer fraud; and by the quality and accuracy of the oral and written evidence provided by Dr Pester to the Committee. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Committee will discuss Mr Bailey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s letter, and the ongoing problems faced by TSB customers, when it sees Dr Pester and other TSB Board members, as well as the FCA, on Wednesday.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The beleaguered boss of UK bank TSB is being hauled back to parliament today to face fresh questioning over the IT meltdown that left millions locked out of their accounts. Paul Pester is in the firing line over his handling of the crisis, and can expect plenty of criticism and tough questions from MPs on the Treasury Committee. Last month, the committee accused Pester of being \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcextraordinary complacent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 over the botched migration to a new technology platform, so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session could intensify the pressure. TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IT crisis is one of the worst to have hit a bank ever - customers found they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t log on via their computer or mobile phones, small businesses were unable to pay staff, and some householders found their mortgages had disappeared. Cybercriminals have been taking advantage too, with reports that some TSB customers are falling victim to fraud. Overnight, the Financial Conduct Authority - the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s watchdog - has confirmed it is investigating the issue. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We do not normally make this information public, but, given the level of public interest, I want to be clear that we will be conducting this work.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The FCA has also put Pester in the firing line, accusing him of failing to come clean about TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: The City regulator has launched a stinging attack on the chief executive of TSB over the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to be open and transparent with customers when an IT upgrade went badly wrong, locking as many as 1.9 million customers out of their accounts. The Financial Conduct Authority accused Paul Pester of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153portraying an optimistic view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of services after the botched operation in April that is still causing disruption for customers more than a month on. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The FCA has been dissatisfied with TSB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s communications with its customers and we have had concerns that TSB was not being open and transparent about the issues experienced,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Andrew Bailey, the FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, said in a letter to the Commons Treasury committee. In particular, the FCA think that Pester could have given MPs more information about the crisis when he initially testified on May 2nd. They believe he may have had useful information from the tech experts at IBM who have been trying to fix the problems. The session kicks off at 2.30pm, when the Treasury committee will hear from the FCA. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll then question Pester, along with TSB chairman Richard Meddings and Miguel Montes of parent company Sabadell Group. Also coming up today More European stock markets are rising in early trading, after America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tech-focused Nasdaq index hit a record high last night. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains: Tech stock were once again responsible for any excitement on Wall Street. Netflix and Amazon jumping 1.9% and 1.1% respectively boosted the Nasdaq to close at a record high at 7637. This is the second straight session where tech stocks have been under the spotlight and we are seeing a lot of positive news surrounding the sector, Microsoft buying GitHub, Apple pushing new software and Amazon sales flying, when everything else in the market is looking a little drab.

Typically, landlords of profitable stores are treated reasonably well in CVA proposals but those of loss-making stores are offered very little. This flexibility to treat different landlords differently (i.e. repaying the majority of some landlord debts under a CVA but very little of other landlord debts) has angered landlords generally as has the fact that CVA proposals often treat other creditors (suppliers for example) much better and do not impact on the rights of secured creditors (such as banks or other funders).</p> <p>In addition, other businesses (most notably Next) have indicated that they are now sick and tired of competitor businesses using CVAs to reduce overheads, giving them an obvious competitive advantage. Next has stated that it will begin to negotiate a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153CVA clause\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd into its new leases whereby its rent will be reduced in keeping with any reduction under a CVA of a business trading nearby to their stores. This will only increase the anger of landlords.</p> <p>There is a view that retailers are using CVAs to gain a commercial advantage and there is a growing air of cynicism about them.

                "bodyText":"I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news stories on the House of Fraser store closure plan: After suffering technical problems that delayed that start of trading by an hour, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock exchange has ended the day calmly. The FTSE 100 just closed eight points lower at 7,704 points. Retailers had a mixed day; Marks &amp; Spencer lost 1.1% while Next dipped by 0.4%. Oil companies had a better day, though, with BP the top riser (up 2.2%). Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, explains why energy stocks were in demand: Oil rallied hard across the session, jumping 1.5% and recouping losses from the previous session. Buyers came flooding back into the oil market as concerns over supply issues in Venezuela overshadow fears that OPEC could be on the verge of easing oil production cuts. With 2 weeks remaining until the OPEC meeting in Vienna, we are expecting an increase in volatility as investors weigh up the probability of an increase in production against the increasing supply problems in Venezuela and Iran. Oil stocks such as BP and Shell traced the price of oil higher. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction to Dave Ramsden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views on the UK economy: The pound has crept a little higher, up 0.15% at $1.343, but frankly sterling has been volatile all day (as Theresa May and David Davis have tried to hammer out an agreement on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit backstop plan). Newsflash: A senior Bank of England policymaker has declared that the UK economy is emerging from its recent soft patch. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden is telling an audience in London that recent data supports the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view that the slowdown earlier this year was temporary. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) resisted raising interest rates in May, and Ramsden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments suggest a rate rise could come in August. Ramsden says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is still early days. We are still only two thirds of the way through the second quarter, less far through the second quarter data cycle, and only a month has passed since our last MPC meeting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even so, the data we have had so far suggests our interpretation of the slowdown in the first quarter as temporary looks to be being borne out. Consumer confidence and consumer credit both picked up in the latest data, as did retail sales and several business surveys. That included the latest services PMI (purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index) output balance, representing 80% of the economy. So far at least our May judgement looks on track. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking ahead, my central expectation for the economy is in line with the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best collective judgement as expressed in our inflation report forecasts. Global growth still looks solid, albeit a bit less rosy than it did before. The labour market is still robust. I expect GDP growth to resume at a steady but unspectacular pace and demand to continue to rotate away from consumption and towards trade and investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ramsden is seen as a dovish member of the MPC, having opposed last November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike. Another reason why landlords are unhappy about House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move: House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to use a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) to close 31 stores and cut the rent on some others will annoy some landlords. Matthew Weaver, partner at Radcliffe Chambers, explains why property owners are losing patience with this legal manoeuvre: Landlords are becoming restless in the face of numerous CVAs proposed and entered into by retailers in which they are faced with significant decreases in the rent being charged and, in some instances, closure of stores which still have significant lease periods left on them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thereby reducing or removing income for the landlords. Typically, landlords of profitable stores are treated reasonably well in CVA proposals but those of loss-making stores are offered very little. This flexibility to treat different landlords differently (i.e. repaying the majority of some landlord debts under a CVA but very little of other landlord debts) has angered landlords generally as has the fact that CVA proposals often treat other creditors (suppliers for example) much better and do not impact on the rights of secured creditors (such as banks or other funders). In addition, other businesses (most notably Next) have indicated that they are now sick and tired of competitor businesses using CVAs to reduce overheads, giving them an obvious competitive advantage. Next has stated that it will begin to negotiate a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153CVA clause\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd into its new leases whereby its rent will be reduced in keeping with any reduction under a CVA of a business trading nearby to their stores. This will only increase the anger of landlords. There is a view that retailers are using CVAs to gain a commercial advantage and there is a growing air of cynicism about them. This is not helped by the subsequent administration or liquidation of a number of high-profile retailers that have entered into CVAs which have failed, asking the question of whether the CVA was ever an appropriate step to attempt in the first place. Plymouth City Council are disappointed that their local store faces the axe: One male shopper on Oxford Street tells us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit of a shock.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He hoped that the newly refurbished House of Fraser store near Victoria station in London would stay open. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really do online shopping. I like the personal touch.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Otherwise he said he would probably switch to Debenhams or John Lewis. Christopher Scott, who hates shopping and had come to House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Oxford Street shop for his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one big shopping trip of the year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was indifferent to the store closure, although he added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I got a winter coat from House of Fraser [in the past]. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite good.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But he was also wary of online shopping, saying clothes often don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fit if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try them on. Shoppers at House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Oxford Street branch say they were shocked and saddened to hear of the flagship store\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closure. Pamela Emmanuel, who has a House of Fraser loyalty card and has been shopping there for more than 20 years, told us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m shocked that they are closing this one because it is Oxford Street. There are still so many people that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do online shopping. I like to come and try things on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said she had an inkling when the department store stopped selling the Petite range of clothes that she liked, and could not get an appointment at the nail bar which she thought was shutting. Lala Ahmadova, who has been shopping at House of Fraser since she moved to London from Azerbaijan 10 years ago, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sad people are going to lose their jobs. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something like BHS \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another shop that has been here for a long time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said the retailer sells some brands that you cannot buy elsewhere on the high street, such as Hallhuber womenswear and Timberland Kids. House of Fraser employs 990 people directly and through its concessions at the two London stores that are due to be shut, in Oxford Street and the City. A member of staff working in beauty knew about the store closure but said he had not been told about his future. Jeanne Bateman from Norwich said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a big high street shopper. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very sad to see so many big high street names closing down. I feel sorry for us the shopper, and very sorry for the people who work here.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Her daughter Catherine Wilamowska agreed, although she added that because she lives in a small village she does all her shopping online. Another regular House of Fraser shopper, Sille Jeeawon, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will be very sad. I like what they sell.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said she would go to Debenhams once the Oxford Street shop shuts its doors. Shoppers in Birkenhead, Merseyside, are unhappy that their local House of Fraser is earmarked for closure. Doreen Gibson, 81, from Greasby, Wirral, told the Press Association that she and her friends would miss the department store badly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and blamed young shoppers for buying on the Internet... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been coming here every two weeks for 25 years. We meet our friends and have a coffee in the restaurant and a bit of shopping. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is devastating. They are all shopping online now, all the younger ones, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruining it all. Some people still like to go and see what they are going to buy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Honestly, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really, really terrible news.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After crunching the numbers, we can report that at least 35,00 jobs are at risk - or already cut - across Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retailers and restaurant chains since the start of this year: Despite the Father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day offers that are heavily advertised in the street-level window displays, the Frasers store in Edinburgh was quiet on Thursday morning, as the unexpectedly warm weather encouraged shoppers outdoors, my colleague Libby Brooks reports. Staff at the store, one of two owned by the retailer on Princes Street, the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main thoroughfare, had been told not to speak to the media. Each till point has issued with contact details for the press office at headquarters, but many staff privately expressed shock at the news that the store would be closed in early 2019, affected 127 jobs, with some close to tears. Others expressed anger that, although the proposed closure of 31 stores was already public knowledge, they had heard about the closure of their own store from the morning news bulletins rather than from management. One described an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153atmosphere\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the days leading up to the announcement, but remained surprised at the decision. Window-shopping with his partner on a day trip from Fife, David Bell said that if upmarket retailers like Frasers and its sister store Jenners along the street were failing to make a profit, then it was further evidence that shoppers were moving online. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The high streets are suffering everywhere, even Kirkcaldy where we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re from has so many closures. In a place like Frasers they are charging 50% more than you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d pay online and they still can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a profit. Shopping online is not just convenient, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so much cheaper.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Looking up at the prime site on the corner of Princes Street, opposite the Waldorf Astoria, he asked: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What will they do with the building now? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been here forever but I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think who would want to take it over.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In the Pride of Scots gift shop next door to Frasers, Abdul Manan blamed the location of the store for poor footfall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come to this end of the street. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really the wrong location. They go further up Princes Street, where the Scott Monument is. Jenners is in a really good spot.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here are a few of the House of Fraser stores facing the axe, if the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors approve its restructuring plan. Another UK company, the AA, is facing its shareholders at its annual general meeting. Investors are angry about the pay packages handed to bosses, and demanding (in vain) answers about the dismissal of the former chairman. Some more mundane issues are also on the agenda, as my colleague Rob Davies reports from the AGM: At the AA annual meeting, chairman John Leach has said the company will not be answering any questions about former chairman Bob Mackenzie, who is suing the company for \u00c2\u00a3225m after he was sacked over an assault on a colleague at a country hotel. Despite finance chief Martin Clarke having voluntarily given up a bonus earlier this year, 24% of voting shareholders have rejected the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay policy, although not all votes are in yet. Chairman John Leach says some shareholders are concerned about the uncertainty around performance conditions attached to company bonus plans. In the absence of any questions on Bob Mackenzie, one shareholder has raised two equally scintillating matters. The first is a request that the motor industry sue the government over the impact of potholes. The second is that there be gluten-free biscuits at future AGMs. One of House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (many) problems is a failure to engage with millennials. Amelia Brophy, head of data products at YouGov, explains how the chain has lagged behind nimbler retail rivals, and failed to impress younger shoppers: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153YouGov BrandIndex data underlines how House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brand perception has declined over the past year. Its Impression score (whether someone has a favourable impression of the brand) among the general public has declined from +23 last May to +19 now. Its score among younger consumers, those in the 18-34 age bracket, is even lower, at +17. This is been mirrored by shifts in the brand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Quality score, which, among the general public has fallen from +32 to +29. However, the key is the brand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Value score, particularly among younger customers. Overall, it has a rating of just +1, way behind online rivals that have outflanked it. Among 18-24s its score is -4, well below other stores such as H&amp;M (+31), Asos (+27) and Boohoo (+14).\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Patrick O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Brien, UK research director at GlobalData Retail, reckons Marks &amp; Spencer could benefit from House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retrenchment: M&amp;S is also cutting back on stores, with more than 100 expected to close over the next few years. Typo alert: That last headline should have said \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPoundworld\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, of course, not \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPoundland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Now fixed, sorry for any confusion.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning into another black day for UK retail, with reports that budget chain Poundworld is on the brink of administration. Poundworld could file for administration today, putting more than 5,000 jobs at risk across the UK. The company, which made a loss of \u00c2\u00a317m last year, has been trying to find a buyer for some time, but without success. It has 355 stores, and faces a quarterly rent bill in less than three weeks. Press Association has more details: Sources told PA that the notice will give Poundworld time to structure a deal, which could be undertaken through a pre-pack administration, with private equity firm R Capital, former owner of Little Chef. The administration will be handled by Poundworld\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advisers Deloitte. Poundworld, which is owned by TPG Capital, had previously rejected offers to sell through a pre-pack but all options are now being considered. Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Kleinman also fears that Poundworld will join the swelling ranks of UK retailers forced into administration. The Labour Party have accused the government of neglecting Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling retail sector, while it struggled to get to grips with Brexit. Rebecca Long Bailey MP, Shadow Business Secretary, points out that more than tens of thousands jobs are being lost this year: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the first three months of this year 21,000 jobs were lost in the retail sector. Today another 6000 jobs are at risk as House of Fraser confirms store closures across the UK. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the Cabinet is in chaos over Brexit their lack of focus on our high streets is leading to mass job losses, failing one of the biggest employers and industrial sectors in the UK, which is why Labour has called on the Business Secretary to publish a retail sector strategy to safeguard jobs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The next Labour government will support retail by placing it at the heart of our industrial strategy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for the Tories to step up to the challenge of rescuing our high streets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The rising use of CVAs by cash-strapped retailers is hurting Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s landlords, warns Daniel Stern, commercial property litigator at Manchester-based law firm Slater Heelis. Stern says there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrescue culture\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at the heart of insolvency regimes, allowing retailers to go into administration, shed unprofitable operations, and then emerge stronger. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Only 75 per cent of a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors need to approve a CVA which is then legally binding on all unsecured creditors, including landlords, regardless of whether the landlord agreed the proposal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This effectively means property owners must accept lower rents to help a tenant avoid financial collapse. As landlords are often pension and investment funds this is having a knock-on effect on the ordinary man in the street. The Huffington Post have helpfully listed the 28 House of Fraser stores that are staying open if the CVA is agreed. They are: Gateshead Metro Centre, Huddersfield, Leeds, Manchester, Nottingham, Sheffield Meadowhall, Sutton Coldfield, Bluewater, Croydon, London City, London Victoria, London Westfield, Richmond, West Thurrock Lakeside, Bath, Bristol, Cheltenham, Cirencester, Exeter, Guildford, Maidstone, Norwich, Reading The Oracle, Rushden Lakes, Edinburgh (Jenners), Glasgow, Loch Lomond Shores (Jenners), and Belfast. Victor Garcia Capdevila of credit rating agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s believes the store closure plan should give House of Fraser some breathing room to tackle its problems. Capdevila says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Store closures will allow House of Fraser to reduce its rent bill and exit long-dated lease agreements in unprofitable locations. This should facilitate and accelerate the transformation of the company into a more effective multi-channel retailer while alleviating liquidity challenges that have necessitated cash injections from its owner over the past few months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently has a Caa1 rating on House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjunk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rating, implying a substantial risk that the company might not repay its borrowings [Caa1 is the 17th highest rating, only four above default]. House of Fraser says it has put another \u00c2\u00a31m into its pension fund to secure the backing of its pension trustees for its CVA restructuring plan. In other news, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market is still in sluggish mode, according to the latest survey. House prices rose 1.5% in May from the month before, following a sharp drop of 3.1% in April, says Halifax, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest mortgage lender, which is part of Lloyds Banking Group. The average price of a home is now \u00c2\u00a3224,439. This means prices grew just 0.2% in the three months to May from the previous quarter, while the annual rate slowed to 1.9% from 2.2%. Russell Galley, managing director of Halifax, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Both of these measures have fallen since reaching a recent peak, in the final months of last year. These latest price changes reflect a relatively subdued UK housing market. After a sharp rise in January, mortgage approvals have softened in the past three months. Whilst both newly agreed sales and new buyer enquiries are showing signs of stabilisation having fallen in recent months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Cardiff branch of House of Fraser, which is earmarked for closure in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan, is opening late today (presumably because staff are being briefed about the situation?). This store is one of the biggest department stores in Wales. It dates back to the 1850s, when James Howell opened a department store there. Howells was acquired by the House of Fraser group in the 1970s. The store closures announcement is awful news for thousands of House of Fraser staff. Some will have discovered their job is being eliminated as they headed to work this morning. Four stores in the West Midlands are closing, for example, as Simon Penfold of the Birmingham Express and Star explains: It will mean more than 1,100 people losing their jobs across the West Midlands. The Beatties store in Wolverhampton employs 279, 150 work at Telford, 83 at Shrewsbury and 688 at the House of Fraser store in Birmingham. Some staff learned of the news through Twitter before they even got to work today. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our retail correspondent Sarah Butler on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news: House of Fraser is to close 31 stores, more than half of its UK chain, putting a further 6,000 retail jobs at risk and dealing another hammer blow to British high streets. The struggling department store group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Oxford Street flagship in London and outlets in cities including Birmingham, Cardiff and Edinburgh are among those facing closure. The drastic cuts form part of a rescue plan that will also lead to the company moving out of its head offices in London and Glasgow. The 31 outlets would close by early next year under a company voluntary arrangement, a form of insolvency that enables a business to rearrange deals with landlords. Creditors are set to vote on the deal, which includes reducing rents by 25% at 10 other stores, on 22 June. The House of Fraser chairman, Frank Slevin, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The retail industry is undergoing fundamental change and House of Fraser urgently needs to adapt to this fast-changing landscape in order to give it a future and allow it to thrive. Our legacy store estate has created an unsustainable cost base, which, without restructuring, presents an existential threat to the business. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So while closing stores is a very difficult decision, especially given the length of relationship House of Fraser has with all its locations, there should be no doubt that it is absolutely necessary if we are to continue to trade and be competitive.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors will vote on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal on 22 June. As well as shutting 31 department stores, the company also wants to shave 25% off the rent of another 16 stores. If landlords agree, then these 16 stores (plus another 10) will remain open and keep trading, the company says. Back to House of Fraser.... and ITV News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Joel Hills reports that some landlords will oppose the plan to shut 31 stores. Back in the City, London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market failed to open at 8am. The London Stock Exchange are blaming \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctechnical\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 issues, and have just managed to get trading running. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a highly unusual development - the last such outage occurred in 2011 (updated). Hopefully we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out what went wrong soon.... Alex Williamson, chief executive of House of Fraser, has promised to support the 6,000 staff who could lose their jobs: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement is one of the most important in this company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 169-year history. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We, as a management team, have a responsibility to take necessary steps to ensure House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survival, which is why we are making these proposals. I would like to offer my heartfelt thanks to all my colleagues at House of Fraser for working tirelessly throughout this difficult period. We are fully committed to supporting those personally affected by the proposals. Assuming today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan is approved, the 31 stores earmarked for closure up and down the country will shut in early 2019. John Pal, retail expert at Alliance Manchester Business School, says retailers such as House of Fraser are facing a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcperfect storm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Rising business rates, competition from internet rivals, and over-capacity on the high street are making some stores unviable. Pal says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153News that House of Fraser is to close stores comes as no surprise as many retailers grapple with stagnating sales and increasing running costs. Once the training budget has been cut, over-time slashed and overall headcount reduced, in both head offices and in stores, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to focus on the big costs of which stores are a main one. Richard Lim, chief executive, Retail Economics says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s store closures reflect the move away from high street stores and onto internet shopping: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153News that House of Fraser is to shut its Oxford Street store and 30 others is a huge statement of intent. The closure of such an iconic flagship store signals the massive restructuring task at hand. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Department stores are incredibly expensive to operate and the last few years have seen costs spiraling upwards from business rates, rents and National Living Wage. These traditional retail business models that hold huge fixed costs are simply becoming unsustainable for some retailers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The announcement to close such a significant number of stores highlights the unyielding shift towards online shopping and the overcapacity concerns faced by a significant proportion of the market. The retailer will need to push forward right-sizing initiatives and utilise any excess space to sweat assets more effectively in a move become fit-for-purpose in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s digital age. Economics journalist Dharshini David agrees that UK retailers are suffering from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdesperate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 times: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grim announcement follows weeks of talks between House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owners - China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s C. Banner - and its lenders and landlords. House of Fraser needs 70 per cent of its creditors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including landlords \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to back the plan filed this morning. If they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, then the entire company would probably collapse into administration. That would put 17,000 jobs at risk across its 59 stores. Frank Slevin, chairman of House of Fraser, say the company needs to shut more than half its stores, or face collapsing altogether. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The retail industry is undergoing fundamental change and House of Fraser urgently needs to adapt to this fast-changing landscape in order to give it a future and allow it to thrive. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our legacy store estate has created an unsustainable cost base, which without restructuring, presents an existential threat to the business. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So whilst closing stores is a very difficult decision, especially given the length of relationship House of Fraser has with all its locations, there should be no doubt that it is absolutely necessary if we are to continue to trade and be competitive.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd House of Fraser is shutting these 31 stores under a company voluntary arrangement. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effectively a deal between a struggling firm and its creditors under which underperforming stores are shed. Under the CVA, House of Fraser is looking to cut the rent on these 31 stores to just 30% for the next seven months - and then shut them down. Accountancy firm KPMG is managing the process. Will Wright, restructuring partner at KPMG, says a CVA is needed to keep House of Fraser operating in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tough retail environment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The CVAs proposed by House of Fraser give the business a vital lifeline to avoid administration by renegotiating the lease terms of its UK-wide property portfolio, as part of a wider restructuring. The business has been impacted by the mounting pressures facing the UK high street, with the declining profitability of certain stores exacerbated by costly legacy leases which were originally negotiated many years ago. With trading conditions unlikely to materially improve in the short term, the future of House of Fraser is at significant risk unless steps to restructure the business both financially and operationally are taken.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd NEWSFLASH: Retail chain House of Fraser has announced plans to shut more than half of its UK and Ireland stores, in a move that will cost up to 6,000 jobs. House of Fraser is planning to close 31 of its 59 stores across the UK and Ireland, under a restructuring plan filed at the Court of Session in Edinburgh this morning. The list of stores includes House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flagship site on London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Oxford Street, as well as at towns and cities across the country. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the list of stores that will close over the next few months: Altrincham, Aylesbury, Birkenhead, Birmingham, Bournemouth, Camberley, Cardiff, Carlisle, Chichester, Cirencester, Cwmbran, Darlington, Doncaster, Edinburgh Frasers, Epsom, Grimsby, High Wycombe, Hull, Leamington Spa, Lincoln, London Oxford Street, London King William Street, Middlesbrough, Milton Keynes, Plymouth, Shrewsbury, Skipton, Swindon, Telford, Wolverhampton, Worcester.

However, the order backlog in the manufacturing sector is still very high.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carsten Brzeski, ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist for Germany, is disappointed by the 2.5% decline in German factory orders last month. He agrees that it suggests Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has weakened this year. Normally, an increase in new orders after three consecutive drops looks as safe a bet as predicting tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sunrise. However, it seems that today the sun did not rise for German industry. It will get harder and harder to explain these monthly drops with one-offs like the weather or the timing of holidays. In fact, evidence is piling up that the soft patch at the start of the year has been more serious than previously thought. For the time being, we remain cautiously positive. In absolute terms, order books are still richly filled, assured production is high and inventories have been reduced recently. All boding well for industrial activity in the coming months. However, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing new orders reading sends a clear warning that nothing should be taken for granted. Good morning , and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. German factory have suffered their fourth drop in monthly orders in a row, raising fresh fears over the strength of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. Industrial orders slumped by 2.5% in April, new figures from the Federal Statistics Office (Destatis) show. On an annual basis, order numbers in April were 0.1% lower than in April 2017. March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data has been revised down too, to show a 1.1% drop in demand. The decline was driven by a 4.8% drop in domestic orders, while new orders from Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurozone neighbours tumbled by almost 10%, Destatis reports. Capital goods orders (for machinery etc) fell by 5.6% month-on-month in April, while consumer goods orders fell by 2.2%. Intermediate goods orders rose by 2.5%, though. The data is much worse than expected - economists had forecast a 0.8% rise in orders for goods with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Made In Germany\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd stamped proudly on them. This decline suggests that the German economy has made a faltering start to 2018, perhaps dragged back by fears of a trade war triggered by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs. Experts are warning that Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories have made a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchorrible\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 start to the second quarter of 2018 - a worrying sign for its economy, and the wider global economy too.

He could go further by declaring a cap on his existing arsenal freeze on other nuclear activity like uranium enrichment.</p> <p>His biggest element of his opening offer, however, would be a statement on his plans to dismantle his nuclear weapons programme, and here everything will be in the details \u00e2\u20ac\u201c how clearly denuclearisation is defined, and whether Kim commits to a timetable.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/05/donald-trump-north-korea-summit-kim-jong-un-explained\">What will be the outcome of Trump and Kim Jong-un's nuclear summit?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b1a5955e4b022a3efa12935\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-08T10:36:12.965Z\">11.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump attacks Canada over dairy tariffs</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Just in: Donald Trump is limbering up for the G7 meeting by firing another attack at Canada over trade tariffs:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1005030839019802625\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Canada charges the U.S. a 270%  tariff on Dairy Products!

David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: European stocks spent much of the session in the red as trade tensions weighed on investor sentiment. The G7 meeting gets under way today in Quebec, and investors are cautious as certain trading relationships are a little strained. Those talks in Quebec will run for hours and continue tomorrow (although without Donald Trump). Leaders are being pushed to make gender equality a top priority, alongside climate change and trade. Keep an eye on our website for the latest developments. Goodnight! GW Newsflash: British satellite company Inmarsat had found itself in a takeover battle. Shares in the company jumped by 13.5% today, sparking speculation that the company could be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcin play\u00e2\u20ac\u2122...and it is! Inmarsat has just told the City that it has rejected an approach from US rival Echostar. It says: The Board of Inmarsat plc notes today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent press speculation and movement in its share price and confirms that it received a highly preliminary and indicative non-binding proposal from Echostar Corporation in relation to the potential acquisition of the entire issued, and to be issued, share capital of Inmarsat (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Proposal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). After carefully considering the Proposal with its advisers the Board rejected the Proposal on the basis that it very significantly undervalued Inmarsat and its standalone prospects. The Board remains highly confident in the independent strategy and prospects of Inmarsat. Echostar now has until 6 July to make a firm offer, or walk away. Inmarsat is now valued at around \u00c2\u00a32.2bn, following todays share price move. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt has come under pressure today, sending yields on Italian government bonds higher. The FT says the are several factors, both at home and in Frankfurt..... Strategists are uncertain over how the newly-formed populist government will work with Brussels, and also over its fiscal plans. At the same time, a string of hawkish speeches from ECB policymakers earlier this week have revved up expectations that the central bank will announce next week the end of its bond buying programme. Quantitative easing has been a boon to eurozone government debt, helping push yields lower. European Council president Donald Tusk, who is attending the G7 meeting, insists that European delegates will maintain a united front. Tusk also played down the idea that Russia could be readmitted to the gathering, despite Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments earlier: He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This morning I had the first and very good, promising meeting with Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and I am convinced that here at the G7 we will have a fully united European position on all issues. Including on Russia. I am not talking about details but about the more general common line. Tusk also put his finger on the challenge facing world leaders: BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are still near the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard this afternoon, as traders digest the exit of CEO Gavin Patterson. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re currently up 1.1% at 205p. Back in 2013, when Patterson was appointed, they were worth 300p, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been some value destruction on his watch. BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares did rise early in Patterson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenure, hitting \u00c2\u00a35 in 2016. But they then fell back as BT struggled to hit growth and earnings targets - despite spending a lot of money on sports rights. Last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning, released alongside the latest strategy, was the last straw, sending shares to six-year lows. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Perhaps fittingly, Gavin Patterson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenure was very much a game of two halves. The rise of BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sport coverage, which has stepped up to challenge the dominance of Sky initially brought some good times for investors. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a different story over the last two years. Since 2016, BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price graph resembles something of a black run; pretty much always on a downward trend and with a few nasty cliffs here and there. Ultimately, this is what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behind the change. Shareholder confidence has followed the share price down, and with BT embarking on a crucial restructure, the board has decided it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for a change. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments: US stock markets have followed Europe and Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead, and dipped in early trading. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a modest fall, though; the Dow Jones industrial average has shed 40-odd point, or 0.15%., while the Nasdaq is down 0.5%. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has reportedly backed Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for Russia to be reinstated. It raises the prospect of the G7 becoming the G8 again... unless it shrinks to become the G6 first, of course. Breaking: The pound is falling as the Europe Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, gives a thumping thumbs down to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest proposal. Barnier has rejected Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal that Britain should stay in the customs union until the end of 2021 unless a new customs agreement is agreed once Brexit has occured. He is telling journalists in Brussels that the backstop cannot apply to the whole UK, but could apply to Northern Ireland. Barnier also takes issue with the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctime-limited\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 nature of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer. He insists that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153backstop means backstop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (a wry jibe at May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit means Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). This has to be a backstop that provides a guarantee under all circumstances. This is another blow to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position - which was only agreed yesterday after crunch talks between May and Brexit secretary David Davis. Barnier also claimed that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153paradoxical\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (because London wants to leave the EU but maintain many of its advantages). The pound has dropped by 0.5% against the US dollar, or 0.66 of a cent, to $1.336. Our Politics Live blog has all the action: Trump has added further spice to the G7 meeting, by telling reporters in Washington that Russian president Vladimir Putin should be joining the throng in Quebec: Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership of the G8 (as it then was) was suspended after the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Given events since, such as the Salisbury Novichok attack, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think Putin is welcome back.... Trump also declared that Canada, the EU and Mexico all treat America very badly when it come to trade, meaning we can dial down expectations for a successful G7 even lower.... Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s social media sledging isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t doing much for the mood on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average is expected to fall by 136 points at the open, or around 0.5%. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increased isolation on the world stage is worrying traders, says Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA. While Trump has at times appeared friendly with certain other heads of state in the past, the relationships have at least appeared to have become more hostile since tariffs were imposed on the European Union, Canada and Mexico by the US last week. The G7 meeting has become more like a G6+1, with Trump choosing to isolate the US on a number of issues from trade to Iran and climate change. The Nasdaq is heading for an 0.8% drop, with Apple called down 2% following reports it is taking a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cautious\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd approach toward upcoming iPhone shipments this year. Trump has thrown down the gauntlet: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try to hold the president to that last pledge.... However, I suspect the talks will mostly centre on the recent tariffs imposed by the United States on its allies: In another sign that America is detaching from fellow advanced economies, Donald Trump will actually leave the G7 meeting early. The president is due to leave Quebec on Saturday morning, meaning he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll miss the summit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second day. Trump is flying to Singapore for his historic meeting with North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kim Jong-un. The talks could lead to a thawing of tensions between the two countries; but with such unpredictable leaders, anything is possible. My colleague Julian Borger explains how the Trump-Kim meeting could unfold: Trump has sought to play down expectations, characterising the meeting as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153getting-to-know-you, plus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But without a substantial \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the form of progress in the direction of disarmament, the meeting will widely be deemed a failure. And to achieve that progress, Trump will have to make significant gestures towards what Kim wants most \u00e2\u20ac\u201c security guarantees. Both leaders will go into the Singapore meeting with cards in their hands, representing quick, deliverable concessions. The big question next week will be which cards they play and in what sequence. At a minimum, Kim will be expected to formalise the current suspension of nuclear and missile testing. He could go further by declaring a cap on his existing arsenal freeze on other nuclear activity like uranium enrichment. His biggest element of his opening offer, however, would be a statement on his plans to dismantle his nuclear weapons programme, and here everything will be in the details \u00e2\u20ac\u201c how clearly denuclearisation is defined, and whether Kim commits to a timetable. Just in: Donald Trump is limbering up for the G7 meeting by firing another attack at Canada over trade tariffs: Trump is referring to Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Supply management\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd regime, a long-running point of dispute between the two countries. This system specifies fixed prices paid to farmers, strict quotas for how much they can produce, and a tariff wall to prevent cheaper imports from abroad. The result: stable incomes for farmers, who are protected from bankruptcy in lean times, at the cost of higher prices for Canadian consumers. American farmers, though, want to send their own milk and butter north, and Trump is pushing their case. Emerging market currencies are being hit badly today, as investors scramble into the safety of the US dollar instead. The South African rand, the Turkish lira and the Indian rupee have all suffered sharp falls. This kind of action puts pressure on domestic policymakers to consider raising interest rates to prevent capital flight - a move that also hurts economic growth. Yesterday, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank hikes its benchmark rate to a blistering 17.75%, from 16.5%, in an attempt to prop up the lira. Angela Merkel has received some unwelcome news as she prepares for the G7 meeting -- German industrial output and exports both fell in April. Factory output across Germany shrank by 1% in April, dashing expectations that it would rise by 0.3%. The Federal Statistics Office also reported that German exports fell by 0.3% in April while imports rose by 2.2%. That helps to narrow Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus, so could be welcomed by its neighbours. The wider concern, though, is that trade war fears are hurting demand for German goods. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management is gloriously unimpressed by this weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G7 shindig, arguing that little will be achieved in Quebec. But markets could slide if Donald Trump falls out badly with fellow world leaders. Donovan says: Several heads of government disappear off for a taxpayer-financed weekend mini-break in Canada today. The G5, G7, G8, and now G6 plus 1 have never really accomplished very much after the first burst of enthusiasm with the Plaza and Louvre accords of the 1980s. This meeting will be no different. Because the G6 plus 1 is about spin not substance, the risks for markets come from the visual from this meeting. The US is looking isolated. This is not the isolationism and protectionism of the 1930s. In the 1930s everyone put up trade barriers against everyone else. This time the US is putting up trade barriers against everyone else, and everyone else is carrying on just as before. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit says the international trade system is more complex than Donald Trump suggests.... Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attacks on the EU and Canada have sent traders racing to sell risky assets, says Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index. Interest rate realities are sinking back in ahead of what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a not particularly cordial G7 summit in Canada. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little wonder that risk-aversion has returned. Odeluga points out that G7 summits can often disappoint -- but his week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one could be especially worrying: Even under \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnormal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 circumstances, markets tend to write-off the chances that G7 summits will result in concrete communiques with lasting impact. The current U.S. administration back-tracked on climate-related pledges within weeks of the last meeting. It also took its first steps on the trade war path despite the anti-\u00e2\u20ac\u0153protectionism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sentiments addressed in the prior G7 statement. With new U.S. tariffs now lodged against all but one of the remaining six members and Trump tweeting his still combative mood overnight, some leaders might be wondering if there might be more productive ways to spend their time this weekend. No wonder markets are falling. Overnight, Donald Trump launched a fierce attack on his fellow G7 leaders via Twitter, accusing Europe and Canada of treating America unfairly. Trump signed off that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclooking forward\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to meeting Justin Trudeau and Emmanuel Macon in Quebec.... having further stoked the feud between the US and the rest. Macron responded more tactfully, tweeting that tensions are rising everywhere, and the G7 meeting will be demanding. A wave of selling has swept through Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading floors this morning. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 58 points or 0.75%, to 7645 points. Nearly every share is down -- BT jumped 2.5% at the open, but has now subsided. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx blames geopolitical worries: A likely feisty G7 meeting in Quebec appears to be the main thing driving the markets lower. Investors are either worried that nothing will get resolved, or Trump will become more entrenched in his aggressive approach to trade. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has also started the day badly - down 1.1% - while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC is down 0.6%. BT tweets... ...because the incumbent is being kicked out by the chairman?... Geoff Cutmore of CNBC questions whether BT will stick with Patterson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy to revitalise BT, and cut 13,000 jobs, if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now surplus to requirements. Cutmore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s colleague, Karen Tso, points out that transforming BT into a tech-focused company is a huge challenge: It emerged earlier this week that BT shareholders were agitating for change, with top investors demanding talks with chairman Jan du Plessis. We wrote on Monday that du Plessis has already held meetings with investors, with more planned. Clearly the mood wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great. As one top investor told the FT: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much faith in Gavin....Since he took over [five years ago], it has not been a happy time for shareholders. I am not sure he is the right man for the job.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement suggests that du Plessis and the rest of the board came to the same conclusion, deciding that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dca change of leadership\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is needed. As Richard Fletcher of The Times puts it, du Plessis has now \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcousted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Patterson: A wobbly day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading in Asia has seen Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei drop 0.5%, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite index lose 1.5%, and the Hong Kong Hang Seng lose 1.7%. David Madden of CMC Markets says G7 worries are mounting. The G7 meeting starts today in Quebec. Traders will be paying attention to see if any progress is made regarding trade talks. President Tump is in the eye of the trade storm, and he is letting the world know he means business, and he is determined to get the best deal for the US. At the moment, investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overly concerned about the state of play, but that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a pain threshold. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Some breaking news to start the morning: Gavin Patterson is stepping down as chief executive of BT, in the face of criticism from investors. The telecoms giant has announced that Patterson will leave later this year -- after concluding that a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchange of leadership\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is needed. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: The company said that it had already started the process of looking for his successor, and expected to appoint a new chief executive in the second half of the year. Jan du Plessis, chairman of BT, thanked Patterson for his contribution but said the company needed a change in leadership. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The board is fully supportive of the strategy recently set out by Gavin and his team. The broader reaction to our recent results announcement has though demonstrated to Gavin and me that there is a need for a change of leadership to deliver this strategy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Patterson was clearly under pressure; BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price hit its lowest level since 2012 last month. It emerged earlier this week that some investors were losing patience with Patterson, who has been spending billions of pounds on sports rights such as Premier League football in an attempt to attract customers to its TV service. This looks like a rather humiliating way to go, just four weeks after announcing a new strategy and thousands of job cuts. More on that shortly.... Also coming up today Investors will be watching La Malbaie in Quebec, as Canada hosts the G7 meeting of world leaders. It could turn into a G6 +1, though, as America faces criticism over its trade policies from the UK, Germany, France, Japan, Italy and Canada. European markets are expected to fall, with the FTSE 100 called down 35 points, after Asian markets dropped back. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrisk aversion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is rising, as investors fear the meeting will be fraught. Given the quiet economic calendar today, the continuing trade spat between the US its closet allies will attract a good deal of attention as the G7 summit begins. The broader US market posted its first loss in 5 days as the recent equity rally, and more specifically tech rally, faltered, whilst investors started to show unease over the potential climate at the G7 Summit. Souring investor sentiment resulted in a softer session for Asia and indicates a weaker start for Europe on the open.

It was a smart place.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd<br></p> <p>The Tees Valley market town found out this week that Binns, bought by House of Fraser in the 1950s, is to close, along with 31 other HoF department stores around the country. McGee, who used to run a hair salon, says she is devastated by the news. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I come here about twice a week. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lovely place to meet people and go for a coffee,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says.</p> <p>House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement on Thursday that it would shut more than half of its UK stores, came after Marks &amp; Spencer said last month that it was planning to close 100 stores, among them its shop in Darlington.

                "bodyText":"\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Darlington used to be like Harrogate years ago,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says 65-year-old Jenny McGee, as she comes out of Binns, an art deco department store at one end of Darlington town centre. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People used to tell me about how all the women here wore these nice hats and coats with gloves. It was a smart place.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Tees Valley market town found out this week that Binns, bought by House of Fraser in the 1950s, is to close, along with 31 other HoF department stores around the country. McGee, who used to run a hair salon, says she is devastated by the news. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I come here about twice a week. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lovely place to meet people and go for a coffee,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement on Thursday that it would shut more than half of its UK stores, came after Marks &amp; Spencer said last month that it was planning to close 100 stores, among them its shop in Darlington. The two stores sit at either end of the town\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main shopping thoroughfare, with its range of handsome historic buildings. Once a major shopping centre for people from surrounding villages, in recent years the town centre has lost a British Home Stores, a TK Maxx, a McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and a Starbucks, leaving it with more than its fair share of discount stores, charity shops and empty units. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably just board Binns up like they did with British Home Stores and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll make the town look so poor, which it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says McGee. Chris McEwan, cabinet member for economy and regeneration on Darlington borough council, says the closure of the two stores was, in some ways, inevitable, but that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cruel twist of fate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd brought the announcements in such quick succession. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think these companies have made a strategic directional change and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re smelling the coffee and we want to get out of medium-sized towns\u00e2\u20ac\u2122,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. For Rachel Anderson, head of policy and representation at North East Chamber of Commerce, shopping centres like Darlington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s should be thriving. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you look at the figures for the Tees Valley, by far the most affluent boroughs are Stockton and Darlington,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Darlington has pockets of deprivation, but its proximity to the east coast mainline, the airport and the A1 means there is relatively low unemployment and some high-quality jobs. It is really quite affluent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Like many towns of a similar size, says Anderson, it has suffered from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153leakage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c shoppers being pulled away from town centres to places like shopping malls \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Teeside Park, a retail and leisure development in Thornaby-on-Tees, is about a 25-minute drive away. Jonathan Liddle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family have been running a fish stall in Darlington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s covered market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which stands opposite Binns \u00e2\u20ac\u201c since 1970. He recognises that the closure of Binns will bring difficulties, but says he is trying to keep his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chin up and mind open\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the new trends in how people shop. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People like coming here,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says, after greeting a customer by his first name. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lives have changed so much. The mums and dads both work and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re very busy and they do need to do their shopping at Aldi at 8pm,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The traditional older shopper still comes to us, and the younger shopper loves to come to us \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but only when they have time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Robin Blair is vice-chair of Darlington retail market stalls association, as well as the proprietor of JJ Blair and Sons, a grocer and smallholder that has traded from the market hall for 140 years of its 150-year existence. He refuses to believe that the closure of Binns could signal the end for Darlington high street. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to have to work harder and to provide a different sort of service. But the market hall would be empty if people didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want it and it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t empty,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says, gesturing to his busy stall.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd New plans for the market hall involve creating more eating and drinking areas, and spaces for musical performances. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets and town centres are important to the social side to life. As you can see, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not dead,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Blair. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We save the NHS a lot of money. People come here to shop and have a chat and, when they go away, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not depressed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd McEwan agrees that there needs to be what Anderson describes as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a reassessment of what the town centre is for\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He insists that the council has been trying to prepare for the flight of the big chains by deploying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153operational tactical interventions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like arranging Christmas markets and street theatre \u00e2\u20ac\u201c designed to give people more reasons to travel into town. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only so much you can do when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had \u00c2\u00a350m taken off you by central government,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he adds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not trying to make a political point. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just how it is.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He says the council is going to have to think radically about what to do with the Binns building \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which underwent a \u00c2\u00a32m refurbishment as recently as 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it is not going to be easy to find a company to take on such a large space. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is the biggest unit in the town, so we cannot stand by and allow it to be boarded up and look like crap.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap. Britain has been hit by a flurry of weak economic data, that undermines confidence that its economy is recovering from its winter slowdown. New figures show that: UK manufacturing output fell by 1.4% in March, the worst performance since 2012 The trade gap widened to a 19-month high, at \u00c2\u00a35.3bn Construction output posted another quarter-on-quarter decline. Economists warned that Brexit uncertainty may now be biting, making it harder for UK firms to win new business abroad. The drop in manufacturing output was driven by weaker demand for steel and electrical machinery. My colleague Larry Elliott says the figures are troubling: The manufacturing figures from the Office for National Statistics are troubling for three reasons. First, surveys had suggested a much better performance. Second, the 0.5% drop in production in the three months ending in April makes forecasts of a strong bounce-back from tepid growth in early 2018 look premature. Third, even if signs are correct that consumer spending is picking up because of falling inflation, the UK will have reverted to its old pattern of growth after a short interlude in which activity was better balanced. The markets have shrugged off last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fractious and unconstructive G7 meeting, which saw Donald Trump fall out spectacularly with Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Justin Trudeau in a post-meeting tweet storm. Trump has now declared that trade should be truly reciprocal, as he continues to criticise other nations for their tariffs even as he threatens more of his own. European stock markets are all up in late trading, led by Italian optimism that its new government will not consider leaving the eurozone. FTSE 100: Up 50 points or 0.66% at 7731 points German DAX: Up 53 points or 0.4% at 12,819 points French CAC: Up 23 points or 0.4% at 5,473 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: Up 738 points or 3.4% at 22,094 European car companies have taken a hit, though, due to fears they could be hit by new US tariffs. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been another rough day for the UK retail sector, with discount chain Poundworld falling into administration. More than 5,000 jobs are on the line. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today, thanks for reading and commenting. GW Shares in European carmakers have fallen today, amid concerns that they could be dragged into a trade war between the US and Europe. Over the weekend, Donald Trump suggested he could impose tariffs on auto imports, using the same \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnational security\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 argument he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already used for steel. Trump told reporters that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an economic justification for tariffs: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the balance sheet. To have a great military, you need a great balance sheet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Any new tariffs could make it uncompetitive for European carmakers to sell cars in the US, which explains why shares are under pressure today: However, several European carmakers including Fiat Chrysler and BMW actually have factories in America, building cars for export. New tariffs could encourage manufacturers to make more cars in the US, or it could force them to move production to cheaper sites. Greece has won more plaudits today as Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leftist-led government unveiled a multi-bill of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153urgent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd reforms before the Greek parliament. The move officially launches the countdown to bailout exit in August, Helena Smith reports from Athens. As Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy finance minister Giorgos Chouliarakis formally presented the reforms before MPs - saying their passage would finally permit the country to exit international bailout oversight and successfully complete talks on the key issue of debt relief \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Athens received what amounted to some of the highest praise, yet, from the euro group chairman himself. After almost a decade of being dependent on international bailout funds, Greece was ready to stand on its feet again, said Mario Centeno, president of the group of euro area finance ministers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece is a different country today,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Portuguese finance minister told a conference in Lisbon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece has the conditions to take on its own hands the process of its economic and social development, within the euro framework, and can always count on European solidarity if it sticks to the path of internal responsibility.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The high praise came as Chouliarakis said it was vital the draft bill outlining further pension cuts, labour market reforms and privatisations in the energy domain, was voted on this week so that Greece could complete its final review by creditors in time for the next euro group meeting on June 21. That is when Athens not only hopes to take stock of a new \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12b aid disbursement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last as a bailout programme recipient \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but could finally embark on meaningful debt relief talks, he said. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u201a\u00ac320bn debt mountain is by far the biggest in Europe making economic recovery impossible if it is not reduced. Chouliarakis told MPs: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Completion of the fourth and last review of the economic adjustment programme will permit the Euro group on the 21 June to discuss, conclude and decide on a packet of measures for the reduction of Greek debt. Consequently it should be obvious to all why the legislation is of urgent character.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staggering debt pile will also be the focus of talks today between German chancellor Angela Merkel and International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde today. Ding ding! Wall Street has opened calmly, as US traders take the G7 meeting in their stride. The Dow Jones industrial average is 22 points higher, or 0.1%, with the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also in the green (just). Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprised that Donald Trump fell out (badly) with other world leaders in Quebec. The mood in financial markets is relatively upbeat at the start of a very busy week, as investors shrug off the G7 meeting which didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly go to plan as Donald Trump rejected the prepared communique and left early. While everyone will have hoped for a better outcome from the meeting, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think anyone is surprised given Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views on trade and his combative approach to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allies on the issue. Perhaps it was the expectation that this was a likely outcome that has led to investors shrugging it off and turning their attention to something more interesting, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly plenty for them to focus on in the coming days. Newsflash: Jaguar Land Rover is moving the production of its Land Rover Discovery SUV vehicle to Slovakia, from Solihull in the UK. JLR says it will retool its Solihull plant to handle a new generation of electric, petrol and diesel models. But there could still be job cuts at the plant, close to Birmingham in the Midlands, as the changes are made. Kaye Wiggins of Bloomberg has more details: Discovery production will be moved from the beginning of 2019, meaning job cuts at the Solihull plant are possible before it ramps up staffing again, the people said. The investment, totaling hundreds of millions of pounds, according to the people, could cut both ways. While some agency-employed plant workers may lose their jobs, the decision to build electric cars at Solihull marks a major commitment to U.K. manufacturing amid uncertainty over Brexit. European stock markets are holding onto this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, as traders scamper from their desks for a quick lunchbreak (or spill sandwich crumbs on their keyboards). The European-wide Stoxx 600 is up 0.4%, thanks to rallies in London and in Italy. Italian stocks are buoyant after finance minister Giovanni Tria has insisted that Italy remained committed to the euro. Investors are putting the G7 meeting behind them, and concentrating on the imminent Trump-Kim summit in Singapore. Artjom Hatsaturjants, research analyst at Accendo Markets, says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The FTSE has made a strong start for the week, with bullishness back in vogue in spite of a geopolitical dust-up at the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G7 Summit in Canada. Investors appear to be writing off President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bickering with his colleagues as same old, same old (start in attack dog mode, dial back rhetoric later), perhaps more interested in the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. UK building firms are suffering from Brexit uncertainty and the weakness of the UK pound, says Michael Thirkettle, chief executive of construction consulting and design agency McBains. As mentioned earlier, construction output shrank by 3,4% in the three months to April. Almost every part of the sector suffered: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures also show that total construction new orders fell by 4.6% in the first three months of this year, which will drag on output in the coming months. Thirkettle says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics prove the construction sector is still in troubled waters with continuing uncertainties, borne from Brexit, and the poor value of sterling impacting on the cost of imported materials, meaning many UK companies are delaying investment decisions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The real test, however, will be in the months to come, given the uncertainty over issues like Brexit that have impacted on UK companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 commitment to new projects over the last two years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yet more disappointing news: the UK economy only grew by 0.2% in the last three months, from March to May. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest estimate from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than the 0.1% recorded in the first three months, but it dashes hopes of a healthy rebound from the winter slowdown. Economists had pencilled in growth of 0.3%. Amit Kara, NIESR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of UK macroeconomic forecasting, says the UK is only growing half as fast as its potential growth rate, partly due to the snow in March. Economic growth has slowed materially since the start of this year and it continues to remain weak. One reason for sluggish growth is the disruption caused by severe weather in March, particularly to the construction sector. The latest data also shows a notable slowdown in manufacturing sector output that appears to be driven by both domestic and external conditions. By contrast, the retail sector and the dominant services sector may be recovering. At Poundworld in Hyde in Tameside, Greater Manchester, shoppers were dismayed to hear of the chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demise, reports my colleague Helen Pidd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh what a shame,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Sylvia Andrew, 61, who had just paid a pound for a dummy security camera to protect her hen house. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If someone comes to nick my chickens they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not to know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not real. If you put two AA batteries in a light flashes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Currently signed off sick, she counts every penny, explaining: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At Poundworld you get two Pears soaps for \u00c2\u00a31. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a31.50 at the supermarket.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Joanne Betts, 48, a carer, had just bought four packets of Glow sticks for \u00c2\u00a31 each and some bin bags. She told us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think a place like this would close. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 m in every week buying things I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Inside, shoppers could spend a pound on anything from flip-flops to rat poison or packets of Aunt Bessie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yorkshire pudding mix. One of Poundworld\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems may have been its competitors. Next door to its Hyde store is Bodyworks, a discount cosmetic outlet. Next to that is B&amp;M Bargains, a northern chain which recently announced plans to open 45 stores down south. Add to that the Quality Save in the precinct, the Iceland in the shopping centre carpark and a branch of Yorkshire frozen food retailer Jack Fulton and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear bargain hunters are spoiled for choice. The slide in the pound today is pushing shares higher in London (as a weaker currency is good for exporters). The FTSE 100 is now up 70 points today at 7750, as City traders continue to shrug off the G7 mess. Newsflash: UK discount chain Poundworld has gone into administration, putting 5,100 jobs at risk. This is the latest in a string of retail failures this year, following the collapse of Toys R Us and Maplin. My colleague Rob Davies explains how last-ditch rescue talks to save the firm failed: Poundworld, which has a chain of 335 shops, filed a notice of intention to appoint an administrator last Thursday, giving it temporary protection from its creditors. But plans to find a buyer for the business have now been abandoned, although the administrators are likely to seek buyers for parcels of stores. But two potential rescue buyouts have fallen through, with private equity firms Rcapital and Alteri Partners both walking away after talks with current owners TPG Capital. All this weak economic data is bad for the pound. Sterling has shed half a cent against the US dollar to $1.335. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down a similar amount against the euro, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.134. The 1.4% tumble in UK manufacturing output in April has come as a nasty shock to economists, who had expected a small rise. It undermines hopes that the UK economy was bouncing back from its slowdown last winter. Brexit could be partly responsible for the drop in UK manufacturing output last month. Economics journalist Dharshini Davis suspects that firms may find it harder to win business, because of the uncertainty over trading relations after March 2019. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), fears that trade war fears are already hurting UK exporters. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s widening trade gap: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The deterioration in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade position in April is a concern and means that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit remains significantly higher than the historical average. This deterioration largely reflects a marked decline in exports in the month. It is possible that the UK is now moving past the recent sweet spot for exporters, with growth in key markets moderating and the impact of the post-EU referendum slump in sterling, which has helped some exporters, subsiding. The possibility of an escalating trade war has added to the downside risks for exporters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153More must be done to support UK exporters by addressing longstanding issues, from the lack of practical support for exporters to chronic skills shortages.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And Donald Trump thinks he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got trade problems.... This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic data paints a rather grim picture of the UK economy. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the ONS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of national accounts, Rob Kent-Smith: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Manufacturing fell in the three months to April with electrical machinery and steel for infrastructure projects seeing reduced production. International demand continued to slow and the domestic market remained subdued. However, oil and gas production grew strongly in the aftermath of the Forties pipeline closure at the end of last year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While construction output saw a small bounceback in April after a poor start to the year, over the longer-term this sector continues to contract with significant falls across most types of work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Construction orders fell for a second successive quarter after recent boosts from large rail projects. However, new housing orders reached their highest level since before the economic downturn. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The trade deficit widened as exports fell by more than imports, with exports of goods and services both declining. Exports of machinery, aircraft and pharmaceuticals all saw notable falls.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Make that a triple-dose of bad news! UK construction output fell by 3.3% year-on-year in April. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fourth drop in a row, and the longest negative run since May 2013. In a double-dose of bad news, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade gap with the rest of the world has worsened. The total UK trade deficit widened by \u00c2\u00a31.9bn to \u00c2\u00a39.7bn in the three months to April 2018, due mainly to falling exports of both goods and services. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: Goods exports fell \u00c2\u00a33.1 billion, due mainly to falls in exports of machinery, pharmaceuticals and aircraft, while services exports also fell \u00c2\u00a32.5 billion in the three months to April 2018. Falling volumes was the main reason for the declines in exports of machinery, pharmaceuticals and aircraft in the three months to April 2018 as price movements were relatively small. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade in goods deficit improved \u00c2\u00a30.6 billion with countries outside of the EU and worsened \u00c2\u00a31.2 billion with countries inside the EU in the three months to April 2018. In April alone, the trade gap widened to nearly \u00c2\u00a35.3bn. Britain ran a surplus of \u00c2\u00a38.7bn on services, but that was more than wiped out by a \u00c2\u00a314bn deficit in goods. Total industrial production in the UK fell by 0.8% last month, dragged down by that worrying 1.4% slide in manufacturing. Energy production fell by 2%, thanks to the warmer weather. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers have suffered their biggest monthly fall in over five years -- raising new worries about the strength of the economy. UK manufacturing output fell by 1.4% in April 2018, new figures from the Office for National Statistics show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest monthly fall since October 2012, when it shrank by 1.8%. The ONE warns: There is widespread weakness with 9 of the 13 sub-sectors decreasing and this is a continuation of the recent slowdown in this sector. Over the last three months, manufacturing output has now fallen by 0.5% - the worst performance since May 2017. The ONS blames \u00e2\u20ac\u0153decreases in electrical equipment (9.4%), and basic metals and metal products (1.8%).\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More to follow.... Donald Trump told fellow G7 members that America was tired of other countries imposing unfair tariffs. The data, though, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back this up. According to the World Bank, the average tariff on goods traded between countries has now fallen to 2.9%, thanks to various trade deals. G7 countries actually have lower tariffs -- at just 1.6% for goods coming into the UK, France, Germany or the US. Of course, there are still significant tariffs on some goods - such as milk imports into China, or tobacco imports into the US. But by unilaterally slapping tariffs on steel imports, Trump risks driving up the global tariff burden. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy minister has said the G7 meeting has bolstered unity among European Union members. Peter Altmaier told reports in Brussels that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The commotion at the G7 summit in Canada has brought the European Union closer together. It is important we show unity at all levels.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Four EU members took part in the G7 meeting - Germany, France, Italy and the UK. Like Canada, the EU is expected to hit back at America with a range of retaliatory tariffs on July 1st, in response to the US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Chancellor Angela Merkel took an unusually blunt line, saying that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to withdraw from the G7 communique by tweet was sobering and depressing. She told the ARD broadcaster that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow ourselves be ripped off again and again. We will act too. The Canadian dollar is dropping this morning, in the face of deteriorating relations between Washington and Ottawa. The loonie (as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s known in financial circles) has shed 0.3% against the greenback to C$1.296. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a modest fall, following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that Canadian PM Trudeau was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very dishonest and weak.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump is particularly angry about Canadian milk, where domestic subsidies and high tariffs protect Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s farmers from the vicissitudes of the dairy market. But that centralised \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsupply management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 system does seem to work; it avoids both bankruptcies and gluts by guaranteeing farmers a decent price. Trudeau is determined to support it. Ding! European stock markets are open, and rallying despite the lack of progress at the G7 meeting. In London the FTSE 100 has gained 35 points, or almost 0.5%, with similar gains in Frankfurt and Paris. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX has jumped by over 1%. Traders are jittery about the acrimony seen in Canada last weekend, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets, but also hopeful of progress in Singapore. Van Dulken explains: Thankfully, there is more optimism about the US President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. Potential for a meaningful discussions about de-nuclearisation on the Korean peninsula could diffuse some of the tensions between US and North Korea, improve the global mood and gain Trump some brownie points after this weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s events at the G7. South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has led the rally in Asia today, on hopes that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next summit will be more productive than his last one. The Kospi index has gained 0.75% as traders prepared for the historic Trump-Kim meeting tomorrow. There are also gains in Japan and India, although China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark index has dropped into the red. David Madden of CMC Markets says investors are hoping for a breakthrough: The US President left the G7 summit early in order to prepare for his meeting with Kim Jong Un, the North Korean leader. The meeting will take place today in Singapore. There has been a bit of toing and froing about the meeting, but now it seems as if it is finally going ahead. Last summer there were some volatile sessions on global stock markets on account of the heightened tensions between the US and North Korea because of the regime\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear weapons programme. The meeting between the two leaders could greatly improve political relations around the world. President Trump has launched another tirade at the rest of the G7, as he prepared for his summit with North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kim Jong-un in Singapore on Tuesday: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It was a bad weekend for fans of the rules-based international order, as the meeting of top world leaders struggled to meet even the lowest expectations. Relations between America and the rest of the G7 look worse than ever, after Donald Trump left the meeting early, refused to sign the official communique, and accused his host Justin Trudeau of making \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfalse statements\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Getting all the adults in one room is meant to deliver progress and resolve differences, but not this time. Instead, the G7 has taken another step backwards, with Trump accusing the rest of the world of treating America like a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPiggy Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. So, the US is sticking to its new tariffs on steel and aluminium, and Canada is vowing to hit back with its retaliatory tariffs on US goods from July 1 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite being accused of treachery by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic advisor. The scale of the debacle suggests that the alliances and structures build up over the last 70 years are now creaking alarmingly, raising the dangers of a full-blown trade war. The financial markets, though, are remarkably unconcerned by events in Quebec. Asian stocks have risen overnight, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei gaining 0.5%. European markets are expected to rally too; Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is expected to creep higher today too. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says investors are shrugging off the G7 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets appear able to shake off geopolitical risks with stocks showing firmness in the face of a pretty torrid weekend for free trade. Asian shares have risen and futures point to the FTSE opening up around 0.2%, with smaller rises for the DAX and CAC. After a stormy G7 meeting, the US seems to have turned its back on its allies and is prepared to ratchet up the pressure on trade. Ostensibly this should not be good for risk, though markets appear deaf at present to such rumbings. This is brinkmanship that may ultimately end up working to the advantage of the US; but it is also likely to depress investor sentiment, and therefore growth through the second part of 2018. Nevertheless, expectations coming into the event were exceptionally low and so there has been little negative reaction in the markets so far.

We expect underlying inflation to trend gradually higher from here, which will prompt the Fed to hike rates twice in the second half of the year.</p> <p>A 1.7% m/m rise in gasoline prices last month pushed the energy index up by 0.9% m/m. Thanks also to the base effects caused by the 5.3% m/m drop in gasoline prices in May of last year, that rise in energy prices pushed headline CPI inflation up to 2.8%, from 2.5%.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap. Wage growth in the UK has slowed, in the latest sign that British households is struggling. Basic earnings rose by 2.8% per year in the February-April period, down from 2.9% a month earlier. Total pay, including bonuses, only rose by 2.5% -- meaning inflation ate virtually all the increase. Unions warned that wage growth was too slow to help families recover from the financial crisis. Economists say the wage growth slowdown cuts the chance of interest rates rising in August. The government hailed the news that employment was at a record high. Unemployment remained at a 43-year low of 4.2%. American consumers are also being hit in the pocket, with CPI inflation hitting a six-year high last month. Energy costs were a key factor, as US citizens faced higher prices at the gasoline pumps Economists say the figures mean the Federal Reserve is certain to raise interest rates at the end of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting tomorrow (on Wednesday). The markets are subdued today, as investors digest the Trump-Kim summit. The FTSE 100 is down 16 points (0.2%), while the Dow Jones industrial average is down 21 points (-0.1%). Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, says markets have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more pressing concerns\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The long-term importance of the Korea-U.S. summit is obvious but the event itself was always going to be something of a sideshow. All eyes were on the topic of denuclearisation, and, just as importantly facilities to verify that, but whilst North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kim Jung Un reaffirmed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unwavering\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd commitment to the aim, agreements appeared vague and their scope limited. Verification was discussed, according to U.S. President Donald Trump, in a lengthy post-summit presser, but he gave no indication of whether North Korea was inclined to move towards the kind of stringent corroboration needed. So, grounds for optimism on a new North-South Korea order remain, but talks have merely confirmed there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a long grind ahead to fulfil that promise. That may be all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting, GW Rating agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s says America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic at the sight of inflation jumping further above its target: Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s says: U.S. inflationary pressures are gradually developing, not surprising given the rise in global commodity prices, the tightening in the domestic labor market, and above-trend GDP growth. The headline consumer price index increased 0.2% in May, matching the gain in April. Food prices were unchanged, while energy rose 0.9%. Excluding food and energy, the CPI was up a trend-like 0.2%. On a year-ago basis, the headline and core CPIs increased 2.7% and 2.2%, respectively. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a slam dunk that the Fed will raise interest rates at the conclusion of its meeting Wednesday, and odds favor that it signals a total of four rate hikes, rather than three, this year. Though policymakers sound hawkish, there is no immediate need to panic; the central bank should let inflation temporarily run above target. Philip Smeaton, chief investment officer at Sanlam UK, reckons Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade disputes are helping to push US inflation higher. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Underlying upward pressure from tariff discussions, tax cuts and low employment has helped stoke the inflationary fires. And while the Fed won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too concerned about inflation ticking above its target, it does pave the way for an interest rate rise later this week. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-trade policies have certainly added to this inflationary pressure. While the US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiation style has often been more bluster than action, it looks like some tariffs will go live, and he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem too concerned about the short-term effects if it has a lasting impact in the longer term. However, [Federal Reserve chair Jerome] Powell will be keeping a watchful eye on the ongoing discussions and any further effects these may have on growth and inflation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Michael Pearce of Capital Economics points out that fuel and energy are getting more expensive: The increase in headline inflation to a six-year high of 2.8% in May is partly due to the rally in energy prices, but it is also reflects another solid monthly gain in core CPI, which will keep the Fed on course to raise interest rates tomorrow. We expect underlying inflation to trend gradually higher from here, which will prompt the Fed to hike rates twice in the second half of the year. A 1.7% m/m rise in gasoline prices last month pushed the energy index up by 0.9% m/m. Thanks also to the base effects caused by the 5.3% m/m drop in gasoline prices in May of last year, that rise in energy prices pushed headline CPI inflation up to 2.8%, from 2.5%. With crude oil prices stabilising in recent weeks, gasoline prices are likely to be more neutral for inflation over the rest of the year. Inflation is devouring most of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay rises, flags up economist Ulrik Bie: Greg Daco of Oxford Economics predicts America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bankers will raise interest rates twice more this year, starting tomorrow. This chart from Bloomberg shows how US inflation has now running over the official 2% target for months, and is now at its highest level since 2012: BREAKING: Prices in America are rising at their fastest pace since 2012. The US consumer prices index rose to 2.8% per annum in May, up from 2.5% in April. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little higher than expected, and the highest inflation rate since February 2012. It surely means the Federal Reserve is certain to raise US interest rates on Wednesday. Prices rose by 0.2% during the month. Core inflation (which strips out volatile items) rose to 2.2%, another sign that inflationary pressure are building. European stock markets continue to be underwhelmed by the results of Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historic summit in Singapore. In London, the FTSE 100 has dropped into the red - down 20 points at 7718. The Frankfurt and Parisian markets are looking becalmed too. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lacklustre response to what Trump claimed was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very important event in world history\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear that the US president has achieved much, in return for granting Kim such as high-profile meeting. North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153complete denuclearisation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sounds good, but today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t include concrete targets. Of course, it will take more than one meeting to reach a truly momentous deal. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our analysis: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also some surprise that Donald Trump has agreed to suspend \u00e2\u20ac\u0153War Games\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the region, on the grounds they are expensive, provocative and inappropriate. Dr Moritz Pieper, an expert in International Relations at the University of Salford, sees a long road ahead: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The historic meeting between Trump and Kim can be a first step in a longer-term process that might eventually see a peace treaty for the Korean peninsula and North Korean denuclearisation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But both sides have different views of what denuclearisation means. The US line has always been that it wants to see complete, irreversible and verifiable dismantlement of North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear programme in return for aid and sanctions lifting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or relief. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But North Korea is unlikely to agree to give up its nuclear weapons. This is seen as North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security guarantee \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the nuclear deterrent is seen as key for regime survival. The president of ZEW, Achim Wambach, reckons German investors are being spooked by geopolitical perils: Explaining today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop in sentiment, Wambach says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest escalation in the trade dispute with the United States and fears about policies by the new Italian government that could destabilize the financial system are leaving their mark on the outlook for Germany. In another alarming development, optimism among German investors has sunk to its lowest in nearly six years. The ZEW institute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly index of morale has slumped to -16.1, down from the -8.2 recorded in May, and the lowest level since September 2012. The trade dispute between Europe and the US, and the election of a populist government in Italy, could be a nasty cocktail for German investors. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also seen exports and factory production fall this year, a sign that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy may be slowing down. Economists are concerned... The broader picture is that UK wages are still below their pre-financial crisis levels in real terms, and struggling to catch up: Public sector pay packets have lagged behind since 2015, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthanks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay cap on nurses, teachers et al. They suffered the brunt of the fall in real wages last year, as inflation ravaged pay packets. The slowdown in UK wage growth last month will concern the Bank of England, which has predicted that earnings will accelerate in 2018. Weak economic growth in the first quarter of this year prevented the BoE from raising interest rates in May. If wage growth remains weak, it could deter a rate hike this summer too. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, suspects that UK interest rates may remain at 0.5% until 2019. The Bank views wage growth as a key indicator when considering whether to raise rates. Disappointing figures here, combined with confirmation that the economy grew by just 0.1% in Q1, should put paid to any talk of a summer rate rise. Policymakers had been thought to be considering raising rates in August, but I still think a rate rise this year looks unlikely. The Bank will almost certainly want confirmation that the Q1 growth figure was just a blip before raising borrowing costs. Women taking part-time jobs makes up the biggest proportion of job creation in the last year, followed by men taking full-time jobs. This helped to push the female employment rate to a record high of 71.3% (compared to 80% for men). Young Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trust chief executive Dr Carole Easton OBE says more help is needed: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The record rate of women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment is welcome, although the Office for National Statistics has pointed out that this is in part due to women retiring later. At the other end of the scale, young women are struggling to find work and make ends meet. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Young women tell us they want to work and be able to live independently but today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures show that nearly half a million are still out of work and full-time education \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 11,000 more than this time last year. Esther McVey, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, says the steady job labour market is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153success story\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The employment rate has never been higher \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with over 3.3 million people moving into work since 2010. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Great British success story with businesses from Exeter to Edinburgh creating jobs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c helping, on average 1,000 people find a job each and every day since 2010. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And with the increase in the personal tax allowance, this Government has ensured that people are keeping more of their money before they begin paying tax \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning more take-home pay, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more money in your pocket for you and your family. At just 2.8%, UK pay growth is well below the 4.5% enjoyed in the run-up to the financial crisis. Conor D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Arcy, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, says earnings growth remains disappointing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK jobs market has continued to impress in 2018, with employment remaining at a record high and female unemployment falling to its lowest ever level. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re yet to see the good news on jobs feed into wage pressure, with nominal pay growth still below 3%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the easing of inflationary pressures is helping pay packets to stretch that little bit further, there is still no sign of a long overdue pay rebound in Britain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Industrial unrest hit a record low in April, with fewer walkouts than ever before. The ONS reports that: there were 3,000 working days lost from five stoppages in April 2018, the lowest number of stoppages since monthly records began in January 1931 1,000 people took strike action, one of the lowest figures on record This highlights how union power has waned in Britain in recent years -- perhaps one reason that wage growth is now so mediocre. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), is worried that UK wage growth is slowing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While pay is still outpacing price growth, the slowdown in earnings growth is a concern. Delivering sustained rises in real pay growth is likely to prove an uphill struggle amid weak productivity and a sluggish economy. As a consequence, household finances are likely to remain stretched, particularly given weak household savings and high debt levels. The slowdown in earnings growth, together with the recent weakness in a raft of other economic indicators, undermines the case for tightening monetary policy. Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, fears that the UK labour market may have peaked. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The juxtaposition of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increase in the employment rate to a record 75.6% and yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news of lay-offs at both Poundworld and Jaguar Land Rover will be lost on nobody and we think that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report could soon be revealed as a high water mark for job creation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The recent claimant count trend has been increasing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it sits at 3\u00c2\u00bd year high currently - and employment readings within the PMI sentiment surveys have been deteriorating so an increase in joblessness soon would not come as surprise. This could also contribute to a slowing of wage gains, something that we have seen already this month.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This wage slowdown means that real basic pay growth in the UK (basic earnings minus inflation) remains just 0.4%. And total real pay growth is zero -- with inflation eating up pay and bonuses. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady has warned that wage growth is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stuck in the slow lane\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. At this rate pay packets won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recover to their pre-recession levels for years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to speed things up. Extending collective bargaining would boost living standards and help workers get a fairer share of the wealth they create. The number of unemployed people in the UK dropped by 38,000 in the last quarter, to 1.42 million. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs data is weaker than expected, says Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Andy Bruce: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment rate has now been at a record high of 75.6% for two months running - a record dating back to at least 1971. At 4.2%, the unemployment rate hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been lower since March-May 1975: But this apparent strength is not reaching workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pockets. Regular pay growth is now dropping, having hit its highest level since 2015 last month. Newsflash: Wage growth in the UK has slowed, even though the economy continues to create jobs. Basic pay growth slowed to 2.8% per year in the three months to April, the latest labour market report shows. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 2.9% a month ago, suggesting that wage growth is faltering. Total pay growth (including bonuses) also slowed, to 2.5% from 2.6%. The unemployment rate, though, remains at just 4.2% - its lowest level in 43 years. And the economy continued to create jobs -- 146,000 new workers were taken on in the last quarter, down from 197,000 in the January-March quarter. The ONS says: There were 32.39 million people in work, 146,000 more than for November 2017 to January 2018 and 440,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 years who were in work) was 75.6%, higher than for a year earlier (74.8%) and the joint highest since comparable records began in 1971. There were 1.42 million unemployed people (people not in work but seeking and available to work), 38,000 fewer than for November 2017 to January 2018 and 115,000 fewer than for a year earlier. More to follow! Economist Shaun Richards says we should watch out for total wage growth in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay including bonuses). It dropped to 2.6% last month, down from 2.8%. Overnight, Larry Kudlow - the director of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Economic Council - was hospitalised after suffering a heart attack. Trump broke the news on Twitter, shortly before his summit with Kim. Kudlow, a former TV personality and Wall Street economist, only joined the White House in March. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important advisor to Trump, and a supporter of free trade, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear who might cover his duties while he recuperates. Kudlow hit the headlines on Sunday after accusing Canadian PM Justin Trudeau of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153essentially double-crossing President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Paul Donovan of UBS thinks investors should focus on the crisis at the G7, rather than Trumps\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Kim. He explains: The US president seems to have a better relationship with the North Korean leader than with the Canadian leader. Markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care too much about North Korea. Markets do care about US relations with Canada. Sue Trinh of RBC says investors shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too excited by Kim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to work towards \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomplete denuclearisation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the Korean peninsula. Both sides stand far, far apart on what denuclearisation means. To the US, it means NK must deliver complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation. To Kim, it means NK suspends nuclear and missile tests in exchange for major economic concessions and the US stepping back as torchbearer for the Asian region (basically dismantling its alliance with South Korea and ultimately the region as a whole). Kim has never announced the intention of abandoning his existing nuclear arsenal, which he calls a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153treasured sword\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Per previous peace deals, the main issue will be the pace of implementation, which includes agreement on a verification protocol. South Korean President Moon suggested it could be the start of a process lasting up to two years or longer. So let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s get back to what really matters for markets for the time being \u00e2\u20ac\u201c next up, US CPI, voting on the EU Withdrawal Bill and the FOMC and ECB meetings. European stock markets have opened higher as traders digest the historic US-North Korea summit in Singapore. After holding hours of talks, Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un have sat down before the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s media and signed a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomprehensive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 agreement, pledging to work towards peace on the Korean peninsula. Photos of the document also show that North Korea has committed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153work towards\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd complete denuclearisation. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a welcome aspiration, but not a full-blooded commitment it will actually happen. Kim hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agreed to any explicit missile reductions, for example. But still, the Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index has gained 0.4% in early trading, on relief that the Singapore event has gone better than the G7 summit. Trump declared that the two leaders had enjoyed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153really fantastic meeting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while Kim spoke about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a big prelude to peace\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is up a modest 6 points. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re tracking all the developments here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we learn how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market is faring, as the warning lights flash on the UK economy. Overnight, recruitment firm ManpowerGroup has reported that company bosses are at their most pessimistic since 2012 -- due to worries over Brexit and the high street slowdown. My colleague Richard Partington explains: Watched by the Bank of England and the government for early warnings of hiring spurts or downturns, the quarterly poll of about 2,000 major employers from nine different industry sectors across the UK found a net balance of only 4% planning to hire more staff rather than cutting back. The weakest outlook from the survey was reserved for the banking and finance industry, which recorded the worst outlook since the depths of the financial crisis almost a decade ago, suggesting job cuts may be on the way over the summer. With manufacturing output hitting a six-year low yesterday, and construction output also disappointing, the economy appears to be at its weakest point since the eurozone crisis was raging six years ago. So, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment figures will be scrutinised for signs of weakness. Economists are expecting the jobless rate to remain at 4.2% in April, a 43-year low, with basic pay rises unchanged at 2.9%. But, the number of jobs created over the last quarter could drop to around 110,000, from 197,000 in the three months to March. That could signal that the labour market is cooling. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada explains: Even though there have been a number of large surprises to the upside in the employment data over the last six months, it will be very difficult for gains in employment to match last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very strong +197k 3/3m. For the unemployment rate, we expect it to remain at 4.2% for a third consecutive month. As ever, average wages will be the more closely watched measure, but on this occasion we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect major changes and look for the excluding-bonus measure to remain 2.9% 3m/yr. Also coming up today It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big day for Brexit, as parliament votes on an amendment to give MPs give parliament a meaningful vote on the final deal. This would put the House of Commons in charge if MPs were to reject the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final divorce deal was rejected by MPs into the hands of the Commons. It aims to avoid MPs facing a choice between the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal or no deal, but Brexiters fear it could lead to a second referendum. Sterling could be volatile if Theresa May fails to block the amendment. We also get the latest American inflation figures. The annual US CPI is expected to rise to 2.7%, from 2.5% in May, as the cost of living accelerates. The US Federal Reserve is already expected to raise interest rates tomorrow, following a two-day meeting starting today.

Even using the less volatile rolling 12-month average, the average mortgage is still 3.8% higher than it was a year ago: So while housing affordability is perhaps not decreasing as quickly as it was two years ago, it remains a tough market to get into. The housing data suggests that for many investors, the difficulty is not worth the risk given the prospect of poor returns owing to low rental price growth and the already high house prices. And for those looking to a buy a home for themselves, it appears many are holding off, perhaps in the expectation that this slowing of the market will lead to a fall in house prices, or perhaps because while prices might be cooling now, after nearly five years of running hot while wages growth has been falling, the damage has already been done.

However higher oil prices and rising domestic cost pressures meant that the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts for inflation went up to 1.7% in both 2018 and 2019, from 1.4% previously.</p> <p>Against this backdrop the ECB felt ready to announce moves towards a less accommodative policy stance, albeit not an overtly hawkish one. Principal payments from maturing securities under the asset purchase programme will continue to be reinvested, and the forward guidance on interest rates demonstrates that the bank is planning to keep policy loose for some time. Mr Draghi added that the ECB stands ready to adjust all of its instruments if necessary.</p> <p>We had expected the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net monthly asset purchases to be reduced in the final months of 2018 and now expect a first move towards policy normalisation in 2019, with an increase in the deposit rate, and a rise in the main refinancing rate in early 2020.

Just as the days of nipping out to the local bakers every morning is a thing of the past, so too is a trip to M&amp;S for a white shirt and packet of socks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the artisanal shop looks like the future of the high street.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b223196e4b02fa070a12542\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-14T09:15:30.611Z\">10.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ian Gilmartin,</strong> head of retail &amp; wholesale at<strong> Barclays Corporate Banking,</strong> is encouraged by the jump in retail sales:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Record breaking temperatures in May had shoppers running to the tills to stock up on food and drink, with DIY and garden stores also receiving a boost from the warm weather.

                "bodyText":"The European Central Bank has shrugged off evidence of a slowdown in the eurozone and announced that it will phase out the stimulus provided by its massive three-year bond-buying programme to the eurozone economy by the end of the year, our economics editor Larry Elliott writes. Despite warning that the single currency area was going through a soft patch at a time when protectionist risks were rising, the ECB said it would wind down its bond purchases over the next six months. The ECB is currently boosting the euro zone money supply by buying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30bn of assets each month, but this will be reduced to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn a month after September and ended completely at the end of the year. The move follows strong pressure from some eurozone countries, led by Germany, that were uncomfortable about the more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.4tn of assets accumulated by the ECB since it launched its quantitative easing programme at the start of 2015. Mario Draghi, the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, said at the end of a meeting of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council in Latvia, that the QE programme had succeeded in its aim of putting inflation on course to meet its target of being below but close to 2%. Eurozone activity has accelerated markedly over the past three years, with some estimates suggesting that QE contributed 0.75 percentage points a year to the average 2.25% annual growth rate. The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement reflected the battle between hawks and doves on the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s council, with the decision on QE matched by a softening of its approach to interest rates. Draghi said there would be no prospect of an increase in the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key lending rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c currently 0.0% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c until next summer at the earliest. More here... That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have surged today, as traders take the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to end QE in their stride. In London the FTSE 100 has jumped 62 points to 7765, a gain of 0.8%. There are headier gains across Europe, as the sliding euro boosts exporters. David Madden of CMC Markets says Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge not to raise interest rates before next summer, at the earliest, cheered markets. European stocks have soared as it appears the European Central Bank (ECB) won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be hiking interest rates until at least the back end of 2019. Mario Draghi, the ECB chief, confirmed the stimulus package would be wound down in 2018, and we could see a taper of the bond buying scheme in the final quarter of this year. The update was far more dovish than some traders were expecting, and the euro sold off heavily on the back of it. The slide in the single currency prompted buying of eurozone equities. Mike Ingram, chief market strategist at WHIreland, agrees that Mario Draghi was more dovish than expected today. The pledge not to raise interest rates for at least a year has caught traders unawares. It has trumped the decision to end the bond-buying stimulus programme in December - which is why the euro has fallen, not risen, today. Ingram explains: The ECB has (conditionally) pre-committed to keeping interest rates at their current, extraordinarily low levels until at least the summer of 2019 and in any event \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcas long as necessary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This sort of language was not expected from the ECB until the end of the 2018 and was the most biggest dovish surprise for markets. Up until this point, markets had been expecting about a 40% change on an ECB rate hike in a year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. Elsewhere in the markets, some extremely strong US retail spending figures have cheered investors. US retail sales jumped by 0.8% in May, new data shows, and were up 5.9% over the past 12 months. That suggests US consumers are confident, and spending accordingly. And it means the US economy could be running faster than thought - perhaps at a sizzling annual rate of over 4%. This has driven the US dollar higher, and helped to pull the euro and pound down. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official: Greece has just unlocked the next \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn of its bailout programme, having satisfied its lenders that its meeting its targets. Over in Athens MPs have just approved the last multi-bill of reforms the country will have to take before its bailout expires this summer. It means fresh austerity and economic reforms for Greece, as our correspondent Helena Smith reports. Final results saw 154 deputies vote in favour of the draft bill \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which foresees more pension cuts, labour market regulations, health care measures and sell-offs in the energy sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and 144 against. The ballot took place in an atmosphere of growing political drama in Athens following the decision of the main opposition conservative party to call a vote of no-confidence in prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 government over its handling of the Macedonia name row, and an accord unveiled earlier this week, that will see the Slavic state being renamed the Republic of North Macedonia. Addressing parliament, Tsipras said he welcomed the motion. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Danielle Haralambous, UK Analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, on the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement and press conference: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mr Draghi acknowledged that risks from an increase in protectionism and financial market volatility had become more prominent, but maintained a relatively positive view of the outlook, brushing off signs of softer economic growth in the euro zone that prompted quite a sizeable a downward revision to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast for 2018, to 2.1% from 2.4% previously. However higher oil prices and rising domestic cost pressures meant that the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts for inflation went up to 1.7% in both 2018 and 2019, from 1.4% previously. Against this backdrop the ECB felt ready to announce moves towards a less accommodative policy stance, albeit not an overtly hawkish one. Principal payments from maturing securities under the asset purchase programme will continue to be reinvested, and the forward guidance on interest rates demonstrates that the bank is planning to keep policy loose for some time. Mr Draghi added that the ECB stands ready to adjust all of its instruments if necessary. We had expected the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net monthly asset purchases to be reduced in the final months of 2018 and now expect a first move towards policy normalisation in 2019, with an increase in the deposit rate, and a rise in the main refinancing rate in early 2020. The next rate hike will probably be delivered by the successor to Mr Draghi, whose term ends in October 2019.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jan von Gerich, chief strategist at Nordea Markets, predicts that the ECB won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raise interest rates until the end of next year: Candice Bangsund, vice president and portfolio manager at Fiera Capital, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting had something for hawks and doves. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite political turmoil in the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s periphery and a recent soft patch of economic results, the ECB has set the stage for an end of QE later this year. Indeed, for the hawks, the ECB announced that it will taper the pace of monthly asset purchases after September (from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30bn/month to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn/month) and then end the purchase program in December. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, for the doves \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ECB tempered this stance somewhat by reiterating its pledge that interest rates will remain unchanged until the back-half of 2019 (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153at least through the summer of 2019\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is slightly longer than markets were expecting.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And finally, Draghi denies that the ECB plotted against the new Italian government by stopping buying its bonds last month. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not conspiracy here, he insists. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the press conference. Q: What impact will the US tariffs, and worries about a trade war, have on the Eurozone? Draghi says that the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest economic forecasts do not include the effects of trade measures that have not been implemented yet. They only include measures that have already been imposed, and the impact of these is pretty limited. Draghi then warns that trade discussions must take place within the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153existing multilateral framework\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That is as important as the nature of the measure under discussion, Draghi says sternly. Otherwise, great damage could be caused if the multilateral framework created after the end of the second world war, and has helped create prosperity since, is undermined, he concludes. Mario Draghi is declining to give more details about when eurozone interest rates might rise from their record lows. It all depends when we achieve the necessary convergence, he says, adding tersely: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthrough the summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 meant September [2019], we would have said September\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Q: When might savers in the eurozone get some help from the ECB with an interest rate rise? Draghi hits back, saying that savers benefit from the eurozone recovery - which more than makes up from the impact of low interest rates. The balance is vastly positive, he insists. Draghi famously declared in 2012 that he would do \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhatever it takes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to save the euro. He hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lost that belief today, as he tells reporters that the euro is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcirreversible\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He points out that 340 million people live in the eurozone, and more countries want to join. Mario Draghi plays down the prospect that Italy creates a new eurozone crisis. He says there was little \u00e2\u20ac\u0153contagion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from Italy, and little \u00e2\u20ac\u0153redenomination risk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (ie, that Italy leaves the euro and returns to the lira) Draghi also plays down the political drama that unfolded in Rome this year: We have 19 countries, we are bound to have 19 elections every now and then. The important thing is that political changes are discussed within the current eurozone treaties, Draghi says. Draghi says there has been much sacrifice and struggle in the eurozone, so it is important that the achievements achieved in recent years is not destroyed. A reporter (rightly) ignores the warning not to ask about the allegations that Latvia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank chief Ilmars Rimsevics has sought bribes. Draghi refuses to comment about the case, but insists the ECB is not taking any sides. Our mantra is to be patient, prudent, and persistent, declares Draghi. He reveals that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions were unanimous. The euro is falling more sharply as traders listen to Mario Draghi explain today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now down a whole cent against the US dollar, at $1.169. The fall accelerated as Draghi warned about rising economic uncertainty, and reiterated that the ECB was in no rush to raise interest rates. A weak currency will not worry the ECB though -- it should help exporters, and keep inflation rising towards their target. Q: Why does the ECB think risks are broadly balanced? Where do you see upside risks? Draghi says there is undeniably an increased risk in global political uncertainty [a downside risk]. But on growth, Draghi predicts \u00e2\u20ac\u0153positive surprises\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the fiscal expansion in the United States, and - in the medium term - in the eurozone. Onto questions (after a warning to reporters not to mention the corruption allegations against Latvia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank governor - who isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allowed into today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference). Q: Do you expect to raise interest rates before you leave the ECB in October 2019? Draghi says the ECB governing council didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discuss when they might raise interest rates, and then adds that economic uncertainty is rising. He points out that eurozone growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2018, down from 0.7% in the last quarter of 2017. Draghi ends his statement by calling on eurozone politicians to up their game. Draghi says the implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantially stepped up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential. He also calls for eurozone countries to rebuild their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fiscal buffers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and appears to single out Italy, saying: This is particularly important in countries where government debt remains high. That looks like a warning shot to the new Italian government not to boost government spending and cut taxes. The ECB has also hiked its forecast for inflation this year and in 2019. It now expects the price of living to rise by 1.7% per year, up from 1.4% previously. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due to the higher oil price. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad news for households (although the ECB will see it as a success, as it is aiming for inflation close to 2%). Boom! The ECB has cut its forecast for growth this year. It now expects eurozone GDP to increase by 2.1% this year, down from 2.4% back in March. President Draghi says that global risks have risen in recent months, and points to rising protectionism -- a clear nudge towards Donald Trump who has imposed tariffs on European steel and aluminium makers. Growth in the eurozone economy is solid, and broad-based, Mario Draghi says. But growth had moderated due to temporary factors, he adds, such as weaker trade with the rest of the world. We stand ready to adjust all our instruments as appropriate to ensure that we meet our inflation goals, Draghi continues. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t set in stone - the ECB can change policy whenever it deems it appropriate. Mario Draghi begins by saying that the governing council undertook a careful assessment of the progress of its asset-purchase scheme, and of the inflation situation. The governing council concluded that there has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantial\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd progress towards a sustained adjustment of inflation towards the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target (of just below 2%). He confirms what we already know - that the ECB will maintain its asset purchase scheme at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30bn per month until September, then drop to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn until December, and then stop. Draghi also confirms that interest rates have been left unchanged at their record lows, and will remain there until \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at least the summer of 2019\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The ECB president declares: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy decisions maintain the current ample degree of monetary accommodation that will ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. ECB president Mario Draghi has arrived at his press conference in Riga, to explain today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions. Some history: The ECB launched its QE programme back in early 2015, as policymakers tried to fight off the threat of deflation and persistently weak growth. It began by buying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn of eurozone bonds each month -- despite opposition from some countries, such as Germany, who worried that the ECB could be monetising eurozone debt. The ECB was late to the QE party - the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve both moved much faster. But it made up for lost time by raising its bond-buying to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn per month, and extending the programme until this autumn. Having originally planned to buy \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1 trillion of bonds, the ECB has ended up expanding its balance sheet by over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.6 trillion. QE has been criticised for making the wealthy wealthier (as it pushes up asset prices). Central bankers, though, argue that it keeps unemployment down - and that politicians should address the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdistributional consequences\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of their actions (perhaps through a wealth tax). So, has QE worked? Well, inflation has finally moved close to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target and unemployment is at a 10-year low. That looks like success. Swiss bank UBS argued last week that QE actually saved the eurozone, by giving it a growth jolt at a vital time. But you could argue that policies such as QE have also fed into the rise of populist parties, and helped European politicians to put off trick decisions about eurozone integration. Historians will give their verdict eventually.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Marchel Alexandrovich, senior European economist at Jefferies, on the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The ECB takes the plunge and announces a three months taper to finish QE at the end of December (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn per month in Oct, Nov. Dec). The reinvestments commitment stays in place. And in terms of interest rates they will remain on hold until \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at least through the summer of 2019\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So the ECB is sending a signal that rates are to remain on hold for 6-9 months after QE finishes. Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last Press Conference and Q&amp;A is on 24 October 2019 (he leaves the ECB at the end of October 2019) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so the focus will now be on whether he can raise rates before he departs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Remember: Mario Draghi will explain today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision in around 20 minutes. Stay tuned! Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision is something of a surprise. Many economists had expected the ECB would delay a final decision on its QE programme until its July meeting. But instead, Mario Draghi and colleagues have bitten the bullet and decided to stop buying eurozone government bonds with newly created money. The governing council was split between hawkish members who argued that QE had run its course, and doves who worried at the eurozone economy wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t strong enough to cope without stimulus. Carsten Brzeski says the council have reached a wise compromise: You might have expected the euro to rally, on the back of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historic decision to end its huge bond-buying programme. But instead, the single currency is dropping sharply - probably because the ECB has also promised not to raise interest rates for some time. The euro is now down 0.5% against the US dollar at $1.173. In another important move, the ECB has also pledged to keep interest rates unchanged until at least the middle of next year. That means the headline cost of borrowing will probably remain at zero for many months to come. Banks will continue to be charged a negative interest rate of -0.4%, in an attempt to get them lending. The ECB says: The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remains aligned with the current expectations of a sustained adjustment path. NEWSFLASH: The European Central Bank has decided to end its bond-buying stimulus programme! The ECB has decided to halve the pace of its QE programme after September to just \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn per month, from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30bn per month at present. And then it will stop buying new bonds altogether at December. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a significant move; the ECB has decided that it can finally take away the punch bowl of easy money and ultra-loose monetary policy. The ECB says: At today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, which was held in Riga, the Governing Council of the ECB undertook a careful review of the progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, also taking into account the latest Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, measures of price and wage pressures, and uncertainties surrounding the inflation outlook. Based on this review the Governing Council made the following decisions: As regards non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council will continue to make net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) at the current monthly pace of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30 billion until the end of September 2018. The Governing Council anticipates that, after September 2018, subject to incoming data confirming the Governing Council\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s medium-term inflation outlook, the monthly pace of the net asset purchases will be reduced to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15 billion until the end of December 2018 and that net purchases will then end. More to follow! Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting is in Riga, as part of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy of taking the governing council around the eurozone. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not great timing, as Latvia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank governor instead fighting corruption allegations and is barred by national authorities from even entering the central bank #awkward Tension is mounting in the markets as we await the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision on monetary policy, in under 25 minutes time. As explained earlier, traders are desperate to know whether the ECB has taken a decision on its bond-buying stimulus programme, which is due to expire in September. The meeting comes at a fascinating time. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new populist government getting to work in Italy, trade war tensions growing among G7 members, and some signs that the eurozone economy has entered a softer patch just as inflation picks up. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group, says the ECB has a lot on its plate. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Usually hints on policy come from anonymous \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcECB sources\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision by the chief economist, Peter Praet, to go on manoeuvres and make statements about the QE programme could represent a major shift. It looks like the bank is prepared to discuss moving towards an end date for its QE programme, even if that end-date is still further away than many expect. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To give the ECB its due, it does look like the eurozone recovery is firmly in place. As we discussed here, the eurozone economy is still seeing increased strength, with unemployment falling overall and consumer spending rising, and even recent weakness in the composite PMI is not necessarily a cause for concern given the overall strength of the past year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation has also begun to pick up, with CPI rising to 1.9% for May, close to the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. Sustained price growth above this level has yet to be seen, but the overall trend is still higher from the lows of early 2016. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more political drama in Greece; the opposition has called a no-confidence vote! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s related to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Macedonia issue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Earlier this week, the tiny Balkan state agreed to rename itself as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Republic of North Macedonia\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd following negotiations with Greece (whose territory includes the province of Macedonia). Macedonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president then pulled the plug on the deal, arguing that too many concessions had been made to Greece. But the Greek opposition also criticised the deal, given the importance of Macedonia (Alexander the Great and all that) in its history. Back in the eurozone, Greek MPs are preparing to vote today on the last omnibus bill of reforms-for-rescue funds the debt-stricken country must take before its current bailout ends. Helena Smith reports from Athens: After being the focus of parliamentary debate for much of the week, the multi-bill will be voted on this afternoon. This will be the last time MPs are called to pass deeply unpopular reforms, or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprior actions,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 demanded of Athens if it is to successfully complete its last inspection review in time to exit the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third bailout in August. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taken the best part of a decade but never again will they have to vote on pension cuts, labour market reforms and energy sector privatisations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all outlined in the bill \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to secure the funds needed to keep Greece afloat. Unions are NOT missing the chance to take to the streets in protest with a barrage of strikes being announced to coincide with the vote. Public sector workers have already begun amassing for a march on parliament. The leftist-led government, however , is keen to rush through the legislation so that euro area finance ministers can begin discussing debt relief at their next meeting on June 21st. Addressing MPs, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos insisted Greece would not be needing further aid in the form of a precautionary credit line when the foreign funds officially expire. The governor of the Bank of Greece, Yannis Stournaras, has openly opposed that view saying a credit line \u00e2\u20ac\u0153even if never used\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is essential to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-bailout return to normality. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There will not be a precautionary credit line so that you can call it a fourth memorandum,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tsakalotos told opposition MPs earlier this week using the official term used to describe Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout programs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What there will be is a system of enhanced surveillance without preconditions, without money and without other measures.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics editor Larry Elliott on the recovery in UK retail sales last month: Better weather brought some much-needed respite to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling retail sector last month as the hottest May on record brought consumers flocking back to the high street. The volume of goods sold in shops and online was 1.3% up on April \u00e2\u20ac\u201c comfortably beating predictions in the financial markets of a 0.5% increase. The Office for National Statistics said feedback from retailers suggested that a hot, dry spell and royal wedding celebrations boosted spending in supermarkets and household goods stores during the month. Annual growth in retail sales picked up sharply from 1.4% to 1.9%, although the ONS said that was partly due to a weak month for consumer spending in May 2017. In the three months to May \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a better guide to the trend than one month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data \u00e2\u20ac\u201c retail sales volumes rose by 0.9%. The latest three-month period includes both the weakness caused by the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beast from the east\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd cold snap and the more recent bounce back in consumer spending. Samuel Tombs, of PantheonMacro, said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The jump in retail sales in May has all the hallmarks of a weather-related blip, rather than a sustainable pick-up in spending. Overall growth was boosted by sharp increases in sales of clothing, sporting goods and garden items, up 1.7%, 3.3% and 6.2% month-to-month, respectively. The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Alpesh Paleja, is also worried about the underlying trends in UK retail: Jacob Nell, Morgan Stanley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief UK economist, cautions that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153idiosyncratic factors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - including sunny weather and the Royal Wedding - flattered UK retail sales last month. But still, the growth was broad-based: The jump in retail sales last month is encouraging, but it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high street out of trouble. So argues Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, who points to the relentless advance of internet shopping: Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive report from the ONS, news from individual companies continues to paint a somewhat gloomy picture for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bricks-and-mortar retailers. House of Fraser and Poundworld are the latest names to run into trouble. With the most recent set of numbers from online fashion retailer boohoo.com showing a 49% jump in UK sales, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not difficult to work out where those high street customers have been going. Ted Baker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results earlier this week were notable for showing some positive growth, but even that was driven by a 33.6% increase in online sales. However, a good result from the UK wholesale business suggests that Ted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s higher price point and quirky style are helping to insulate it from the worst of the downturn. That supports our belief that the names that survive the current turbulence will be those that treat high street shopping as a pastime rather than an essential. Just as the days of nipping out to the local bakers every morning is a thing of the past, so too is a trip to M&amp;S for a white shirt and packet of socks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the artisanal shop looks like the future of the high street. Ian Gilmartin, head of retail &amp; wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, is encouraged by the jump in retail sales: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Record breaking temperatures in May had shoppers running to the tills to stock up on food and drink, with DIY and garden stores also receiving a boost from the warm weather. The really encouraging aspect to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures is the breadth of positive data, with growth posted across the different parts of the retail sector. We shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get carried away as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still very tough out there, but the truth is that despite continued rumours of the demise of our retail industry, many retailers are simply getting on with the job and continuing to attract customers through their doors. Football fever could give retailers another lift, he adds: Of course, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to have a heatwave and a Royal Wedding to help drive sales every month, but the World Cup kick off should help supermarkets in particular maintain this momentum over the next month or so.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The recent pick-up in UK wages may also be driving retail sales higher, suggests Chris Williamson of Markit. The unexpectedly strong UK retail sales figures have sent the pound sharply higher. Sterling is up 0.5% at $1.344, as traders predict that an August interest rate hike is more likely. More on the Meghan and Harry effect from the ONS: Food stores provided a positive contribution to growth with supermarkets commenting on good sales in celebration of the Royal Wedding during good weather. Newsflash: UK retail sales were stronger than expected in May, new figures from the Office for National Statistics show. Sales volumes jumped by 1.3% compared to April, smashing forecasts of a 0.3% rise. On an annual basis, the amount sold by retailers jumped by 3.9%, with growth across the board: The ONS says there are two factors - good weather in May, and the Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle (now the Duchess of Sussex). This encouraged spending on food (all those Royal Wedding BBQs?) and on household goods. Retail sales had been suppressed by the bad weather earlier in the year, when ice and snow kept shoppers off the streets. Things seem to be improving now, though, with sales rising in line with temperatures: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB meeting is the first since Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new coalition government was sworn in, and began announcing policies that could breach Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget rules. A clash is brewing between Brussels and Rome, even though Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new finance minister has insisted the country is committed to the euro. The ECB is often accused of being too political -- Mario Draghi regularly chides elected politicians to implement structural reforms. But on this occasion, the governing council may be keen to take its big decisions on QE before a crisis blows up. Bank of America Merrill Lynch say: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We believe the ECB may be in a hurry to close the QE chapter,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think this is essentially political, as the ECB would not want its monetary policy to be affected by claims of supporting or conversely impairing the new policy course in Italy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Economists and investors are split over whether the European Central Bank will make a decision about its stimulus programme today, or kick the can down the road to July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mereting. Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada predicts the ECB will have an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153active debate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about whether to let its QE programme expire in September. However, she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the final decision until July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, adding: The other point of focus should be the updated staff forecasts, and in particular the 2020 inflation forecast (currently at 1.7%). We look for an upward revision, which would be positive for the euro \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though unclear whether that will be enough given yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally. The first hike is currently priced for June 2019 but with the deposit rate [on bank deposits at the ECB] at -0.4%, there is a long way to go to get to neutral. Draghi will almost certainly be grilled on the Italian situation in the Q&amp;A but we doubt that he will let himself be drawn in. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management suggests we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a major announcement from the ECB today: ECB President Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extensive rehabilitation to overcome an addiction to easing seems to have paid off. There are hopes of either 1) an announcement of the timetable to end bond buying, or 2) an announcement of an announcement of the timetable to end bond buying. Marchel Alexandrovich, senior european economist at Jefferies, says investors want to know more than just the end-date of QE: After more than three years of QE, and against the background of what Peter Praet judges to be improving inflation dynamics, the ECB is preparing to end its net asset purchases. Whether the formal announcement comes this week, or in July (our guess), and what profile the taper will take (a straight 3 months drawdown to zero, or something more creative) are the immediate questions. But at this point in the process, a few months and a few extra billion in purchases either way are not crucial; the markets are more focused on how the ECB amends its interest rate guidance, any technical changes around bond reinvestments and whether Draghi delivers a relatively dovish taper by leaving the door open to the possibility of restarting the programme if the recovery were to splutter. European stock markets are in the red this morning, as central banks hog the headlines. The FTSE 100 dropped nearly 50 points at the open (-0.6%) and there are similar losses in Frankfurt, Paris, Milan and Madrid: This follows a down day on Wall Street, where the Dow lost 119 points to 25,201 points last night. Traders are worried that the Federal Reserve will raise US interest rates too aggressively over the next 18 months. The Fed is now forecasting four hikes in 2018 (we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had two already) and three in 2019. That would take borrowing costs up to 3.25%. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor, explains: As Fed chairman Jerome Powell acknowledges, the risk remains that officials overcook it and bring an end to the Trump trade once and for all. Achieving the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnot too fast, not too slow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Goldilocks approach to monetary policy will be key to extending the equities bull run. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. All eyes are on Riga as the European Central Bank weighs up whether to pull the plug on its stimulus programme, despite signs that the eurozone recovery is slowing. The ECB governing council faces a tricky decision as it holds its monetary policy meeting in Latvia today. Its huge bond-buying stimulus programme runs out in September, so policymakers must decide whether to call time - or extend the scheme into 2019. The ECB has bought more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.5 trillion bonds under its quantitative easing (QE) programme, in an attempt to fight off deflation. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently committed to buying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30bn per month until September. Hawks on the council believe the scheme has run its course, and would like to pull the plug. But, with growth slowing in the eurozone - particularly in Germany - and geopolitical tensions growing, the ECB may be reluctant to turn off the QE tap. A decision could be delayed until July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, but at the very least the governing council must discuss the issue today. They must tread cautiously, or risk spooking the markets and triggering a sell-off. Traders will be keen to hear Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views at the press conference following the decision. President Draghi should expect questions on trade war fears, and the new government in Italy. Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADS Securities, explains: The stakes are high for the ECB President, and for many people he has to send a message that the European central bank is planning to end its asset purchases\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 program and the date to start that has to be September. There has been a lot of chatter leading up to this meeting and if, for whatever reason, Draghi fails to deliver what investors expect then the euro will be in trouble. The ECB will also release its latest growth and inflation projections, which will help determine what they do today. Whatever the ECB decides, they are lagging far behind their counterparts across the Atlantic. Last night the US Federal Reserve vote to raise American interest rates to 2%, and signalled that it expects two more hikes this year. Fed chair Jerome Powell insisted that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy can handle higher borrowing costs, declaring: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decision you see today is another sign the US economy is in great shape. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Growth is strong, labour markets are strong, inflation is close to target.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Also coming up It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a tough few months for UK retailers, with tens of thousands of job cuts and several chains shutting down. So the latest UK retail sales figures, due this morning, could be interesting. Economists predict growth slowed to 0.3% in May, down from 1.3% in April Plus, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bad day for Rolls-Royce workers as the engineering firm announces thousand of job cuts.

Thank you for reading the blog and for all your comments. Have a great weekend and please join us again on Monday. The bell has gone on Wall Street and US markets are down: Dow Jones: -0.5% at 25,047 S&amp;P 500: -0.3% at 2,774 Nasdaq: -0.4% at 7,727 It hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken Beijing long to respond to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to impose a 25% tariff on $50bn of Chinese imports. As expected, it plans to retaliate. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commerce department has issued a statement: China is unwilling to have a trade war, but the Chinese side has no choice but to strongly oppose this, due to the United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 myopic behaviour that will harm both parties. We will immediately introduce tariff measures of the same scale and strength. All the results from the previously reached by the two parties will be invalid. US investors are feeling nervous after President Trump announced plans to slap a 25% tariff on $50bn of Chinese imports. China has promised to retaliate in equal measure, raising the prospect of a full-blown trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies, and that is weighing on sentiment. Peter Cardillo, economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York: It has gotten investors nervous. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to probably mean a cautious and bumpy ride for the stock markets. US futures are all trading lower. The opening bell rings in less than 10 minutes. Speaking on Fox News, President Trump said that he regarded China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s President Xi Jinping as a friend, but it was time to take action to reduce America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit. Look, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my friend. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a wonderful guy, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great guy. But at some point we have to straighten it out. President Trump has just made his way down to the Fox News base outside the White House for an unscheduled interview. Among the various subjects covered are the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very big tariffs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the US will impose on $50bn of Chinese exports. Trump said: The trade war was started many years ago by them and the United States lost It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official. Donald Trump has given the green light to a 25% tariff on $50bn of goods imported from China. The tariffs will apply to a total of 1,102 products and will be divided into two parts, the White House has confirmed. The first set of tariffs will apply to $34bn of Chinese imports, on 818 product lines, effective from 6 July. The second set will apply to $16bn of imports, on 284 product lines. More soon. The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to cut the maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) from \u00c2\u00a3100 to \u00c2\u00a32 will not take effect until 2020, it has emerged. Tom Watson, deputy leader of the Labour Party and shadow culture secretary, said the government was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pathetic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after bookmakers persuaded the government to delay the introduction of the new rules. He added: Capitulating to a two-year delay is a pathetic move from a fundamentally weak government. Those who praised the government when the announcement was made will feel badly let down. They are already rolling back on their promises and allowing these machines to ruin more lives. Gamblers stand to lose an extra \u00c2\u00a34bn in the intervening period, based on the average \u00c2\u00a31.8bn a year in revenues taken by the machines, which critics say are highly addictive and allow huge losses to rack up quickly. Read our full story here: Craig Erlam at currency firm Oanda, says the prospect of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are causing a market wobble. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a relatively mixed start to trading in Europe on Friday and the US is on course to post small losses at the open, as the focus shifts from central banks back to trade. US President Donald Trump is expected to announce tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports today that will once again stoke fears of a trade war and protectionist policies and likely trigger a response from the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy. Trump has been picking fights with a number of countries on trade in an attempt to address the large deficit the US runs and China is clearly his primary target. Markets will always be vulnerable to trade spats between countries and while the response to the G7 meeting may have been quite muted, that is more likely a sign that such an outcome was in line with expectations than markets becoming less sensitive to it. The biggest concern here is naturally that this will continue to escalate and more and more counter-tariffs will be imposed, something that will harm all economies and weigh on investor sentiment. Investors across Europe are feeling less chirpy as they await confirmation of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to impose tariffs on $50bn of Chinese imports.

Here is how May annual inflation rates compare across the EU: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign ministry has said this morning that Beijing will respond swiftly to any US tariffs, as Donald Trump prepares to unveil revisions to his initial tariff list targeting $50 billion of Chinese goods. The euro is heading for its biggest weekly loss in 19 months after Mario Draghi, president of the ECB, said there would be no rate hike in the eurozone until after the summer of 2019. The currency is up 0.2% against the dollar at $1.1591, but on track for the worst week since November 2016. McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is the latest company to ditch plastic straws, with plans to them with the paper version in all its UK and Ireland restaurants from September. The fast food giant currently uses 1.8 million straws a day in the UK, and said it was responding to what customers wanted by moving away from the single-use plastic straw. Companies are under mounting pressure to find alternatives to single use plastic products that are polluting the oceans and harming wildlife.

Over the past few months we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been working closely with supplier partners to find a solution that works both for our customers, and that the supply is there given the size of our business. The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambitious plans, combined with strong customer opinion, has helped to accelerate the move away from plastic and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m proud that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been able to play our part in helping to achieve this societal change. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says Tesco had managed to shrug off the malaise facing the wider retail sector: Tesco had a confident start to the year, despite the Beast from the East, and maintained its sales momentum into a tenth consecutive quarter. The recently acquired Booker business flaunted a sparking performance in the first few months of the year, and is already looking like a nice little growth engine for Tesco. Booker is now benefiting from the Tesco distribution network, a good example of how [chief executive] Dave Lewis intends to wring \u00c2\u00a3200 million of annual synergies out of combining the two businesses. Tesco is one of the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top performer this morning, at a near four-year high of 255p. Tesco shares are up 2% this morning at a near four-year high of 255p. Investors have been cheered by the news that sales at the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest supermarket rose for a 10th consecutive quarter in the 13 weeks to 26 May (Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first quarter). Sales at stores open for more than a year rose 1.8%, as trading improved after the snow disruption of the beginning of the period. Tesco completed the \u00c2\u00a34bn takeover of Booker, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest wholesaler, in March. Dave Lewis, Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, gave his assessment: Our growth plans are on track and we are pleased with the momentum in the business. We remain well-placed to serve our customers better and deliver on our medium-term financial ambitions. We are delighted with initial progress on Booker, and are focused on delivering the synergy benefits that our merger brings. Trading is underway in Europe and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mixed picture so far. Markets were boosted on Thursday by the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revelation that it would phase out its bond-buying programme by the end of this year. Investors continue to digest the move - which came earlier than expected - this morning. As it stands, European shares are on course for their best week in more than three months. Here are the latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,771 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: 0.3% at 13,142 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.4% at 5,551 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.3% at 22,416 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.2% at 9,936 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.2% at 394 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The prospect of a trade world between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies is back in the spotlight as Donald Trump is expected to say today that he will press ahead with tariffs on $50bn of Chinese imports. Trump gave the green light at a meeting of his top trade advisors on Thursday. Reuters reports: Trump is due to unveil revisions to his initial tariff list targeting $50 billion of Chinese goods on Friday. The list will contain 800 product categories, down from 1,300 previously. Trump no longer believes that Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s influence over North Korea is a compelling reason to ease up on trade talks now that his administration has opened up a direct line of communication with the nuclear-armed country, [an] administration official said. Beijing has reiterated that it will respond \u00e2\u20ac\u0153appropriately\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to any measures imposed by the US. Also coming up Tesco has reported a 1oth consecutive quarter of rising sales, despite snow disruption at the beginning of the period and a gloomy consumer backdrop. More on that soon.

The wake-up call here should be for BP itself, now that it has correctly realised that the power sector is not cutting emissions fast enough to stop dangerous levels of climate change (despite solar-panel installations doubling in a year). BP only has two major routes towards decarbonisation. One is to produce less oil and more gas, which it is already doing.

                "bodyText":"The escalation of the potential trade war between the US and China following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat of new tariffs on $200bn worth of goods has sent a shudder through the markets. With Wall Street lower - and the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing all its gains so far this year - European markets have ended the day in downbeat mood. The FTSE 100 was among the better performers, helped ironically by sterling hitting a seven month low. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 0.36% or 27.48 points to 7603.85 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.22% to 12,677.97 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.1% at 5390.63 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.07% to 22,084.33 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.14% lower at 9755.4 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 342 points or 1.37%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. More on Navarro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, from Associated Press: The White House is not planning any imminent talks with China on the trade dispute, the FT is reporting (\u00c2\u00a3). Peter Navarro, a senior US trade adviser told reporters on a press call that China had been given a chance to address US complaints over the past year, and no more discussions were planned. The prospect of US mid-term elections could determine how the trade dispute plays out, with some suggesting Trump will continue to play hardball to prove to the voters that he is still putting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153America first.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But this could backfire. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said: The only potential stop for Trump could be the reality of mid term elections. A large percentage of the US population are not going to be happy about paying more for imported goods. This is a long shot and still sufficient time away for damage to the markets to continue, however it could also prevent this trade war from spiralling out of control. Here are some major US companies with trade links to China: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the market losses following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s escalation of the trade dispute with China: US stock markets fell sharply on Tuesday morning, following similar drops across the world, as investors feared that escalating tensions could trigger an international trade war. Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional $200bn in levies on Chinese goods on Monday evening, days after the US announced $50bn in tariffs aimed at punishing what the US administration sees as unfair trade practices. China has already said it will retaliate for last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move and said it would escalate its response if further tariffs were imposed. Monday night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move sent global stock markets sharply lower and the Dow followed suit when it opened, dropping over 340 points (1.37%) in early trading. The S&amp;P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq also fell close to 1%. Some of the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest exporters were among those most affected. Boeing dropped 3% and construction and mining equipment maker Caterpillar shed 2.7%. Tech companies, too, felt the pinch with Apple down 1.5%. The full story is here: US markets continue to fall, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down more than 400 points or 1.6%. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: There was no let up on Tuesday, the US open extending the disastrous trading that began on Monday. Plunging 400 points to hit a 2 week nadir, the Dow Jones was the latest index to display its abject terror at the trade war Donald Trump seems intent on provoking. The Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s day was made worse by the strength of the dollar; though the greenback struggled against the yen, it stomped all over the euro and the pound, sending the single currency and sterling to 19 day and 7 month lows respectively. Over in the Eurozone, where political issues in Germany cut the legs out from under the region on Monday, the situation was just as nasty. The DAX shed 200 points for the 2nd consecutive session, leaving it on track for its worst close since the start of May, while the CAC lost 1.5%. It was cable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.6% fall that arguably helped the FTSE avoid the kind of gory losses seen by its US and Eurozone peers. Though hardly something to celebrate, the UK index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.5% decline was nevertheless half of its post-open drop, and roughly a third of the losses incurred elsewhere. Emerging markets are also under pressure as the fears of a trade war grow. A US tech industry group is very unhappy about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned tariffs, saying they raise prices for Americans, harm US competitiveness, and will hinder economic growth. Jose Castaneda, spokesman for the Information Technology Industry Council, said: The Trump Administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to escalate trade tensions with China is irresponsible and counterproductive. We appreciate President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to protect the United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccrown jewels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but tariffs are simply the wrong way to do it. Tariffs will harm U.S. workers and businesses from Silicon Valley to Silicon Prairie. The White House needs to work with our allies to create lasting change with China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c too many jobs and livelihoods are at stake to get this wrong. A trade war which would benefit no one may not actually happens, says Chris Payne, managing director at GWM Investment Management: Despite all this tit-for-tat posturing, an all-out trade war is unlikely to ensue because it will not benefit anybody, especially China whose economy is going through a major deleveraging process. It should also be noted that China will soon run out of US goods on which to impose retaliatory tariffs which will move this negotiation to a more sensible and constructive forum. Although as noted previously, China could slap higher tariffs than 10% if it really wanted to push back at Trump. Fears of an escalation in the trade tensions between the US and China have sent US markets sharply lower at the open. President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose a 10% tariff on $200m of Chinese goods has led to new warnings from Beijing that it would retaliate. So the growing prospect of an all out trade war, and the damage that would cause to the global economy, has sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down around 1.3% in early trading. This means the Dow has given up all its gains of the year. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have also opened in the red. Meanwhile the Vix index of volatility hit a two week high of 14.67 before recovering to 14.18, still up 15% on the day so far. Time for a recap, as investors brace for the Wall Street open, in just over 10 minutes. Stock markets around the globe are suffering losses after Donald Trump took another step towards a trade war. Overnight, Trump instructed US officials to draw up plans for tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports, in the latest tit-for-tat move between the two countries. Trump said he was acting because China had outlined $50bn of tariffs on US products over the weekend [a response to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original tariffs laid out earlier this year]. China hit back, accusing the US of blackmail. The Commerce Ministry declared: This practice of extreme pressure and blackmail deviates from the consensus reached by two parties through many negotiations, and it also disappointed the international community. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the U.S. side becomes irrational and issues the list, China will have to adopt measures that are comprehensive measures in quantity and quality in order to make strong countermeasures.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The move rocked markets in Asia, sending Chinese stocks reeling to their lowest level since summer 2016. Equities in other regions also fell, as investors dumped riskier assets and economists warned a trade war would hurt growth. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 slumped by 80 points at the open, but has currently clawed back half of those losses. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the situation: FTSE 100: down 0.5% German DAX: Down 1.2% French CAC: down 1.1% Japanese Nikkei: closed down 1.8% Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng: closed down 2.8% China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite: closed down 3.8% Commodities, such as oil, wheat and soybeans, have also fallen. There is also drama in the foreign exchange markets, with most currencies falling against the US dollar. Sterling has fallen through $1.32 for the first time since November 2017. Analysts fear that the world could be heading towards a trade war, unless the US and China can ratchet the pressure down again. Miles Eakers, Chief Market Analyst at global payments firm Centtrip, says investors are right to worry. Any retaliation by Beijing is likely to fuel the escalating trade war with Washington, which will in turn have a negative impact on equities and increase risk aversion. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors are not the only ones troubled by the current situation. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest superpowers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shift towards protectionism has global ramifications. International companies may grow less competitive due to tariffs and the cost of raw materials purchased overseas could rise by 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c20%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly possible that any further action from the US or China could put an end to the current 10-year bull market run.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yuan has fallen to its lowest level against the U.S. dollar in more than five months today, as trade tensions escalated between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. Reuters has the details: The yuan opened onshore trade at 6.4450 per dollar, and weakened to a low of 6.4754 at one point. It ended at 6.4743 by the official close of domestic trading in the late afternoon, the weakest such close since Jan.11. If it ends the late night session at the same level, it would have lost nearly 0.6 percent against the dollar for the day, its worst daily performance since Jan.6, 2017. Beijing controls the value of the yuan closely, which means it could use its currency to retaliate against America. A weaker yuan makes Chinese exports more attractive overseas, so could mediate the impact of tariffs. That might infuriate Donald Trump, though, who already thinks the yuan is unfairly weak..... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve put together a Q&amp;A on the US-China trade dispute: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Why is Trump imposing the tariffs? During the 2016 election campaign, Trump promised to protect American jobs and to renegotiate US trade deficits with countries around the world. The US has the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest trade deficit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning it buys more goods and services from other countries than it sells overseas \u00e2\u20ac\u201c worth $568bn last year. China is responsible for the bulk of the deficit in terms of goods, exporting $376bn more to the US than it bought from US producers. Raymond Ma, portfolio manager at Fidelity International, predicts that the trade battle between the US and China will hurt company profits - which likely leads to weaker wage growth and more job cuts. Ma warns that the situation could escalate further: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest development suggests the recent d\u00c3\u00a9tente in US-China trade talks has slipped. Indeed, recent months have seen economic relations between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies in a dance best characterised as two steps backwards for every step forwards. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The concern now is how China could retaliate against President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest action by increasing its own reciprocal tariffs. Such a move could push up input prices, which may prompt Chinese companies to either pass on the increased costs to consumers or allow them to eat into profits; neither outcome is favourable. Commodity prices are also sliding today. Oil is down 1.5%, sending the cost of a barrel of US crude down by one dollar to $64.87. That reflects concerns that a trade war would damage economic growth, leading to less demand for energy. US cotton and soybeans futures both fell by 2.5%, as traders calculate that American farmers could lose out badly. Last weekend, China announced retaliatory tariffs on US exports such as electric cars, soybeans and whiskey, in response to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original $50bn of tariffs -- a move that triggered Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new threat against $200bn of Chinese goods and services. The US stock market is expected to fall sharply when trading begins at 9.30am New York time (2.30pm BST). America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones industrial average is being called down 330 points, or 1.3%, as traders react to the latest twists in the trade spat between the US and China. Craig Erlam of financial trading firm OANDA says risk aversion is rising fast: With China showing no desire to be bullied into submission, with its Commerce Ministry promising to retaliate to any new tariffs and its Foreign Ministry reaffirming that while it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a trade war, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not afraid to engage in one, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to see how and when this ends. Moreover, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to fully grasp just how much damage will be done in the process, particularly with the European Union also drawing up counter-tariffs against the US. The clear escalation that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s occurred in recent days has shaken investors and appears to brought an end to the good run that US stock markets had been on since the start of May. While Chinese stocks are faring much worse at the moment, US companies are obviously not immune to a trade war and could come under more pressure unless both sides find a solution. The US dollar has hit its highest level in almost a year, as traders scramble to protect themselves from a trade war. The US dollar index (which measures the greenback against a basket of other currencies) has gained 0.5% today to levels last seen in July. Obviously the pound is one casualty, but the damage is wide-spread; the euro is down 0.6% at $1.155, the Australian dollar is down 0.8%, the Swedish krona shed 1.4% and the Indian rupee lost 0.5%. At first glance that may seem odd; if America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy will be hurt by tariffs, why is the dollar attractive? Answer: tariffs will drive US inflation up, forcing more interest rate rises to control the cost of living, making the dollar a higher-yielding asset. This capital flight out of emerging markets will cause serious pain. Any developing-market company which has issued debt in dollars, but earns revenue in its local currency, faces higher repayment costs. Emerging market policymakers may also be forced to hike interest rates to prop up their currencies, which will damage economic growth. Analyst group Oxford Economics has estimate that economic growth in the US and China would suffer a hit if reciprocal tariffs are imposed: They say: By threatening to impose 10% tariff on an additional US$200 billion of imports from China, President Trump has upped the ante on the trade conflict between the two. China has quickly vowed to retaliate - and if such an escalation does materialise, it would have significant economic impact on China, the US and the rest of the world, at a sensitive time for the global economy. In principle, there is still room for negotiation and we cannot rule out de-escalation in the coming weeks. But attitudes seem to be hardening. Meanwhile, deeper conflicts are also hard to resolve. Indeed, it looks like the probability of a full-blown trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies is rising. In terms of economic impacts, we estimate that 25% US tariffs on US$50 billion plus 10% tariffs on US$200 billion worth of imports from China, with one-to-one retaliation by China, would reduce real GDP growth in China and the US by about 0.3 percentage points and 0.2 percentage points, respectively, in 2019-20. Seema Shah, Senior Global Investment Strategist at Principal Global Investors, fears that the global economy will suffer as China and the US march towards a trade war. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest escalation in trade tensions between China and the United States should have investors worried. Recall that the original tariffs on about US $50 billion worth of Chinese imports motivated sharp declines in equity markets, despite not being expected to have a meaningful impact on the global economy. The latest ratcheting up in the trade dispute may trigger even more severe market turmoil. After all, not only will this latest round of tariffs have a direct negative impact on China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth outlook and the rest of the Asia region via the integration of global value chains, but China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inevitable retaliation will surely hurt the U.S. economy in turn. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Emerging markets have had to contend with a long line of challenges this year. Rising U.S. interest rates, the strengthening U.S. dollar and higher oil prices have already made it a tough six months, and this lurch towards protectionism will be felt most acutely in already vulnerable emerging market economies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Several experts are warning today that the US and China are heading towards a full-blooded trade war. With Trump threatening a swathe of fresh tariffs, and Beijing vowing to retaliate, the situation is escalating fast. Professor Davide Castellani, professor of international business at Henley Business School, warns that China could hurt large American firms, potentially turning US public opinion against the tariffs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The risk of an all-out trade war between the US and China is becoming more and more concrete. Both parties do not want to back down, because they would signal to the other party that they could use the threat of trade war in the future to further their negotiation position. However, in the long run, the US policy position may be weaker, since they are up for mid-term elections soon. When the effects of tariffs will unfold with higher prices for US consumers and possible disruptions in value chains, due to higher costs for intermediate inputs, the mood towards tariffs in the US might change. China is much less vulnerable to this threat, due to the nature of its political system. On top of this, China may resort to more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcqualitative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 measures that could make business more difficult for US firms in China. This will put further pressure on US Congress and Administration from large US MNEs [multi-national enterprises]. Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit in Singapore, warns that manufacturers across Asia could suffer badly from a US-China trade dispute. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The collateral damage from an escalating U.S.-China trade war will be widespread, hitting many Asian countries that are part of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing supply chain in sectors such as electrical and electronic products. Sean Callow, senior currency strategist at Australian bank Westpac, says investors are getting anxious: We are starting to see signs of deepening market concern now that we can effectively confirm that a bilateral trade war is under way between the US and China. There seems little doubt that the prevailing mood in global markets is that investors were a lot happier with US economic policy in 2017 when it was focused on tax cuts than in 2018 when it has switched to trade protectionism. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory bosses fear that fresh tariffs on Chinese imports will cost jobs. Kip Eideberg of the Association of Equipment Manufacturers says Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest threat is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrible news for equipment manufacturers in the United States\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He also points out that consumers will pay the price too: Trade war fears and Brexit uncertainty have combined to drag the pound down to a seven-month low. Sterling has dropped by half a cent against the US dollar to $1.319, the lowest since November 2016. Other currencies are also dropping against the US dollar, as traders seek a safe-haven asset. But the pound is also suffering from political angst; UK PM Theresa May faces a fresh showdown with rebel MPs who are demanding a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153meaningful vote\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit deal with the EU. Fiona Cincotta, Senior Market Analyst at City Index, says May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political challenges are hurting sterling: The dollar was one of the few assets benefiting from the Sino-US tensions and rose against a basket of currencies. The pound, however, was bogged down by domestic problems and declined below $1.32 for the first time since November. Theresa May continues to struggle to get any Brexit-related decision approved by the Parliament and a vote by the Lords is about to make her life even more difficult because it will require that the Commons approve any Brexit deal reached between the government and Brussels. Our Politics Live blog is tracking all the action: Asian tech firms who supply components to Apple have been hit hard today, due to fears that a trade war would hurt demand. Marketwatch has the details: IPhone-camera maker Cowell Holdings skidded 11.5% in Hong Kong to fresh record lows, while smartphone-lens maker Sunny Optical pulled back a further 5% and acoustics firm AAC Technologies fell 3.3%. In Taiwan, Sunny peer Largan Precision was off 5.2%. Apple product assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry dropped 2.3%. The selloff came despite a report that the Trump administration has told Apple that tariffs would not be placed on iPhones imported from China. CEO Tim Cook had told the White House that imposing tariffs against Chinese goods could hurt Apple. American consumers will feel the pain if Trump imposes 10% tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports, as he threatened last night. As Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale explains, such tariffs would be paid by customers in the US: $200bn of goods represents over a third of likely 2018 imports from China. The important point to note about the escalation, which will surely result in a Chinese response, is that while the tariffs imposed may be lower on the expanded range of goods, they will include more consumer goods, and therefore have a more direct impact on US consumers apart from anyone else. Away from the political implications, these tariffs will deliver higher prices to the US and weaker growth to China. In due course we will find out how Chinese policy-makers respond Asian stocks have hit a six-month low today, Bloomberg reports: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has suffered a late rout, as investors in Shanghai shivered at the prospect of fresh US tariffs. The benchmark Shanghai composite sank by 3.8% percent to close below the 3,000 mark at 2,906.43. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest level since late June 2016. Reuters reports that speculators were badly hit by the selloff: The slump risks triggering fresh margin calls in a highly-leveraged stock market, potentially causing a downward spiral that could derail Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to lure the listings of high-tech giants. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market is so fragile. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where the bottom is,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said David Dai, general manager of Shanghai Wisdom Investment Co Ltd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more rewarding watching the World Cup.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Elsewhere, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei ended down 1.7% while the Hong Kong Hang Seng index lose 2.8% European stock markets are a sea of red, as trade war fears ripple through the trading floors. DING DING: Shares are falling sharply in London at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 index of top shares has shed 1%, or 80 points, to 7551 - the lowest level since the start of May. The mood in the City is decidedly edgy, as traders worry that Donald Trump will trigger a full-blown trade war with China - with serious consequences for the global economy. Mining stocks are among the big fallers, with Anglo American losing 3% and Glencore down 2.6%. Technology firm Micro Focus has also shed almost 3%. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: Global sentiment is on the back foot amid signs that neither side will back down, potentially taking global commerce a step closer to an unwelcome trade war. It is impossible for China to retaliate in kind to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new threat. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because China imported $170bn from America in 2016 -- $115bn of goods and $55bn of services. So by threatening to impose 10% tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods, Trump is (deliberately?) putting a tit-for-tat response out of Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reach. However, China could technically impose a higher tariff on that $170bn, which would certainly escalate the situation even further. Simon Rabinovitch of The Economists explains: Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat has met with an immediate, chilly response from Beijing, implying that the US is losing the plot. The Ministry of Commerce in Beijing has vowed to hit back if the US actually imposes $200bn of fresh tariffs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the U.S. loses its senses and publishes such a list, China will have to take comprehensive quantitative and qualitative measures and retaliate forcefully. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Markets are sliding today after president Donald Trump escalated America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade dispute with China. Overnight, Trump threatened to impose a 10% tariff on $200bn of Chinese imports, a tit-fot-tat move that could trigger a full-blown trade war. Trump is angry that China is imposing tariffs on $50bn of US imports - in retaliation to his original tariffs on $50bn of Chinese goods. He wants Beijing to back down, or else he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll ratchet up the trade dispute between the two powers. The president declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unfortunately, China has determined that it will raise tariffs on $50 billion worth of United States exports. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Further action must be taken to encourage China to change its unfair practices, open its market to United States goods, and accept a more balanced trade relationship. China has already responded firmly, accusing Trump of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153blackmail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and promising \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong countermeasures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if America goes through with its $200bn threat. The news has sent Asian investors reeling. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has fallen by 2.7% and Japan is down 1.7% in a wide-ranging rout. European markets are expected to slide too, with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 called down 55 points (0.7%). Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says the City is increasingly worried about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach to trade: Things have changed overnight after President Trump upped the ante by threatening another $200bn worth of tariffs at a 10% rate on a whole new raft of Chinese goods and services, if China went ahead with their retaliation measures. This upping of the ante saw markets in Asia slide and unlike yesterday haven bond markets rallied as US treasury yields slid back, the Japanese yen gained and gold rallied. As such European markets look set to continue their losing streak and open lower.

Camra, the organisation for devotees of cask ales, seized on the opportunity to urge drinkers to abandon artificially carbonated brews. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beer drinkers concerned about the supply of beer this summer can rest easy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Tom Stainer, Camra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief communications officer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are plenty of fantastic real ales, ciders and perries that will be completely unaffected by the impending CO2 shortage. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Real ales are naturally carbonated by live yeast that is left in the bottle or cask, and are therefore \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcliving products\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 compared to keg beers, which artificially inject CO2 into the brew for carbonation. In addition, real ciders and perries are naturally still, making them a refreshing beverage choice in the summer heat.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Camra members recently turned down a motion that would have led to it promoting the interests of products such as keg beer, which requires CO2.",

Meanwhile evidence of rising demand came from the weekly US figures, which saw a 5.9m barrel decline, the biggest drop since mid-January. On the other hand there was a 3.3m barrel rise in gasoline stocks compared to expectations of a 1m fall.</p> <p>Brent is currently up 0.19% at $75.22 a barrel. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Crude oil is also in focus, with a whole raft of comments coming from OPEC member states ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big production decision. Despite an initial rebuttal of a production increase proposed by Russia (via Saudi Arabia), we are seeing a gradual shift in tone which will likely see some form of rise in output come Friday.</p> <p>For markets, the line in the sand seems to be the 1 million barrels a day level. Anything less than that will be seen as a compromise given the Saudi target is closer to 1.5 million barrels a day. We have seen the biggest drawdown in US crude inventories since January, but the impact has been offset by a rise in gasoline supply.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b2a72c3e4b06f2cac880075\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-20T15:29:23.616Z\">4.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our first take on the David Drumm sentencing:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/20/david-drumm-former-chief-of-anglo-irish-bank-sentenced-to-eight-years-in-jail\">David Drumm, former chief of Anglo Irish Bank, sentenced to eight years in jail</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b2a7115e4b06f2cac880056\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-20T15:22:57.727Z\">4.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jun/20/china-trump-trade-war-fears-grow-uk-factories-business-live?page=with:block-5b2a4196e4b06f2cac87fd7e#block-5b2a4196e4b06f2cac87fd7e\">the Anglo Irish case </a> and former chief executive David Drumm has been sentenced to eight years in jail for his part in the fraud, but will serve six with mitigating circumstances taken into account. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b2a64d4e4b06f2cac87ff9b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-20T14:30:44.506Z\">3.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Investor enthusiasm appears to be waning, with markets coming off their best levels.

There was little for the index to really work with on Wednesday, beyond the ever-looming threat of a full-blown trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. </p> <p>The Eurozone, which started the week poorly and then went downhill from there, saw its initial tame recovery gradually chipped away at until nothing was left. That means the DAX is back struggling to keep its head above 12700, while the CAC tumbled below 5400 after switching from a 0.3% rise to a 0.2% loss. </p> <p>Only the FTSE remained in the green with any real substance, and even then its 0.6% increase was half of the growth posted at lunchtime. Though the UK index broadly just followed the direction of trading from around the Western world, sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reversal of its initial losses also helped erase some of the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains.

This beats Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $35 all-cash, $65bn bid but we must assume that Comcast is ready to come back with an even stronger offer.</p> <p>This offer from Disney is probably a little bit stronger than expected and [Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] Iger will be looking to kill off Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid once and for all. However, the rationale for Comcast remains the same, the question is only how much debt it can afford to carry. If it gets its way total debt would rise to $170bn according to Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, with just $6bn in cash on its books. Disney will also take on Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $14bn debts, giving this bid an enterprise value of more than $85bn. </p> <p>Debt is a concern for investors here and points to market-top behaviour. The amount of debt both companies are prepared to assume is arguably a worry, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a case of innovate or die in the face of competition. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign of just how desperately these two legacy media groups want the assets of Fox. In their attempt to contend with cord cutters like Netflix they are risking leveraging themselves up to a degree that makes them susceptible should the current benign market conditions deteriorate. </p> <p>Sky shares are trading up 3% today at \u00c2\u00a313.82 on the news but they could go higher if Comcast really goes big. Even it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the appetite for all of Fox it could settle to swoop for Sky only and bag those important European subscription revs.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b2a5700e4b06f2cac87fea7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-20T13:35:01.055Z\">2.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets have joined in the generally positive mood after the week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-offs as trade tensions between the US and China escalated.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 80 points or 0.33%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.325 and the Nasdaq Composite 0.5% better.</p> <p>But General Electric shares are down after the group was pushed out of the 30 share Dow after more than a century.

                "bodyText":"The prospect of a trade war between the US and China has put markets under pressure this week, and although there was some recovery today, it was by no means convincing. As well as continuing uncertainty over the effect of the proposed tariffs, oil prices were volatile ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meeting. Meanwhile the pound edged a little higher after the UK government won a key Brexit vote. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 23.55 points or 0.31% at 7627.40 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 0.14% to 12,695.16 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.34% at 5372.31 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 0.16% to 22,120.58 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.34% to 9788.9 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 10 points or 0.05%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a pretty volatile day for stock markets, as well as crude. And the pound has not been left out. From a low of $1.3149 against the dollar it hit a high of $1.3215 after the UK government won a key Brexit vote. It is currently at $1.3206, up 0.21%. Our politics live blog has all the latest details on the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s narrow success in seeing off a potential rebellion: Oil prices are edging higher ahead of the key Opec meeting which begins on Thursday and following a bigger than expected fall in US crude stocks. The oil producers are expected to agree to increase output but the key question is by how much. Meanwhile evidence of rising demand came from the weekly US figures, which saw a 5.9m barrel decline, the biggest drop since mid-January. On the other hand there was a 3.3m barrel rise in gasoline stocks compared to expectations of a 1m fall. Brent is currently up 0.19% at $75.22 a barrel. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Crude oil is also in focus, with a whole raft of comments coming from OPEC member states ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big production decision. Despite an initial rebuttal of a production increase proposed by Russia (via Saudi Arabia), we are seeing a gradual shift in tone which will likely see some form of rise in output come Friday. For markets, the line in the sand seems to be the 1 million barrels a day level. Anything less than that will be seen as a compromise given the Saudi target is closer to 1.5 million barrels a day. We have seen the biggest drawdown in US crude inventories since January, but the impact has been offset by a rise in gasoline supply. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our first take on the David Drumm sentencing: Back with the Anglo Irish case and former chief executive David Drumm has been sentenced to eight years in jail for his part in the fraud, but will serve six with mitigating circumstances taken into account. Investor enthusiasm appears to be waning, with markets coming off their best levels. Connor Campbell, market analyst at Spreadex, said: The Dow Jones, which at one point looked like it was going to reclaim 150 points, ended up starting the US session flat, the wrong side of 24700. There was little for the index to really work with on Wednesday, beyond the ever-looming threat of a full-blown trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. The Eurozone, which started the week poorly and then went downhill from there, saw its initial tame recovery gradually chipped away at until nothing was left. That means the DAX is back struggling to keep its head above 12700, while the CAC tumbled below 5400 after switching from a 0.3% rise to a 0.2% loss. Only the FTSE remained in the green with any real substance, and even then its 0.6% increase was half of the growth posted at lunchtime. Though the UK index broadly just followed the direction of trading from around the Western world, sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reversal of its initial losses also helped erase some of the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains. The pound rose 0.1% against the dollar and the euro \u00e2\u20ac\u201c granted, not a lot in the context of its recent performance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as the government appeared to come to a compromise over the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmeaningful vote\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 issue, but couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gain any more momentum thanks to Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impending Bank of England meeting. US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross has been speaking about the trade dispute with China. He says President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy is to make it clear to China that continuing on its current path would be more painful that changing its behaviour. Back with the bids for 21st Century Fox, and Neil Wilson at Markets.com says the market is now waiting for Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next move after Disney increased its offer: As was expected, cash was added to the all-share offer as a sweetener and the deal is now worth $38 a share, up from its previous $28 offer that was worth c$55bn. This beats Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $35 all-cash, $65bn bid but we must assume that Comcast is ready to come back with an even stronger offer. This offer from Disney is probably a little bit stronger than expected and [Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] Iger will be looking to kill off Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid once and for all. However, the rationale for Comcast remains the same, the question is only how much debt it can afford to carry. If it gets its way total debt would rise to $170bn according to Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, with just $6bn in cash on its books. Disney will also take on Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $14bn debts, giving this bid an enterprise value of more than $85bn. Debt is a concern for investors here and points to market-top behaviour. The amount of debt both companies are prepared to assume is arguably a worry, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a case of innovate or die in the face of competition. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign of just how desperately these two legacy media groups want the assets of Fox. In their attempt to contend with cord cutters like Netflix they are risking leveraging themselves up to a degree that makes them susceptible should the current benign market conditions deteriorate. Sky shares are trading up 3% today at \u00c2\u00a313.82 on the news but they could go higher if Comcast really goes big. Even it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the appetite for all of Fox it could settle to swoop for Sky only and bag those important European subscription revs. US markets have joined in the generally positive mood after the week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-offs as trade tensions between the US and China escalated. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 80 points or 0.33%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.325 and the Nasdaq Composite 0.5% better. But General Electric shares are down after the group was pushed out of the 30 share Dow after more than a century. GE, one of the original members of the Dow, will be replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance. Back with trade disputes, and the European Union has confirmed it will begin charging import duties of 25% on a range of US products on Friday. The move is in retaliation to the US tariffs imposed on EU steel and aluminium. The EU tariffs will be placed on \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.8bn worth of goods, from Harley Davidson motor bikes to bourbon and peanuts. Over in the US, and the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit widened in the first quarter, but by less than forecast. Reuters reports: The Commerce Department said the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, widened by $8.0 billion to $124.1 billion, or 2.5 percent of national economic output, in the first three months of the year. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the current account deficit to widen to $129.0 billion from the previously reported $128.2 billion in the fourth quarter. The figures also showed that US companies brought back cash from overseas after a December 2017 tax change. Companies paid out dividends of around $305bn from foreign receipts. Newsflash: The takeover battle over Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox group has taken another twist. Disney has raised its offer for most of 21CF to $38bn per share, up from a previous offer of $28 per share. That takes the value of the offer up to around $70bn, from $52bn previously. Disney has also tweaked its offer to include a cash component - previously it was only offering shares. It beats Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rival all-cash offer of $35 per share, and seemingly puts Disney back in poll position. Over in Dublin, one of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fallen bank bosses is being sentenced over his role in the financial crisis. David Drumm, the former CEO of Anglo Irish bank, faces a prison term after being found guilty of conspiracy to defraud and false accounting earlier this year. The case relating to banking transactions he was involved in at the height of 2008 financial crisis. By circulating deposits between Anglo and Irish Life &amp; Permanent (IL&amp;P), the bank created the impression that its deposits were \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.2bn larger than was actually the case. Tom Lyons, deputy editor of The Sunday Business Post, is tweeting from the court room. He reports that Drumm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team is defending his actions, while also recognising that a custodial sentence is on the cards.... Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says investors should be cautious about joining today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally. He points out that the trade spat between China and the US could escalates again soon. Asian and European stocks rose today as markets attempted to shrug off trade war threats. While the improved risk appetite could elevate stock markets higher, the sustainability should be questioned as fears over trade tensions remain a key market theme. Global equity bears could transform the current rebound into a classical dead cat bounce if trade tensions between the United States and China continue to escalate. The US stock market is expected to rise when trading begins in a couple of hours, ending several days of losses. Yesterday the Dow lost 287 points, or 1.1%, wiping out its 2018 gains. The Bank of England could face a major shake-up if Labour wins the next election. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is unveiling a swathe of proposed reforms to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank today. The headline-grabbing elements include opening an office in Birmingham, a shift away from its base at London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Threadneedle Street. The most intriguing element - setting the Bank a productivity target, alongside its current mandate to control inflation. These ideas aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Labour policy yet, but they could be considered for its next manifesto: Chris Giles of the FT suggests the Bank could have some issues with a productivity target: Good news: UK factory orders have risen, helping manufacturers to boost their output. The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest healthcheck on the sector has found that manufacturing order books recovered in the last quarter, while the volume of output increased strongly. The CBI says: 33% of manufacturers reported total order books to be above normal, and 20% said they were below normal, giving a balance of +13% 20% of firms said their export order books were above normal, and 11% said they were below normal, giving a balance of +9% 43% of businesses said the volume of output over the past three months was up, and 13% said it was down, giving a rounded balance of +29% Anna Leach, CBI Head of Economic Intelligence, believes Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial sector may be picking up pace after a recent lull. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The recovery in orders and a return to bumper growth in production suggests the lull in manufacturing activity may be over. While risks to demand persist from Brexit and escalating global trade tensions, firms can work with the Government to nurture a pro-enterprise environment that helps UK growth to shift up a gear. UK housebuilder Berkeley has called the top of the London housing market. After some bumper years, Berkeley told shareholders that profits will drop by 30% in the 2018/19 financial year, as the sector returns to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd times. Chairman Tony Pidgley says that new housing starts in London have dropped by a third in the last two years (or since the EU referendum, basically). Pidgley blames Brexit uncertainty for the drop in activity: It is telling that some funders and builders are choosing to exit the market when faced with the degree of risk and regulation that now confronts development in the capital where macro and political uncertainty, including Brexit, are leading to this caution. This is a great shame as London is a fantastic world-class city with unique attributes that will last long beyond the current hiatus which is only exacerbating the well documented under-supply. Stocks are recovering because investors are snaffling up bargains after Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout, says Ken Odeluga of City Index. He believes the People Bank of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention overnight is reassuring the markets: European stocks are posting solid gains with similar demand building in Dow, S&amp;P and Nasdaq contracts. This follows chunks of buying interest in Asia-Pacific shares. It looked very much like bargain-motivated flows juiced by a window of benign currency conditions, particularly in Japan, Hong Kong, S. Korea and Australia where benchmarks all added around 1%. Chinese equities also enjoyed a bounce, though to a lesser extent, with precarious sentiment capping Shanghai and Shenzhen gains as investors read the PBoC stepping in as corroborating a sense of crisis. The central bank recommended a reserve ratio requirement cut\u00e2\u20ac\u201dessentially looser policy\u00e2\u20ac\u201dafter fresh tariff threats. Elsewhere in the markets, cryptocurrency prices are falling after another digital coin exchange was hacked. The South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb says it lost 35bn won ($31.5m) worth of virtual coins to hackers. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the second such breach in a week, highlighting the risks of investing in crypto (as coins are virtually anonymous, they can be almost impossible to recover). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the damage: Two hours into the trading day, and European markets are all comfortably higher. Shares are up across the board, as traders shake off some of their fears about a devastating trade war. Analysts at FXPro say: Markets are taking a breath right now and retracing some of the moves over the past number of sessions. Whether this turns into a broader rally or the selloff is resumed remains to be seen. Stock markets are higher after support was found in the European session yesterday and US and Asian traders built on the foundations of that support. Sterling has hit a new seven-month low this morning, as the UK government faces another crunch vote over Brexit. Parliament will vote on the EU withdrawal bill, the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flagship piece of Brexit legislation, later today. And one group of MPs are refusing to drop their demand for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmeaningful\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vote in the scenario in which Britain can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree a Brexit deal. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve insists that parliament must have a chance to protect the UK economy, in the event of a no-deal. Grieve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s amendment has been been sent back to the Commons by the House of Lords, amid claims that Theresa May \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdouble-crossed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Grieve last week by promising to address his concerns, then pulling a u-turn. The vote could be close, if Grieve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s band of backbench Conservative MPs hold firm. Some pro-Brexit Labour MPs could vote with the government, though, which would be a headache for opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn..... This uncertainty has knocked the pound down by 0.2% to $1.315, the lowest since November 2017. Those calming words from the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China are helping markets recover from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout. In London the FTSE 100 has jumped by 80 points, or 1%, to 7683 (partly helped by a weaker pound). Other European markets are also higher, with Germany up 0.4% and Spain gaining 1% following the rally in Asia overnight. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets reckons investors are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153calming their fears about the current US-China trade tariff dispute\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly because neither side has actually imposed tariffs yet -- just made lots of threats. Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada explains why things might calm down: On the trade front, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re likely to see a two month \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchibernation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as the US works through the legal process for the next $200bn of tariffs and China awaits the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 formal response. The boss of Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs has predicted that China and the US still step back from a devastating trade wars. Lloyd Blankfein says that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to add tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports are a negotiating tactic: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you would do if it was a negotiating position, and you wanted to remind your counterparty just how much fire power you had to bring to the negotiation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Blankfein is hopeful that Washington and Beijing won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mutually destroy their economies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a suicide pact on this...\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I suspect we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to cause the economies to collapse with Smoot-Hawley on steroids. The protectionist Smoot\u00e2\u20ac\u201cHawley Tariff Act of 1930 imposed tariffs on more than 20,000 imported goods. It was meant to protect US workers after the Wall Street crash of 1929, but actually appears to have hurt economic growth and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prevent the Great Depression. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only one flirting with a bear market. After days of losses, the Philippines PSI index has fallen almost 20% from its recent peak. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose more tariffs on China is dominating the newspapers across Asia today. The China Daily newspaper \u00e2\u20ac\u201c often a good window into Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has accuse the US of trying to hurt the Chinese economy. It says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Faced with this heightened intimidation from the U.S., China has no choice but to fight back with targeted and direct measures aimed at persuading the U.S. to back off, since it appears that any concessions it makes will not appease the Trump administration, which wants to suck the lifeblood from the Chinese economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beijing will have to ensure that Washington is aware that there will be heavy price to pay every action it strikes against China if it is to avoid being a victim of the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing blood lust.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Global Times also put the boot in, saying Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration was the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest destabilising factor. A raging fever of nationalism rising in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sole super power sends an alarming signal. Nationalism is a challenge to globalization. Rising nationalism and protectionism could hinder the process of globalization and jeopardize the world order. The US often points an accusing finger at alleged economic nationalism of other countries including China, but now, the reality is that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s truculent nationalism is posing the biggest threat. And in Hong Kong, the Apple Daily newspaper produced quite a front page... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Could Donald Trump really trigger a trade war with China? With neither side backing down, the markets getting nervous after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff hit shares and commodities across the globe. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose new tariffs on $200bn of Chinese exports has investors worried, with Beijing already vowing to retaliate. Overnight, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker urged people to remain strong and calm. People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China governor Yi Gang told the Shanghai Securities Journal that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy remained solid, and that there was no reason to panic. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China still has good economic fundamentals and resilient growth. The yuan is one of a few currencies that have appreciated against the US dollar this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m fully confident about the health of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital market based on the fundamentals.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yi also pledged that the PBOC would act to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fend off systemic financial risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and prepare for the danger of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153potential external shocks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fend off systemic financial risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Yi Gang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments helped to stem another day of losses in China, where shares are on the brink of a bear market (down 20% from their peak). Other Asian equity markets also recovered a little, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Topix up 0.5% and Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P 500 gaining 1.1%. European traders might also recover their poise today, after Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says investors fear the consequences of a trade war: Global GDP could stand to be hit by 2% - 3% should the trade war continue and spread, to put this into context the Great Recession wiped out 6% of the global GDP, so this trade spat is by no means insignificant. For weeks the market has been relatively complacent that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tough protectionist rhetoric were merely a negotiating tool; however, the realisation that the US President is willing to go ahead with his threats has sent a shiver through the markets. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy appears to be to raise the stakes until China is forced to capitulate, by opening up its markets to American goods and addressing intellectual property theft concerns. But if that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen, the world economy could find itself on a rocky road. Also coming up today.... Top central bankers are gathered in Sintra, Portugal, for a conference organised by the European Central Bank. Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell, Bank of Japan chief Haruhiko Kuroda, and ECB president Mario Draghi will all speak. Plue, we get a new healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories and the latest oil inventory figures from America The agenda: From 9am BST: European Central Bank conference in Sintra, Portugal 11am BST: CBI industrial trends survey of UK factories 3.30pm BST: US weekly oil inventory figures",

In particular, indicators of household consumption had recovered strongly from their subdued levels at the time of the previous meeting.<br></p> <p>Set against that, the outlook for global growth had weakened somewhat, and global financial conditions had tightened, with some modest impact on UK bank funding and corporate credit spreads. Data on manufacturing output and goods exports in April had been weak, although business surveys had generally suggested steady underlying GDP growth. For these members, there was value in seeing how the data evolved from here, in order to learn more about the extent to which conditions were evolving in line with the May Inflation Report projections.</p> </blockquote> <p>But chief economist <strong>Andy Haldane</strong> disagreed!

These members had a higher degree of confidence that the slowdown in Q1 was temporary or erratic and would largely be unwound.</p> <p>They felt that the economy was developing broadly in line with the May Inflation Report forecasts, but the most recent indicators of labour demand and pay settlements indicated some upside risks to the expected pickup in average weekly earnings and unit wage costs.

Since the OBR estimates that the output gap in 2017/18 was close to zero, the structural budget deficit was probably also just below 2% of GDP in that year, meaning that the Chancellor has already met his medium term fiscal target set originally for 2020 with further deficit reductions likely over the next couple of years.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153So the Chancellor can afford to ease off on austerity without endangering his medium term fiscal targets.

So we estimate that the Chancellor may only need to raise taxes or increase borrowing relative to previous plans by around \u00c2\u00a315 billion in 2023/24 to fund these plans, which is equivalent to around 0.6% of GDP in that year.

                "bodyText":"Hello again. The pound has continued to climb, on the back of the news that three Bank of England policymakers pushed to raise interest rates at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Sterling has now risen to $1.325, up three quarters of a cent today, as traders anticipate a rate rise in August (maybe). That has pulled down shares in London, though (as a stronger currency erodes the value of overseas earnings). Stock markets have also been hit by another bout of trade war jitters. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 shed 70 points, or nearly 1%, to 7556. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest level since early May. In Germany, the Dax shed 1.5%, dragged down by automobile stocks following Daimler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning. David Madden of CMC Markets says: Equity markets are lower as dealers are worried about the global trade situation. The standoff between the US and China is not any closer to being resolved, and traders are fearful President Trump will turn up the heat on the EU next. Time for a recap. The Bank of England has voted to leave interest rates unchanged at 0.5%. But three policymakers, including chief economist Andy Haldane, pushed for rates to rise to 0.75%. The split vote raises the chances that interest rates are hiked in August. Some experts aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced, though, and believe borrowing costs could remain unchanged for longer. The pound jumped following the announcement, rising from a 7-month low to reach $1.325. The Bank of England also changed its guidance on quantitative easing. It now expects to start unwinding its bond-buying programme once interest rates have hit 1.5%, down from a previous goal of 2%. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances have improved, thanks to a rise in tax receipts. The UK borrowed \u00c2\u00a35bn to balance the books in May, the smallest amount in over a decade. Economists say the government has more flexibility to relax austerity. With borrowing below forecast, Philip Hammond has the firepower to increase spending on the NHS. Eurozone finance ministers are meeting to discuss Greece. The Eurogroup will consider how Athens will complete its bailout this summer, and what measures are needed to help it return to the financial markets. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back later when we have developments on Greece... Shares in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carmakers are sliding after Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daimler issued a profits warning, and blamed Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade disputes. Daimler warned that profits would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slightly below the previous year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s level\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and blamed the prospect of higher tariffs on US cars sold into China (Daimler has a factory in America making SUVs). Daimler shares have fallen 4%, with Fiat (-3.5%), Volkswagen (-3.2%) and BMW (-2.75%) also dragged down. In other news, the boss of Intel - Brian Krzanich - is resigning after conducting a relationship with an employee. Although the relationship was consensual, it breached the chipmaker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno fraternisation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 policy. Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, has some advice for savers and borrowers: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Once again you can breathe a sigh of relief if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on a variable rate mortgage; the Bank of England just bought you some time to get a cheaper, fixed deal sorted. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not out of the woods yet though. With a rate rise still expected soon the clock is ticking loudly at you especially as the vote was split this month. Check if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on a variable deal and speak to a decent mortgage broker about your options if so. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll save a significant chunk of cash which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure you could better spend elsewhere. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If your fixed mortgage ends in the next 6 months consider prebooking a mortgage now too as it can help you to lock in a lower rate. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Savers, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bank on a rate increase to make things better; banks are notoriously slow to pass on any rises so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best to take matters into your own hands. Aim to get your return as close to inflation as possible, and beat it if you can. While this is still a challenge, now inflation has tapered slightly and rates topping best buy tables are slowly started to creep up, the situation isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as dire as it was. Via Kallum Pickering of Berenberg, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy chart showing how the odds of an August rate hike have jumped to over 60% today: Pickering says Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote has made City economists change their forecasts: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise vote for a rate hike by the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Andy Haldane shifts the balance of probability for the next hike to the August meeting. Previously we had called for a November hike, with a risk of a potential move in August already. However, the minutes from the June meeting show that, despite heightened uncertainty about the global economy linked to trade tensions, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is confident that growth has rebounded to around its trend rate in Q2 (c0.4% qoq) after a soft patch in Q1. Foreign exchange dealer Argentex suggests the next UK interest rate rise might come in the autumn, not his summer. But it all depends on whether growth picks up, after slowing to just 0.1% in January-March. An August move is still possibly too soon, but November is now far more realistic. We remain optimistic of a sterling recovery, aside from the ongoing political risks, we are moving closer to monetary tightening. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to see stronger economic fundamentals in the short-term. If the shaky first quarter was just an blip then the MPC is likely to act.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A new Brexit crisis could derail the Bank of England from raising interest rates in August, despite Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkish conversion. Silvia Dall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Angelo, senior economist at Hermes Investment Management, explains: The Bank seems determined to deliver one more hike in the second half of the year, justified by a tight labour market and an economy now working close to potential. However, there are several reasons to err on the side of caution. In particular, recent hard data on industrial production and surveys on economic activity suggest that the prospects of a significant rebound in economic performance are uncertain following a weak Q1. Moreover, risks of a disruptive Brexit event down the road are still high. Negotiations have stalled in recent months reflecting unresolved divisions within the UK Cabinet, and the upcoming EU council at the end of June is unlikely to deliver any progress, as other issues (not least international trade tensions) are now topping the EU leaders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 agenda. City economist Sam Tombs of Pantheon has spotted that the pound started to rally just before the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision was published. Sterling was trading at $1.310 at 11.50am, but had snuck over $1.313 by 11.59am: The Bank actually held its meeting yesterday, and keeps its decision tightly under wraps until the official announcement. But was it tight enough?... Another development: the Bank of England has changed its guidance about when it might start unwinding its quantitative easing (QE) stimulus programme. The Bank currently holds \u00c2\u00a3435bn of bonds bought through QE using newly-created electronic money. It has now decided it could start to sell some of these bonds when interest rates have risen to 1.5% (compared to 0.5% today). It had previously aimed for 2%. Neil Wilson of Markets.com thinks this shows the Bank doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect rates to hit 2% for a long time. A lower bar but whether 1.5% or 2% - neither are going to happen any time soon, so this is of marginal relevance to investors right now. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indeed probably an admission it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see rates hitting 2% for a very long time indeed, while 1.5% is a bit more achievable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Neil Birrell, Chief Investment Officer at Premier Asset Management, agrees: Another significant change was in QE guidance; the bank won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t consider reducing the debt purchased until the rate reaches 1.5%, down from 2%. This suggests that they now think rates will have a lower peak this cycle than previously expected. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is mixed news for markets. In the short term, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a positive for Sterling and we may see gilt yields rise modestly, but the outlook is still unclear, as is the message from the bank.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Andy Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transformation to an interest rate hawk means there is more chance of an interest rate rise in August, says Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA. Prior to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, investors were unconvinced by the prospect of a rate hike in August but I think today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s release will change that. Sterling rallied above 1.32 against the dollar from just above 1.31 prior to the release which suggests people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations for August are being quickly revised. While a hike in November makes more sense as there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be more clarity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hopefully \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by then, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised if they go in August given the criticism they endured for holding off in May. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official position is that it expects that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an ongoing tightening of monetary policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will be appropriate over the next couple of years, if the economy performs as expected. Economics journalist Dharshini David points out that this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a concrete promise to raise rates soon Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 6-3 split is a surprise, says Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown: But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that interest rates will definitely rise in August, he adds: There was a small element of surprise in the voting, with the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Andy Haldane joining Michael Saunders and perma-hawk Ian McCafferty in calling for an immediate rate rise. Economists had expected a 7-2 split, but in the event a forecast uptick in inflation was enough to split the committee 6-3. Sterling jumped on the news, gaining almost a cent against the dollar as traders factored in a bigger chance of a move in August. But on balance I still think we might not see a rate rise for the rest of the year - policymakers will at the very least want confirmation that the weak first-quarter growth figure was just a blip before raising borrowing costs. There is clearly a split at the Bank of England over the state of the British economy. The minutes of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting show that six members believe the UK economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t strong enough to handle higher interest rates, especially with the global economy looking shakier. Those members are governor Mark Carney, deputy governors Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe and Dave Ramsden, and external committee members Silvana Tenreyro and Gertjan Vlieghe. As the minutes put it: For the majority of members, an increase in Bank Rate at this meeting was not required. For these members, the news since the previous meeting had given them greater reassurance that the softness of activity in the first quarter had been largely temporary. In particular, indicators of household consumption had recovered strongly from their subdued levels at the time of the previous meeting. Set against that, the outlook for global growth had weakened somewhat, and global financial conditions had tightened, with some modest impact on UK bank funding and corporate credit spreads. Data on manufacturing output and goods exports in April had been weak, although business surveys had generally suggested steady underlying GDP growth. For these members, there was value in seeing how the data evolved from here, in order to learn more about the extent to which conditions were evolving in line with the May Inflation Report projections. But chief economist Andy Haldane disagreed! Along with external members Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders, Haldane argued that the economy was healthy, and that growth was bouncing back from the winter slowdown. The minute say that this trio pushed for higher borrowing costs, to avoid a spike in inflation. Three members favoured an immediate increase in Bank Rate. These members had a higher degree of confidence that the slowdown in Q1 was temporary or erratic and would largely be unwound. They felt that the economy was developing broadly in line with the May Inflation Report forecasts, but the most recent indicators of labour demand and pay settlements indicated some upside risks to the expected pickup in average weekly earnings and unit wage costs. These members also felt that the benefits of waiting for additional information were limited. Rather, they judged that a modest tightening of monetary policy at this meeting could mitigate the risks of a more sustained period of above-target inflation that might ultimately necessitate a less gradual subsequent change in policy and hence a sharper adjustment in growth and employment. You can read the minutes online here. The pound is rallying, following the news that three Bank of England policymakers voted to raise interest rates today. Chief economist Andy Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conversion to a hawk makes an August interest rate rise more likely, City traders believe. This has sent sterling back up to $1.32, away from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seven-month low. Newsflash: The Bank of England has voted to leave interest rates at 0.5%. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a split vote! The Bak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Andy Haldane voted to raise borrowing costs to 0.75%, along with Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders. The remaining six members of the MPC voted to leave rates on hold, though. More to follow! The pound is weakening, as the City braces for the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision on interest rates at noon. Sterling has fallen by 0.3% today to $1.313 against the US dollar. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest level this year. Over in Europe, the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout fund has warned that Greece still faces major \u00e2\u20ac\u0153challenges\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before it can end its bailout programme this summer That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important point, as eurozone ministers gather to discuss Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial future this afternoon. Helena Smith reports from Athens \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece has made significant progress in stabilising its economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the European Stability Mechanism said in its 2017 annual report. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Continuing on this path is decisive for the sovereign to regain stable market access. [\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6] Despite strengthened market confidence, the Greek economy faces a difficult economic and financial environment. Greece must address remaining challenges before the programme concludes to ensure that it can build upon its significant programme achievements in the post-programme period.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The assessment echoes similar comments by the ESM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director Klaus Regling in Athens last week. Speaking after holding talks with the Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, the ESM chief said despite the progress the debt-stricken country had made, it will continue to remain under \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tight\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd surveillance when it exits its current bailout programme in August. Supervision is expected to be strict for several years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Surveillance will be tight in the case of Greece,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told reporters adding that while all bailed out euro zone economies were subject to supervision, Athens would be given especially enhanced oversight because of the unprecedented amounts of emergency bailout funding the country had received. Greece would only be a success story if it continued to implement tough economic reforms, Regling said. If it fails to do so, investor confidence will plummet and the markets will retaliate, he warned. Excluded from international capital markets, Greece has been dependent on international rescue funds since May 2010 in what has been the biggest bailout of any state in global financial history. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says the drop in UK borrowing will allow the government to relax its austerity policies. However, tax rises will still be needed to fund the increase in NHS spending announced this week, he adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a share of GDP, public borrowing in 2017/18 is now estimated to be just 1.9%, the first time the budget deficit has been below 2% of GDP since 2001/2. Since the OBR estimates that the output gap in 2017/18 was close to zero, the structural budget deficit was probably also just below 2% of GDP in that year, meaning that the Chancellor has already met his medium term fiscal target set originally for 2020 with further deficit reductions likely over the next couple of years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So the Chancellor can afford to ease off on austerity without endangering his medium term fiscal targets. We estimate that, of the proposed \u00c2\u00a325 billion of real NHS spending rises across the UK by 2023/24, around \u00c2\u00a310 billion is already implicit in current spending plans used in OBR forecasts. So we estimate that the Chancellor may only need to raise taxes or increase borrowing relative to previous plans by around \u00c2\u00a315 billion in 2023/24 to fund these plans, which is equivalent to around 0.6% of GDP in that year. A net tax rise of around 0.3% of GDP, plus a modest borrowing rise of a similar magnitude would be enough to fund the additional health spending over and above that implicit in current fiscal projections. Britain is on track to undershoot the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing forecast by around \u00c2\u00a39bn this financial year, says Andrew Wishart of Capital Economics. He also agrees that chancellor Philip Hammond has more firepower than expected: Wishart says: While we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t place too much weight on the estimates of borrowing in the early months of the fiscal year, since they are largely based on forecasts rather than actual data, the continued improvement in the public finances suggests that the deficit will undershoot the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast again this year. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, if the economy holds up as we expect, borrowing is likely to undershoot the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast by a more significant margin in subsequent years. This would allow the Chancellor to deliver the recently promised \u00c2\u00a315bn increase in health spending over the next five years while still meeting his fiscal target (for the cyclically-adjusted deficit to be less than 2% of GDP in 2020/21). Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK public finance figures look \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fantastic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Economics. He warns that the trend probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t continue, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still room to increase NHS spending. We still expect full-year public borrowing to be only a little below the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Spring Statement forecast. The Chancellor, however, still will have scope to pause the fiscal consolidation at the Budget later this year, given that cyclically-adjusted borrowing as a share of GDP already will be below his 2020 target of 2% this year. Most of the likely extra borrowing, however, looks set to be earmarked for the NHS, leaving little scope for measures to boost households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 spending or business investment. Howard Archer of the EY Item Club says: The Chancellor will be heartened by the healthy start to the 2018/19 fiscal year following better-than-expected public finances in 2017/18. It suggests that he may have more room for manoeuvre in November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Budget as he looks to find the extra funding needed for the high-profile increased spending promised for the NHS. Matt Whittaker of Resolution Foundation also believes chancellor Philip Hammond has more flexibility to boost government spending on services such as health. The improvement in the UK public finances suggests there is room to boost spending on key public services. Rupert Harrison, former advisor to the Treasury, believes the NHS (just promised a spending increase) should benefit: Harrison (now at asset manager BlackRock) tweets: The government will be delighted by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall in borrowing, says Kamal Ahmed of the BBC: Fraser Munro of the Office for National Statistics points out that last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing figures were better than expected too: The Conservative Party have welcomed the news: (yes, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same Conservative Party that once hoped to eliminate the entire deficit by 2015) Newsflash: UK government borrowing fell last month as the long, slow process of fixing the public finances continues. Britain borrowed \u00c2\u00a35bn to balance the books in May, the Office for National Statistic reports. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from around \u00c2\u00a37bn in May 2017 and is the lowest borrowing for any May since 2005. In April and May combined, Britain has borrowed \u00c2\u00a311.8bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a34.1bn less than a year ago, and the best start to a financial year since 2007 (before the financial crisis). This improvement is due to rising tax revenues, the ONS explains: In the latest financial year-to-date, central government received \u00c2\u00a3112.9 billion in income, including \u00c2\u00a382.6 billion in taxes. This was around 3% more than in the same period in 2017. Over the same period, central government spent \u00c2\u00a3123.6 billion, roughly equal to that spent in the same period in 2017. Of this amount, just below two-thirds was spent by central government departments (such as health, education and defence), around one-third on social benefits (such as pensions, unemployment payments, Child Benefit and Maternity Pay), with the remaining being spent on capital investment and interest on government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outstanding debt. In another boost, last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit has been revised down to \u00c2\u00a339.5bn, down from \u00c2\u00a340.5bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest net borrowing since the financial year ending March 2007. Overall, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national debt stands at \u00c2\u00a31.8 trillion, or around 85% of GDP. Economists are all-but certain that the Bank of England won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raise interest rates today. City AM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshadow MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of nine City experts unanimously agree that the BoE should hold borrowing costs, given recent mixed economic data and the ongoing Brexit talks. As Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon put it: There are three main sources of uncertainty in the UK economy: the source of the first-quarter slowdown, the progress of Brexit negotiations and the impact of higher petrol prices. Hold bank rate while assessing these uncertainties further. Morgan Stanley predict that the Bank of England will hold interest rates today, in a 7-2 split (the same as last month). They also expect the BoE to give a hawkish message in the minutes of the meeting (which are also released at noon). MS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jacob Nell and Shreya Chander told clients: June to reiterate May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wait-and-see message: As usual, we are sceptical of action at a non-Inflation Report meeting, given the lack of a new forecast, and expect an unchanged 7-2 vote to hold. Mixed data also makes it unlikely that we get any strong new guidance on August. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. The Bank of England is in the spotlight today as its Monetary Policy Committee meets to set interest rates. While borrowing costs probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change today, the City will be looking for hints that the long-awaited hike could come in August. The key issue is whether the Bank still believes the recent weakness in UK economic growth is temporary. That slowdown scared the MPC away from raising interest rates last month, forcing investors to rethink their expectations about how fast borrowing costs will rise. The two hawkish members of the MPC, Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty, will likely vote for a hike today. The majority, though, will (probably!) decide to leave interest rates at just 0.5%. Mike Bell of JP Morgan Asset Management argues that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no reason to raise interest rates yet, especially with Brexit uncertainty bubbling away: Some lead indicators suggest wage growth could soon start to accelerate, so the case for a rate hike is building. However, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no rush to raise to rates this week given still high political and economic uncertainty. But you never know.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also an important day for Greece. The Greek bailout ends in August, so Eurozone finance ministers will discuss what debt relief measures are needed to help Athens return to the financial markets. The Greek government is hoping for substantive measures to address its debt pile, which has swelled to 180% of its GDP. Spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told reporters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are optimistic that we are on the verge of a solution with substance.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Full-blown debt write-offs aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the agenda, but the eurozone could agree to extend the payback data on Greek debt, giving Athens more wriggle-room to recover from years of economic trauma. Tzanakopoulos argues that Greece needs debt relief in order to become an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcordinary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 country again: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The accepted criteria for all sides is that this solution be convincing for markets and embed the creditworthiness of our country - the final act in restoring the credibility of Greece to be able to plan for the next day like any ordinary country. The eurogroup will also discuss what \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsurveillance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 measures should be imposed on Greece, to ensure it keeps meeting its commitments even after the bailout is over. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also keep an eye on Vienna, where Opec members are gathering for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Some oil ministers (including the Saudis) are pushing for a deal to raise oil output, but others are keener to maintain current production caps....and keep prices higher. Plus, the latest UK public finances will show how much Britain borrowed last month. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 9.30am BST: UK public finances for July Noon BST: Bank of England interest rate decision 2pm BST: Eurogroup meeting on Greece begins",

                "bodyText":"Donald Trump has threatened to widen the mounting trade dispute between US and the EU by imposing tariffs on European cars, after Brussels made good on its threat of retaliatory levies on American products including bourbon whiskey, Levi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jeans and Harley-Davidson motorbikes. Raising the stakes in the tit-for-tat exchange of import tariffs threatening to spark a global trade war, the US president tweeted in response to the EU tariffs which came into effect late on Thursday: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed, we will be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the U.S. Build them here!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new threat comes after the EU imposed tariffs on a range of US consumer goods in response to steel and aluminium tariffs from the White House, which could increase the cost of consumer goods by \u00c2\u00a3200m per year in the UK alone. Should Trump carry through the levy, it would have damaging consequences for jobs and economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic. Leaders from American and European car manufacturers have previously said such measures would lead to net job losses in the US. The US is the biggest market for EU car exports, accounting for 25% of the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac48bn (\u00c2\u00a342bn) total in 2016, when Germany accounted for just over half of all EU car exports and the UK had the second biggest share, at 13%. Shares in US and European carmakers fell, including Ford, General Motors, Fiat, BMW and Daimler. The US opened a new front in the trade war on Friday, telling the World Trade Organisation that appeals rulings in trade disputes could be vetoed if they took longer than the allowed 90 days. The statement by the US ambassador, Dennis Shea, threatened to erode a key element of trade enforcement at the 23-year-old WTO: binding dispute settlement, which is widely seen as a major bulwark against protectionism. The tariffs from Brussels imposed on consumer goods \u00e2\u20ac\u201c designed to target producers in Republican states where Trump draws much of his support \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were introduced from 11pm (BST) on Thursday on US goods worth up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.8bn (\u00c2\u00a32.5bn). The White House had refused to exempt its traditional allies from worldwide tariffs on steel and aluminium, which Trump argues are necessary to protect US jobs and industry. The president is also threatening China with tariffs worth up to $200bn over alleged \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unfair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trading practices. The EU trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m, said this week the 28-nation bloc was left with no other choice but to impose tariffs of its own after the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unilateral and unjustified decision of the US\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Brussels drew up the list of products in March when Trump first floated the idea of 25% tariffs on steel and 10% on aluminium. Although American goods already in the UK will not increase in price, shipments leaving the US for Europe from Friday onwards will be charged the tariffs. Customs agents across the EU internal market of 500 million people will impose the duty, hiking prices on US-made products in supermarkets and across factory floors. The EU tax on imported goods in the UK will be collected by HM Revenue &amp; Customs, with some of those duties staying within the country, but the cost for importers, such as wholesale firms and supermarkets, will rise and is likely to be passed on to consumers. Richard Lim, the chief executive of the consultancy Retail Economics, estimated the tariffs could add \u00c2\u00a3200m to the cost of consumer goods in Britain. In 2017, consumers in the UK spent about \u00c2\u00a3406bn on retail purchases. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Though the immediate effects on UK retailers might look relatively modest, it is worth paying close attention to this dispute because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future course is unpredictable, fast moving and could quickly escalate to engulf other, seemingly unrelated areas of trade,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Most economists say the consequence of higher international import tariffs will drive up costs for consumers, offsetting much of the benefit of protecting domestic industries for the country imposing them. Analysts at the Oxford Economics consultancy said the consequences for the European economy could be contained in the short term, as the affected imports only account for about 1% of all goods coming into the EU from the US, although it warned tariffs on cars would have a greater negative impact. The EU will impose an additional \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.6bn of tariffs if the dispute is still active in three years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time. European consumers would be able to find alternatives, said the European commission vice-president for trade, Jyrki Katainen. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we chose products like Harley-Davidson, peanut butter and bourbon, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because there are alternatives on the market. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to do anything that would harm consumers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, these products will have a strong symbolic political impact.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd What US products will be hit by the tariffs?

A market-friendly outcome could be a scenario where Iran makes a last-minute U-turn to cooperate, consequently allowing Saudi Arabia and Russia to move forward with a gradual production increase.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b2cd3e7e4b0f6bed51043ab\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-22T10:53:51.997Z\">11.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0d085175e4cfa820337ca01f2e1202ce97e71453\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d085175e4cfa820337ca01f2e1202ce97e71453/0_0_2402_3464/693.jpg\" alt=\"A petrol pump nozzle.\" width=\"693\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Newsflash: UK supermarket chain Asda has cut its fuel prices, in response to recent drops in the oil price.</strong></p> <p>Asda is shaving 2p per litre off its unleaded petrol, and 1p per litre off diesel prices.</p> <p>This follows a fall in crude oil prices - with Brent dropping from $80 per barrel to $74 in the last month.</p> <p>Motorists suffered a surge in prices on the forecourt in recent weeks, as the oil price jumped to its highest levels since 2014.

                "bodyText":"Time to wrap up, after a busy day. Donald Trump has threatened to widen the mounting trade dispute between US and the EU by imposing a 20% tariffs on European cars. The move came as Brussels imposed retaliatory levies on American products including bourbon whiskey, Levi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jeans and Harley-Davidson motorbikes. Shares in European carmaker fell following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning. Traders worried that tariffs could hurt carmakers such as BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen, who all contribute to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus in car sales. The Opel cartel has agreed to raise production levels. Oil producers agreed to boost output by up to one million barrels per day, following intense talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The oil price rose following Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move, as some analysts had expected a larger increase in production. The Bank of England has warned that the UK economy would be badly hurt if China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy crashes. New research found that the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tied to China and Hong Kong were greater than previously thought. Greece has welcomed last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt relief deal, that extends the maturity on some Greek bonds by a decade. Finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has said the Greek government is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153happy with this deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but will not forget the suffering of the last eight years. Creditors in House of Fraser have approved plans to close 31 of its 59 stores with the loss of up to 6,000 jobs. The 169-year old department store chain faced going into administration if its plan to shut stores and impose rent reductions on 10 other outlets was rejected. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW European carmakers would suffer badly if America imposed a 20% tariff on exports. The EU car industry is a major exporter -- selling \u00e2\u201a\u00ac192bn of motor vehicles overseas in 2016. The US is the biggest single export market for EU carmakers, with 25% of all exports. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s followed by China (16%) and Turkey (7%), followed by Japan, South Korea, Russia, Australia, Norway and Canada. However, the European Union only imported \u00e2\u201a\u00ac77bn of cars, meaning it ran a chunky surplus with the rest of the world. Turkish car factories contributed 20% of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car imports, followed by Japan with 19% and then America with 14%. So European carmakers have more to lose if the car trade across the Atlantic were to freeze. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s belligerent demand that European auto firms make cars in America ignores the fact that several already have large factories in the US. Daimler, for example, makes Mercedes SUVs in Alabama. BMW has a large factory in South Carolina. Both factories make cars for export abroad, so they could be badly hit if China imposes tariffs on US-built cars [which is why Daimler issued a profits warning on Wednesday night] Ironically, US carmakers such as Ford and General Motors have partnerships with Chinese firms - meaning most of the cars they sell in China are made locally. Thus, they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be hurt by Chinese tariffs on imports. As the FT put it yesterday: It is one of the tantalising ironies of the trade war between the US and China: German carmakers BMW and Daimler could end up as the biggest losers. After decades of investing in American states that back Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Republican party, the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest car exporters by value are likely to be hurt most. Looking back at the Opec deal.... this chart suggests today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a massive difference to the oil market. It shows that Iraq, Iran and Venezuela are all unable to boost their production. So the total supply increase will be less than the headline figure of one million barrels per day. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opposition Labour party has warned that tit-for-tat tariffs between the US and Europe will cost jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. Barry Gardiner MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow International Trade Secretary, says president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel industry will backfire. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald Trump said he would welcome a trade war and could win it but the workers in the motorbike factories in Wisconsin, Missouri and Pennsylvania are the foot soldiers he is prepared to sacrifice. Nobody wins in a trade war and Donald Trump may finally come to realise that his attack on steel workers in Europe was not such a good idea after all, as the European Union is forced to reciprocate with retaliatory tariffs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to see a trade war and, ultimately, these tariffs need to be removed by both sides as we begin to work together to address the real issue of global overcapacity in steel and unfair market practices. Shares in European carmakers are falling, as Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose tariffs sends a shiver through the sector. Fiat has shed 2.6%, BMW are down 2.1% and Daimler (which issued a tariff-related profits warning this week) have lost another 1.1%. American auto-makers are also suffering; traders may be anticipating retaliatory action from Europe against US cars. Newsflash: Donald Trump has just threatened to impose fresh tariffs on European carmakers. In a tweet (what else?) the US president said his administration would make EU cars 20% more expensive in the US, unless Europe lowered its tariffs and barriers on US products. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat comes as Europe starts to impose fresh tariffs on US goods, in retaliation to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs on steel and aluminium from the EU. Bourbon whiskey, Levi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jeans and Harley-Davidson motorbikes imported from the US are all on the list of US products which will now cost rather more in Europe. The oil price is continuing to strengthen following Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement - which will not please Donald Trump! Brent crude (sourced from the North Sea) is up over 2% now at $74.64 per barrel. US crude oil has jumped by 3%, or two dollars per barrel, to $67.58. Analysts at Danske Bank say today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement should keep oil prices up in the months ahead. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) today agreed to lift output by one million barrels per day, effective from 1 July. The aim of the deal is to return total compliance to the current output agreement to 100%. Compliance has been well above 100% this year since some countries, notably Venezuela, have seen a drop in production. The price of Brent crude rose about $1/barrel to above \u00e2\u201a\u00ac75/barrel on the news. The fact that oil prices are rising when OPEC is returning supply to the market reflects a concern in the market heading into the meeting that OPEC would agree to raise output further than the level needed to ensure 100% compliance. For the rest of the year, the deal today reduces the upside risk to prices from the risk of lower output in, e.g. Iran and Venezuela, since OPEC now effectively has established a mechanism which opens the way for other countries to increase production correspondingly. Reminder, Iran has been unwilling to accept a supply boost, at a time when US sanctions are hurting its energy sector. Saudi Arabia, though, had pushed for an increase - under pressure from Trump to get energy prices down. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement looks (at first glance) like a compromise. Output will go up, but in practice by less than some analysts had expected. President Donald Trump may have missed the boat. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just tweeted that Opec must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantially\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd increase oil production, but of course the agreement has already been announced. Unless Trump is getting his dissatisfaction in early... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official: Opec has reached an agreement to raise oil production by up to one million barrels per day. UAE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy minister Suhail Al Mazrouei, who is also OPEC president, has just announced the plan in Vienna. It partly unwinds the 1.2m bpd cut which Opec agreed back in 2016, which helped to drive the oil price higher. Al Mazrouei told reporters that the increase is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a little bit less than 1 million barrels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd above Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current output. However, in practice the increase will be less - because many Opec members aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in a position to raise their output. Al Mazrouei said Opec had made \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the best choice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, balancing the interests of its members and other producers. Opec also hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t revealed which countries will raise their output, and by how much. Leaving the meeting, Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy minister said the deal added up to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153less than 700,000 barrels per day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in practice. Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy minister, Khalid al Falih, said the agreement would allow countries with spare production capacity to boost output. Newsflash: House of Fraser has been given approval by creditors to close 31 stores, resulting in up to 6,000 job losses, the Press Association reports. That follows this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with HoF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s landlords, where they were asked to vote on a plan to shut more than half its stores and cut the rent on another 10 of its 59 outlets. Oxford Economics predicts that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal (if confirmed) will push the oil price higher. Journalists in Vienna are waiting patiently for the Opec press conference begin. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chatter that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s communique will focus on getting Opec members to comply with the current production curbs. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is rallying hard today, partly thanks to the jump in the oil price. The FTSE 100 has gained 98 points, or 1.3%, to 7654 points. Mining companies and energy producers are leading the rally, with BP up 3% and Royal Dutch Shell up 2.7%. Or maybe not... An Opec announcement could be imminent... Back in the UK, the Bank of England has warned that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy poses a greater risk to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability than previously realised. New analysis from the Bank has found that a Chinese \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard landing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 would have a serious impact on the UK economy. If China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit boom blows up, Britain will suffer serious economic harm, they say. As the BoE puts it: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit boom is now one of the largest and longest running ever recorded. Indeed, rapid credit expansions, such as China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, have typically preceded financial crises. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economists have forecast that a modest shock would knock 3% off China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP, and reduce UK GDP by up to 0.5%. A full-blown financial crisis that wiped 10% off China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy would knock 1.4% off Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP, they believe. But the full impact could be twice as bad, due to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcamplification effects\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that would drive down asset prices and rock the currency markets. The Bank warns: We find that the effects via standard channels from a modest fall in Chinese GDP are larger than our previous estimates, primarily due to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasing role in global trade. A more extreme shock which triggers amplification mechanisms \u00e2\u20ac\u201d such as a larger financial market reaction \u00e2\u20ac\u201d could potentially double the effects from the standard channels alone.... The financial market reaction to a China crash is as yet untested; hence, a more extreme shock to exchange rates and asset prices could occur, resulting in greater declines in demand for UK exports and wealth and investor confidence. The BoE has also calculated that the City is more exposed to China than previously thought, thanks to its links with Hong Kong. Unlike most countries, the UK is unique in having both sizable direct exposures to mainland China, and indirectly via UK banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exposures to Hong Kong. Together, UK banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exposures to mainland China and Hong Kong exceed exposures to the US, euro area, Japan and Korea combined, despite the UK economy being a fifteenth of the size of these economies combined. You can read the report here. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing official from Opec yet.... Bloomberg and Reuters are both reporting that Opec has agreed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcin principle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to lift their production cap by one million barrels per day. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what the Saudis have been lobbying for at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, following pressure from Donald Trump to push oil prices down. But the actual increase will actually only be 600,000bpd, compared to what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually being produced today, as not every Opec member can boost production. Oil is actually pushing higher on the back of this news, with Brent crude now up 2% at $74.40 per barrel. Another newsflash from Vienna: Opec ministers have been discussing how to ensure everyone is fully complying with the supply freeze agreed in 2016: Reuters newsflash: OPEC SOURCE SAYS MINISTERS ARE NEARING AN AGREEMENT My colleague Adam Vaughan reports that Opec ministers are inching towards a deal. From Vienna, he writes: Major oil producers are set to pump around 1m more barrels a day to help cool crude prices as part of an Opec deal, according to Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy minister. Khalid Al-Falih said he was hopeful an agreement would be reached on Friday, minutes after meeting Iran, which has been the key holdout to a rise in output. Delegates privy to the negotiations in Vienna told the Guardian that talks had been fraught but they thought the cartel could maintain unity despite divisions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An agreement was reached yesterday to release the equivalent of about 1m barrels to the market; it will be distributed pro rata,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Al-Falih said on Friday, of an Opec committee meeting on Thursday. The deal has not been formally signed off yet, however. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Saudi Arabia is unique. All of our spare capacity is available at short notice,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. He acknowledged not all of the cartel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s members could increase output, in a reference to countries such as Venezuela. More here: If you own an Aston Martin, then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re probably not short of a few bob already. But the luxury carmaker is keen that its rich customers should get even richer, by offering them cheap shares in its upcoming stock market float. Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Kleinman has the details: James Bond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carmaker is drawing up plans to hand millions of pounds of discounted stock to wealthy customers as part of a London listing expected to value it at up to \u00c2\u00a35bn. Sky News has learnt that Aston Martin is working on incorporating a customer share offer into an initial public offering (IPO) that has been earmarked for the autumn. Details of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans have yet to be finalised, but are expected to be unveiled alongside a new employee share scheme at the time of the long-awaited flotation. If it proceeds, the customer offer would form part of efforts by Aston Martin to build demand for its shares in what would be one of the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most prominent stock market listings for many years. Of course, shareholders would normally only make gains if Aston Martin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares rise after the float. But the beauty with discounted shares is that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re much more likely to make a profit..... Opec insiders report that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153closed door\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd session of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting has begun. With the cameras switched off, and no journalists in the room, this is the opportunity for energy ministers to agree production increases, or not.... Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says the financial markets are increasingly edgy about today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meeting. The clashes between Saudi Arabia and Iran over whether to increase production has created \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a growing sense of uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he says: And while Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal is important, traders are also wondering whether the cartel can maintain its current agreement with Russia to curb production. That deal has been crucial in keeping output down, and prices up. Otunuga says: While Saudi Arabia and Russia have proposed to ease supply curbs, other members including Iran, Iraq, Algeria and Venezuela are against such a move. With Iran already storming out of preparatory discussions yesterday, investors should fasten their seat belts in preparation for potential fireworks today. If Iran continues to reject the deal to raise output and gathers support from other cartel members, talks are at risk of ending in an impasse. Such an undesirable outcome is likely to create uncertainty and will spark fears over the future of OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 18-month agreement with Russia to limit production. A market-friendly outcome could be a scenario where Iran makes a last-minute U-turn to cooperate, consequently allowing Saudi Arabia and Russia to move forward with a gradual production increase. Newsflash: UK supermarket chain Asda has cut its fuel prices, in response to recent drops in the oil price. Asda is shaving 2p per litre off its unleaded petrol, and 1p per litre off diesel prices. This follows a fall in crude oil prices - with Brent dropping from $80 per barrel to $74 in the last month. Motorists suffered a surge in prices on the forecourt in recent weeks, as the oil price jumped to its highest levels since 2014. Asda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move suggests other retailers could also trim prices.... Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister told has reporters that Opec won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply take instructions from Donald Trump, who has been lobbying for lower oil prices. Associated Press has the details: Iranian oil minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said as the group met Friday that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we are not here to receive instruction from President Trump and apply it and implement it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked whether he supports increasing production, he replied: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some of the countries are against any increase, and ask them. I am not representative of them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As mentioned earlier, Zanganeh also said $70 per barrel was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd oil price, AP adds. Back in Vienna, security officers have now emptied the Opec meeting of journalists, so the serious negotiations can get underway. Here are some photos of the main players speaking to reporters: Back in London, landlords are arriving to vote on House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal to shut half its stores and lay off 6,000 staff. Most people heading into the meeting refused to comment but those who did speak said they thought the vote would be approved. House of Fraser are making the cuts to preserve the rest of their business. If creditors reject the plan (a company voluntary arrangement), then the whole business could collapse. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meeting has been difficult, Ecuador\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister Carlos Perez tells us. Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Khalid Al-Falih tells us he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hoping to get a deal to increase production limits today. Across the conference room in Vienna, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh is also surrounded by journalists. Zanganeh is a crucial player at this meeting, having walked out of talks on a production increase yesterday. He says that this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with the Saudi delegation was good, and that Iran is happy with oil at $70 per barrel (Brent crude is trading at $74 today). Asked if a deal will be reached today, Zanganeh says cryptically that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we are cooking something\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Kuwait\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister says he will support a production increase of one million barrel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s per day (Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal), or less. Boom: Iraq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister has told Adam that a change in Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s targets will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153definitely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd be agreed today. No-one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggesting that supply targets will be reduced, so this suggests an increase will be waved through. Saudi oil minister Khalid Al-Falih is surrounded by a gaggle of reporters seeking answers. He insists that no-one should expect to see an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immediate flood\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of oil onto the market following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Oil supply release will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gradual\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Al-Falih says, suggesting the impact of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be seen until the end of the summer. Al-Falih is talking about a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnominal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 increase in production of one million barrels per day, split between Opec and non-Opec members. But in practice the actual increase will be less, he reckons Finally, the oil ministers are taking their seats in Vienna. Energy reporters have been unleashed from their imprisonment on the stairwell, and are firing questions now.... While Saudi Arabia and Iran negotiate, scores of journalists are still kettled on a stairwell waiting to be allowed into the meeting. My colleague Adam Vaughan reports that some are even wearing trainers, to give them an advantage in the race to speak to ministers. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Amanda Cooper reports that other \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcside meetings\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 are now taking place, as ministers continue to haggle about production levels... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy reminder of what the various Opec ministers hope to achieve today, from Jon Andersson, head of commodities at Vontobel Asset Management. Saudi Arabia want OPEC+ (OPEC and Russia) to increase production to please the US. In other words they want to show a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbearish\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 headline number to demonstrate to the US that they are listening and playing their part in balancing the market. Russia wants OPEC+ to increase production because they together with Saudi Arabia are the only ones that can significantly increase production in the near and medium term. In addition they will not be able to increase production during the winter so they strongly favour a decision to increase now compare to later this year. Iran don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want OPEC+ to increase production because they will be forced to reduce production as a consequence of US sanctions. Current expected loss around 1 million barrels per day All the other OPEC and non OPEC participants will play along. So what might happen? Andersson sees two likely scenarios: If OPEC increase by 500,000 to 1 million barrels per day, that will offset the expected loss from Iran in H2. A possible (but unlikely) scenario is that Iran veto an production increase and that OPEC decide to postpone the decision to the next OPEC meeting in September. The Opec meeting is running late! The opening session should have started 45 minutes ago, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a hiatus. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a rumour that Iranian oil minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh and his Saudi counterpart Khalid A. Al-Falih are holding a private meeting. Presumably they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to reach agreement on production limits before the meeting formally starts - when journalists are allowed to quiz minister. Amir Paivar of BBC Persian TV makes a good point: Why should Iran agree to boost Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s production targets when US sanctions are squeezing Iranian supplies down? Last week Donald Trump tweeted that Opec was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcat it again\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - keeping oil prices too high. Presumably the president wants to put pressure on the cartel, but this intervention means Iran won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to lose face today..... A date for your diaries..... Impressive can-kicking, even by eurozone standards! Jake Robbins, Manager of the Global Alpha Growth Fund at Premier Asset Management, thinks Opec will probably agree to pump more oil at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153OPEC look likely to raise production targets for the first time since late 2016, with the likes of Russia looking to cash in on the much improved oil price since the introduction of the policy. OPEC has been surprisingly disciplined over the past couple of years and successfully pushed oil to levels that are now profitable for the majority of producers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unfortunately for OPEC, the higher price has also encouraged further expansion from non-OPEC producers, most notably the US shale producers who have benefitted the most from OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supply constraints. Now some members are keen to also make the most of the higher oil price, particularly many in the Middle East and Russia who require the cash to cover big budget deficits. Any increase will probably end the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bull run\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the oil price, Robbins adds, as it could lead to another oil glut. Anxiety over today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meeting is pushing the oil price higher this morning. Brent crude has gained almost $1 to around $74 per barrel, a rise of 1.3%. That reflects uncertainty over whether Opec ministers will agree a production increase, and how large it will be. Analyst Daniel Lacalle thinks a 500,000 barrel per day increase is most likely - or just half what the Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are aiming for. Despite Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resistance, Opec last night drew up a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpreliminary deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to raise production by around one million barrels per day. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no certainty that Iran will back the deal today, as Bloomberg explains: In a night of drama in Vienna, the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, which includes Russia and Saudi Arabia, recommended a supply boost despite Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, the Iranian oil minister, walking out of the meeting and predicting OPEC won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convince him to back an increase. Iran could wield a veto over any formal deal on Friday, but such a move wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily prevent additional oil coming onto the market. Riyadh could seek to assemble a coalition of countries ready to pump more within their existing agreement, act unilaterally to boost output or abandon the 2016 cuts deal entirely. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meeting is overshadowed by a raft of political tensions, from the Saudi-Iran proxy war in Yemen to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new sanctions against Iran. The AFP newswire points out that Washington is putting the Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s under pressure to lower the oil price, ahead of Congressional elections this autumn. Saudi Arabia, backed by non-member Russia, is now pushing to raise production again in order to meet growing demand in the second half of 2018. But the proposal has run into resistance from Iran, Iraq and Venezuela, who would struggle to immediately raise output and fear losing market share and revenues if other countries open the spigots. Iran is particularly vocal about its objections as it braces for the impact of fresh US sanctions on its oil exports after President Donald Trump quit the international nuclear agreement. But Riyadh, which cheered Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the nuclear pact, is under pressure from Trump to boost output in order to lower oil prices ahead of November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s midterm elections... More here... My colleague Adam Vaughan is attending the Opec meeting in Vienna. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heard that a deal to raise oil production is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153likely today\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Opec oil ministers are meeting in Vienna today for a crunch meeting that could lead to a production boost, or could end in disagreement and disorder. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major oil-producing countries are under pressure from the US, China and Russia to pump more crude and bring down oil prices. But there are divisions at the heart of Opec. Saudi Arabia favours a supply boost, of perhaps one million barrels per day, but Iran, Iraq and Venezuela are all opposed. Yesterday, Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister walked out of preparatory talks, raising the prospect that a deal won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be reached. This split threatens to undermine the consensus at Opec, two years after the group agreed a production freeze that helped to drive oil prices higher. Motorists, consumers, and countries which are net oil importers, would probably welcome a production increase - as it might prevent prices rising higher. Opec members, though, have enjoyed higher oil prices, so will be reluctant to burst the bubble. The meeting starts shortly, but a final decision may not come until Saturday when Russia (not an Opec member) joins discussions Also coming up today: Greece is celebrating after its eurozone creditors finally agreed a debt relief deal that will help Athens exit its bailout programme. Following late-night talks in Luxembourg, eurozone finance ministers hammered out an agreement to make Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge debt pile more manageable. Under the plan, the repayment dates on almost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100bn of bailout loans will be pushed back 10 years, with the earliest repayment deadlines shift from 2023 to 2033. The eurogroup also agreed to hand Greece a final loan tranche of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn. That gives Athens a cash reserve of around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac24bn as it returns to the financial markets in August. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a significant moment, three years after Greece came to brink of leaving the euro area. Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has hailed the decision, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It took a bit longer than we expected, but ended in a very good way. I think it is the end of the Greek crisis ... a historic moment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggles aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over. It will still be under strict supervision from its creditors, even after the bailout ends, and must run high budget surpluses for decades to come to bring its debt pile (at a staggering 180% of GDP) down. Meanwhile in the UK, high street chain House of Fraser is asking its creditors to vote on plans to shut more than half its stores. If the deal goes through today, 31 department stores will close with the loss of 6,000 jobs. If it is rejected, the company could fall into administration. What a choice...

Initially traders were rather complacent that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threats were just a hardball negotiating tactic. However, he has more than proved that his intentions are far more serious and damaging; this realisation has struck market sentiment hard.</p> <p>Global equities are falling sharply today, with indices on both sides of the Atlantic succumbing to losses of over 1%. The fear that is driving the markets here is at what point does this end? How much damage needs to be done to the economies involved and global trade in order for Trump to decide enough. This is a huge uncertainty in this very dangerous game of economic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chicken\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as investors are starting to see US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sino relations sink past the point of no return. In the absence of any optimistic news over the global trading climate, we can expect the current sell off to intensify over the coming sessions.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b310640e4b0385b28423372\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-25T15:13:09.904Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Regarding that tweet from US treasury secretary Mnuchin, Chris Beauchamp at IG said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The new week has begun on a firmly negative footing, as equity indices around the globe suffer heavy losses, with trade wars getting the blame once more. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, the US administration itself appears divided as the Treasury Secretary tweets out that planned measures regarding intellectual property will encompass all countries and not just China.</p> <p>It seems the US is hell-bent on falling out with everyone, increasing the risk that trade wars will do what all the other worries of the past nine years have failed to do \u00e2\u20ac\u201c namely stop the great bull market in equities. The usual havens are in demand as investors seek refuge from the turmoil, with the ten-year Treasury yield dipping below 3% once more \u00e2\u20ac\u201c investor concerns about what a 3% yield would do seem awfully quaint compared to the genuine concerns about the impact of trade wars. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b3102ece4b01266b4b88042\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-25T15:04:06.784Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Falling oil prices in the wake of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision by Opec to increase production - Brent crude is down 1.8% - is another factor in the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market slump.</p> <p>But the trade tensions continue to dominate, and the markets may have been too complacent up until now about the impact to the global econom. Neil Wilson at Markets.com made a number of points about the state of play:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First, markets have been pretty relaxed about the trade war escalation and so the events of recent days necessitate a repricing of risk that is arguably overdue. </p> <p>Second, Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for restrictions on Chinese investment in US companies does mark step up in tensions and makes a full blown trade conflict more likely. Three, taken on their own the restrictions on investments would have a bigger economic impact - i.e. on corporate earnings - than fairly small beer tariffs would if there is no escalation. Four, US equities are still just about flat for the year, which given the massive ramp up through Jan is not a terrible performance. From a technical viewpoint, as long as we see the Dow hold its 200-day SMA - which at time of writing it is managing to do - we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still in an upwards trending channel from the April lows. </p> <p>The US should confirm tariffs on Chinese imports and the investment curbs by the end of this week - it could be a pivotal few days but there is still some hope -albeit fading - that the White House will step back from the brink.

                "bodyText":"The escalation of trade tensions has sent investors scurrying for the sidelines, amid growing fears of an all out global trade war. Reports that Donald Trump planned to block Chinese companies investing in US tech companies and could also restrict tech exports to China set the tone for the day. Comments from the US treasury secretary that the reports were inaccurate did little to limit the damage, especially since Steve Mnuchin suggested the restrictions might not apply just to China. On top of that, the impact of EU tariffs at a company level was demonstrated by the decision of motor bike maker Harley-Davidson to move some production out of the US. The final impact on European markets was pretty grim: The FTSE 100 fell 2.24% or 172.43 points to 7509.84, its worst daily performance since 6 February this year Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax, already weak on worries about the impact of tariffs on its key car producers, dropped 2.46% to 12,270.33 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.92% at 5283.86 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished 2.44% lower at 21,355.19 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 1.78% at 9617.9 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 382 points or 1.55%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest report on the trade wars and Harley-Davidson move which is helping cause the market woes: On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Unsurprisingly in the current circumstances, the VIX volatility index is moving higher: Amid the increasing trade tensions, things could get worse from here for markets, says Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index: Trade war fears appear to be ramping up almost daily. Initially traders were rather complacent that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threats were just a hardball negotiating tactic. However, he has more than proved that his intentions are far more serious and damaging; this realisation has struck market sentiment hard. Global equities are falling sharply today, with indices on both sides of the Atlantic succumbing to losses of over 1%. The fear that is driving the markets here is at what point does this end? How much damage needs to be done to the economies involved and global trade in order for Trump to decide enough. This is a huge uncertainty in this very dangerous game of economic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chicken\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as investors are starting to see US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sino relations sink past the point of no return. In the absence of any optimistic news over the global trading climate, we can expect the current sell off to intensify over the coming sessions. Regarding that tweet from US treasury secretary Mnuchin, Chris Beauchamp at IG said: The new week has begun on a firmly negative footing, as equity indices around the globe suffer heavy losses, with trade wars getting the blame once more. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, the US administration itself appears divided as the Treasury Secretary tweets out that planned measures regarding intellectual property will encompass all countries and not just China. It seems the US is hell-bent on falling out with everyone, increasing the risk that trade wars will do what all the other worries of the past nine years have failed to do \u00e2\u20ac\u201c namely stop the great bull market in equities. The usual havens are in demand as investors seek refuge from the turmoil, with the ten-year Treasury yield dipping below 3% once more \u00e2\u20ac\u201c investor concerns about what a 3% yield would do seem awfully quaint compared to the genuine concerns about the impact of trade wars. Falling oil prices in the wake of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision by Opec to increase production - Brent crude is down 1.8% - is another factor in the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market slump. But the trade tensions continue to dominate, and the markets may have been too complacent up until now about the impact to the global econom. Neil Wilson at Markets.com made a number of points about the state of play: First, markets have been pretty relaxed about the trade war escalation and so the events of recent days necessitate a repricing of risk that is arguably overdue. Second, Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for restrictions on Chinese investment in US companies does mark step up in tensions and makes a full blown trade conflict more likely. Three, taken on their own the restrictions on investments would have a bigger economic impact - i.e. on corporate earnings - than fairly small beer tariffs would if there is no escalation. Four, US equities are still just about flat for the year, which given the massive ramp up through Jan is not a terrible performance. From a technical viewpoint, as long as we see the Dow hold its 200-day SMA - which at time of writing it is managing to do - we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still in an upwards trending channel from the April lows. The US should confirm tariffs on Chinese imports and the investment curbs by the end of this week - it could be a pivotal few days but there is still some hope -albeit fading - that the White House will step back from the brink. Harley Davidson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to pull US jobs is a timely reminder to the administration that trade is not a zero sum game that either won or lost. Although some members of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team seem to be rowing back on the Chinese reports: It is hard to know which would be better: that the US is targeting China alone on technology or that it plans to expand its attacks further afield as well. A bidding war could be on the cards for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading satellite company Inmarsat. Earlier this month US group EchoStar had a bid rejected by Inmarsat, and since then it disclosed a 3% stake in its target. Now Paris-based Eutelsat has said it is currently evaluating its own offer for Inmarsat, pushing the UK group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares around 4% higher. Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline is accelerating, sending other markets lower in its wake, as the global trade tensions continue to grow. Investors have been increasingly concerned about the fallout from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions on tariffs, and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s developments - the threat of more restrictions on China and Harley-Davidson cutting some US production - are confirming their worst fears. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 are down around 1%, with the Nasdaq Composite nearly 1.4% lower on Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tech plans. In Europe the FTSE 100 has dropped 1.9% while in Germany - whose car production would be hard hit by US tariffs - the Dax is down 1.8%. Shares in Carnival, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest cruise company, have dropped more than 8% after it cut its earnings forecast for 2018. In the second quarter it said revenues had risen by 10.4% with earnings per share up from 52 cents a year earlier to 78 cents, helped by higher ticket prices and on-board spending. But increased fuel costs and adverse exchange rates mean that it now expects its full year earnings to be $0.19 a share lower than it forecast in March. A weak start to trading in New York: Ding ding! The US stock market is open for trading....and trade war fears are biting. The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen by 160 points, or 0.65%, to 24,420. Technology shares are dropping, following reports that the Trump administration will block Chinese companies from investing in the US, and also restrict US tech exports to China. Alphabet (Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company) is down by 1.7%, semiconductor maker nVidia is down 2.1% and aircraft maker Boeing is down 2%. Harley Davidson is also dropping, down 2% after outlining its response to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs on US goods. Bloomberg points out that Harley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales in Europe hit their highest level since 2011 last year (as a share of total sales). Clearly the company can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to lose sales in such a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccritical market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (which is why it will swallow the tariff cost itself, while it moves production out of America). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to Harley-Davidson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to move some US production overseas, from former White House press spokesman Tony Fratto.... ING economist Carsten Brzeski isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed either: Peter Alexander of NBC News points out that Donald Trump has previously hailed Harley-Davidson as a great US business. CNN has a good first take on the Harley-Davidson news: Harley-Davidson is already taking a hit in the trade fight between President Trump and European allies. The company is shifting some production of motorcycles for European customers out of the United States to avoid EU retaliatory tariffs. The EU is imposing tariffs on $3.2 billion worth of American goods, including motorcycles, orange juice, bourbon, peanut butter, motorboats, cigarettes and denim. They are a response to the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Europe. For motorcycles, the EU is raising its 6% tariff to 31%. That will make each bike about $2,200 more expensive to export, Harley said. Harley is not raising prices for customers. The company said it will take a hit of $30 million to $45 million for the rest of this year. Harley-Davidson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (HOG) stock fell 2% in premarket trading. Donald Trump won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be happy to hear that Harley-Davidson is moving some production out of America. The president singled out the motorcycle maker in his first State of the Union speech in February 2017, telling Congress that he would help companies like Harley-Davidson sell their goods abroad. As the new president put it: I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House. At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They said that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good. I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales. They told me \u00e2\u20ac\u201d without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent. They weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even asking for change. But I am. I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE. Instead, Trump has provoked the European Union into imposing higher tariffs on \u00c2\u00a32.5bn of US imports, by slapping tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into America. Harley-Davidson isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only US company being hurt by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs. A nail manufacturer in the mid-west state of Missouri says it has lost 50% of its business in two weeks, thanks to the new tariffs on steel imports. Mid Continent Nail Corporation imports steel wire from Mexico, so has seen prices surge to uncompetitive levels thanks to the 25% tariff on imports imposed by Trump earlier this year. The company has already laid off 60 temporary staff, and could axe another 200 by the end of July unless it gets a tariff exemption, quickly. According to local news outlet Missourinet, Mid Continent Nail Corporation produces half of the nails made in America, but has seen orders tumble as customers find cheaper products elsewhere. Shares in Harley-Davidson have fallen almost 2% in pre-market trading in New York. Traders are calculating that absorbing the $100m annual cost of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs will hurt Harley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet know how many US jobs will be affected by Harley-Davidson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to move some production from America to Europe. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s base in Milwaukee, Wisconsin could be hit badly. Wisconsin is one of the rural states that backed Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, heartened by his promise to Make America Great Again and bring jobs back home. Harley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement, though, shows that trade wars aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good and easy to win\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as Trump once claimed.... NEWSFLASH: Harley-Davidson is planning to move some manufacturing out of America in response to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs on motorcycle imports. Harley-Davidson has just announced that the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs will have a serious impact on its business. The average tariffs on a Harley will rose to 31%, from 6% today, adding $2,200 to the average price of a motorcycle exported from the US to Europe. Such a burden could make Harley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s uncompetitive in Europe. So the company has decided it must shift production of motorcycles for EU destinations from the US to its international facilities to avoid the tariff burden. The company says: Harley-Davidson expects ramping-up production in international plants will require incremental investment and could take at least 9 to 18 months to be fully complete. It says this is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153only sustainable option\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to ensure Harleys can still be sold in Europe (where it sold almost 40,000 last year). It says: Increasing international production to alleviate the EU tariff burden is not the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preference, but represents the only sustainable option to make its motorcycles accessible to customers in the EU and maintain a viable business in Europe. That could be serious blow to Harley workers in America - and a stark example of the damage that a trade dispute can cause. Europe implemented tariffs on imports of US goods, including motorbikes and bourbon, in response to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs on steel and aluminium. In the short term, Harley says it will absorb the cost of the tariffs, rather than passing it onto customers - costing it up t0 $100m per year It says: Harley-Davidson believes the tremendous cost increase, if passed onto its dealers and retail customers, would have an immediate and lasting detrimental impact to its business in the region, reducing customer access to Harley-Davidson products and negatively impacting the sustainability of its dealers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 businesses. Therefore, Harley-Davidson will not raise its manufacturer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggested retail prices or wholesale prices to its dealers to cover the costs of the retaliatory tariffs. The Stoxx 600 index of European shares is on track for its biggest one-day fall in a month, according to Reuters data. European car firms are partly to blame, following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose 20% tariffs on auto imports from the EU. Renault are down 2.8%, Daimler has lost 2.5, while car parts firm Continental has shed 3.6% (fewer car sales means less demand for tires and brakes). Analysts at FXPro say traders are shunning riskier assets, thanks to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s repeated threats to impose tariffs on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading partners. Over the weekend President Trump indicated that if trade barriers and tariffs against the US were not removed that he would have no choice but to add further sanctions against those countries targeting the US. The stock market selloff is gathering pace. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is now down 96 points, or 1.2%. Mining stocks are helping to drive the selloff, with Anglo American down 3.3% and Antofagasta losing 2.6% - and dragging the sector down to a seven-week low. That reflects concerns that a trade war will hurt global growth, and dampen demand for commodities like iron ore, copper and nickel. Oil giants are also falling, matching a drop in the price of crude after the Opec cartel agreed to raise production levels last week. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: With a troublesome US open on the horizon, the European indices saw their losses intensify as Monday went on. The FTSE was one of the worst performers at the start of the week. Not only was the UK index dealing with the same trade war fears gripping its peers, it also had to process Brent Crude\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.2% decline, a move that took the black stuff back towards $74.50 per barrel and left Shell and BP down 1.1% and 1.8% respectively. This in turn forced the FTSE 90 points lower, taking the index back under 7600 and only 50 points away from last Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 7 week nadir. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is defying today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downturn, after Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an was reelected as the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president last night. The Istanbul bourse has jumped by 1%, although the Turkish lira is sliding after an early rally. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AKP party won 52.5% of the votes, giving it an unexpected outright majority in a crucial election for Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency has sweeping new powers to appoint officials and set security policies, following a constitutional shake-up last year. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has promised to use his new powers to fight terrorism and improve Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubled economy. But having overseen a crackdown since an attempted coup in 2016, Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is likely to keep running Turkey in an autocratic manner. Vincent-Fre\u00c4\u203ade\u00c4\u203aric Mivelaz of Swiss Bank explains: Erdogan is likely to act unilaterally (in politics and economics) without consulting the opposition. Among the five parties making the parliamentary threshold of winning 10% of votes, cooperation will not be easy. The constitutional reform of April 2017 reinforces the power of the president (abolishing the office of the Prime Minister, allowing direct appointment of top officials, allowing intervention in the legal system and state-of-emergency powers) and its allies in the Nationalist Movement Party in the parliament. Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alliance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is projected to win 342 seats out of 600 in the parliament, giving little power to the opposition. Emerging markets expert Charlie Robertson of Renaissance Capital warns that Turkey faces troubles ahead. The US stock market is heading for losses when trading begins in almost four hours time. The futures market suggests the Dow Jones industrial average will drop by 150 point, or 0.7%. The technology-focused Nasdaq could lose 1%, amid concerns that tech companies are being dragged into Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade dispute with China. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank tried to calm nervous investors yesterday. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China relaxed the rules on commercial banks, allowing them to hold less cash. That should encourage them to pump more than $100bn of liquidity into the economy, to help Chinese firms. But this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to prevent another day of falling share prices in Shanghai - where the market lost more than 1% today. After two hours trading, European stock markets are falling deeper into the red. The FTSE 100 has now shed almost 1%, down 70 points at 7612. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has lost 1.2%, helping to knock the Europe-wide Stoxx 600 down by around 1% too. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Blue Monday in the markets. The dark mood over global markets returns, on increasing pessimism that a full-blown U.S.-China trade war may be unavoidable. Technology firms are leading the selloff, following those reports that American firms will be blocked from selling some tech to China - and that Chinese firms will not be allowed to invest in US rivals. In London, IT firm Micro Focus has fallen over 4%. Chipmakers such as BE Semiconductor (-3.7%) and Infinion (-2.7%) are also suffering. Odeluga explains why the markets are worried: The latest White House trade restriction against China might be an unprecedented ban of firms, at least 25% Chinese-owned, from investing in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153industrially significant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd U.S. technology companies. If the Treasury proposals, outlines of which were reported by the Wall Street Journal, are enacted, Beijing would have little choice but to react in kind. That could mean potential clampdowns on U.S. technology firms active in China, from the smallest to the largest. Newsflash: EU banks aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t properly prepared for the risk of a hard Brexit, according to the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top European watchdog. In a new report, the European Banking Authority has warned that financial institutions haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drawn up contingency plans in case Britain leaves the EU without a deal in March 2019. Crucially, the EBA is concerned that London and Brussels may not agree a transition deal that would allow UK-based banks to maintain their current links with Europe, and vice versa. The EBA also urges banks not to assume that politicians will find a magic solution to the trillions of pounds worth of cross-Channel contracts that could be left in limbo after Brexit. The EBA warns that: a) progress in the preparations of financial institutions for the potential departure of the UK from the EU without a ratified withdrawal agreement in March 2019 is inadequate; b) the recent political agreement on a transition period, while welcome, does not provide any legal certainty until a withdrawal agreement is ratified at the end of the process for the departure of the UK from the EU; c) there remains a material possibility that, despite the best efforts of both sides to conclude a ratified withdrawal agreement, this may not be possible, in which case the UK would leave the EU on 30 March 2019 by operation of law without a transition period; and d) the necessary mitigating actions take time, and should be pursued without further delay Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full report Ouch: German business morale has deteriorated, as the threat of a trade war casts a shadow over Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. Munich\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IFO institute has reported its business climate index has dropped to 101.8 this month, down from 102.3 in May. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that German businesses are finding life tougher this year. IFO chief Clemens Fuest explained. Companies were less satisfied with their current business situation. Their business expectations, by contrast, remained slightly optimistic. The tailwind enjoyed by the German economy is calming down. After a strong 2017, the IFO survey has been deteriorating for much of this year. Carsten Brzeski of ING points out that domestic political tensions in Germany are also hurting the economy, as Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition threatens to split over migration The next two weeks could dramatically change the political landscape in Germany and in a worst case scenario even lead to a fall of the government and new elections. For the economy, this would mean further delays of the urgently needed investments, new structural reforms and strengthening of the monetary union. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always hope... Six drops and one stagnation in the last seven months or in other (soccer) words: six losses and one draw. This is clearly not a promising trend. However, as seen last Saturday in the World Cup match between Germany and Sweden, never count out Germany. Hope dies last, even if it takes until the very last second. Even before these latest threats, there were concerns that trade war fears are hurting the global economy. Yesterday the Bank of International Settlements (which represents central banks) warned that growth could falter if nations imposed more protectionist measures on each other. BIS chief Agust\u00c3\u00adn Carstens warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Indeed, there are signs that the rise in uncertainty associated with the first protectionist steps and the ratcheting up of rhetoric have already been inhibiting investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Wall Street Journal says the Trump administration is determined to protect US companies from having their tech secrets snaffled by Chinese rivals. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got trillions of dollars seeking our crown jewels of technology,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said White House trade adviser Peter Navarro last week. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There has to be a defense against that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Financial Times says Chinese investment in America could tumble, if Trump blocks China from buying into US tech companies. According to the Rhodium Group consultancy, Chinese foreign direct investment in the US plunged more than 90 per cent to just $1.8bn in the first half of 2018 compared with the same period last year. In 2016, Chinese companies made a record $46bn in foreign direct investment in the US. The exact scope of the investment measures has been the subject of internal discussions in the Trump administration in recent days, say people familiar with the debate. It is unclear how quickly restrictions would take effect and if they would apply to Chinese investments in venture capital funds, which provide much of the seed money for US technology start-ups. But according to officials and people briefed on the discussions, the administration has decided to restrict China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to invest in or acquire US companies in the industries identified by Beijing in its so-called Made in China 2025 plan. Xi Jinping, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, has set a goal of leading the world in those ten sectors, which include aerospace, AI, robotics, medical devices and railways. US firms are concerned that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be blocked from selling some tech products to China, says Politico: Like the tariffs that Trump imposed on $50 billion in Chinese imports \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and those he has threatened to impose on $400 billion more if Beijing retaliates \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the new investment restrictions and export controls are intended to pressure China to stop unfair trade practices that threaten the United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 technological leadership. Trump is expected to invoke his emergency powers to protect national and economic security to put the restrictions in place. But the administration is already getting pushback from bureaucrats who think it would be a misuse of the export control system, and from businesses that fear the approach will further disadvantage U.S. firms trying to enter the Chinese market Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest threat against China has hit European markets. Shares are down across the region in early trading, with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX both losing 0.6%. The threat that Chinese firms could be blocked from investing in US tech companies has worried the City, as Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains In the latest escalation of the trade war Trump has decided to take aim at Chinese investments. A draft series of restrictions on inbound Chinese investments are due to be published later this week, in a move which could have great long-term consequences on the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sino economic relationship. Once again details remain very sketchy, with the scope of such a measure still under discussion. It is now very difficult to get away from the fact that neither side has any intention of backing down in this game of economic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chicken\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of a trade war between America and China have ratcheted up another notch, hitting confidence in the markets. Overnight, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emerged that President Donald Trump is drawing up a fresh crackdown on Chinese investment in the US. New rules, which could be announced within days, would prevent firms with at least 25% Chinese ownership from acquiring American companies involved in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcindustrially significant technology\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, such as robotics, electronic cars and aerospace. Trump is also planning to restrict US companies from selling certain technologies to China, using \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enhanced export controls\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to the Wall Street Journal. Such a move would further damage relations between Washington and Beijing, following the threat of tit-for-tat tariffs. The Trump administration is embracing increasingly aggressive restrictions on what they see as China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unfair trade practices. These latest measures could undermine China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to become a world leader in emerging technologies. As the WSJ explains: The twin initiatives, set to be announced by the end of the week, are designed to prevent Beijing from moving ahead with plans outlined in its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made in China 2025\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd report to become a global leader in 10 broad areas of technology. The Treasury Department is crafting rules that would block firms with at least 25% Chinese ownership from buying companies involved in what the White House calls \u00e2\u20ac\u0153industrially significant technology.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ceiling may end up lower than that, according to people familiar with discussions finalizing the plans. The news has hit Asian markets, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite indices both falling by 1%. European stock markets are expected to follow suit, with the FTSE 100 dropping in early trading. Last Friday, Trump threatened to impose new tariffs on European car makers, declaring that they should set up factories in America instead. That rocked the share prices of Fiat, BMW and Daimler. Trump also fired a warning shot at America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade partners over the weekend. The president tweeted that they must drop trade barriers and tariffs - even as he slaps them on US imports - or else... No wonder investors are worried.... Also coming up today... We get the new IFO survey of German business morale, which may show another decline, plus the latest US home sales. In Dublin, Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank and the International Monetary Fund are hosting a two-day conference on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the euro at 20\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It will examine the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance over its first two (sometimes turbulent) decades. IMF Christine Lagarde will give the opening speech this morning.

Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is little reason to believe that this respite from the recent selling in the larger markets is anything more than a breather before the pressure starts once more. </p> <p>No one is showing any signs of backing down in the escalating and dangerous trade war that was started by the US. Today, the focus of US President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ire is iconic motor cycle manufacturer Harley Davidson, which is threatening to get round the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliatory import tariffs by increasing production outside the US. Trump is warning the company of a big tax being levied should it move production to Thailand, and we are seeing an important proxy play out for future cases given the growing impact this trade war is having on US-based firms.</p> <p>US consumer confidence has taken a knock this month, with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conference Board survey highlighting a particularly noticeable decline in future expectations. While many believe that the US will emerge in an improved economic standing in the aftermath of this current trade war, the fact is that we have a huge degree of anxiety over how this will play out. With China eradicating tariffs on Soybeans (one of the biggest US exports to China) from five Asian countries, it is clear that China is positioning itself for a further breakdown in US-China trade relations.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b32596ae4b0bef28bb9a648\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-26T15:21:43.383Z\">4.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There may not be a full blown trade war but markets will continue to be hit by the continuing tensions, says Ingvild Borgen Gjerde at Capital Economics:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite the small rebound in equity markets today, fears of a global trade war have increased further this week. This, together with a likely slowdown in the US economy next year, will probably continue to weigh on equities.</p> <p>The news over the weekend that the US is taking further steps towards implementing protectionist policies, and that it is broadening its approach, strengthen the perception that we are genuinely moving closer to a full-blown trade war. This, rather than the proposed measures themselves, explains yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off in equity markets.</p> <p>Information technology (IT) stocks were hit particularly hard yesterday, which is not surprising. Admittedly, the measures are meant to protect US technology. But they could hurt the sales of US IT firms in China, or limit their ability to operate there.</p> <p>However, some of the stocks that fell the most in the US were consumer discretionary stocks, with very limited exposure to China. And some of the IT firms with larger-than-average exposure to China fared better than those with less exposure.</p> <p>Indeed, the stocks of the so-called FAANGs, the group of large US consumer discretionary and IT firms, were among the hardest hit stocks in the US yesterday. (See Chart.) This follows surprisingly strong performance so far this year, and suggestions that the FAANGs are emerging as some form of safe haven amid rising global trade tensions.</p> <p>....We disagree with this notion. While most of the FAANGs might not be very exposed to China, they are still highly cyclical. They are therefore particularly vulnerable, as a trade war would raise the risk of an economic slowdown.</p> <p>We still do not anticipate a full-blown trade war, and we do not expect the protectionist measures implemented or proposed thus far to kill the current economic expansion on their own....However, as equity markets usually lead the economy rather than the other way around, the current escalation of trade tensions is adding to the pressure on global equity markets. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, cyclical sectors remain particularly vulnerable in this environment, with or without exposure to China. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b324fd9e4b0bef28bb9a5a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-26T14:39:21.213Z\">3.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Markets are managing to hold on to their - fairly limited - gains.

It has been heading lower for a while and is down another $8 an ounce to $1257 so far today. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Gold has been falling sharply of late, dropping by a good $50 in the space of nine trading days. At the time of writing, the yellow precious metal was trading around $1257, its lowest level since December 18. The perceived safe haven metal has been unable to find much demand from flows out of the equity markets which have been tumbling amid concerns over global trade disputes and the outlook for rising interest rates.</p> <p> Indeed, the trend of central banks turning hawkish has continued in recent weeks. The Fed has indicated that it will probably raise borrowing costs two more times this year, while the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE will end at the end of this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c albeit the first rate rise has been delayed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and there are now more hawks at the BOE (3) than expected (2). </p> <p> As central banks tighten monetary conditions, yields could rise further. This means the opportunity cost of holding noninterest-bearing assets like gold will increase (on a relative basis) along with expectations for higher borrowing costs. Unfortunately for gold, which is priced in the dollar, interest rate expectations in the US have been rising faster than in other regions. This has helped to underpin the dollar and undermine foreign currencies, and pressurised buck-denominated gold further. </p> <p> Thus, for gold to make a meaningful comeback, the dollar will have to depreciate and depreciate sharply. This can only happen if incoming US macro data were to deteriorate sharply, or the global economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in particular, the EU \u00e2\u20ac\u201c starts to expand at a faster pace than the US economy. However, as things stand, this looks unlikely and we therefore may see further dollar strength in the coming days and weeks. So, the outlook for gold looks bleak. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fc3645165db580f3939650d1b298177a42b54f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fc3645165db580f3939650d1b298177a42b54f3/0_125_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gold bars at YLG Bullion International Ltd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gold bars at YLG Bullion International Ltd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b323c19e4b025d39df45154\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-26T13:15:50.246Z\">2.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A few minutes until Wall Street opens and the futures market is predicting the US markets - like those in Europe - will stage a minor recovery.

                "bodyText":"With enthusiasm draining away as the close of trading approached, European markets failed to hold on to the bulk of their early gains, limited as these were anyway. The fears about a trade war after Donald Trump raised the stakes in his attacks on China and elsewhere continued to dominate sentiment. A rise in the oil price gave a lift to the FTSE 100 but elsewhere markets slipped back by the close, in some cases into negative territory. An early rise on Wall Street did little to support shares elsewhere. So the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 28.08 points or 0.37% at 7537.92 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.29% to 12,234.34 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.05% at 5281.29 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB edged up 0.3% to 21,419.27 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.2% at 9637.4 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 80 points or 0.34%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the latest on the spat between Donald Trump and Harley-Davidson over trade tariffs: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the criticism of the Bank of England over its expenses: On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. A London magistrates court says Uber can continue operating in London, but for a trial period: A court decided the ride-hailing firm should be awarded a new, 15-month probationary licence, after being told of sweeping changes to its practices. The ride-hailing firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future in one of its biggest global markets had been in jeopardy after Transport for London ruled last September that it was not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fit and proper\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to hold a private hire vehicles operator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s licence. At the start of a two-day hearing, Uber admitted that London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original decision not to renew its five-year licence had been correct. TfL cited concerns about public safety and security, including reporting of crimes, and background checks on drivers. But Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyers convinced Westminster magistrates court that it had since cleaned up its act, while continuing to operate in the capital pending its appeal. Chief magistrate, Emma Arbuthnot, said that Uber should pay all costs of the appeal. TfL\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyer said a figure of \u00c2\u00a3425,000 had been agreed. Our full report is here: The nervous gain made by markets in the wake of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls is hardly a convincing recovery. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: There is little reason to believe that this respite from the recent selling in the larger markets is anything more than a breather before the pressure starts once more. No one is showing any signs of backing down in the escalating and dangerous trade war that was started by the US. Today, the focus of US President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ire is iconic motor cycle manufacturer Harley Davidson, which is threatening to get round the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliatory import tariffs by increasing production outside the US. Trump is warning the company of a big tax being levied should it move production to Thailand, and we are seeing an important proxy play out for future cases given the growing impact this trade war is having on US-based firms. US consumer confidence has taken a knock this month, with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conference Board survey highlighting a particularly noticeable decline in future expectations. While many believe that the US will emerge in an improved economic standing in the aftermath of this current trade war, the fact is that we have a huge degree of anxiety over how this will play out. With China eradicating tariffs on Soybeans (one of the biggest US exports to China) from five Asian countries, it is clear that China is positioning itself for a further breakdown in US-China trade relations. There may not be a full blown trade war but markets will continue to be hit by the continuing tensions, says Ingvild Borgen Gjerde at Capital Economics: Despite the small rebound in equity markets today, fears of a global trade war have increased further this week. This, together with a likely slowdown in the US economy next year, will probably continue to weigh on equities. The news over the weekend that the US is taking further steps towards implementing protectionist policies, and that it is broadening its approach, strengthen the perception that we are genuinely moving closer to a full-blown trade war. This, rather than the proposed measures themselves, explains yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off in equity markets. Information technology (IT) stocks were hit particularly hard yesterday, which is not surprising. Admittedly, the measures are meant to protect US technology. But they could hurt the sales of US IT firms in China, or limit their ability to operate there. However, some of the stocks that fell the most in the US were consumer discretionary stocks, with very limited exposure to China. And some of the IT firms with larger-than-average exposure to China fared better than those with less exposure. Indeed, the stocks of the so-called FAANGs, the group of large US consumer discretionary and IT firms, were among the hardest hit stocks in the US yesterday. (See Chart.) This follows surprisingly strong performance so far this year, and suggestions that the FAANGs are emerging as some form of safe haven amid rising global trade tensions. ....We disagree with this notion. While most of the FAANGs might not be very exposed to China, they are still highly cyclical. They are therefore particularly vulnerable, as a trade war would raise the risk of an economic slowdown. We still do not anticipate a full-blown trade war, and we do not expect the protectionist measures implemented or proposed thus far to kill the current economic expansion on their own....However, as equity markets usually lead the economy rather than the other way around, the current escalation of trade tensions is adding to the pressure on global equity markets. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, cyclical sectors remain particularly vulnerable in this environment, with or without exposure to China. Markets are managing to hold on to their - fairly limited - gains. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positivity managed to carry over into the US session, though the gains were nothing compared to Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. The Dow Jones managed to rise 0.3% after the bell, sending the beleaguered US index back above 24300. This despite another strong day for the dollar, with the greenback rising 0.4% against both the pound and the euro, sending the former below $1.323 and the latter towards $1.165, and jumping half a percent against the yen. The most recent Conference Board consumer confidence reading had little impact on either currency or index, the possible negative impact of the worse than expected month-on-month decline countered by the upwards revised figure from May. Commenting on the US data Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said: Consumer confidence declined in June after improving in May. Consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment of present-day conditions was relatively unchanged, suggesting that the level of economic growth remains strong. While expectations remain high by historical standards, the modest curtailment in optimism suggests that consumers do not foresee the economy gaining much momentum in the months ahead. It should hardly come as much of a surprise, given the amount of talk about the recent trade tensions, but US consumer confidence has slipped back in June, coming in below expectations. The Conference Board consumer confidence index fell from 128.8 in May (itself revised up from 128) to 126.4. Analyst had forecast a level of 128. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest report on the new spat between Donald Trump and Harley-Davidson: President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened Harley-Davidson with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big tax\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and said the motorbike company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to shift some motorcycle production overseas, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will be the beginning of the end\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A day after the company announced it was moving some production overseas to mitigate the impact of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on European steel and aluminium Trump used Twitter to say the company is using \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tariffs/Trade War as an excuse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to hide previously announced plans to move jobs to Asia. The Milwaukee-based company said on Monday it came to its decision because of retaliatory tariffs it faces in an escalating trade dispute between the US and the European Union. Trump warned Harley-Davidson that any shift in production \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will be the beginning of the end\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump said in one of several tweets on Tuesday. He was referring to tariffs Harley-Davidson would face on motorcycles produced overseas and shipped back to the US for sale. The president has held up the motorcycle maker as an example of a US business harmed by trade barriers in other countries, but Harley-Davidson had warned that new US tariffs could negatively affect its sales. Trump recently imposed steep tariffs on aluminium and steel imported from Canada, Mexico and Europe in his attempt to reduce trade deficits between the US and its trade partners. But those countries have treated Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s action as an insult and have chosen to respond in kind. The US and China are also volleying back and forth over tariffs. The full story is here: After Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump, US markets have indeed managed to open in positive territory, even if the gains are not particularly convincing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 47 points or 0.2% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.19% higher and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.29%. Technology stocks, which on Monday were among the biggest fallers after Donald Trump latest trade threats hit the sector, are leading the recovery. Gold is typically seen as a haven for investors in times of market turmoil, but not at the moment. It has been heading lower for a while and is down another $8 an ounce to $1257 so far today. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said: Gold has been falling sharply of late, dropping by a good $50 in the space of nine trading days. At the time of writing, the yellow precious metal was trading around $1257, its lowest level since December 18. The perceived safe haven metal has been unable to find much demand from flows out of the equity markets which have been tumbling amid concerns over global trade disputes and the outlook for rising interest rates. Indeed, the trend of central banks turning hawkish has continued in recent weeks. The Fed has indicated that it will probably raise borrowing costs two more times this year, while the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE will end at the end of this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c albeit the first rate rise has been delayed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and there are now more hawks at the BOE (3) than expected (2). As central banks tighten monetary conditions, yields could rise further. This means the opportunity cost of holding noninterest-bearing assets like gold will increase (on a relative basis) along with expectations for higher borrowing costs. Unfortunately for gold, which is priced in the dollar, interest rate expectations in the US have been rising faster than in other regions. This has helped to underpin the dollar and undermine foreign currencies, and pressurised buck-denominated gold further. Thus, for gold to make a meaningful comeback, the dollar will have to depreciate and depreciate sharply. This can only happen if incoming US macro data were to deteriorate sharply, or the global economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in particular, the EU \u00e2\u20ac\u201c starts to expand at a faster pace than the US economy. However, as things stand, this looks unlikely and we therefore may see further dollar strength in the coming days and weeks. So, the outlook for gold looks bleak. A few minutes until Wall Street opens and the futures market is predicting the US markets - like those in Europe - will stage a minor recovery. After Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 328 point decline, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open up around 40 points. Getting back to the trade wars.... Donald Trump has savaged Harley-Davidson for deciding to move some production out of America to avoid EU tariffs on US goods. The president accused the motorbike manufacturer of misleading customers yesterday, by using tariffs as an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexcuse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to shift jobs. He says it will be the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbeginning of the end\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for Harley, unless it scraps the plan. Overnight, the Financial Times spoke to Harley workers in Milwaukee. Most apparently still support Trump, and think he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s using his business smarts. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it unless it needed to be done, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very smart businessman,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one Harley employee whose name is embroidered on his work shirt \u00e2\u20ac\u201d though he asks not to be quoted by name. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s playing poker: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hit you with this, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hit us with that, I think this will bring them to the table \u00e2\u20ac\u201d unless he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s completely crazy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd chimed in another.... More here. Before being quizzed over those whopping travel expenses, Bradley Fried told the Treasury committee that the Bank of England was committed to improving diversity. Reuters has the details: The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next governor must embody values of inclusion and accountability, as well strong economic skills, the new chair of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s court of directors said on Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those values include inclusion, they include accountability, they include collaboration, decisiveness and empowerment. We would want that in the new governor,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bradley Fried told lawmakers. Incumbent governor Mark Carney is due to step down on June 30, 2019, and finance minister Philip Hammond is expected to announce his successor before the end of this year. Fried also acknowledged the criticism for only having one woman (Silvana Tenreyro) on the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee which sets interest rates. That image doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t match the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to inclusivity and equality, Fried insisted. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also only one woman (Elizabeth Stheeman) on the Financial Policy Committee alongside 12(!) men - including two facing tough questions about their trans-Atlantic flights.... Back in parliament, the new chair of the court of the Bank of England has faced some uncomfortable questions about expenses. Bradley Fried has been asked to justify how two members of the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee, Donald Kohn and Anil Kashyap, ran up \u00c2\u00a3390,000 of travel expenses in the last two and a half years. This is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a simply staggering sum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Conservative MP Simon Clarke. Is it really a sensible use of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resources? Fried argues that Kohn and Kashyap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expertise mean it was value for money, given the skills which they provide to the FPC. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the context of the skills we needed on the committees at the time\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Having seen these committees in action and the contributions they have made, as high as their expenses have been, so staggering, I think, has been their contribution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Anil Kashyap is a professor at the University of Chicago, while Donald Kohn is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Both men are travelling between London and America to attend FPC meetings - with the Bank picking up the tab. Clarke says his constituents would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gobsmacked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to hear that one return flight from Chicago for Mr Kashyap to attend a meeting in February cost \u00c2\u00a311,084.89. Clarke says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These meetings must be scheduled months in advance. I cannot understand how that figure was arrived at. Are FPC members allowed to fly first class, he wonders. Our people fly business class, replies Fried, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll check this issue. Onto taxis! Donald Kohn, it transpires, took a flight from Washington to London costing \u00c2\u00a38,000 and added an extra \u00c2\u00a3469 in taxi fares. Clarke says this is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just unconscionable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He adds that there are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disturbing echoes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the culture that was exposed by the House of Commons expense scandal in 2009. As if this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough, Clarke reminds Fried that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2016 summer party cost \u00c2\u00a3100,000. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one hell of a party\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Is that public money? if it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, whose money is it? Fried says he will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reflect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on this issue and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153figure out with our financial manager what framework is appropriate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Clarke puts his finger on another dubious issue. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sports Centre facility at Roehampton - where it costs \u00c2\u00a31,464 per year to a humble member of the public, but Bank staff only pay \u00c2\u00a350 a year. That, Clarke says, is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an extraordinary good deal, and suggests an extraordinary subsidy being offered here\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. How does that fit with the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mandate of promoting monetary and financial stability? Fried admits that the issue will be examined: Roehampton is part of what we look at. We will be looking at Roehampton. Andy Bruce of Reuters has dug out an example of Donald Kohn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expenses - including more than \u00c2\u00a356,000 in one three-month period last year. The Chinese stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide into a bear market today has sent shivers through the financial world, particularly in Asia. With shares down 20% since January, and worries about trade rising, investors fear more losses ahead. Qian Qimin, strategiest at Shenwan Hongyuan Group in Shanghai, says the threat of trade protectionism could push shares lower. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market may keep falling since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still hard to gauge the impact of trade tensions. Investors will keep cutting risk.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Analysts at Danske Bank have warned that some international companies could pull out of China, leading to an outflow of capital. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We envisage that US companies in China will increasingly repatriate profits as they risk being caught in the crossfire in the trade war. The prospect that America blocks some technology exports to China (and maybe other countries too?) is also alarming traders. Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo, explains why such a move would be significant: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unlike the seemingly spur-of-the-moment tweets by President Trump and the retaliatory exchange of tariffs, Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid to protect intellectual property is an issue at the heart of a trade row between two powers battling for future global supremacy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning out to be a long-term bearish factor for the financial markets, as the United States is unlikely to back down at least through its midterm elections.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jonathan Haskel seems to be talking sterling down, even before he gets his knees under the table at the Bank of England. Sterling has dropped by half a cent today, to $1.322, as Haskel tells MPs that there may be more slack in the UK economy than we think. If he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right, that could mean interest rates rise more slowly. Haskel is generally coming over as a more dovish policymaker, which is significant as he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacing the hawkish Ian McCafferty... The man who will be replaced by Jonathan Haskel is also speaking this morning, explaining why he voted (in vain) to raise UK interest rates last week. Ian McCafferty, who leaves the Bank of England monetary policy committee this summer, is arguing the economy is much stronger than official figures suggest. In his final major speech, McCafferty declares: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We should not dally in making the next move. In his view, low unemployment is starting to drive wages higher and energy prices are rising - both of which could keep inflation above the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Continuing with the slow reduction in monetary stimulus without undue delay could well prevent the need for a more aggressive tightening later on. Over in parliament, economics professor Jonathan Haskel is being quizzed by MPs about his appointment to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee. Haskel has warned that rising protectionism could threaten the UK economy by driving up costs and hurting economic demand. Haskel told the Treasury committee: If protectionism were to break out into a widespread trade war I would of course be very concerned, for in such a situation economies would have higher inflation (due to higher import costs), lower demand (due to confidence etc.) and likely lower supply (to the extent that supply chains were interrupted that couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t otherwise be established). Haskel also warns that Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effect on the UK economy is still very uncertain. On productivity (his specialist area), Haskel says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less pessimistic than some other experts. He believes that some firms are making significant investment in artificial intelligence which aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet bearing fruit. Haskel is due to join the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee in September, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now being grilled about gender balance, following the row over his appointment (over four female candidates). He says that Imperial College, where he works, are making efforts to improve the pipeline of female candidates into economics. This includes outreach programmes and efforts to engage with schools (Imperial experts who will turn up and perform a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whole load of explosions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). Wes Streeting MP jokes that the Treasury Committee might enjoy a demonstration; Haskel gently points out that the House of Commons has already had one near-miss with explosions.... Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister has warned that a trade war would be disastrous, not least for the United States. Speaking during a visit to India, chancellor Philip Hammond has told CNBC that we are living in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncertain times\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd right now, thanks to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach to trade and tariffs. He told CNBC India: The old certainty for many decades has been that the United States was completely wedded to open markets and free trade. And now the United States is questioning the value, the fairness, of some of our arrangements. Hammond warns that a full-blown trade was could be devastating. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I very much hope that we can avoid a full scale trade war (because) that would be a disaster for everyone, not least for the United States. Hammond also pledge that the UK would remain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an outspoken proponent of open markets and free trade, low tariffs barriers and low non-tariff barriers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The chancellor is one of the key voices pushing for a relatively \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, under which Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existing trade links with Europe are largely maintained. This chart shows how China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai composite index has fallen pretty steadily since its recent peak at the end of January. The slump in Chinese shares this year will worry policymakers in Beijing. Many small investors will have suffered hefty losses as the Chinese market has slid 20% from January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high. Financial speculation could destabilise the economy, at a time when officials are trying to tackle financial risks and shadow banking problems without hurting growth. Peter Garnry of Saxo Bank says China is under pressure to settle the trade dispute with America: After yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumbles, European traders will have approached their desks nervously today. But so far, the City looks relatively calm. The FTSE 100 has rise by 23 points in early trading, having plunged by 173 points yesterday. The news that China has fallen into a bear market hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t caused a wider panic. The French and German markets have also risen by around 0.3%, as investors try to digest some mixed messages from the White House overnight. Wall Street was spooked last night by treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that America could restrict investment from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all countries that are trying to steal our technology.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That message was then undermined by trade advisor Peter Navarro, who went on TV to declare: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no plans to impose investment restrictions on any countries that are interfering in any way with our country. This is not the plan.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to wait and see what Donald Trump signs off later this week. In the meantime, these escalating tensions are making investors increasingly nervous, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets. If the US stops Chinese investment in certain US sectors, it will have a strong counteraction. Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin has said that more details on this would follow by the end of this week and this is going to keep investors even more nervous. On top of this, Trump administration is further adding to this uncertainty by keep sending conflicting statements; one person would say it is fake news and another would say more details on the topic would emerge sooner than later. Dickie Wong, head of research at Hong Kong-based broker Kingston Securities, says the gloom is deepening in China, as America threatens to escalate the trade dispute. Wong says (via CNN): It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a combo effect of concerns about the trade war and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP growth. Last week Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports, on top of the $50bn already being targeted. Newsflash: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has fallen into bear market territory, as fears of a trade war with America hits confidence. The Shanghai Composite index has dropped 0.5% today, which means it has fallen more than 20% from its recent peak in January. Energy stocks and banks led the selloff today, as traders worried that escalating trade tensions would hit Chinese economic growth and financial stability. Reports that the US will soon block Chinese firms from investing in America, and restrict the export of cutting-edge technology to China, has sent a shiver through the trading floors. Airline stocks also had a bad day, amid worries that the weakening yuan would drive up the cost of servicing debts issued in US dollars. Bloomberg reports that anxiety in China is growing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pessimism will keep growing as many companies are on the edge of margin calls and bond defaults,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Sun Jianbo, China Vision Capital president in Beijing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index will fall at least 10 percent from the current level.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trade war fears are hitting currencies across the developing world today. Jameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy at FXTM, explains: Concerns over the possibility of an upcoming trade war are expected to remain front and centre of investor focus once again today. The Chinese Yuan, Malaysian Ringgit, Thai Baht, Indian Rupee and Indonesian Rupiah are once again trading lower against the Dollar, while the Japanese Yen is still outperforming as a result of investor reluctance to take on risk during an atmosphere of market uncertainty. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. The markets are edgy today after growing worries of a trade war sent shares sliding on both side of the Atlantic yesterday. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff wiped 328 points, or 1.3%, off America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones industrial average while the Nasdaq shed 2%. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yuan has slumped to a near six-month low, as the threat of a deepening dispute with America hit confidence. Analysts believe Washington will press the button in tough restrictions on Chinese investment in the coming days, which would further escalate tensions with Beijing. US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin denied last night that America was targeting China, saying that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all countries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which pilfer US technology could face restrictions. Mnuchin may have been trying to help, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually raised fears of a broader crackdown by the US. As Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets puts it: This trade spat story looks to have good legs on it everyone. Buckle up. In weak trading, the yuan has fallen to 6.5573 against the US dollar today, the lowest since last December. The news that US motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson would move some production out of America, thanks to EU tariffs, also hit sentiment yesterday. Analysts warned that it shows the perils of tit-for-tat trade barriers: Having triggered the current flurry of tariffs, Donald Trump has tweeted that manufacturers should be patient: But other US companies may follow Harley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead, to avoid Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new 25% tariffs on some US goods. Also coming up today MPs will be kicking the tires of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newest central bank policy maker, Jonathan Haskel, who joins the Bank of England in September. Haskel is a productivity expert, but the City don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know much about his views on monetary policy. The hearing may provide some hints on whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a hawk or a dove, and thus likely to vote for interest rate hikes. Haskel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appointment caused a stir last month; he was the only man on a five-person shortlist, so the Treasury missed the opportunity to tackle the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gender problems. On the data side, the CBI is publishing its estimate of UK retail sales this month. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already had one piece of bad retail news - struggling Carpetright has just posted a whopping loss of \u00c2\u00a370.5m for the last year, as it presses on with its store closure plan. Carpetright also warned that some suppliers are tightening credit terms, following \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcadverse publicity surrounding the Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restructuring\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Plus, the latest survey of US consumer confidence is released later today. It hit a three-month high - will trade tensions have weakened it? The agenda: 10am BST: Professor Jonathan Haskel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appointment hearing for the Monetary Policy Committee at parliament 11am BST: CBI survey of UK retail sales in June 3pm BST: US consumer confidence for June",

The British Meat Processors Association chief executive, Nick Allen, said the situation was getting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pretty tight\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, exacerbated by the hot temperatures. Poultry slaughterhouses have already called for priority supplies of dwindling CO2 stocks, saying the current shortage could have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153potentially huge effect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on British food production. A spokeswoman for the British Retail Consortium said CO2 supply issues remained and retailers and suppliers were working hard to ensure food availability was maintained. The shortages are understood to have been caused by a longer than usual break in production of ammonia, one of the key sources of food-grade CO2 in Europe. Ammonia is used to carbonate drinks and preserve some packed fresh foods. The trade journal Gas World said the shortage had been described as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worst supply situation to hit the European carbon dioxide business in decades\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.",

Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Equities are reaching for the stars once again, with healthy gains across the board. Many market watchers will remember when it was the Fed that was scared into policy changes by financial market volatility. Now the financial markets appear to be doing the same to the US president. Trade war concerns remain high on the agenda, but the White House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on using existing legislation rather than new rules has helped boost risk appetite.</p> <p>Having tied himself so closely to the stock market early on in his presidency, Mr Trump will be wary of anything that prompts a sustained rout in equities. Of course, he may decide that the political advantages of talking tough on trade outweigh those arising from a buoyant stock market. But for now investors will be pleased that a softer tone is being adopted.</p> <p>Also helping equity markets this afternoon is oil, which has enjoyed a stellar week. OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move to raise production did not dispel concerns about a supply shortage, and those concerns have only increased thanks to US jawboning on Iranian exports, a Canadian shutdown and now a fresh drop in US crude stockpiles. So long as OPEC keeps a lid on production increases, we can expect further bullish momentum in oil. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b33a33de4b0bef28bb9b17b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-27T14:49:52.972Z\">3.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with John Lewis Partnership, and analyst Greg Lawless at Shore Capital was positive about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jun/27/uk-house-price-growth-falls-bank-of-england-financial-stability-business-live?page=with:block-5b335358e4b02f6ecf5e89e3#block-5b335358e4b02f6ecf5e89e3\">the moves the business has outlined</a> to deal with a tricky retail environment:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This looks a sensible path for JLP to navigate given the structural shifts across the current retail landscape. The group is playing to its own core strengths with an increased focus on differentiation, innovation and enhanced service. The work in recent years from a balance sheet perspective (slowed the investment in physical space growth, reduced the discretionary pension increases and reduced partnership bonuses) has put it in a stronger position. The stronger balance sheet allows a commitment to continue to invest \u00c2\u00a3400- \u00c2\u00a3500m per annum over the next three years. The group is targeting a net debt to EBITDA of 3.0x ratio over the next five years, suggesting capital discipline over the medium-term. </p> <p>JLP is now being more realistic in recognising that group profits need to be rebased as it faces into its challenges and charts its own path. The expectation is that there will be no let-up in the headwinds and it is right that the group is being more realistic in its appraisal of the sector.

This includes \u00c2\u00a3500m of fresh investment over the next few years.</p> <p>Here are some highlights (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve bolded up the key points):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is widely acknowledged that the retail sector is going through <strong>a period of generational change</strong> and every retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response will be different. For the Partnership, the focus is on greater differentiation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not scale. We have clear plans to build on our strengths and to sharpen our points of difference in both Waitrose and John Lewis.</p> <p>These plans include <strong>further investment</strong> in and development of unique products and service, together with a greater emphasis on own brand and innovation.</p> </blockquote> <p>On current earnings:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We expect the Partnership\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s half year profits before exceptional items \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which are always much lower and more volatile than the second half \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to be <strong>close to zero</strong> this year. For the full year there are a wide range of possible outcomes, given the market uncertainty, but we are currently assuming that <strong>profits before exceptional items will be substantially lower than last year</strong>.</p> <p>The Partnership currently expects to see profit growth in Waitrose, a decline in John Lewis and significant extra costs at the Partnership level as a result of<strong> greater IT investment</strong>, which will be a big driver behind the overall profit change.</p> <p>Today the Partnership has announced that it will take steps to <strong>strengthen its balance sheet by a further \u00c2\u00a3500m</strong> over three years to invest in product and service innovation. This will be achieved by rebuilding profitability at Waitrose, creating more value from the property estate, and conducting a review of the Partnership\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension scheme.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation that five Waitrose stores will close:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unlike many of its competitors, the John Lewis Partnership has a well balanced and well located store portfolio, with 353 Waitrose shops and 50 John Lewis. As we develop our plans to prioritise differentiation we will continue to make adjustments to our overall estate, including exit or closures, but at a rate that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in line with what we have seen over the last few years. <strong>To this end, Waitrose today announced the disposal of four convenience shops and one small supermarket</strong>.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b335240e4b0973193b2fc30\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-27T09:04:34.028Z\">10.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement is clearly bad news for John Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 85,000 staff, who effectively own the Partnership.</strong></p> <p>Each employee is a partner, who receives a percentage of their annual salary in a profit-related bonus each year.</p> <p>In 2017-18 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/08/john-lewis-cuts-staff-bonuses-as-profits-dive-77-percent-weaker-pound-waitrose\">the partners only got a 5% bonus</a>, the lowest in over 60 years, after profits slumped by 77%.

                "bodyText":"Global stock markets have been pushed around by the trade tensions between the US and, notably, China, and signs of a softer tone from the Trump administration has given them a lift today. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Equity markets are higher now that it seems the US is taking a more relaxed position regarding investment from China. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) will access international investment in the US. Traders are viewing this less aggressive way to monitor overseas investment in the US as a boost for international relations. Traders welcomed the initiative as the government now appears to have a body that will deal with the issue, and it should lead to less confusion about which investment is allowed and which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Recently, different members of the Trump administration seemed to be on different wavelengths from one another, and that added to the uncertain economic environment. Dealers are now happy to enter the market and pick up relatively cheap equities. The trade dispute is still ongoing, so investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 optimistic mood may not last too long. Rising oil prices have also helped push shares higher, particularly in the commodity sector. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 83.77 points or 1.11% higher at 7621.69 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 0.93% to 12,348.61 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.87% at 5327.20 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 0.65% to 21,557.91 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.22% higher at 9658.6 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently Elsewhere John Lewis Partnership warned this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits would be well below last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures, and said it was getting rid of five Waitrose stores. Our full story is here: On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Over in the US, and President Trump is back tweeting about Harley-Davidson (which said it would move some production out of the US due to his tariff plans) and not, perhaps surprisingly, about China (there is still plenty of time for that, of course). Markets continue to recover after the signs that the Trump administration may be taking a more conciliatory tone with China. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Equities are reaching for the stars once again, with healthy gains across the board. Many market watchers will remember when it was the Fed that was scared into policy changes by financial market volatility. Now the financial markets appear to be doing the same to the US president. Trade war concerns remain high on the agenda, but the White House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on using existing legislation rather than new rules has helped boost risk appetite. Having tied himself so closely to the stock market early on in his presidency, Mr Trump will be wary of anything that prompts a sustained rout in equities. Of course, he may decide that the political advantages of talking tough on trade outweigh those arising from a buoyant stock market. But for now investors will be pleased that a softer tone is being adopted. Also helping equity markets this afternoon is oil, which has enjoyed a stellar week. OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move to raise production did not dispel concerns about a supply shortage, and those concerns have only increased thanks to US jawboning on Iranian exports, a Canadian shutdown and now a fresh drop in US crude stockpiles. So long as OPEC keeps a lid on production increases, we can expect further bullish momentum in oil. Back with John Lewis Partnership, and analyst Greg Lawless at Shore Capital was positive about the moves the business has outlined to deal with a tricky retail environment: This looks a sensible path for JLP to navigate given the structural shifts across the current retail landscape. The group is playing to its own core strengths with an increased focus on differentiation, innovation and enhanced service. The work in recent years from a balance sheet perspective (slowed the investment in physical space growth, reduced the discretionary pension increases and reduced partnership bonuses) has put it in a stronger position. The stronger balance sheet allows a commitment to continue to invest \u00c2\u00a3400- \u00c2\u00a3500m per annum over the next three years. The group is targeting a net debt to EBITDA of 3.0x ratio over the next five years, suggesting capital discipline over the medium-term. JLP is now being more realistic in recognising that group profits need to be rebased as it faces into its challenges and charts its own path. The expectation is that there will be no let-up in the headwinds and it is right that the group is being more realistic in its appraisal of the sector. Perhaps other retailers might also want to consider the wider sector implications of JLP acknowledging the current retail environment. Crude prices have been rising in recent days, giving a boost to commodity stocks and markets such as the FTSE 100 where mining and oil companies are well represented. Despite Opec agreeing to increase production, the price was supported on Tuesday by Donald Trump calling for buyers to cut their purchases from Iran, Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third largest producer. Now a bigger than expected drop in US crude stocks has suggested growing demand, and pushed prices higher. Crude stocks dropped by 9.89m barrels last week, compared to expectations of a 2.6m decline. Gasoline stocks grew by 1.16m but this was less than the forecast 1.3m increase. Brent crude is now up 2% at $77.82 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has added 2.7% to $72.5. US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin is predicting strong growth for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy in the second quarter. He told CNBC he was expecting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big number\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd . And although he made it clear he had no advance sight of the figures, the comments have helped push Wall Street even higher. Signs that the Trump administration may been trying to ease tensions with China have given US markets a lift at the open. As reported earlier the US is moving away from a blanket ban on Chinese firms investing in US businesses, and instead is talking about using a strengthened security review process to deal with the issue. The news has helped push the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 108 points or 0.46%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.2% higher and the Nasdaq Composite 0.33% better. There are also some new US figures showing an improvement in the goods trade balance to -$64.85bn in May, down $2.5bn. Exports for May were up $2.9bn to $143.6bn, while imports edged up $0.4bn to $208.4bn. Still with the US, and new orders for capital goods fell unexpectedly in May, although April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure was revised sharply higher. The commerce department said that orders for non-defence goods excluding aircraft slipped by 0.2% compared to forecasts of a 0.5% increase. But the April figure is now reported as a 2.3% rise, much better than the original estimate of a 1% gain. Analysts trying to work out how this might affect US interest rate policy might have a difficult time, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at GKFX: Over the past few years investors have got used to equities rallying on the back of data releases, irrespective of the numbers surprising to the upside or downside. Strong data has reinforced the view that the US economy is powering ahead, at least when compared to other developed countries. But at the same time, disappointing numbers have led to the belief that the US Federal Reserve would decelerate monetary tightening. After all, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen repeatedly from both Janet Yellen and her predecessor as Fed Chair, Ben Bernanke. However, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a growing perception that the current chair, Jerome Powell, is doing things differently and that under his lead the Fed is prepared to tighten unless there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a significant market disruption. Consequently, data disappointments are unlikely to receive the positive reaction that they once did. This shift in sentiment is something to be aware of as we approach the second half of this year. Newsflash: Donald Trump may have backed away from escalating the trade dispute between America and China. US officials have revealed that the Trump administration is moving away from plans for a blanket ban on Chinese firms buying stakes in US companies. Instead, the US government is pushing Congress to strengthen a panel called the Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS), to protect US intellectual property rights. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a less confrontational approach, which will calm fears that the row between Washington and Beijing was escalating ever higher. Earlier this week, there were reports that the US would use national emergency laws to prevent Chinese companies from investing in the US - and possibly other countries too. But now, the White House seems to have backed away from such an inflammatory step. One official told CNBC that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We considered a number of different mechanisms for addressing the concerns articulated regarding the acquisitions of sensitive technologies that may threaten U.S. national security, national interests. In the end the president and his advisers settled on the idea that we have a strong and effective mechanism through the CFIUS process ... and that is a mechanism that can be used in the flexible and aggressive way to combat the practices that are troubling to the president.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Investors have welcomed the news, sending shares higher. In London the FTSE 100 index is now up 55 points, or 0.7%, and Wall Street futures are recovering too. Back in London, the governor of the Bank of England has defended the huge cost of flying policymakers around the globe. Mark Carney was questioned about the revelation that two members of the Financial Policy Committee spent \u00c2\u00a3390,000 on flights between them in the last couple of years. In response, Carney told reporters that it was absolutely right to question the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expenses - before explaining that its officials are jet-setting around the world to attend important international meetings. Carney says he personally went on 52 trips in the last year, at a cost of \u00c2\u00a3312,000. Some of that cost is covered by Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other jobs (he also chairs committees for the Bank of International Settlements), getting the average price down to \u00c2\u00a33,000. As Carney says: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a lot of money, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a consequence of having to go to these various meetings. The governor points out, a little defensively, that he was slaving away last weekend while luckier souls were watching England overcome Panama, sunbathing, or wrestling with a barbeque. As Carney puts it: I spent what was a glorious weekend here, I hear, in Basel, chairing a group of global governors dealing with issues around Brexit, emerging market risks, the future of financial reforms... And I was very pleased to be able to get back on Sunday night so I could come into work on Monday morning. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on John Lewis: The John Lewis Partnership has said it will make no profit in the first six months of this year and is to close five Waitrose stores as tough trading on the high street takes its toll. The group said its full-year profits, to be announced next March, will also be substantially lower than last year. It operates 50 John Lewis outlets and 350 Waitrose shops. JLP blamed market uncertainty and cited significant extra costs as a result of greater IT investment, which would be the main cause of the profit decline. Waitrose will shut four convenience shops and one small supermarket, affecting aabout 200 staff. The four convenience stores are being sold to the Co-Op. Sir Charlie Mayfield, the JLP chair, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is very important that we feel the jeopardy of what is happening right now. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a blip, it is a major shift and it has a while to run.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Waitrose is expected to see profit growth, but that will be offset by a decline at John Lewis. The group said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is widely acknowledged that the retail sector is going through a period of generational change and every retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response will be different. For the partnership, the focus is on greater differentiation, not scale.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd... More here: Newsflash: The Waitrose store on Camden high street will become an Aldi. The discount chain has exchanged contracts to acquire the Camden store - one of the five being shut by John Lewis. It intends to reopen the site in Spring 2019. While Waitrose is firmly upmarket (although it does run a popular Essentials range too), Aldi has grown its market share strongly by focusing more on price. Graham Hetherington, Aldi regional managing director, says North London shoppers will appreciate the difference: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Camden store is an opportunity to reach customers in a busy London borough, many of whom may not have experienced Aldi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s award-winning, quality products at unbeatable prices before. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect details of the agreement to be finalised in autumn and work will then begin to refit the store with a view to opening in spring next year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: The Co-op has swooped in to buy the four small Waitrose stores being axed today, saving them from closure. The Co-op has exchanged contracts to take over the Little Waitrose convenience stores in Manchester (on the approach to Piccadilly railway, and in the financial centre of Spinningfields). It will also take over the store on Colmore Row in Birmingham City Centre, and Portman Square in central London. Stuart Hookins, Co-op Director of Property Portfolio and Development, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are pleased to have worked with Waitrose to agree the purchase of four of its convenience stores. Our acquisition and refit programme forms a fundamental part of our food strategy. Our aim is for stores to be at the heart of local life, creating stronger communities and offering great quality products conveniently, when and where our members and customers need them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This should also avoid job losses. Waitrose Partners at those shops being acquired by the Co-op will transfer to the Co-op under TUPE (Transfer of Undertakings, Protection of Employment regulations). Waitrose has also promised to find opportunities for staff wh want to say with them. The slide in John Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits this year highlights the wider crisis in British retail, says Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy group Retail Economics, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even the mighty John Lewis has not been able to escape intensifying pressures building on UK high streets. The impact of rising sourcing costs, higher operating costs and the turbulent consumer environment has flatlined profits. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a growing sense of panic for the retail sector as the intergenerational shift in behavioural trends is fragmenting the market. The emergence of the sharing economy, mass personalisation at scale and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economy has put the emphasis on retailers to differentiate themselves from their competitors. But the pace of change is accelerating and the race is on to pivot business models in a move to become fit-for-purpose in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s digital age.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd John Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits are being eaten by Amazon, and Brexit uncertainty, says Bloomberg: The operator of department stores and Waitrose supermarkets said it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unable to give a precise annual profit forecast because of economic uncertainty, some of it linked to the pending departure from the European Union. With Brexit less than a year away, consumer confidence will suffer further in the second half, Chief Financial Officer Patrick Lewis said. The announcement from John Lewis, at a strategy day Wednesday, continues a run of bad news from U.K. store chains. Brexit is squeezing their costs and prompting consumers to keep closer tabs on budgets, compounding the damage from the rise of online shopping. Newsflash: The Bank of England has issued a warning that Europe needs to do more to prepare for Brexit. In its new financial stability report, the BoE says that progress has been made in protecting UK households and businesses against Brexit disruption but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153material risks remain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It is particularly concerned that the EU hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t created a temporary permission regime to allow financial firms to continue trading across Europe after next March. Without such a regime, trillions of pound worth of derivative contracts are at risk, plus millions of insurance contracts. The Bank says: Progress has been made, but material risks remain. The biggest remaining risks of disruption are where action is needed by both UK and EU authorities, such as ensuring the continuity of existing derivatives contracts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As yet the EU has not indicated a solution analogous to a temporary permissions regime.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd BoE governor Mark Carney is speaking to reporters in London now, warning that the rise of protectionism could hurt the global economy. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have more details shortly... Here are the five Waitrose stores that are closing as part of the strategy announced this morning: Spinningfields, Manchester Manchester Piccadilly Colmore Row, Birmingham Portman Square, London Camden, London The first four are convenience stores, while the Camden store is a small supermarket. John Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman has now weighed in on Brexit, saying it is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunthinkable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that Britain leaves the EU without a deal. He made the comments at this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s media briefing, as he outlines the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to shut five Waitrose stores and boost investment. Reuters has the details: Britain is unprepared to leave the European Union without a deal and chaos would ensue were it to happen, the chairman of department store group John Lewis said on Wednesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A no deal Brexit is in my view a pretty much unthinkable scenario,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Charlie Mayfield told reporters. Martin Lane, managing editor of money.co.uk, is alarmed that profits across John Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business have all but evaporated so far this year. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise John Lewis have seen a fall in consumer demand, but to make close to no profit is worrying to say the least. John Lewis are struggling to soak up rising costs whilst improving their own infrastructure. The strategic move to close a few Waitrose stores is part of a wider plan to innovate rather than expand. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With numerous high street retailers going into administration since Christmas, this news will surely have the John Lewis board members in crisis talks. Lane believes that Waitrose are losing out to cheaper rivals, as consumers cut back. John Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s department stores face an even bigger nemesis - the internet. With lack of wage growth and rising living costs it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s become evident that shoppers are tightening their purse strings and saving where they can. Cheaper supermarkets like Aldi and Lidl are growing in popularity which leaves Waitrose out in the cold. John Lewis on the other hand are battling an even bigger battle - the online retail market. With the recent news House of Fraser are having to shut a large number of their stores, the worry is that John Lewis may end the same way. The partnership has its work cut out to recover from this. The boss of John Lewis Partnership, Paula Nickolds, is briefing reporters about the challenging retail world: Waitrose chief Rob Collins is also there: The company is also rebranding, to emphasise the partnership element of its business: The John Lewis Partnership has now issued a statement, confirming that profits are taking a tumble this year and that several Waitrose stores are being shuttered. The news comes in a strategic update, outlining its plans for its department stores and supermarkets. This includes \u00c2\u00a3500m of fresh investment over the next few years. Here are some highlights (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve bolded up the key points): It is widely acknowledged that the retail sector is going through a period of generational change and every retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response will be different. For the Partnership, the focus is on greater differentiation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not scale. We have clear plans to build on our strengths and to sharpen our points of difference in both Waitrose and John Lewis. These plans include further investment in and development of unique products and service, together with a greater emphasis on own brand and innovation. On current earnings: We expect the Partnership\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s half year profits before exceptional items \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which are always much lower and more volatile than the second half \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to be close to zero this year. For the full year there are a wide range of possible outcomes, given the market uncertainty, but we are currently assuming that profits before exceptional items will be substantially lower than last year. The Partnership currently expects to see profit growth in Waitrose, a decline in John Lewis and significant extra costs at the Partnership level as a result of greater IT investment, which will be a big driver behind the overall profit change. Today the Partnership has announced that it will take steps to strengthen its balance sheet by a further \u00c2\u00a3500m over three years to invest in product and service innovation. This will be achieved by rebuilding profitability at Waitrose, creating more value from the property estate, and conducting a review of the Partnership\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension scheme. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation that five Waitrose stores will close: Unlike many of its competitors, the John Lewis Partnership has a well balanced and well located store portfolio, with 353 Waitrose shops and 50 John Lewis. As we develop our plans to prioritise differentiation we will continue to make adjustments to our overall estate, including exit or closures, but at a rate that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in line with what we have seen over the last few years. To this end, Waitrose today announced the disposal of four convenience shops and one small supermarket. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement is clearly bad news for John Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 85,000 staff, who effectively own the Partnership. Each employee is a partner, who receives a percentage of their annual salary in a profit-related bonus each year. In 2017-18 the partners only got a 5% bonus, the lowest in over 60 years, after profits slumped by 77%. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bonus could be even more miserly. More gloom from John Lewis Partnership chairman Charlie Mayfield: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is very important that we feel the jeopardy of what is happening right now. John Lewis is briefing reporters about its plans now. Chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield warns that the retail slowdown isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153blip\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and could continue for some time: Newsflash: John Lewis has warned that its profits will be substantially lower than a year ago. In the latest gloomy news to hit Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sector, the John Lewis Partnership admits that profits in the first half of the financial year could be close to zero. It is also planning to close a handful of small Waitrose stores - including one in Camden, two Little Waitrose outlets in Manchester and one in Birmingham. More to follow! Worries that Donald Trump will trigger a destructive trade war are weighing on the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets again today. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark CSI 300 index slumped by 2% today to a two-year low, leaving it firmly in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbear market territory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (more than 20% below its peak in January). Other Asian markets also slipped, with the Hong Kong Hang Seng index down 1.8%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a bad few weeks for emerging market shares, as nervous investors pull money out. As this chart shows, the entire region is worryingly close to bear market territory: European markets are also on the back foot. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has dropped by 0.75% this morning, as concerns that Trump might slap tariffs on European car imports mount. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC is down 0.5%. Things look better in London, though, where the FTSE 100 has lost just 10 points (-0.15%). Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ongoing trade war concerns continuing to weigh on investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Economist Howard Archer of EY Item Club has spotted that UK house prices actually flatlined in the last three months, compared to the previous quarter. This is the first time that prices haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t risen on a quarterly basis since the third quarter of 2012 - another sign that the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cooling. Archer says people are being cautious because interest rates could rise soon - making a mortgage less affordable: Housing market activity is expected to remain lacklustre as the extended squeeze on consumer purchasing power only gradually eases, confidence is relatively fragile and appreciable caution persists over engaging in major transactions. Potential house buyers may also be concerned that they are likely to face further interest rate hikes over the coming months (we believe the Bank of England is more likely than not to raise interest rates from 0.50% to 0.75% in August \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although it could be delayed until November). Furthermore, house prices are relatively expensive relative to incomes Worries over Brexit are keeping some potential housebuyers out of the market, keeping prices subdued, says Jonathan Samuels, CEO of the property lender, Octane Capital. With Brexit on the horizon, households feeling the pinch and interest rate uncertainty lingering, a lot of prospective buyers are sitting tight. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nationally, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re witnessing the revenge of the regions, with the East and West Midlands in especially barnstorming form. Wales also has a significant spring in its step.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdLondon is in a league of its own once again, but sadly, for homeowners in the capital, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the bottom league. North London estate agent Jeremy Leaf says sellers need to be realistic about prices, particularly in his patch: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOn the one hand, the squeeze on incomes and unrealistic asking prices is reducing activity and confidence to move, particularly in price-sensitive areas such as London. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOn the other hand, the market continues to be supported by low interest rates and overall supply shortages, although we have found recently that listings and viewings are on the rise. This will translate into more sales if buyers and sellers recognise the new market realities.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, reckons we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll avoid a full-blown house price crash: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tight supply, a healthy labour market and a continued lengthening of mortgage terms - 30-year loans now are common - will help to prevent prices from falling outright. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But it is inevitable that house prices will grow at a slower rate than households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 incomes during a period of rising mortgage rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd House prices in the North are closing the gap on their Southern cousins. Northern property prices have risen by 3.3% in the last year, a vigorous performance compared to the South\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s softer growth of just 0.5% (dragged down by London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.9% decline). But.... that only makes a small dent in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing divide. Prices in London, for example, are still more than 50% higher than in 2007 when the financial crisis stuck. In swathes of the North, though, prices are below those levels. House prices growth is slowing in most parts of the UK, Nationwide reports. The Midlands has seen the strongest house price growth recently, followed by Wales and Scotland. But while London lags behind, the average price in the capital (\u00c2\u00a3469k) are still more than twice the national average (\u00c2\u00a3215k). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. House price growth in the UK has fallen to its lowest level in five years, in the latest sign that the market is cooling. Nationwide, the building society, has reported that annual house price growth slowed to 2% this month. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the slowest rate since 2013, with the market dragged down by falling prices in the capital. London was the weakest performing region in the last quarter, Nationwide reports, with prices down 1.9% year-on-year. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, blames weak economic growth and tight household finances, saying: Surveyors continue to report subdued levels of new buyer enquiries, while the supply of properties on the market remains more of a trickle than a torrent. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking further ahead, much will depend on how broader economic conditions evolve, especially in the labour market, but also with respect to interest rates. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Subdued economic activity and ongoing pressure on household budgets is likely to continue to exert a modest drag on housing market activity and house price growth this year, though borrowing costs are likely to remain low. More details and reaction to follow... Also coming up today The Bank of England will highlight key threats to the UK economy when it presents its latest financial stability report this morning. Governor Mark Carney is also facing questions over the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conduct and culture, after it emerged yesterday that two policymakers have run up almost \u00c2\u00a3400,000 in travel expenses in the last couple of years. MPs called the expense \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstaggering\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as we covered in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liveblog: The criticism is mounting this morning.... The stock markets are still edgy about the prospect of a US-China trade war. Shares have dropped again in Shanghai, but traders hope for a better day in Europe. Retailers could also be under pressure today, as Britain runs low on beer! Not great timing, with the World Cup coming to the boil. Plus, the oil price could be volatile as America puts pressure on other countries to stop buying oil from Iran. The latest oil inventory stats will show whether supplies are holding up. The agenda: 10.30am BST: Bank of England financial stability report 1.30pm BST: US trade figures 3.30pm BST: US weekly oil inventory",

With the likes of the EU and China holding huge surpluses in the trade of goods with the US, Trump knows they have more to gain than to lose. The sharp deterioration in German stocks this week is a clear nod to the reliance the country has upon physical exports.

But they are far from being sufficient ones.</p> <p>When it comes to those structural features of the economy, central banks do not have the tools to affect lasting change. Central bank tools are cyclical, rather than structural, because their impact on the economy is temporary, not permanent. We do not build schools, colleges, houses, roads, railways or banks.

A Bank Rate rise of 25 basis points would still leave monetary conditions in the UK extraordinarily accommodative by any historical metric. And the aim in doing so is to lower the risk of needing to tighten policy less gradually in future and cause a sharper adjustment in the economy.</p> <p>Truth be told, I would have voted to raise Bank Rate at the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s May meeting had data on the economy held firm. What we saw ahead of that meeting was a string of weak data suggesting consumer spending might be faltering. I believed there was option value in waiting to see if these data signalled the start of a lasting retrenchment by households, or were instead a temporary snow or statistical blip. With only a modest policy tightening needed over a number of years to return inflation to target, there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no rush\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. </p> <p>In the event, data on the consumer since the May MPC meeting has, virtually without exception, bounced back strongly. That includes measures of retail spending, consumer confidence and consumer credit. The underlying picture now appears to be one of gently rising household spending. This is being supported by highly accommodative credit conditions and now-positive growth in inflation-adjusted wages. </p> </blockquote> <p>And he added (saying he did not want to tempt fate even as he was doing so):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And then, of course, there is the World Cup. Without wishing to tempt fate, England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent sporting success on the football field (and cricket pitch) has probably added to that feel-good factor among England-supporting consumers. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153smile count\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on my recent visits to Wales and Scotland was also as high as I can remember, although I suspect that may have been the weather rather than the football. </p> </blockquote> <p>More from Reuters:</p> <blockquote> <p>Haldane said there would always be some data that disappoints.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153But waiting for something to turn up is not a prudent strategy in life.

                "bodyText":"Despite Wall Street making a partial recovery by the time European markets closed, this did little to help them. Trade war tensions continued to dominate sentiment, especially in Germany which is heavily dependent on exports. In the UK a weakening pound on doubts about interest rate rises helped the FTSE 100 outperform its peers, given the index is full of overseas earners which benefit from lower sterling. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished virtually unchanged, down just 6.06 points or 0.08% at 7615.63 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.39% to 12,177.23 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.97% lower at 5275.64 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.58% to 21,432.34 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.72% at 9589.0 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 11 points or 0.05%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Despite other distractions, the current trade tensions between the US and China - and elsewhere for that matter - continue to dominate market sentiment. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Stocks have sold off as trade woes continue. Investors are cashing in on yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, as trade tensions remain alive and well. Investors will want to see progress being made regarding trade negotiations before they hold on to stocks for several days at a time. As a result, markets are finding it difficult to hold on to a rally, which underlines the weak sentiment. Wall Street has regained much of its early losses but European markets continue to struggle. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: European markets have led the way lower, with the threat of a breakdown in trade disproportionately hurting stocks in countries which enjoy a sizeable trade surplus with the US. The continued deterioration in the Chinese yuan highlights the influence the Chinese government has upon their exchange rate, with the 5% rise in [dollar/yuan] over the past two months shifting the trade of terms before any tariffs even start to kick in. Brexit concerns continue to dominate local sentiment, with sliding consumer and business confidence dragging the pound to a seven-month low against the dollar. However, much of the story is related to the growing prominence of the US dollar, with the greenback likely to continue gaining ground as the trade war continues. With the likes of the EU and China holding huge surpluses in the trade of goods with the US, Trump knows they have more to gain than to lose. The sharp deterioration in German stocks this week is a clear nod to the reliance the country has upon physical exports. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downward revision for first quarter GDP out of the US provided a temporary dent in the dollar resurgence story. However, while GDP came in at 2%, rather than the 2.2% previously expected, the pathway in US PMI surveys points towards continued upside for US growth despite this short term blip. The continuing trade tensions between the US and China are on investors minds again, pushing US markets lower in early trading. News that Amazon is buying US online pharmacy group PillPack has hit shares in rival drugs companies, adding to the pressure on markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 85 points or 0.35% while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.03% and the Nasdaq Composite dipped by 0.09%. Haldane also appeared to take issue with the Labour party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal to give the Bank of England a mandate to boost productivity. In his speech Haldane said: It is ... well-known, including from historical experience, that productivity depends importantly on a number of structural features of the economy, including levels of education and skills in the workforce, the quality and quantity of infrastructure and innovation and the scale of financing to companies. Price and financial stability are necessary conditions for rising productivity. But they are far from being sufficient ones. When it comes to those structural features of the economy, central banks do not have the tools to affect lasting change. Central bank tools are cyclical, rather than structural, because their impact on the economy is temporary, not permanent. We do not build schools, colleges, houses, roads, railways or banks. Nor do we finance them. Those tools, rightly, are in the hands either of governments or private companies. So too is the financing of them. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics on Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments: Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane caught many observers off guard last week when he voted for an interest rate rise for the first time. But in a speech in London on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity problem, he said the decision should not have been seen as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153surprising or radical.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said: Voting for a 25 basis point rate rise, a full decade after monetary policy was first placed on an emergency setting, is hardly either surprising or radical. A Bank Rate rise of 25 basis points would still leave monetary conditions in the UK extraordinarily accommodative by any historical metric. And the aim in doing so is to lower the risk of needing to tighten policy less gradually in future and cause a sharper adjustment in the economy. Truth be told, I would have voted to raise Bank Rate at the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s May meeting had data on the economy held firm. What we saw ahead of that meeting was a string of weak data suggesting consumer spending might be faltering. I believed there was option value in waiting to see if these data signalled the start of a lasting retrenchment by households, or were instead a temporary snow or statistical blip. With only a modest policy tightening needed over a number of years to return inflation to target, there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no rush\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In the event, data on the consumer since the May MPC meeting has, virtually without exception, bounced back strongly. That includes measures of retail spending, consumer confidence and consumer credit. The underlying picture now appears to be one of gently rising household spending. This is being supported by highly accommodative credit conditions and now-positive growth in inflation-adjusted wages. And he added (saying he did not want to tempt fate even as he was doing so): And then, of course, there is the World Cup. Without wishing to tempt fate, England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent sporting success on the football field (and cricket pitch) has probably added to that feel-good factor among England-supporting consumers. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153smile count\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on my recent visits to Wales and Scotland was also as high as I can remember, although I suspect that may have been the weather rather than the football. More from Reuters: Haldane said there would always be some data that disappoints. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But waiting for something to turn up is not a prudent strategy in life. And waiting for everything to turn up is certainly not a prudent strategy for monetary policy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Most of Haldane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech focused on fixing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s abysmal record of productivity growth over the last 10 years. He said Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s institutions should focus more on how to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trickle-down\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd new technology to the swathes of the economy that have shown only weak growth in productivity. Stock markets continue to be volatile, with the worries about a potential trade war between the US and China continuing to dominate sentiment. The FTSE 100 is down 0.35%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 1.44% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has fallen 0.83%. The UK market is outperforming peers due to further weakness in the pound. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The FTSE avoided the losses seen over in the Eurozone, largely because of sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing crisis. Concerns about a more pessimistic Brexit outlook from the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s businesses, a lack of faith in Theresa May heading into Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU summit, and disappointment at a dovish message from MPC member Jon Cunliffe left the pound in a sorry state. Against the dollar it was at a sub-$1.31, 7 month nadir after falling 0.3%, while against the euro it hit a 7 and a half week low of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1305 following a half a percent plunge. Meanwhile on Wall Street, the futures market is suggesting a fall of more than 100 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Back in the UK, and bad news for one DIY chain. Sarah Butler and Zoe Wood report: Homebase is cutting 300 jobs at its Milton Keynes head office amid speculation that up to 80 stores will close after its takeover by the restructuring specialist Hilco. The loss-making DIY chain was bought by the owner of HMV for \u00c2\u00a31 in a deal agreed in May after its previous Australian owner, Wesfarmers, pulled the plug on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disastrous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd venture into the UK. Wesfarmers, which bought the business for \u00c2\u00a3340m two years ago, offloaded the entire 250-store Homebase chain, which has a workforce of just over 11,000 people, ditching a plan to convert them to its Bunnings brand. The full story is here: Newsflash: E-commerce giant Amazon has bought US online pharmacy chain PillPack, giving its rivals quite a headache: NEWSFLASH: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy suffered an even sharper slowdown than previously thought at the start of this year. New figures show that US GDP rose by 0.5% in the first quarter of 2018, or an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcannualised rate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of 2.0%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from a previous estimate of 2.2%, and much slower than the 2.9% annualised rate recorded in October-December. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still faster than Britain, where GDP only rose by 0.1% during the quarter (or 0.4% on an annualised basis). The slowdown won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry US policymakers too much, though. Economists think US growth roared back in the current quarter, as Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts boosted demand. An annualised growth rate of 4.5% would pretty punchy -- although not unprecedented, as the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son was reminded on Twitter last night.... In other news, oil giant BP has swooped on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest network of electric car-charging points in a \u00c2\u00a3130m deal. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an intriguing move for BP, a company more known for extracting and refining crude than for renewable energy (despite trying to move \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbeyond petroleum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at the start of the millennium). My colleague Adam Vaughan explains: The acquisition of Chargemaster, which has more than 6,500 charging points across the country, will begin to result in the deployment of fast chargers at BP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1,200 forecourts over the next year. The deal is understood to be worth \u00c2\u00a3130m and was lauded as a significant milestone towards cleaner motoring in the UK. There are more than 140,000 electric vehicles on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s roads, most of which are plug-in hybrid vehicles that can run for a short distance on battery power before switching to petrol or diesel.

The Suffolk-based company says sales of beer and gin have both spiked during England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first two (triumphant) games, so is hoping for more success for the Three Lions*. CEO Rooney Anand says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hope Harry Kane has got his shooting boots on tonight. His hat-trick on Sunday helped us sell nearly half a million [more] pints during the game.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a busy morning for the Bank of England. Deputy governor Sam Woods has written to the chief executives of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks and insurers, urging them to be cautious about getting involved with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Woods warned that digital currencies are new, volatile, and prone to use by organised criminals, saying: The range of products and market participants related to crypto-assets has grown quickly. In their short history, crypto-assets have exhibited high price volatility and relative illiquidity. Crypto-assets also raise concerns related to misconduct and market integrity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c many appear vulnerable to fraud and manipulation, as well as money-laundering and terrorist financing risks. Entering into activity related to crypto-assets may give also rise to reputational risks. Woods wants banks to make a named, senior manager responsible for signing off any crypto-related ventures, and to avoid undue risk-taking. The letter is online here. Anyone who \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinvested\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in Bitcoin late last year won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need reminding that digital currencies are volatile. Bitcoin is trading at $6,100 this morning, down from around $20,000 in mid-December. At the risk of putting more pressure on Gareth Southgate, UK businesses are pinning their hopes on a World Cup sales boost. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regional agents report that sales of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153electronics and alcoholic drinks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are expected to rise, as fans pile into the local pub or splash out on a new TV to admire Harry Kane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest screamer. Brexit isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad news for all UK companies, of course. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proving jolly lucrative for lawyers. The Bank of England explains: Business services turnover had been growing relatively solidly and more strongly than most other sectors. This was despite some hesitancy around client investment decisions that contacts reported had been driven by political uncertainty For professional services firms, Mergers and Acquisition (M&amp;A) activity from overseas buyers, Brexit preparations, and insolvency and restructuring activity had driven fee growth. The new GDPR rules on data have also bene a windfall for legal experts, the BoE adds, as companies have tried to understand how the regulations affect them. The growing pessimism about Brexit among British firms bolsters the case for a second referendum on EU membership, argues Labour MP Virendra Sharma. Sharma (a member of the Best for Britain campaign) points out that UK businesses are becoming more vocal about their concerns: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This report highlights the damage Brexit is doing to business. That means jobs are on the line. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A number of big employers have come out against Brexit recently. From Airbus to BMW to Jaguar Land Rover, jobs are being cut and livelihoods put at stake - all because Theresa May is running scared of the ideological extremists in her party. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit means fewer jobs. The case for a people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote with the option to stay in the EU becomes clearer by the day.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threats against America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading partners is also causing jitters in the UK, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regional agents report: Brexit was causing exporters and clients to examine their supply chains due to potential tariff and non-tariff barriers, and there were growing concerns about global trade protectionism. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an example of why UK firms are worried about Brexit: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Regional Agents report also shows that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumers are cutting back, particularly when it comes to big-ticket items. Growth in demand for consumer goods had not recovered sufficiently to make up for sales lost due to the adverse weather in Q1, however, and there was ongoing weak demand for new cars, white goods and homewares. Contacts attributed more cautious consumer sentiment to squeezed real incomes, higher pensions auto\u00e2\u20ac\u2018enrolment contributions and political uncertainty. Third-sector contacts suggested that delays in benefit payments and benefits sanctions were increasing the pressure on low-income households. Worryingly, this means some consumer-focused firms are now planning to axe jobs: Brexit is also making it harder for UK firms to find workers. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regional agents say that a drop in EU migration into the UK is hurting farms, restaurants and distributions firms: Recruitment difficulties remained elevated and were widespread across sectors and job roles. There were a growing number of reports of vacancies taking longer to fill and, in a small number of cases, labour shortages were constraining headcount growth. This was particularly the case where skill shortages were most acute, eg construction trades, drivers, specialist engineering and IT. A continued slowing in the inward flow of EU migrants for lower skilled and/or seasonal work was reported to be acting as a constraint in sectors such agriculture and food, hospitality and warehousing. Big UK firms, and those with an overseas focus, are particularly anxious about Brexit. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regional agents say the uncertainty is forcing them to cut back on investment: Brexit uncertainty was weighing down discretionary or expansionary investment for some medium to larger-sized businesses, or those with a greater international focus. SMEs and domestic-facing businesses were more likely to maintain a business as usual approach to investment as potential Brexit effects remained unclear. Newsflash: UK firms have become gloomier about the impact of Brexit on their sales in recent months. The latest report from the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regional agents, just released, shows an increase in the number of companies expecting a negative impact from Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. The number of companies expecting a Brexit boost has also dropped a little, compared to three months ago. As you can see, rather more companies expect Brexit to be a negative experience. Overall, UK businesses expect around 3% to be wiped off their sales, the Bank says: The average eventual change in sales was negative and stood at around -3%. Using the same methodology would suggest that the most pessimistic 10% of businesses expected a reduction in sales of more than 10% due to Brexit, while the most optimistic 10% of respondents expected a boost of 1% or more. The Regional Agents also flag up a rise in debt defaults, as struggling UK companies fall into administration: Suppliers to consumer-facing businesses had reported an increased incidence of bad debts, and contacts expected continued retail and restaurant company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) and administrations as rising costs and over\u00e2\u20ac\u2018supply put pressure on balance sheets. Sterling has hit a new seven-month low this morning, as traders digest Jon Cunliffe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning about household debt levels. The pound extended its recent slide and hit $1.3076, down almost half a cent, its lowest point since November 2017. City traders are also concerned about the state of play with Brexit; overnight, Irish PM Irish leader Leo Varadkar said the lack of progress was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disappointing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153misery\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd seems to know no end. With the Bank of England concerned about household debt, and investors doubtful about the smooth progress of Brexit despite Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts at reassurance ahead of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key EU summit, sterling fell 0.4% against the dollar, taking cable under $1.31 for the first time since early November last year. Against the euro, meanwhile, it dipped 0.3%, teasing a fresh month and a half low. Some lenders are already more reluctant to lend to consumers - perhaps anticipating the sort of financial downturn that is worrying the Bank of England. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest survey shows a very sharp decline in the availability of consumer credit - even bigger than during the last financial crisis. The BoE explained yesterday that the boom in buying cars on credit deals seems to have faded: The slowdown in consumer credit growth is consistent with a reduction in demand as well as some tightening in supply. Slower car finance growth may be driven by the wider weakness in the car market, reflected in falls in new car registrations since end-2016. In addition, the structural shift increasing the share of cars purchased with some form of car finance may also have come to an end. More generally, the reduction in credit demand may be linked to slightly lower consumer confidence Jon Cunliffe also rejected the chance to throw his hat into the ring to replace his boss, Mark Carney. Asked if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be in the running to become governor when Carney leaves next summer, Cunliffe replied: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a really challenging and difficult job and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just focusing on doing it the best I can. When he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not being distracted by the World Cup, anyway..... Jon Cunliffe also played down the prospect of interest rates rising sharply soon. Cunliffe is one of the more dovish members of the Monetary Policy Committee - one of the six who voted to leave rates unchanged at just 0.5% last week. Asked whether borrowing costs could hit 2.5% in a few years, Cunliffe pointed out that the City only expects them to rise modestly: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Financial markets are assuming that interest rates go up by another three-quarters of a percentage point over the next couple of years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We do our forecasting on the basis of where the financial markets have those interest rates and we think we have inflation at target at those sorts of levels. This chart (from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Stability Report) shows why the Bank is fretting about household debt levels: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. One of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top policymakers has warned that indebted households could be in peril if Britain falls into recession. Deputy governor Jon Cunliffe told BBC radio this morning that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerned about families with high debt levels. Cunliffe warned that some households have run up worrying levels of debts, which could drag them into a crisis if the economy sours, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153(Household debt is) quite high by historical standards but (households have) worked hard to put those debt levels down. But within that there are areas that you do worry about. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You worry about households that have high debt (and) could be badly affected in a recession.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd UK household debt now totals \u00c2\u00a31.8 trillion. Around 75% of that is mortgage debt, which will become more expensive to repay if interest rates go up. The rest is mostly in consumer credit. Yesterday, the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest financial stability report shows how household debt is creeping up again, when compared to the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s income. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not at 2008 levels yet, but policymakers seem concerned about the direction of travel. Cunliffe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments come a day after high street bellwether John Lewis revealed its profits had collapsed to almost nothing so far this year. Also coming up today One of Cunliffe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s colleagues, chief economist Andy Haldane, gives a speech this afternoon. He may elaborate on why he voted to raise interest rates last week. European stock markets rallied yesterday after America backed away from imposing new curbs on Chinese investment in the UK. But they may fall back today, after a late wobble on Wall Street yesterday. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Despite an early burst higher for the Dow following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turnaround on Chinese restrictions, the index surrendered its biggest daily gain in 4 months to close 165 points in the red. A selloff in tech stocks &amp; financials overshadowing a rally in the energy sector. Asian markets took their cues from the US, heading southwards overnight. China, which technically entered bear market territory in the previous session after dropping 20% from its January peak, continued to grind lower, as trade war concerns and a slowing of momentum in the economy have sent investors running. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a relatively busy day on the economic front, with eurozone confidence figures, German inflation data, and an updated estimate of US growth in the last quarter. Traders will also be watching events in Brussels tonight, where EU leaders gather for a summit dominated by migration and Brexit. The agenda: 10am BST: Eurozone consumer and economic confidence figures for June 1pm BST: German inflation figures for June 1.30pm BST: US GDP figures for January-March (third estimate) 2.30pm BST: BoE chief economist Andy Haldane speaks",

                "bodyText":"We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had posh chocolate, premium mixer drinks, artisan gin and craft beer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c now ice lollies have become the latest target of a foodie makeover. Whereas the choice used to be standard fruit flavours such as strawberry and orange in bright colours and novelty shapes, a wave of new British food brands have begun serving up \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gourmet lollies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd aimed at adults, with adventurous flavours ranging from Earl Grey tea to alcoholic watermelon martini popsicles. The next big thing, the posh lolly experts predict, will be dipping them into shot glasses containing the same sort of alcohol for a particularly intense flavour hit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Frozen is one of the markets that has not evolved,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd explains James Rae, a co-founder of the London-based Pops, which has scored a hit with its alcoholic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153premium popsicles\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Look at what what has happened with tonic water, confectionery and craft beer over the past five years,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rae continues. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Frozen food was boring and controlled by the usual suspects. Very few people were doing anything with lollies. There was a gap for an adult-focused product that was refreshing and quirky.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The adult ice lolly market is one of the fastest-growing product areas in the ice cream market, with sales up 23% to \u00c2\u00a340m in the past year , according to Kantar Worldpanel, which tracks UK grocery sales trends. Much of the boost is down to the success of boozy ice lollies, with supermarket chains such as Aldi having already spotted the trend and launching its Gianni\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s range of cocktail-flavoured popsicles. While British consumers eat ice cream all year round \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the market has surged by nearly 10% to break through the \u00c2\u00a31bn sales barrier over the last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it takes a heatwave to trigger a rush on ice lollies. According to sales data, ice lolly sales only really take off when the temperature tops 24C. Mass-market ice cream makers have also come under pressure as consumers seek healthier or more artisanal versions but new makers have flourished \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as Little Moons, with its Japanese-style mochi gelato balls, which can be skewered together to create a lolly. It is not only a UK trend. Unilever, the biggest ice cream maker in the world and the producer of Magnum, Ben &amp; Jerry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Wall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, blamed disappointing summer sales last year on competition from the low-calorie brand Halo Top, which has taken America by storm. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since May we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not had chance to breathe,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rae adds. Ice pops sales have doubled this year and the company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whose financial backers include the Fever-Tree co-founder Charles Rolls and the gastronome Loyd Grossman \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is forecasting sales of \u00c2\u00a33m for 2019 from a standing start four years ago. Tesco has just agreed to stock its Pimm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s-flavoured lolly. Another brand trying to raise the stakes is Ice Kitchen, which is run by Cesar Roden, the grandson of the food writer Claudia Roden, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to be a challenger to Wall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and other mainstream brands,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Roden, whose bestsellers include the mojito poptail. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These are chef-inspired lollies with natural ingredients.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We believe that the alcoholic ice cream trend is here to stay,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Roden says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aldi has brought a lot more awareness to alcoholic lollies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He believes consumers will become more experimental and predicts the next trend will be dipping lollies into a shot glass of paired alcohol. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The ice lollies soak up a lot of the alcohol, which then creates a whole new tasting experience.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Taste test We asked three Guardian lolly lovers to taste and test some of the new posh popsicles.

It is not doing so well against the euro, down 0.1% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1290. The euro has held on to its gains against the dollar, currently up 0.6% at $1.1641. Over in the US, consumers only slightly increased their spending in May - despite rising wages - as prices increased at the fastest rate in more than six years. Personal spending grew by 0.2% last month, down from 0.5% in April and weaker than the 0.4% predicted by economists. A fall in spending on services like household utilities was partially offset by higher spending on items such as recreational goods. Personal income - measuring Americans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pretax earnings from salaries and other sources including investments - rose by 0.4% in May, according to the figures from the US Commerce Department. The price index for personal consumption expenditures - the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred measure of inflation - increased by 2.3% in the year to May, which was the highest rate since March 2012. Barely a week after the EU announced a debt deal for Greece - saying the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-running economic crisis was over - the International Monetary Fund has sounded the alarm. Helena Smith reports from Athens. Greece will need significant further debt relief if it is to have problem-free access to international markets \u00e2\u20ac\u0153over the longer run.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That, in a nutshell, is the message from the IMF today, which said Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to achieve a primary surplus of 3.5% annually, was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very optimistic \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 [and] ambitious.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Speaking eight days after the eurozone agreed to medium-term debt relief for Athens \u00e2\u20ac\u201c extending maturities and prolonging interest payments on about a third of its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac320bn debt pile \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mission chief for Greece insisted it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough. Peter Dohlman said: We are concerned this improvement in debt indicators \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 can only be sustained over the long run under what appear to be very optimistic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c maybe ambitious is a better word \u00e2\u20ac\u201c assumptions on GDP growth and Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to run high primary surpluses for an extended period of time. Without more measures, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt load would be unsustainable he warned, adding that if there was a let-up in reforms to boost competitiveness, growth would be limited. Burdened with the highest debt-to-GDP ratio in the euro zone, Greece will exit its third and final international rescue programme in August. Time for another look at European markets, boosted today by the news that EU leaders had agreed a migration deal in Brussels, easing fears of political instability. FTSE 100: +0.7% at 7,666 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: 1.4% at 12,344 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +1.3% at 5,344 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +1% at 21,644 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.8% at 9,665 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +1% at 381 The insurance firm Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of London has announced that its chief executive Dame Inga Beale will step down next year after five years. The company did not give a reason for her departure and said the search for her replacement had begun. Bruce Carnegie-Brown, chairman at Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, said: In her five years at Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Inga has set in motion a series of changes aimed at modernising the market and making it more efficient and inclusive. Her boldness and persistence have generated the momentum required to bring about real change.

Beale said: The decision to leave has been a tough one and when the time comes I will miss the energy, innovative spirit and expertise that I come across every working day. Leading Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is an honour and I am proud to have played a part in ensuring that it remains relevant and fit for purpose for the future. As the first half of 2018 draws to a close, analysts at Hargreaves Lansdown have done a review of markets. The FTSE is slightly below where it started the year, but thanks to dividends, investors are still in positive territory. Despite fears of overvaluation, the US has proved the best performing major stock market this year, though most of the returns for UK investors have come from a strengthening dollar. After a strong run, the German stock market has fallen from grace, as cracks in the eurozone resurfaced, and trade tensions have stoked concerns over the exporting giants of the German economy. A collapse in the share price of Deutsche Bank hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped matters either. FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top five performing stocks in the first half: 1. Ocado: +160% 2. Evraz: +49% 3. Sky: +44% 4. Next: +34% 5. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s: +33% ...and the five worst performers: 1. Micro Focus International: -50% 2. Standard Life Aberdeen: -26% 3. British American Tobacco: -23% 4. Sage Group: -22% 5. Randgold Resources: -22% Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at the firm, says: In the UK, Ocado has been the stand-out performer. After sealing a deal with the US grocery giant Kroger, the online supermarket has thrust its way into the FTSE 100. Its meteoric rise has inflicted serious pain on the hedge funds who bet against it, and they will still be licking their considerable wounds. At the other end of proceedings, a profit warning and a chief executive resignation has done for the Micro Focus share price. Likewise the shine has come off Standard Life Aberdeen following last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s merger. The pick-up in eurozone inflation is another factor behind a stronger euro today, on top of the EU deal on migrants, says John Dolan from currency firm Fexco Corporate Payments: The Euro enjoyed a boost from the overnight deal in Brussels, and this was consolidated by the news that eurozone inflation has ticked up. While the increase in eurozone inflation to 2.0% was widely expected, and will do little to soften Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovish dogma in the short term, the combination of economic growth and rising prices will eventually force the ECB into normalising monetary policy. All of which has helped the Euro hold onto its early morning gains against the Dollar, and the single currency is set to end the month on a high. Annual inflation in the eurozone edged up to 2% in June from 1.9% in May according to the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Eurostat, the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics office. It is the highest rate in more than a year, as higher energy prices pushed price growth above the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of just below 2%. Inflation was also pushed up by higher prices of food, alcohol and tobacco. The rise will be welcome news for Mario Draghi and his colleagues on the governing council of European Central Bank, providing justification for their decision to phase out the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s massive bond-buying programme by the end of the year. The number of mortgages approved for house purchase rose to a four-month high of 64,526 in May, according to figures from the Bank of England. It was up from 62,941 in April and beat economists expectations of 62,200 approvals. However, the data also reflected a weak backdrop for consumers, with 8.5% growth in unsecured consumer lending the weakest since November 2015. Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, is not impressed by the upward revision to UK GDP and says it shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be soothing fears. Headlines can be misleading and while an upgrade is always welcome, it comes purely down to a revision to the contribution of the construction sector which contracted by only a miserable 0.8% against a previously abhorrent estimate of 2.7%. Q1 is still the quarter of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBeast from the East\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and sizeable disruption to consumption habits as a result and while Q2 data will be higher, it is unlikely to do anything than confirm the malaise at the heart of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic engine. UK growth was revised up after more the ONS received more data from the construction firms, which showed a fall in output in the sector was smaller than previously estimated. Construction output fell by 0.8% between January and March, and not by a sharper 2.7% according to earlier estimates from the ONS. It was the weakest growth since the third quarter of 2012. Despite the upward revision, the ONS said Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building industry struggled over the first quarter, and the Beast from the East wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t entirely to blame: While there is some evidence of an impact from the bad weather on this industry, our initial analysis shows weakness in construction throughout the quarter, not just the period during the bad weather. The pound is up 0.7% against the dollar to $1.3169, building on earlier gains after the ONS revised up UK growth in the first quarter to 0.2% from 0.1%. Sterling was briefly up against the euro, but has edged lower again, down 0.1% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1296. Breaking: The UK economy grew by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2018, slightly faster than the 0.1% previously estimated by the Office for National Statistics. Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS, explains the revision: GDP growth was revised up slightly in the first three months of 2018, with later construction data, and significantly improved methods for measuring the sector, nudging up growth. These improved methods, introduced as part of ONS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual update to its figures, will lead to better early estimates of the construction sector with smaller revisions in the future. Overall, households have now been borrowers for six consecutive quarters as rising prices have continued to squeeze domestic budgets. Investment by both local and central government and the private sector fell, with spending on buildings, machinery and software all seeing notable falls. MPs on the influential Treasury committee have issued a warning to the Bank of England over the lack of women in senior roles. In the first intervention of its kind, the committee warned it could block the appointment of male candidates to its main policymaking committees. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates, includes only one woman - Silvana Tenreyro. Nicky Morgan, Conservative MP and chair of the committee, said MPs were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prepared to take progress on this matter into account\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Read our full story here: Downing Street says BAE Systems\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Australian shipbuilding win is the biggest Naval defence contract for a decade. British defence manufacturer, BAE Systems, is one of the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest risers this morning after it won a \u00c2\u00a320bn contract to build Australian warships. The company will build nine new ships at the Osborne Naval Shipyard in Adelaide. The ships will be modelled on BAE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Type 26 global combat ship and will be known as the Hunter class. Theresa May said the export of a British design for the frigates would be an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enormous boost\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the UK economy, although the jobs associated with the programme will be created in Australia. Production of the first ship is expected to start in early 2020s, BAE said. Shares are up 2.4% at 647p. Trading is underway across Europe and the mood is upbeat: FTSE 100: +1% at 7,691 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +1.2% at 12,328 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +1.4% at 5,350 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +1.5% at 21,751 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.9% at 9,675 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The euro is rallying after EU leaders in Brussels broke the deadlock on migration talks after a marathon session lasting nearly 10 hours. Investors fearful of an escalation of political instability breathed a sigh of relief when Donald Tusk, head of the European Council, tweeted the news shortly before dawn. The euro jumped to $1.1650, and is currently up 0.6% at $1.1642. It is also up 0.3% against the pound at 87.5p. Fears had been mounting that a deal in Brussels would not be struck, when Italy threatened to veto the text, unless other EU states did more to help with people arriving on Italian shores. Jasper Lawler from London Capital Group explains why traders felt relief at the deal: The migrant crisis in Europe threatened German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fragile coalition, which was in danger of collapsing if she left the summit without a deal. The euro picked up from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.157 to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.162 in the space of a few short minutes. The deal will also reassure investors of broader political stability in the European Union, lowering the risk of any further breakaway from a member country.
