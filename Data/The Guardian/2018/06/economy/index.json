Economist James Smith says the jobs data means a June rate hike is still on the cards. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Rising employment and an above-consensus wage growth figure will reinforce expectations for a rate rise in a couple of weeks, although Fed voters will also have a firm eye on the latest trade developments.</p> <p>President Trump said shortly before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs report that he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153looking forward\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to seeing the numbers. And with the economy having added 223k jobs in May, he is likely to be fairly chuffed.</p> <p>The unemployment rate fell to 3.8%, a new post-crisis low, and in fact came within spitting distance of 3.7% once rounding is taken into consideration. This decline came as almost 300,000 job hunters found employment in May according to the household survey.</p> <p>But for the Fed, the key positive in this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report is that wage growth beat estimates, taking the year-on-year rate back up to 2.7%. This comes as firms appear to be finding it harder to fill positions. The proportion of small businesses finding it hard to fill job openings continues to flirt with all-time highs, while it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taking around twice as long to fill vacancies than it did during depths of the financial crisis. We think wage growth could test 3% again this year as these skill shortages gradually filter through to the official numbers.</p> <p>All of this means that a rate hike is still highly likely from the Fed in a couple of weeks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time. Our base case is that the committee will hike a further two times after that in 2018, although of course there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no doubt that Fed officials will be keeping a firm eye on the brewing global trade war, and this is the main risk to our view.</p> <p>As far as the jobs numbers are concerned, we suspect it is probably too early to see the effect of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s metal tariffs in this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, but things could start to look a little more concerning over coming months.</p> <p>There are reportedly only around 300,000 workers directly employed in both the steel and aluminium production industries. By comparison, some estimates have put the number of jobs in companies reliant on steel/aluminium inputs at around 6.5 million \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in industries covering aircraft to beer cans. On this basis, the risks stemming from the metals tariffs are likely to be a net negative for the overall jobs market.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b114008e4b022a3efa0e979\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-01T12:46:29.148Z\">1.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ING strategist Viraj Patel on the US jobs numbers:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/VPatelFX/status/1002530147659124736\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hard to find a -ve in the US jobs report.

We suspect it is too early to see any tariff impact in these figures, but the slowdown in the Eurozone that we saw through the first quarter may be playing a role. The gradual strengthening in the trade-weighted pound since last summer could also be beginning to hit demand at the margin.</p> <p>Of course, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector only makes up around 10% of the economy, so we suspect the Bank of England will be paying closer attention to next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services index as it tries to gauge whether growth is rebounding after the weaker first quarter.</p> <p>After a couple of months of dismal weather, May finally saw the sun come out and this should have given the struggling high street a much needed boost. That said...we think consumer-facing sectors are not out of the woods just yet. Households remain cautious in the face of rising petrol prices, stagnant real wages, as well as economic uncertainty more generally.</p> <p>For that reason, a rate hike over the summer is still far from guaranteed. However our feeling from recent Bank of England commentary is that the committee has a preference to hike rates sooner rather than later if the data allows, in part to combat the risk of rising wage growth and underlying inflation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b110a1ee4b0033069061fe2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-01T08:56:14.464Z\">9.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier we also had the German manufacturing PMI:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MarkitEconomics/status/1002472619202043904\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Germany?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Germany</a> Manufacturing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PMI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PMI</a> hits 15-month low in May.

UBS analyst Bosco Ojeda explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In a quick succession of events the Spanish parliament will vote this Friday June 1st a vote of no confidence which could remove from power president Mr. Rajoy (Partido Popular) and appoint Mr. Sanchez (PSOE)...</p> <p>Mr. Sanchez (PSOE) has indicated that he aims to call for early elections but the exact timing is uncertain. Current polls show weak support for PSOE, while there is increasing support for [rival] Ciudadanos. So incentives to call elections are unclear and may extend towards the 2020 limit. Mr. Sanchez has reiterated a commitment with European orthodoxy and budget control in Spain. His plan includes the acceptance on the current 2018 budget. Going forward it may be more expansive on spending but there is not much room. Attempts to reverse reforms may not find a majority in parliament.A complete u-turn in policy seems unlikely.</p> <p>Assuming, for the time being, a high degree of policy continuity, we do not anticipate a substantial impact on the pace of growth. Usually elections have a mild impact on GDP with delays in confidence and investments. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP growth at 3% YTD is solid but may slow moderately over the coming quarters, with full year growth of 2.8% in 2018 and 2.3% in 2019. According to polls the 3 largest parties (PP, Ciudadanos and PSOE) have c70% of vote intentions and support pro-European orthodox policies which in our view are unlikely to drive a u-turn in economic policy. Far left party Podemos according to polls does not have enough support to lead the economic policies. Overall, Spanish equities and bonds have lately suffered and discount a high level of uncertainty. Only contagion from Italy would represent a real risk to risk premium levels, in our view. Latest correction on equities offer opportunities, particularly on banks and largecaps.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"148fac528bc31ce03917faab8939226432d3b4be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/148fac528bc31ce03917faab8939226432d3b4be/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mayoress of Barcelona, Ada Colau, on the second day of the no-confidence motion debate against Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy at the Lower House in the Spanish Parliament in Madrid.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mayoress of Barcelona, Ada Colau, on the second day of the no-confidence motion debate against Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy at the Lower House in the Spanish Parliament in Madrid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EMILIO NARANJO POOL / POOL/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b10ff38e4b0033069061f99\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-01T08:12:47.171Z\">9.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third biggest, grew by 0.3% in the first quarter of the year, in line with initial estimates.</p> <p>The annual increase was 1.4%.

Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After a strong year of economic activity in 2017 the manufacturing sector got off to a slightly softer start at the beginning of this year, across the board. In some of the recent April data there is evidence that this softness has evened out a little and started to stabilise. In Europe activity was able to rebound a little in part, while in the US we also saw increasing evidence of rising prices with prices paid at 7-year highs. If this trend continues in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers then that should be supportive of a rebound in Q2. Expectations for Spain, Italy, France and Germany manufacturing are for 54, 53, 55.1 and 56.8. </p> <p>In the UK we also saw a decent rebound after a soft March number, which may well have been weather related. Activity in May is expected to have steadied at around 53.5, a slight decline from the modest rebound seen in the April numbers with particular attention likely to be on cost price inflation which still looks fairly robust.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally the non-farm payrolls, where around 190,000 jobs are expected to have been created in May after a weak 164,000 figure in April. Wages are forecast to grow by around 2.8%, up from 2.6%.</p> <p>Even if the numbers are disappointing, analysts believe this will not stop the Federal Reserve raising US interest rates in June.</p> <p><strong>Agenda:</strong></p> <p>9.00 BST Eurozone Markit manufacturing PMI</p> <p>9.00 BST Italian GDP</p> <p>9.30 BST UK Markit manufacturing PMI</p> <p>13.30 BST US non-farm payrolls</p> <p>14.45 BST US Markit manufacting PMI</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-06-01T09:06:41.810Z\">at 10.06am BST</time></p>  </div>",
                "bodyText":"Investors pretty much knew that the US was about to slap steel and aluminium tariffs on the EU, Mexico and Canada, so in true market fashion, it was sell on the rumour and buy on the fact. The EU however said it was pressing ahead with a complaint to the World Trade Organisation about the US move, and had also opened a challenge against China over intellectual property. News that a week of political turmoil in Italy had ended with a new coalition government also helped sentiment, while the no confidence vote in Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (now ex) prime minister Rajoy was helped by the fact that a new euro-friendly administration was in place almost immediately. So markets are ending the week on a positive note, with Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB up 2.53%, Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex 1.83% better and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax ahead by 1.4%. In the UK the FTSE 100 is 0.5% higher, while on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 221 points or 0.9%. On the economic front, the US created more jobs than expected in May, something previewed by a Trump tweet ahead of the official release. In Europe, eurozone manufacturing fell to a 15 month low. In the UK, however, the latest manufacturing PMI survey came in slightly betteer than expected, although the recovery was said to be unconvincing. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the week. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. US factories grew strongly again last month, but slightly more slowly than expected. The final Markit manufacturing PMI came in at 56.4 compared to the intial estimate of 56.6 and April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure of 56.5. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has spoken about the Trump tweet on the jobs figures: Despite the growing trade tensions after the US imposed its tariffs on the EU, Canada and Mexico, Wall Street has followed European markets higher, helped by a better than expected jobs figure. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 210 points or 0.86% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.6% higher. Here is our story on the US jobs data, and the president commenting on the figures before their official release: Donald Trump broke with years of protocol on Friday, commenting on the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest jobs report an hour before its official release. The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced at 8.30am that the US had added 223,000 new jobs in May as the unemployment rate slid t0 3.8%, its lowest level since April 2000 and one of the lowest levels since after the second world war. Trump, who has taken credit for job market growth despite the fact that it began under Obama, said on Twitter he was looking forward to the release of the monthly jobs report just over an hour ahead of its release. Following his tweet, treasury yields moved sharply higher. The monthly report is one of the most market sensitive pieces of economic information released by the government and is carefully guarded ahead of its release. For anyone other than the president, the comment would likely lead to an investigation or likely firing. The report is given to senior White House officials the day before its release but is usually closely protected. Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Obama, said Trump should never again be given sight of the figures before their release. Our full story is here: And more Trump. The president has turned his attention back to trade, and Canada: Former US treasury secretary Summers has strong views on the Trump tweet which came ahead of the official announcement of the jobs numbers: More from ING Bank. Economist James Smith says the jobs data means a June rate hike is still on the cards. He said: Rising employment and an above-consensus wage growth figure will reinforce expectations for a rate rise in a couple of weeks, although Fed voters will also have a firm eye on the latest trade developments. President Trump said shortly before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs report that he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153looking forward\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to seeing the numbers. And with the economy having added 223k jobs in May, he is likely to be fairly chuffed. The unemployment rate fell to 3.8%, a new post-crisis low, and in fact came within spitting distance of 3.7% once rounding is taken into consideration. This decline came as almost 300,000 job hunters found employment in May according to the household survey. But for the Fed, the key positive in this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report is that wage growth beat estimates, taking the year-on-year rate back up to 2.7%. This comes as firms appear to be finding it harder to fill positions. The proportion of small businesses finding it hard to fill job openings continues to flirt with all-time highs, while it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taking around twice as long to fill vacancies than it did during depths of the financial crisis. We think wage growth could test 3% again this year as these skill shortages gradually filter through to the official numbers. All of this means that a rate hike is still highly likely from the Fed in a couple of weeks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time. Our base case is that the committee will hike a further two times after that in 2018, although of course there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no doubt that Fed officials will be keeping a firm eye on the brewing global trade war, and this is the main risk to our view. As far as the jobs numbers are concerned, we suspect it is probably too early to see the effect of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s metal tariffs in this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, but things could start to look a little more concerning over coming months. There are reportedly only around 300,000 workers directly employed in both the steel and aluminium production industries. By comparison, some estimates have put the number of jobs in companies reliant on steel/aluminium inputs at around 6.5 million \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in industries covering aircraft to beer cans. On this basis, the risks stemming from the metals tariffs are likely to be a net negative for the overall jobs market. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ING strategist Viraj Patel on the US jobs numbers: The US unemployment rate has fallen to a new 18 year low of 3.8%, slightly better than the 3.9% expected. April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs figure was revised down from 164,000 - already weak - to 159,000 but March was higher than originally reported, up from 135,000 to 155,000. On the wages front, year on year earnings were up 2.7% compared to 2.6% in April, in line with forecasts. Month on month, wages grew by 0.3%, a little higher than the expected 0.2%. Perhaps no surprise given Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive tweet, but the US jobs figures are much better than expected. Some 223,000 jobs were created in May compared to expectations of a 190,000 increase. Back with the EC, and commissioner Malmstrom says we are not in a trade war yet but in a very difficult situation brought on by the US. It is a very worrying situation, she says, it could escalate and the economic recovery risks being diminished by this. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 The US is playing a dangerous game here.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meanwhile, on the US jobs data which is due shortly, President Trump has tweeted about them ahead of time: On the US tariffs, she says the EU is talking to Canada, Mexico, as well as Japan. There might be others as well who will react. Malmstrom says the WTO| complaint about the US tariff will be made in the next few days, and the EU is also making a challenge against China on intellectual property. She says: We are not choosing any sides. We are determined to deal with the root causes of the current tension in the trade system. But we need to do that within the rules. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a link to the European Commission press conference by Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom on the response to the US tariffs. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable on the US tariffs, courtesty PA: As well as being petty and most probably illegal, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade war is ultimately self-defeating. In the inevitable retaliation, there will end up being tariffs on a plethora of US products from jeans to Trump Tower merchandise. This shows how absurd it is for the likes of [UK international trade secretary Liam] Fox to pin their hopes on - and entrust our economic future to - a bilateral trade deal with the US. We know he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s illogical and stubborn, but he claims to be a good businessman. Trump must back down. Following the news of the US move, Fox had told Sky News the tariffs were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153patently absurd\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but said they would not affect a post-Brexit trade deal between the US and UK. He said: The US administration has made clear again this week that they are very keen to see an agreement with the UK but regard steel imports as an EU issue. The European Union is pressing ahead with its retaliation to the US trade tariffs: The EU is opening a case at the World Trade Organisation, after the US imposition of a 25% duty on European steel and a 10% duty on European aluminium came into force this morning. Cecilia Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m, the EU trade commissioner, is also expected to announce retaliatory tariffs on classic American products, such as Levi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jeans, bourbon whiskey, cranberries and peanut butter, at a press conference later on Friday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The European Union will today proceed with the WTO dispute settlement case adding those additional duties on a number of imports from the United States,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Federica Mogherini, the EU high representative on foreign policy, told journalists this morning. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The European Union measures will be reasonable, proportionate and in full compliance with WTO rules and obligations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She was the latest European politician to hit back at the US decision, which has was described by President Emmanuel Macron of France as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mistake\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153patently absurd\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Speaking on Friday morning, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy minister Peter Altmaier said he hoped that a decisive response from the EU would prompt the US president to think again. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We hope that the European response will result in a process of reflection in the USA,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Altmaier told German broadcaster ARD, adding that the EU may look to work with Mexico and Canada on trade, also hit by the new tariffs. Bernd Lange, the German socialist MEP who chairs the European parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international trade committee, said the tariffs were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153illegal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and insisted the EU would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153make some countermeasures, no doubt about\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We chose also some symbolic products like Harley-Davidson to make clear here is a red card.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here is the full story: Markets so far continue to be fairly relaxed about the prospect of a global trade war, and the ousting of Mariano Rajoy as Spanish prime minister. The resolution of the turmoil in Italian politics certainly seems to be helping sentiment, with Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB now up 2.5%. Elsewhere Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex is up 1.77% following the vote against Rajoy, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has risen 0.9% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 1.24%. In the UK, the FTSE 100 is 0.65% better. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open nearly 120 points higher. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda said: The imposition of steel and aluminium tariffs by the US on Europe, Canada and Mexico has drawn plenty of criticism from officials but maybe in a sign of how markets can become less sensitive to certain issues, the response has so far been fairly muted. Focus will now be on the retaliatory measures that these countries have lined up and whether that in turn triggers a larger and quite unnecessary trade war. Investors currently appear at ease with the situation but that could quickly change. And a handy guide to the potential global trade war from ING Bank: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a US Federal Reserve member on the trade tariffs: The voting in Spain by the way showed 180 in favour of ousting prime minister Rajoy, 169 against, and one abstention. The Spanish vote has had less impact than the turmoil in Italy, says Seema Shah, global investment strategist at Principal Global Investors: Much of the market panic around Italy was about the threat to its membership of the Euro area but, by contrast, all of the main Spanish political parties are supportive of the single currency. Presuming Sanchez does not try to hang on to power, Spain is likely to see new elections later this year and a market-friendly, pro-European government should materialise from there. In the meantime, given that the support of Basque nationalist MPs required a promise to not change the budget, Sanchez is unlikely to make sweeping changes to the budget. Material economic progress has been made in recent years - Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal position has improved; unemployment has fallen; and the banking system has been strengthened - the latest political disruption does not upset the generally positive outlook for the Spanish economy. Of course, political uncertainty is never welcome, but it has been telling that Spanish bond yields have fallen again today. It seems that Italian politics are more important for Spanish markets than Spanish politics. Here is Sanchez receiving the applause after becoming prime minister elect: The confidence vote is underway in Spain and here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a link: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick summary of some of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMIs: Back with UK manufacturing, and despite the unconvincing outlook, ING Bank economist James Smith believes the Bank of England is still inclined to raise interest rates this summer: At 54.4, the latest UK manufacturing PMI is a little better than hoped but is still a far cry from the levels seen towards the end of last year. Whilst Markit/CIPS noted the weakness partly reflected a slower pace of domestic orders, we also wonder whether the steadier global growth over the past few months is starting to weigh. We suspect it is too early to see any tariff impact in these figures, but the slowdown in the Eurozone that we saw through the first quarter may be playing a role. The gradual strengthening in the trade-weighted pound since last summer could also be beginning to hit demand at the margin. Of course, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector only makes up around 10% of the economy, so we suspect the Bank of England will be paying closer attention to next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services index as it tries to gauge whether growth is rebounding after the weaker first quarter. After a couple of months of dismal weather, May finally saw the sun come out and this should have given the struggling high street a much needed boost. That said...we think consumer-facing sectors are not out of the woods just yet. Households remain cautious in the face of rising petrol prices, stagnant real wages, as well as economic uncertainty more generally. For that reason, a rate hike over the summer is still far from guaranteed. However our feeling from recent Bank of England commentary is that the committee has a preference to hike rates sooner rather than later if the data allows, in part to combat the risk of rising wage growth and underlying inflation. Earlier we also had the German manufacturing PMI: The Spanish confidence vote is due in around 15 minutes (10am BST), and it seems Mariano Rajoy is resigned to leaving, with socialist Pedro Sanchez set to take over as prime minister. British factory growth was stronger than expected in May, according to a survey of the sector, but the increase masks its underlying weakness. The Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI came in at 54.4, up from 53.9 in April and above expectations of a figure of 53.5. Markit director Rob Dobson said: At first glance the mild acceleration in the rate of output growth and rise in the headline PMI would appear positive. However scratch beneath the surface and the rebound in PMI from April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 17 month low is far from convincing. Raw material prices rose more sharply in May, but manufacturers were less able to pass on these increases and also faces supply issues. Dobson said: These price and supply headwinds, combined with a further slowdown in new order growth, could jeopardise any further expansion of the manufacturing sector. The International Monetary Fund has called for countries to work together on trade. In response to the US tariff moves, IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said: Everybody loses in a protracted trade war, we encourage countries to work constructively together to reduce trade barriers and to resolve trade disagreements without resort to exceptional measures. It is unfortunate that trade tensions are rising at a moment where the global recovery is being supported by trade. For the first time in a long time, trade is growing faster than global GDP, and spreading recovery around the world. Because of trade and innovation, billions of people today enjoy longer, healthier, and more prosperous lives. Earlier IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, tweeted from the G7 Symposium in Canada: Markets seem to be unmoved, not only by the US tariffs, but also the political uncertainty in Spain. UBS analyst Bosco Ojeda explains: In a quick succession of events the Spanish parliament will vote this Friday June 1st a vote of no confidence which could remove from power president Mr. Rajoy (Partido Popular) and appoint Mr. Sanchez (PSOE)... Mr. Sanchez (PSOE) has indicated that he aims to call for early elections but the exact timing is uncertain. Current polls show weak support for PSOE, while there is increasing support for [rival] Ciudadanos. So incentives to call elections are unclear and may extend towards the 2020 limit. Mr. Sanchez has reiterated a commitment with European orthodoxy and budget control in Spain. His plan includes the acceptance on the current 2018 budget. Going forward it may be more expansive on spending but there is not much room. Attempts to reverse reforms may not find a majority in parliament.A complete u-turn in policy seems unlikely. Assuming, for the time being, a high degree of policy continuity, we do not anticipate a substantial impact on the pace of growth. Usually elections have a mild impact on GDP with delays in confidence and investments. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP growth at 3% YTD is solid but may slow moderately over the coming quarters, with full year growth of 2.8% in 2018 and 2.3% in 2019. According to polls the 3 largest parties (PP, Ciudadanos and PSOE) have c70% of vote intentions and support pro-European orthodox policies which in our view are unlikely to drive a u-turn in economic policy. Far left party Podemos according to polls does not have enough support to lead the economic policies. Overall, Spanish equities and bonds have lately suffered and discount a high level of uncertainty. Only contagion from Italy would represent a real risk to risk premium levels, in our view. Latest correction on equities offer opportunities, particularly on banks and largecaps. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third biggest, grew by 0.3% in the first quarter of the year, in line with initial estimates. The annual increase was 1.4%. Fourth quarter growth was revised up quarter on quarter to 0.4% from 0.3%. Meanwhile the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing PMI came in below expectations: The GDP figure and the PMI survey both came before the latest Italian political turmoil, of course. Eurozone factory growth was subdued in May, falling to a 15 month low, and the weakness looks set to continue. The IHS Markit final manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 55.5, in line with an initial estimate but below the April figure of 56.2. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at Markit, said: Some of the weakness may have been related to a higher than usual number of holidays during the month, but risks appear tilted towards growth remaining subdued or even cooling further in the coming months. There are signs the soft patch has further to run. Despite the production trend slowing markedly in recent months, the order book slowdown has been even sharper. Although growth is slowing, it may still be strong enough for the European Central Bank to press on with its plans to reduce its economic stimulus programme, due to finish by the end of 2018. Away from trade for a moment, and here is a handy round-up of predictions for the non-farm payroll numbers later: We expect to hear more details of the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to the US tariffs at lunchtime (1pm BST) when the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade commissioner gives a press conference. With European markets moving higher, taking their cue from Italy not tariffs, Wall Street is also expected to open in positive territory, with IG indicated a 90 point or so rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Setting aside the trade war tensions between the US and EU, for now anyway, the European indices got off to a strong start on Friday as the Italian political crisis appeared to come to an end. Though not exactly the ideal government in the eyes of the markets, with a combination of ministers from the anti-establishment Five State Movement and the right-wing League, the formation of any Italian government is something to celebrate given how pronounced fears were that the situation would result in a Eurosceptic snap election... The euro wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as enthused, its joy tempered by the brewing transatlantic trade issues, the nature of the Italian government and the fact today could see Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy receive a vote of no confidence. This meant the single currency only managed a 0.1% rise against both the dollar and the euro, crossing $1.17 against the former and \u00c2\u00a30.88 against the latter. Legal proceedings against the US measures are due to be triggered at the World Trade Organisation today. The EU wants the US actions declared illegal, but under WTO rules it will have to wait until mid-June to implement any balancing - i.e. retaliatory - measures. The US tariffs, of course, came into effect at midnight on Thursday. A new reaction from China to the US tariffs, courtesy Reuters: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign ministry said on Friday all countries should protect the normal trade order, when asked about United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum exports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico. Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying made the comments at a regular briefing in Beijing. On Tuesday the White House imposed 25% tariffs on $50bn of Chinese goods with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153industrially significant technology.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The threat of a trade war does not seem to have spooked European investors too much, so far at least. The FTSE 100 has climbed 0.6%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up a similar amount. News of the new government in Italy has helped the FTSE MIB gain 2.14% while Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex has added 1% despite the prospect of prime minister Rajoy being ousted. The EU, Canada and Mexico have said they will take the trade dispute to the World Trade Organisation. Europe has a list of products which will be subject to retaliatory measures, including peanut butter, Levi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jeans, Harley-Davidson motor bikes and bourbon whiskey. Canada plans tariffs on \u00c2\u00a39.6bn worth of goods, from steel to orange juice. Mexico plans to target a range of products including lamps, sausages, cranberries and cheese. Former White House Press Secretary Anthony Scaramucci said there was still room for negotiation. He said President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s action was a measure to correct the uneven and unbalanced trade system. He told Radio 4: If you need to put up protective tariffs to protect your farming industry or parts of your industrial base, the United States is just basically saying \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcokay that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not fair to us because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re accepting your goods and services into our country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to give us an opportunity to compete in your country. I am sure that there are chips on both sides that can get traded to make the problem go away. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always room in a negotiation with him, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the type of person that will walk from a negotiation. Back with the US move on steel and aluminium, and Gareth Stace, from trade body UK Steel, told BBC Radio Five Live that the US tariffs were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153illegal and protectionist.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added: This unilateral decision beggars belief. It is the last thing we need given that we are coming out of the worst steel crisis in a generation. He said the claims that the tariffs were being imposed for national security reasons was a smokescreen, given only 3% of steel in the US is used for defence products. And he warned that UK manufacturers exporting to the US not only faced a direct hit, but also there would be a glut of steel which would otherwise have gone to the US flooding the European market. He said: Twenty to twenty five million tonnes could flood our market. Deutsche Bank, which on Thursday reportedly saw its US business put on a Federal list of problem banks, has now had its credit rating cut by S&amp;P. The agency said: S&amp;P Global Ratings today lowered its long-term issuer credit ratings on Deutsche Bank AG and its core subsidiaries to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBBB+\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA-\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The outlook is stable. We removed the ratings from CreditWatch negative. .. The lowering of our long-term issuer credit rating reflects that Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s updated strategy envisages a deeper restructuring of the business model than we previously expected, with associated non-negligible execution risks. While we consider management is taking tough, although likely inevitable, actions and proposes a logical strategy to successfully restore the bank to more solid, sustainable profitability over the medium to long term, the bank appears set for a period of sustained underperformance compared with peers, many of whom have now finished restructuring. Over the coming 18 months, we will look in particular for robust delivery against 2019 objectives, such as the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac22 billion cost target, and evidence that the bank retains the solid support of its clients, something that would help underpin the revenue base in the CIB division amid a period of downsizing. While we regard capital markets earnings as inherently more volatile than retail and commercial banking, we consider a well-balanced blend of profitable businesses to be supportive of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditworthiness. Therefore the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to preserve its global capital markets franchise, focused in particular on Europe, underpins our stable outlook. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Normally on a day like today, markets would be focused on the US jobs figures due later and the manufacturing surveys which will give the first snapshots of how the global economy performed last month. But there are a few other distractions for investors to worry about, notably the prospect of a global trade war now that the US has confirmed it will slap steel and aluminium tariffs on the EU, Canada and Mexico. Traders are now waiting to see how the move, and the threatened retaliation will play out. Here is our latest story on the US action: Wall Street fell by 1% and European markets ended lower but the general reaction was more restrained than might have been expected (Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax was one of the biggest losers but that has as much to do with fears about Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial health as anything else.} Asian market seem to have taken the news in their stride, given that the move was widely expected. The Nikkei 225 is down just 0.14% and the indications are that European markets will open mostly higher: Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: The expected tit for tat response from the EU, Mexico and Canada is setting the scene for a trade war, which is not conducive to global growth. However, the losses have not been as large as we would have expected just a few months ago. The market is becoming more familiar with this administrations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 negotiating tactics and as a result, rather than seeing a move straight into risk off trading, we are seeing some investors take a wait and see approach. The traditional safe haven Japanese yen moved lower versus the dollar, as did gold and European bourses are pointing to a stronger start on the open. There are other things on the agenda too. Markets slumped earlier in the week on fears of a new Italian election, but those fears have now been eased with the formation of a populist government and that appears to be helping investor sentiment. Indeed, as far as Europe goes, Spain has taken over the mantle of immediate problem child. Prime minister Mariano Rajoy is facing a vote of no confidence and according to the latest reports, he may well lose. As far as the manufacturing surveys are concerned, there could be some signs of a slight rebound from April. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: After a strong year of economic activity in 2017 the manufacturing sector got off to a slightly softer start at the beginning of this year, across the board. In some of the recent April data there is evidence that this softness has evened out a little and started to stabilise. In Europe activity was able to rebound a little in part, while in the US we also saw increasing evidence of rising prices with prices paid at 7-year highs. If this trend continues in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers then that should be supportive of a rebound in Q2. Expectations for Spain, Italy, France and Germany manufacturing are for 54, 53, 55.1 and 56.8. In the UK we also saw a decent rebound after a soft March number, which may well have been weather related. Activity in May is expected to have steadied at around 53.5, a slight decline from the modest rebound seen in the April numbers with particular attention likely to be on cost price inflation which still looks fairly robust. Finally the non-farm payrolls, where around 190,000 jobs are expected to have been created in May after a weak 164,000 figure in April. Wages are forecast to grow by around 2.8%, up from 2.6%. Even if the numbers are disappointing, analysts believe this will not stop the Federal Reserve raising US interest rates in June.

Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability, but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge. </p> <p>We will learn more when details of the share price attained in the sale are released. In August 2015 the government sold 5.4% of the bank at \u00c2\u00a33.30 per share, which the National Audit Office estimated crystallised a loss of \u00c2\u00a31.1 billion, or \u00c2\u00a31.9 billion if you include the cost of financing.</p> <p>RBS has cleared several obstacles which have now unblocked the road to re-privatisation, in particular settling claims for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities in the US. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share sale is good news for private investors in RBS because it is a step towards becoming a normal bank again, though government sales may put downward pressure on the share price in the near term. As a business RBS remains a work in progress, and consequently an investment for recovery investors with a long term investment horizon.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day.

But this optimism is unlikely to last, says Ingvild Borgen Gjerde at Capital Economics:</p> <blockquote> <p>Global equities extended their recent rebound on Monday, which has occurred despite renewed tensions between the US and the rest of the world over international trade. We can think of three key reasons why this has happened. None of them, however, is especially reassuring.</p> <p>The first reason is that investors have acclimatised to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153megaphone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd diplomacy. Despite the tariffs imposed by the US on steel and aluminium imports from the EU, Mexico and Canada, investors presumably see it as a negotiating tactic, rather than the start of a full-blown trade war that could have serious ramifications for economic growth. Although we share this view, the risk of a trade war is greater now than it has been for many years. So at the very least, the risk ought to continue to curb investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 enthusiasm for equities.</p> <p>The second reason is that the political situation in Italy has calmed down, as evidenced by the sharp fall in the 10-year government bond yield there since last Tuesday. But while the government sworn in by the president on Friday was arguably more market friendly than many might have feared, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems are over and expect yields there to rise once more in due course. If we are right, global equities will probably come under pressure again.</p> <p>The third reason is that US economic data released on Friday were upbeat, with both the employment report and ISM manufacturing index for May coming in stronger than expected. Although growth in the US economy is likely to remain healthy this year, we think that it will falter in 2019 as monetary tightening bites and fiscal stimulus fades. Growth is also likely to slow elsewhere, if not as rapidly. This is significant because the rally in global equities since mid-2016 has been mainly driven by an upturn in the global economy.</p> <p>The upshot is that we doubt that the recent rebound in global equities will continue. On the contrary, we think that their peak has already passed, and that they will move gradually lower during the rest of the year and in 2019. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b154975e4b00330690639d0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-04T14:19:37.815Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Weak US factory orders in April</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US factory goods orders fell by more than expected in April, dragged down by weak demand for aircraft and machinery.</p> <p>Orders dropped by 0.8%, worse than the forecast decline of 0.5%.

                "bodyText":"The latest RBS stake sale by the UK government could hit the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price in the short term, says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: The RBS share price has bounced back from its slump after the EU referendum, but the taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability, but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge. We will learn more when details of the share price attained in the sale are released. In August 2015 the government sold 5.4% of the bank at \u00c2\u00a33.30 per share, which the National Audit Office estimated crystallised a loss of \u00c2\u00a31.1 billion, or \u00c2\u00a31.9 billion if you include the cost of financing. RBS has cleared several obstacles which have now unblocked the road to re-privatisation, in particular settling claims for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities in the US. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share sale is good news for private investors in RBS because it is a step towards becoming a normal bank again, though government sales may put downward pressure on the share price in the near term. As a business RBS remains a work in progress, and consequently an investment for recovery investors with a long term investment horizon. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. As if to emphasise the market uncertainty facing the RBS share sale - which should be priced overnight after gauging demand from institutions- European markets have lost their early gains. However they still ended, for the most part, in positive territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 39.52 points or 0.51% at 7741.29 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 0.37% to 12,770.75 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.14% to 5472.91 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.45% to 22,009.95 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 1.22% at 9750.3 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.76%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the RBS share sale: Philip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost \u00c2\u00a32.6bn to City investors. The chancellor, through UK Financial Investments, which owns RBS stake on behalf of the government, kickstarted the sale of 925 million shares, representing about 7.7% of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock. The government, which will still own a majority stake in RBS almost a decade after the bailout during the financial crisis, said it would reduce the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ownership of the bank from about 70.1% to 62.4%. The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when George Osborne sold a first tranche at a loss of about \u00c2\u00a31bn. The report is here: The share sale is due to take place this evening with an offering to institutional investors. Here is the full announcement from UK Government Investments, the body which manages the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s RBS stake: UKGI announces that it intends to sell part of HM Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholding in The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc. The disposal of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ordinary shares will be by way of a placing to institutional investors. The price at which the Shares are sold will be determined by way of an accelerated bookbuilding process. The book will open with immediate effect following this announcement. The Placing is expected to comprise of approximately 925 million Shares, representing approximately 7.7% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company. As a result of the Placing, the overall size of HM Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholding in the Company will be reduced from approximately 70.1% to approximately 62.4%. UKGI and HM Treasury have undertaken to the Bookrunners named below not to sell further shares in the Company for a period of 90 calendar days following the completion of the Placing without the prior written consent of a majority (by participation) of the Bookrunners. Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Goldman Sachs International, J.P. Morgan Securities plc (which conducts its UK investment banking activities under the marketing name J.P. Morgan Cazenove) and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. International plc have been appointed to act as joint bookrunners in connection with the Placing. N M Rothschild &amp; Sons Limited is acting as Capital Markets Adviser. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP is acting as legal counsel to UKGI in respect of English and US law. Details of the Placing Price and the number of Shares sold will be announced in due course. Settlement and delivery of the Shares is expected to take place on 7 June 2018. At last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual meeting, the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance director did not seem keen on the government selling shares at the moment. UK Government Investments has announced it will place 925m shares in RBS with institutional investors, representing about 7.7% of the bank. The move cuts its stake from the current 71%. Following last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual meeting of Royal Bank of Scotland , the government has announced it plans to sell \u00c2\u00a32.6bn worth of shares in the taxpayer-owned bank. Wall Street is holding onto its gains but the picture is slightly different in Europe. Most markets have come off their best levels as we head to the close, while Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is in negative territory, down 0.33%. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Stocks have held on to some of their gains today, but the day has not gone entirely the bulls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 way. While Italian concerns have receded from view, trade wars remain the big concern. Given the performance of US equities, which have outpaced their European brethren today, it looks like the market is, for now at least, more concerned that European stocks will be harder hit than their US counterparts. Overall however, risk appetite appears pretty solid for the day, especially when the lack of macro data is factored into the equation. Particularly encouraging has been the continued strength in tech stocks, with the Nasdaq 100 only 1% away from its previous record high. Despite the renewed trade tensions, markets are making a good start to the week. But this optimism is unlikely to last, says Ingvild Borgen Gjerde at Capital Economics: Global equities extended their recent rebound on Monday, which has occurred despite renewed tensions between the US and the rest of the world over international trade. We can think of three key reasons why this has happened. None of them, however, is especially reassuring. The first reason is that investors have acclimatised to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153megaphone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd diplomacy. Despite the tariffs imposed by the US on steel and aluminium imports from the EU, Mexico and Canada, investors presumably see it as a negotiating tactic, rather than the start of a full-blown trade war that could have serious ramifications for economic growth. Although we share this view, the risk of a trade war is greater now than it has been for many years. So at the very least, the risk ought to continue to curb investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 enthusiasm for equities. The second reason is that the political situation in Italy has calmed down, as evidenced by the sharp fall in the 10-year government bond yield there since last Tuesday. But while the government sworn in by the president on Friday was arguably more market friendly than many might have feared, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems are over and expect yields there to rise once more in due course. If we are right, global equities will probably come under pressure again. The third reason is that US economic data released on Friday were upbeat, with both the employment report and ISM manufacturing index for May coming in stronger than expected. Although growth in the US economy is likely to remain healthy this year, we think that it will falter in 2019 as monetary tightening bites and fiscal stimulus fades. Growth is also likely to slow elsewhere, if not as rapidly. This is significant because the rally in global equities since mid-2016 has been mainly driven by an upturn in the global economy. The upshot is that we doubt that the recent rebound in global equities will continue. On the contrary, we think that their peak has already passed, and that they will move gradually lower during the rest of the year and in 2019. US factory goods orders fell by more than expected in April, dragged down by weak demand for aircraft and machinery. Orders dropped by 0.8%, worse than the forecast decline of 0.5%. This is the worst April since 2012. The March figure was revised up from a 1.6% increase to 1.7%. The decline could be temporary, however, given some positive manufacturing surveys in May. Wall Street has followed the global trend, shrugging off trade war fears and moving higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 187 points or 0.76%, as investors continue to celebrate Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than expected jobs numbers. The S&amp;P 500 is up 0.45% while the Nasdaq Composite is 0.37% higher. One of the companies moving higher is Apple, heading closer to a $1trn valuation: Over in Argentina, the International Monetary Fund has said talks about it giving financial support to the country were well advanced: Alejandro Werner, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Director of the Western Hemisphere department, said: IMF staff and the Argentine authorities have been engaged in a very constructive and close dialogue in response to the authorities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 request for financial support for their economic plan. Talks are well advanced. As we have said all along, this will be a plan driven by the Argentine government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s priorities, with a particular focus on protecting the most vulnerable, and strengthening the local economy in light of the recent financial market turbulence. Donald Trump has defended his new tariffs, arguing that he is actually fixing the playing field on global trade. The president has been rather active on Twitter this morning. Remarkably, he claimed he has the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolute right\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to pardon himself (but won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, as he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done nothing wrong....). Investors should stay alert; Trump may be heading towards a titanic clash with special counsel Robert Mueller.... Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund is signalling (finally) that it will not be signing up to Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third bailout programme, which is due to expire this summer. With less than three months before the debt-stricken county exits its current programme, the Fund says the likelihood of it contributing to the rescue package financially is fading fast. The Washington-based body had promised to boost the programme \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third since May 2010 - with a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.6bn credit line if euro area creditors agreed to far-reaching debt relief for Athens. Talks on the issue, conducted on the sidelines of this weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G7 meeting in Canada, failed to make progress with both the EU and IMF agreeing to return to negotiations later this week in Paris. Speaking to Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state-run news agency late on Sunday, the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Greek representative Michalis Psalidopoulos said since the organisation \u00e2\u20ac\u0153probably does not have enough time to activate its program\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it would continue to contribute only in its capacity as technical advisor. But Mario Centeno, the Portuguese chairman of the euro group of euro zone finance ministers said the EU is still determined to reach a debt relief deal for Greece by the June 21 euro group \u00e2\u20ac\u201c giving it enough time to keep to its planned bailout exit on August 20. IMF participation is crucial if the deal is to be credible to markets, he told Reuters at the weekend. Talks in Paris on Thursday are likely to explore several options including prolonging maturities on loans from Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second bailout program. Separately, Greece has taken another step towards normality by relaxing some of the capital controls introduced three years ago: Good news: The sale of Aunt Bessie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to Nomad Foods shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lead to job cuts at its production operation in Hull. Wayne Hudson, MD of Birds Eye UK, has suggested the 400 jobs at the site should be safe. He told the Hull Daily Mail that: We have no plans whatsoever to close the factory in Hull. We will be working with the team there to understand how we can continue the great job they have done. The US stock market is expected to follow Europe and Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead when it opens in two hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is on track to gain 140 points, or over 0.5%. Wall Street is still taking comfort from last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stronger-than-expected jobs report, which suggests the US economy is in good shape. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA explains: The jobs report on Friday was yet another reminder of how well the US economy is doing and why the Federal Reserve is continuing to tighten monetary policy despite constantly being questioned about the need to do so when inflation is only accelerating at a moderate pace. Strong job gains combined with a drop in the unemployment rate to 3.8% and a slight uptick in wage growth was welcome at a time when people are generally fretting about the threat posed by an unnecessary trade war. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little surprising that investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t more concerned about the hoofing delivered to Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin at last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G7 finance minister meeting. This tweet-thread, from Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mike McKee, explains just how badly relations between America and the rest have deteriorated: William Jackson Food Group chairman Nicholas Oughtred says Aunt Bessie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s could have a great long-term future under its new owners: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aunt Bessie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has come a long way with us. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve invested heavily in developing the business and the brand, and Nomad Foods is well placed to take the business even further. Nomad Foods is a well-known food group with a strong commitment to the frozen category, incredible experience, scale and investment capabilities and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure Aunt Bessie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s will continue to thrive. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are exceptionally proud of everyone who works at Aunt Bessie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and are grateful to them for helping it become the much-loved household name that it is today.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: Where there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s puds, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brass! Aunt Bessie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, maker of frozen Yorkshire puddings and roast potatoes has just been sold to Nomad Foods, for the princely sum of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac240m (\u00c2\u00a3210m). Nomad already owns Birds Eye, Findus, Iglo and Goodfella\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, so this deal helps to tighten its grip on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s frozen foods aisles. In a statement just released, Nomad say that acquiring Aunt Bessie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s will expand their portfolio into the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153major eating occasion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of roast dinners. Stefan Descheemaeker, Nomad Foods\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Chief Executive Officer explains: Aunt Bessie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significantly expands our presence within potatoes, one of the largest categories in frozen food, while adding another dimension to our growing portfolio in the United Kingdom.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Aunt Bessie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is being sold by William Jackson &amp; Son Limited (which also owns veg box supplier Abel &amp; Cole). Back in 2015, CEO Norman Soutar explained that the company appealed to cooks who fear getting their roast puds and spuds wrong [one trick is to get the oil really hot....] Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market continues to shrug off the trade war anxiety. The FTSE 100 is now up 61 points, or 0.8%, at 7762 - a one-week high. United Utilities, Severn Trent and easyJet are all topping the risers, after City analysts raised their price targets for their respective shares. UK cardboard box maker DS Smith is also in demand. Its shares are up 3% after announcing a \u00c2\u00a31.7bn takeover of Spanish packaging rival Europac. Back in the markets, Italian government is recovering in value this morning - pulling down the yield (or interest rate) on the debt. That shows that fears that Italy might quit the euro are fading, after its new populist government was sworn in last week. But... the coalition between the League and the Five Star Movement is surely heading for clashes with Brussels over their spending and migration plans. Last weekend, Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio said he hoped to introduce a universal basic income for poorer Italians while League\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader Matteo Salvini vowed to cut spending on asylum seekers and deport migrants. The sharp decline in eurozone investor confidence may be a sign that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is faltering. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some snap reaction from economists: Investor optimism across the eurozone has fallen to its lowest level since October 2016, thanks to trade war fears and the Italian political crisis. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to Sentix, the German research group. Sentix\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index of eurozone investor morale has tumbled to just 9.3 this month, down from 19.2 in May. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much worse than expected, and extends the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent losses. Investors told Sentix they are less optimistic about future prospects, and that current conditions have deteriorated. Last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chaos in Italy over its new government helped to drag down economic prospects in the eurozone, says Manfred H\u00c3\u00bcbner, managing director at Sentix. He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The new government in Italy is causing great concern about the euro zone among investors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd H\u00c3\u00bcbner added that investors are also concerned about America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153punitive tariffs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while still hoping that a full-blown trade war can be avoided. Howard Archer of EY ITEM Club is disappointed that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI was unchanged at 52.5 last month. He says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that building firms are struggling to gain any momentum: Fuelling concerns about the construction sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficulties in building momentum, new orders contracted anew in May, confidence was at a 7-month low and employment growth slowed. This suggests that a marked upturn in construction activity is likely to remain conspicuous by its absence The construction sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficulties in recent months has clearly been influenced by economic and Brexit uncertainties fuelling clients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 caution over committing to new projects. Lacklustre economic activity in some sectors of the economy (such as retail) has also weighed down on construction, as has a shortage on new infrastructure projects. It is also evident that construction sector has suffered from some fall-out from the collapse of Carillion early in the year. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders are suffering from political uncertainty, which has helped to undermine new business opportunities. The monthly survey of UK construction, from data firm Markit, shows that new order books shrank in May, for the fourth time in five months. Optimism about growth prospects also shrank, to a seven-month low, with bosses blaming fears of political and economic uncertainty. This dragged back growth in housebuilding and civil engineering last month, although commercial construction accelerated. This left Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction PMI, which measures activity, unchanged at 52.5 (any reading over 50 shows growth). Sam Teague, economist at IHS Markit, says UK building firms are making an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunderwhelming\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 recovery from the snow-related disruption last winter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflows of new business slipped back into decline, signalling the resumption of the downward trend in demand seen during the opening quarter. Companies frequently noted that Brexit uncertainty and fragile business confidence led clients to delay building decisions in May. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With new order books deteriorating and cost pressures picking back up, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not surprising to see construction firms taking a dimmer view of prospects and pulling-back on hiring, all of which makes for a shaky-looking outlook.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Donald Trump loves tweeting about rising stock markets, so he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be delighted that trade war fears haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sparked a wave of sell orders. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, reckons today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mild market reaction will encourage Trump to stick to his guns.... but the rally could end in tears: The two main benchmarks President Trump appears to use to gauge the success of his policies are his grassroot supporters and the US equity market. His blue-collar followers are hugely supportive of tariffs, and with equity markets currently also choosing to dismiss the problem and in positive territory, this is reinforcing President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view that he is doing the right thing, making it less likely that he will back away from his current stance. This chicken and egg position, where markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that tariffs are a credible threat, combined with President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position that markets are not worried about the issue could lead to an unpleasant reality for both sides eventually. However, for the moment investors are benefitting from positive sentiment. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, Emmanuel Macron, could have a showdown with Donald Trump over trade at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G7 summit, according to French officials. Reuters has the details: The work agenda for the G7 summit in Quebec, Canada this week has been complicated by the United State\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance on trade, climate change and foreign policy, a source at the French president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office said on Monday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The U.S. position on certain issues could make negotiations on the final conclusion (of the summit) tricky,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the source said, citing foreign policy moves such as the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the transfer of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The source said President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Donald Trump could hold talks on the sidelines of the summit. The latest trade war tensions have had \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcremarkably little\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 impact on the markets, says Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx: Carrying over last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s robust relief rally, investors continued to ignore the trade tensions sprouting out of the US in favour of celebrating the improved political situation in the Eurozone. A feisty G7 meeting over the weekend, with US Treasury secretary having to fend-off his furious European and Canadian peers as they vented about last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariff announcement from Trump, and news that the US and China made no progress in their latest negotiations, had remarkably little impact on Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, says there are plenty of events that could spook the markets this week. The list includes this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G7 leaders meeting, central bank meetings in Turkey and Australia, a confidence vote for Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new populist government, and further trade war developments. But, the strength of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs data may set the tone for the start of the week, he adds. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest stock markets have all opened higher, as traders take their cue from last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong US jobs report: European stock markets are rallying, despite the double-dose of trade war worries. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 37 points (or 0.5%) in early trading to 7740. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stoxx 600 index, which tracks Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest companies, is also 0.5% higher. Two banks, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Societe Generale and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Unicredit, are leading the rally following reports they are considering a merger. In another worrying development, talks between America and China over trade have ended without a breakthrough. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Liu He, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic czar, led the weekend negotiations in Beijing over the weekend. The talks centred on China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise to buy more American agricultural and energy products, to help lower the US trade deficit. Negotiators have hit a sticking point - Beijing won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sign up to buy more US goods until the Trump administration have promised not to impose further tariffs on Chinese exports. The US, though, want China to make the first move. This has raised the danger that talks collapse, and that both sides impose tariffs on $50bn of each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exports. The New York Times says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the United States introduces trade measures, including an increase of tariffs, all the economic and trade outcomes negotiated by the two parties will not take effect,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd China said in a statement distributed by the state-controlled news media. The apparent impasse left the Trump administration with the issue of what to do about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial policies. It also left unresolved an awkward issue for both sides: the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE, which had violated sanctions against North Korea and Iran. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance and economy minister was particularly scathing about America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs on certain imports, including steel and aluminium from Europe. Bruno Le Maire revealed that last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G7 finance ministers meeting was much chillier than usual, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has been a tense and tough G7 - I would say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been far more a G6 plus one than a G7. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We regret that our common work together at the level of the G7 has been put at risk by the decisions taken by the American administration on trade and on tariffs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of a global trade war are looming over the financial markets as investors return to their desks for the new week. Over the weekend, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top finance ministers lined up to criticise America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, at a G7 meeting in Canada. US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin faced a barrage of attacks, with fellow ministers warning that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153collaboration and cooperation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between the G7 was now at risk. The official statement following the meeting is remarkably blunt, stating that: Concerns were expressed that the tariffs imposed by the United States on its friends and allies, on the grounds of national security, undermine open trade and confidence in the global economy. Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors requested that the United States Secretary of the Treasury communicate their unanimous concern and disappointment. Attendees had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153frank exchange\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the benefits of an open rules-based trading system -- which is a diplomatic way of saying there were verbal fisticuffs. The statement concluded by saying that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153most\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd G7 finance ministers and Central Bank governors regret the uncertainty created by America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade actions, which threatens global co-operation. The international community is faced with significant economic and security issues, which are best addressed through a united front from G7 countries. Members continue to make progress on behalf of our citizens, but recognize that this collaboration and cooperation has been put at risk by trade actions against other members. The issue is certain to dominate the upcoming meeting of G7 leaders later this week. The markets, though, are holding their nerve. Shares have risen in Asia overnight, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei gaining almost 1.4% - its best day in six weeks. European markets are also expected to rally, following last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong US employment data - which showed a pick-up in wage growth and job creation. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says this has cheered investors: Wall Street ended the previous week on a positive footing, lifted by a better than expected US jobs report; 223k jobs created in May vs. expectations of 200k, unemployment unexpectedly fell to an 18 year low of 3.8% and wages managed to creep up to 2.7%, better than the 2.6% forecast and a 4-month high. The solid jobs report overshadowed any trade war concerns which had been brewing and lifted the S&amp;P over 1%. Coming up today, we get a new healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector - which suffered a fall in output earlier this year, plus US factory orders and eurozone construction data.

In the March quarter, in seasonally adjusted terms, Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 1.0%, the fastest quarterly growth since December 2011:</p> <p>This produced a big jump in the annual growth rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up from 2.4% in December to 3.1% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the strongest for nearly two years.

Unlike consumption and investment spending, export growth (and especially net exports, which subtracts the negative impact of imports on economic growth) is rather erratic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and thus bounces around a bit, in seasonally adjusted terms.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/06/australias-gdp-growth-jumps-to-31-on-back-of-mining-exports\">Australia's GDP growth jumps to 3.1% on back of mining exports</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the March quarter, net exports added 0.35% to GDP growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a third of the total growth, and yet in the December quarter (due to cyclones that prevented some exports) next exports actually reduced GDP growth: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Contribution of net exports to quarterly GDP growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HsckL/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>After exports, the big drivers of growth were government spending on health, aged care and the NDIS. Interestingly, despite recent strong spending on public investment projects, in March the growth of public investment slowed somewhat, while still adding to GDP: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Contributions to GDP growth (seasonally adjusted)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gAjUg/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>While household consumption in March contributed 0.2% points to GDP growth, such an amount actually highlights how weak household spending is at the moment. </p> <p>Household consumption makes up around 60% of our economy, and yet it contributed only 20% of the growth in the first three months of this year.</p> <p>Over the past year household consumption grew by just 2.9% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c marking more than six years since it grew by more than 3% in trend terms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a level that once would have been considered well below-average:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Household consumption - annual growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0IT4Z/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And a major reason that spending was even that good was because households are reducing the amount they are saving.

                "bodyText":"Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew faster in the first three months of this year than it has for over six years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but with growth mainly driven by mining exports and public spending on health and the NDIS, households have largely missed out on the benefits as spending continues to be weak and real incomes continue to fall. First, the good news. In the March quarter, in seasonally adjusted terms, Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 1.0%, the fastest quarterly growth since December 2011: This produced a big jump in the annual growth rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up from 2.4% in December to 3.1% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the strongest for nearly two years. It says something that 3.1% used to be the average growth rate, and now it is the best we have seen for some time. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday In trend terms things were a touch less exuberant. Quarterly growth was just 0.7% and was actually slower than in the December quarter, and the annual rate of 2.8% marked the 22nd consecutive quarter where growth was below 3%: The main reason the seasonally adjusted figures were rather shinier than the trend figures was that the biggest drivers of growth in March were exports of LNG and coal. Unlike consumption and investment spending, export growth (and especially net exports, which subtracts the negative impact of imports on economic growth) is rather erratic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and thus bounces around a bit, in seasonally adjusted terms. In the March quarter, net exports added 0.35% to GDP growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a third of the total growth, and yet in the December quarter (due to cyclones that prevented some exports) next exports actually reduced GDP growth: After exports, the big drivers of growth were government spending on health, aged care and the NDIS. Interestingly, despite recent strong spending on public investment projects, in March the growth of public investment slowed somewhat, while still adding to GDP: While household consumption in March contributed 0.2% points to GDP growth, such an amount actually highlights how weak household spending is at the moment. Household consumption makes up around 60% of our economy, and yet it contributed only 20% of the growth in the first three months of this year. Over the past year household consumption grew by just 2.9% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c marking more than six years since it grew by more than 3% in trend terms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a level that once would have been considered well below-average: And a major reason that spending was even that good was because households are reducing the amount they are saving. In March, Australia households on average saved just 2.1% of their disposable income \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the lowest since 2007. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re spending as much as we were last year, but we are saving less in order to do so. The reason of course is weak wages growth. And here we see two different pictures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one that is good for the government and one that is less good for households. While over the past year the total amount of compensation (mostly wages and salaries) going to employees rose 5.1% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the strongest for six years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the average compensation per employee rose just 1.6%, the best only since 2014: In the past, around 60% of the rise in total compensation to employees was due to rises in the average rate (i.e. pay rises); now it accounts for only around 30%. Essentially, the total amount is rising because employment growth was so strong over the past year that it outweighed the weak wages growth. That has been good for government income tax revenue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because that is based on a combination of employment and wage growth. But while that worked well in 2017, the latest figures suggest that the very strong employment growth is coming off the boil: If that continues, then the lack of wages growth will start once again to bite into tax revenue forecasts. And the lack of growth in average wages is not all that surprising given where the growth in the economy and employment is coming from \u00e2\u20ac\u201c mining exports (which don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t require much labour) and the health and aged care sector. Government spending in infrastructure, healthcare and the NDIS has seen government contribution to GDP growth reach levels much more associated with times where the economy needs government stimulus, rather than where the private sector is powering us along: And while the average level of compensation going to employees is growing, the figures only serve to highlight how households are actually going backwards. In the past 12 months average compensation to employees grew by 1.6% while inflation during that time grew by 1.9% - meaning in real terms, employees went backwards. This should be no shock \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the average compensation of employees hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t risen in real terms in any meaningful sense for six years: It is why household disposable income per capita, despite rising ever so slightly in March, remains lower now than it was in 2012: So yes, it is good that the economy is growing, but these figures show no real sign of any change from the picture that we have become accustomed to \u00e2\u20ac\u201c economic growth remaining positive but historically weak; and households seeing little of that growth flowing through into improved standards of living. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

He could go further by declaring a cap on his existing arsenal freeze on other nuclear activity like uranium enrichment.</p> <p>His biggest element of his opening offer, however, would be a statement on his plans to dismantle his nuclear weapons programme, and here everything will be in the details \u00e2\u20ac\u201c how clearly denuclearisation is defined, and whether Kim commits to a timetable.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/05/donald-trump-north-korea-summit-kim-jong-un-explained\">What will be the outcome of Trump and Kim Jong-un's nuclear summit?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b1a5955e4b022a3efa12935\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-08T10:36:12.965Z\">11.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump attacks Canada over dairy tariffs</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Just in: Donald Trump is limbering up for the G7 meeting by firing another attack at Canada over trade tariffs:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1005030839019802625\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Canada charges the U.S. a 270%  tariff on Dairy Products!

The G7 meeting gets under way today in Quebec, and investors are cautious as certain trading relationships are a little strained. Those talks in Quebec will run for hours and continue tomorrow (although without Donald Trump). Leaders are being pushed to make gender equality a top priority, alongside climate change and trade. Keep an eye on our website for the latest developments. Goodnight! GW Newsflash: British satellite company Inmarsat had found itself in a takeover battle. Shares in the company jumped by 13.5% today, sparking speculation that the company could be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcin play\u00e2\u20ac\u2122...and it is! Inmarsat has just told the City that it has rejected an approach from US rival Echostar. It says: The Board of Inmarsat plc notes today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent press speculation and movement in its share price and confirms that it received a highly preliminary and indicative non-binding proposal from Echostar Corporation in relation to the potential acquisition of the entire issued, and to be issued, share capital of Inmarsat (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Proposal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). After carefully considering the Proposal with its advisers the Board rejected the Proposal on the basis that it very significantly undervalued Inmarsat and its standalone prospects. The Board remains highly confident in the independent strategy and prospects of Inmarsat. Echostar now has until 6 July to make a firm offer, or walk away. Inmarsat is now valued at around \u00c2\u00a32.2bn, following todays share price move. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt has come under pressure today, sending yields on Italian government bonds higher. The FT says the are several factors, both at home and in Frankfurt..... Strategists are uncertain over how the newly-formed populist government will work with Brussels, and also over its fiscal plans. At the same time, a string of hawkish speeches from ECB policymakers earlier this week have revved up expectations that the central bank will announce next week the end of its bond buying programme. Quantitative easing has been a boon to eurozone government debt, helping push yields lower. European Council president Donald Tusk, who is attending the G7 meeting, insists that European delegates will maintain a united front. Tusk also played down the idea that Russia could be readmitted to the gathering, despite Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments earlier: He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This morning I had the first and very good, promising meeting with Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and I am convinced that here at the G7 we will have a fully united European position on all issues. Including on Russia. I am not talking about details but about the more general common line. Tusk also put his finger on the challenge facing world leaders: BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are still near the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard this afternoon, as traders digest the exit of CEO Gavin Patterson. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re currently up 1.1% at 205p. Back in 2013, when Patterson was appointed, they were worth 300p, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been some value destruction on his watch. BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares did rise early in Patterson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenure, hitting \u00c2\u00a35 in 2016. But they then fell back as BT struggled to hit growth and earnings targets - despite spending a lot of money on sports rights. Last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning, released alongside the latest strategy, was the last straw, sending shares to six-year lows. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Perhaps fittingly, Gavin Patterson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenure was very much a game of two halves. The rise of BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sport coverage, which has stepped up to challenge the dominance of Sky initially brought some good times for investors. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a different story over the last two years. Since 2016, BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price graph resembles something of a black run; pretty much always on a downward trend and with a few nasty cliffs here and there. Ultimately, this is what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behind the change. Shareholder confidence has followed the share price down, and with BT embarking on a crucial restructure, the board has decided it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for a change. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments: US stock markets have followed Europe and Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead, and dipped in early trading. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a modest fall, though; the Dow Jones industrial average has shed 40-odd point, or 0.15%., while the Nasdaq is down 0.5%. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has reportedly backed Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for Russia to be reinstated. It raises the prospect of the G7 becoming the G8 again... unless it shrinks to become the G6 first, of course. Breaking: The pound is falling as the Europe Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, gives a thumping thumbs down to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest proposal. Barnier has rejected Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal that Britain should stay in the customs union until the end of 2021 unless a new customs agreement is agreed once Brexit has occured. He is telling journalists in Brussels that the backstop cannot apply to the whole UK, but could apply to Northern Ireland. Barnier also takes issue with the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctime-limited\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 nature of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer. He insists that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153backstop means backstop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (a wry jibe at May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit means Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). This has to be a backstop that provides a guarantee under all circumstances. This is another blow to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position - which was only agreed yesterday after crunch talks between May and Brexit secretary David Davis. Barnier also claimed that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153paradoxical\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (because London wants to leave the EU but maintain many of its advantages). The pound has dropped by 0.5% against the US dollar, or 0.66 of a cent, to $1.336. Our Politics Live blog has all the action: Trump has added further spice to the G7 meeting, by telling reporters in Washington that Russian president Vladimir Putin should be joining the throng in Quebec: Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership of the G8 (as it then was) was suspended after the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Given events since, such as the Salisbury Novichok attack, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think Putin is welcome back.... Trump also declared that Canada, the EU and Mexico all treat America very badly when it come to trade, meaning we can dial down expectations for a successful G7 even lower.... Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s social media sledging isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t doing much for the mood on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average is expected to fall by 136 points at the open, or around 0.5%. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increased isolation on the world stage is worrying traders, says Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA. While Trump has at times appeared friendly with certain other heads of state in the past, the relationships have at least appeared to have become more hostile since tariffs were imposed on the European Union, Canada and Mexico by the US last week. The G7 meeting has become more like a G6+1, with Trump choosing to isolate the US on a number of issues from trade to Iran and climate change. The Nasdaq is heading for an 0.8% drop, with Apple called down 2% following reports it is taking a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cautious\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd approach toward upcoming iPhone shipments this year. Trump has thrown down the gauntlet: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try to hold the president to that last pledge.... However, I suspect the talks will mostly centre on the recent tariffs imposed by the United States on its allies: In another sign that America is detaching from fellow advanced economies, Donald Trump will actually leave the G7 meeting early. The president is due to leave Quebec on Saturday morning, meaning he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll miss the summit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second day. Trump is flying to Singapore for his historic meeting with North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kim Jong-un. The talks could lead to a thawing of tensions between the two countries; but with such unpredictable leaders, anything is possible. My colleague Julian Borger explains how the Trump-Kim meeting could unfold: Trump has sought to play down expectations, characterising the meeting as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153getting-to-know-you, plus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But without a substantial \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the form of progress in the direction of disarmament, the meeting will widely be deemed a failure. And to achieve that progress, Trump will have to make significant gestures towards what Kim wants most \u00e2\u20ac\u201c security guarantees. Both leaders will go into the Singapore meeting with cards in their hands, representing quick, deliverable concessions. The big question next week will be which cards they play and in what sequence. At a minimum, Kim will be expected to formalise the current suspension of nuclear and missile testing. He could go further by declaring a cap on his existing arsenal freeze on other nuclear activity like uranium enrichment. His biggest element of his opening offer, however, would be a statement on his plans to dismantle his nuclear weapons programme, and here everything will be in the details \u00e2\u20ac\u201c how clearly denuclearisation is defined, and whether Kim commits to a timetable. Just in: Donald Trump is limbering up for the G7 meeting by firing another attack at Canada over trade tariffs: Trump is referring to Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Supply management\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd regime, a long-running point of dispute between the two countries. This system specifies fixed prices paid to farmers, strict quotas for how much they can produce, and a tariff wall to prevent cheaper imports from abroad. The result: stable incomes for farmers, who are protected from bankruptcy in lean times, at the cost of higher prices for Canadian consumers. American farmers, though, want to send their own milk and butter north, and Trump is pushing their case. Emerging market currencies are being hit badly today, as investors scramble into the safety of the US dollar instead. The South African rand, the Turkish lira and the Indian rupee have all suffered sharp falls. This kind of action puts pressure on domestic policymakers to consider raising interest rates to prevent capital flight - a move that also hurts economic growth. Yesterday, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank hikes its benchmark rate to a blistering 17.75%, from 16.5%, in an attempt to prop up the lira. Angela Merkel has received some unwelcome news as she prepares for the G7 meeting -- German industrial output and exports both fell in April. Factory output across Germany shrank by 1% in April, dashing expectations that it would rise by 0.3%. The Federal Statistics Office also reported that German exports fell by 0.3% in April while imports rose by 2.2%. That helps to narrow Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus, so could be welcomed by its neighbours. The wider concern, though, is that trade war fears are hurting demand for German goods. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management is gloriously unimpressed by this weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G7 shindig, arguing that little will be achieved in Quebec. But markets could slide if Donald Trump falls out badly with fellow world leaders. Donovan says: Several heads of government disappear off for a taxpayer-financed weekend mini-break in Canada today. The G5, G7, G8, and now G6 plus 1 have never really accomplished very much after the first burst of enthusiasm with the Plaza and Louvre accords of the 1980s. This meeting will be no different. Because the G6 plus 1 is about spin not substance, the risks for markets come from the visual from this meeting. The US is looking isolated. This is not the isolationism and protectionism of the 1930s. In the 1930s everyone put up trade barriers against everyone else. This time the US is putting up trade barriers against everyone else, and everyone else is carrying on just as before. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit says the international trade system is more complex than Donald Trump suggests.... Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attacks on the EU and Canada have sent traders racing to sell risky assets, says Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index. Interest rate realities are sinking back in ahead of what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a not particularly cordial G7 summit in Canada. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little wonder that risk-aversion has returned. Odeluga points out that G7 summits can often disappoint -- but his week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one could be especially worrying: Even under \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnormal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 circumstances, markets tend to write-off the chances that G7 summits will result in concrete communiques with lasting impact. The current U.S. administration back-tracked on climate-related pledges within weeks of the last meeting. It also took its first steps on the trade war path despite the anti-\u00e2\u20ac\u0153protectionism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sentiments addressed in the prior G7 statement. With new U.S. tariffs now lodged against all but one of the remaining six members and Trump tweeting his still combative mood overnight, some leaders might be wondering if there might be more productive ways to spend their time this weekend. No wonder markets are falling. Overnight, Donald Trump launched a fierce attack on his fellow G7 leaders via Twitter, accusing Europe and Canada of treating America unfairly. Trump signed off that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclooking forward\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to meeting Justin Trudeau and Emmanuel Macon in Quebec.... having further stoked the feud between the US and the rest. Macron responded more tactfully, tweeting that tensions are rising everywhere, and the G7 meeting will be demanding. A wave of selling has swept through Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading floors this morning. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 58 points or 0.75%, to 7645 points. Nearly every share is down -- BT jumped 2.5% at the open, but has now subsided. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx blames geopolitical worries: A likely feisty G7 meeting in Quebec appears to be the main thing driving the markets lower. Investors are either worried that nothing will get resolved, or Trump will become more entrenched in his aggressive approach to trade. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has also started the day badly - down 1.1% - while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC is down 0.6%. BT tweets... ...because the incumbent is being kicked out by the chairman?... Geoff Cutmore of CNBC questions whether BT will stick with Patterson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy to revitalise BT, and cut 13,000 jobs, if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now surplus to requirements. Cutmore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s colleague, Karen Tso, points out that transforming BT into a tech-focused company is a huge challenge: It emerged earlier this week that BT shareholders were agitating for change, with top investors demanding talks with chairman Jan du Plessis. We wrote on Monday that du Plessis has already held meetings with investors, with more planned. Clearly the mood wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great. As one top investor told the FT: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much faith in Gavin....Since he took over [five years ago], it has not been a happy time for shareholders. I am not sure he is the right man for the job.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement suggests that du Plessis and the rest of the board came to the same conclusion, deciding that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dca change of leadership\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is needed. As Richard Fletcher of The Times puts it, du Plessis has now \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcousted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Patterson: A wobbly day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading in Asia has seen Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei drop 0.5%, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite index lose 1.5%, and the Hong Kong Hang Seng lose 1.7%. David Madden of CMC Markets says G7 worries are mounting. The G7 meeting starts today in Quebec. Traders will be paying attention to see if any progress is made regarding trade talks. President Tump is in the eye of the trade storm, and he is letting the world know he means business, and he is determined to get the best deal for the US. At the moment, investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overly concerned about the state of play, but that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a pain threshold. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Some breaking news to start the morning: Gavin Patterson is stepping down as chief executive of BT, in the face of criticism from investors. The telecoms giant has announced that Patterson will leave later this year -- after concluding that a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchange of leadership\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is needed. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: The company said that it had already started the process of looking for his successor, and expected to appoint a new chief executive in the second half of the year. Jan du Plessis, chairman of BT, thanked Patterson for his contribution but said the company needed a change in leadership. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The board is fully supportive of the strategy recently set out by Gavin and his team. The broader reaction to our recent results announcement has though demonstrated to Gavin and me that there is a need for a change of leadership to deliver this strategy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Patterson was clearly under pressure; BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price hit its lowest level since 2012 last month. It emerged earlier this week that some investors were losing patience with Patterson, who has been spending billions of pounds on sports rights such as Premier League football in an attempt to attract customers to its TV service. This looks like a rather humiliating way to go, just four weeks after announcing a new strategy and thousands of job cuts. More on that shortly.... Also coming up today Investors will be watching La Malbaie in Quebec, as Canada hosts the G7 meeting of world leaders. It could turn into a G6 +1, though, as America faces criticism over its trade policies from the UK, Germany, France, Japan, Italy and Canada. European markets are expected to fall, with the FTSE 100 called down 35 points, after Asian markets dropped back. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrisk aversion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is rising, as investors fear the meeting will be fraught. Given the quiet economic calendar today, the continuing trade spat between the US its closet allies will attract a good deal of attention as the G7 summit begins. The broader US market posted its first loss in 5 days as the recent equity rally, and more specifically tech rally, faltered, whilst investors started to show unease over the potential climate at the G7 Summit. Souring investor sentiment resulted in a softer session for Asia and indicates a weaker start for Europe on the open.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap. Britain has been hit by a flurry of weak economic data, that undermines confidence that its economy is recovering from its winter slowdown. New figures show that: UK manufacturing output fell by 1.4% in March, the worst performance since 2012 The trade gap widened to a 19-month high, at \u00c2\u00a35.3bn Construction output posted another quarter-on-quarter decline. Economists warned that Brexit uncertainty may now be biting, making it harder for UK firms to win new business abroad. The drop in manufacturing output was driven by weaker demand for steel and electrical machinery. My colleague Larry Elliott says the figures are troubling: The manufacturing figures from the Office for National Statistics are troubling for three reasons. First, surveys had suggested a much better performance. Second, the 0.5% drop in production in the three months ending in April makes forecasts of a strong bounce-back from tepid growth in early 2018 look premature. Third, even if signs are correct that consumer spending is picking up because of falling inflation, the UK will have reverted to its old pattern of growth after a short interlude in which activity was better balanced. The markets have shrugged off last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fractious and unconstructive G7 meeting, which saw Donald Trump fall out spectacularly with Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Justin Trudeau in a post-meeting tweet storm. Trump has now declared that trade should be truly reciprocal, as he continues to criticise other nations for their tariffs even as he threatens more of his own. European stock markets are all up in late trading, led by Italian optimism that its new government will not consider leaving the eurozone. FTSE 100: Up 50 points or 0.66% at 7731 points German DAX: Up 53 points or 0.4% at 12,819 points French CAC: Up 23 points or 0.4% at 5,473 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: Up 738 points or 3.4% at 22,094 European car companies have taken a hit, though, due to fears they could be hit by new US tariffs. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been another rough day for the UK retail sector, with discount chain Poundworld falling into administration. More than 5,000 jobs are on the line. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today, thanks for reading and commenting. GW Shares in European carmakers have fallen today, amid concerns that they could be dragged into a trade war between the US and Europe. Over the weekend, Donald Trump suggested he could impose tariffs on auto imports, using the same \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnational security\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 argument he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already used for steel. Trump told reporters that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an economic justification for tariffs: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the balance sheet. To have a great military, you need a great balance sheet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Any new tariffs could make it uncompetitive for European carmakers to sell cars in the US, which explains why shares are under pressure today: However, several European carmakers including Fiat Chrysler and BMW actually have factories in America, building cars for export. New tariffs could encourage manufacturers to make more cars in the US, or it could force them to move production to cheaper sites. Greece has won more plaudits today as Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leftist-led government unveiled a multi-bill of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153urgent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd reforms before the Greek parliament. The move officially launches the countdown to bailout exit in August, Helena Smith reports from Athens. As Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy finance minister Giorgos Chouliarakis formally presented the reforms before MPs - saying their passage would finally permit the country to exit international bailout oversight and successfully complete talks on the key issue of debt relief \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Athens received what amounted to some of the highest praise, yet, from the euro group chairman himself. After almost a decade of being dependent on international bailout funds, Greece was ready to stand on its feet again, said Mario Centeno, president of the group of euro area finance ministers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece is a different country today,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Portuguese finance minister told a conference in Lisbon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece has the conditions to take on its own hands the process of its economic and social development, within the euro framework, and can always count on European solidarity if it sticks to the path of internal responsibility.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The high praise came as Chouliarakis said it was vital the draft bill outlining further pension cuts, labour market reforms and privatisations in the energy domain, was voted on this week so that Greece could complete its final review by creditors in time for the next euro group meeting on June 21. That is when Athens not only hopes to take stock of a new \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12b aid disbursement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last as a bailout programme recipient \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but could finally embark on meaningful debt relief talks, he said. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u201a\u00ac320bn debt mountain is by far the biggest in Europe making economic recovery impossible if it is not reduced. Chouliarakis told MPs: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Completion of the fourth and last review of the economic adjustment programme will permit the Euro group on the 21 June to discuss, conclude and decide on a packet of measures for the reduction of Greek debt. Consequently it should be obvious to all why the legislation is of urgent character.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staggering debt pile will also be the focus of talks today between German chancellor Angela Merkel and International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde today. Ding ding! Wall Street has opened calmly, as US traders take the G7 meeting in their stride. The Dow Jones industrial average is 22 points higher, or 0.1%, with the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also in the green (just). Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprised that Donald Trump fell out (badly) with other world leaders in Quebec. The mood in financial markets is relatively upbeat at the start of a very busy week, as investors shrug off the G7 meeting which didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly go to plan as Donald Trump rejected the prepared communique and left early. While everyone will have hoped for a better outcome from the meeting, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think anyone is surprised given Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views on trade and his combative approach to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allies on the issue. Perhaps it was the expectation that this was a likely outcome that has led to investors shrugging it off and turning their attention to something more interesting, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly plenty for them to focus on in the coming days. Newsflash: Jaguar Land Rover is moving the production of its Land Rover Discovery SUV vehicle to Slovakia, from Solihull in the UK. JLR says it will retool its Solihull plant to handle a new generation of electric, petrol and diesel models. But there could still be job cuts at the plant, close to Birmingham in the Midlands, as the changes are made. Kaye Wiggins of Bloomberg has more details: Discovery production will be moved from the beginning of 2019, meaning job cuts at the Solihull plant are possible before it ramps up staffing again, the people said. The investment, totaling hundreds of millions of pounds, according to the people, could cut both ways. While some agency-employed plant workers may lose their jobs, the decision to build electric cars at Solihull marks a major commitment to U.K. manufacturing amid uncertainty over Brexit. European stock markets are holding onto this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, as traders scamper from their desks for a quick lunchbreak (or spill sandwich crumbs on their keyboards). The European-wide Stoxx 600 is up 0.4%, thanks to rallies in London and in Italy. Italian stocks are buoyant after finance minister Giovanni Tria has insisted that Italy remained committed to the euro. Investors are putting the G7 meeting behind them, and concentrating on the imminent Trump-Kim summit in Singapore. Artjom Hatsaturjants, research analyst at Accendo Markets, says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The FTSE has made a strong start for the week, with bullishness back in vogue in spite of a geopolitical dust-up at the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G7 Summit in Canada. Investors appear to be writing off President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bickering with his colleagues as same old, same old (start in attack dog mode, dial back rhetoric later), perhaps more interested in the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. UK building firms are suffering from Brexit uncertainty and the weakness of the UK pound, says Michael Thirkettle, chief executive of construction consulting and design agency McBains. As mentioned earlier, construction output shrank by 3,4% in the three months to April. Almost every part of the sector suffered: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures also show that total construction new orders fell by 4.6% in the first three months of this year, which will drag on output in the coming months. Thirkettle says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics prove the construction sector is still in troubled waters with continuing uncertainties, borne from Brexit, and the poor value of sterling impacting on the cost of imported materials, meaning many UK companies are delaying investment decisions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The real test, however, will be in the months to come, given the uncertainty over issues like Brexit that have impacted on UK companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 commitment to new projects over the last two years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yet more disappointing news: the UK economy only grew by 0.2% in the last three months, from March to May. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the latest estimate from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than the 0.1% recorded in the first three months, but it dashes hopes of a healthy rebound from the winter slowdown. Economists had pencilled in growth of 0.3%. Amit Kara, NIESR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of UK macroeconomic forecasting, says the UK is only growing half as fast as its potential growth rate, partly due to the snow in March. Economic growth has slowed materially since the start of this year and it continues to remain weak. One reason for sluggish growth is the disruption caused by severe weather in March, particularly to the construction sector. The latest data also shows a notable slowdown in manufacturing sector output that appears to be driven by both domestic and external conditions. By contrast, the retail sector and the dominant services sector may be recovering. At Poundworld in Hyde in Tameside, Greater Manchester, shoppers were dismayed to hear of the chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demise, reports my colleague Helen Pidd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh what a shame,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Sylvia Andrew, 61, who had just paid a pound for a dummy security camera to protect her hen house. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If someone comes to nick my chickens they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not to know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not real. If you put two AA batteries in a light flashes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Currently signed off sick, she counts every penny, explaining: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At Poundworld you get two Pears soaps for \u00c2\u00a31. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a31.50 at the supermarket.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Joanne Betts, 48, a carer, had just bought four packets of Glow sticks for \u00c2\u00a31 each and some bin bags. She told us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think a place like this would close. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 m in every week buying things I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Inside, shoppers could spend a pound on anything from flip-flops to rat poison or packets of Aunt Bessie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yorkshire pudding mix. One of Poundworld\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems may have been its competitors. Next door to its Hyde store is Bodyworks, a discount cosmetic outlet. Next to that is B&amp;M Bargains, a northern chain which recently announced plans to open 45 stores down south. Add to that the Quality Save in the precinct, the Iceland in the shopping centre carpark and a branch of Yorkshire frozen food retailer Jack Fulton and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear bargain hunters are spoiled for choice. The slide in the pound today is pushing shares higher in London (as a weaker currency is good for exporters). The FTSE 100 is now up 70 points today at 7750, as City traders continue to shrug off the G7 mess. Newsflash: UK discount chain Poundworld has gone into administration, putting 5,100 jobs at risk. This is the latest in a string of retail failures this year, following the collapse of Toys R Us and Maplin. My colleague Rob Davies explains how last-ditch rescue talks to save the firm failed: Poundworld, which has a chain of 335 shops, filed a notice of intention to appoint an administrator last Thursday, giving it temporary protection from its creditors. But plans to find a buyer for the business have now been abandoned, although the administrators are likely to seek buyers for parcels of stores. But two potential rescue buyouts have fallen through, with private equity firms Rcapital and Alteri Partners both walking away after talks with current owners TPG Capital. All this weak economic data is bad for the pound. Sterling has shed half a cent against the US dollar to $1.335. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down a similar amount against the euro, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.134. The 1.4% tumble in UK manufacturing output in April has come as a nasty shock to economists, who had expected a small rise. It undermines hopes that the UK economy was bouncing back from its slowdown last winter. Brexit could be partly responsible for the drop in UK manufacturing output last month. Economics journalist Dharshini Davis suspects that firms may find it harder to win business, because of the uncertainty over trading relations after March 2019. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), fears that trade war fears are already hurting UK exporters. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his take on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s widening trade gap: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The deterioration in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade position in April is a concern and means that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit remains significantly higher than the historical average. This deterioration largely reflects a marked decline in exports in the month. It is possible that the UK is now moving past the recent sweet spot for exporters, with growth in key markets moderating and the impact of the post-EU referendum slump in sterling, which has helped some exporters, subsiding. The possibility of an escalating trade war has added to the downside risks for exporters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153More must be done to support UK exporters by addressing longstanding issues, from the lack of practical support for exporters to chronic skills shortages.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And Donald Trump thinks he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got trade problems.... This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic data paints a rather grim picture of the UK economy. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the ONS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of national accounts, Rob Kent-Smith: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Manufacturing fell in the three months to April with electrical machinery and steel for infrastructure projects seeing reduced production. International demand continued to slow and the domestic market remained subdued. However, oil and gas production grew strongly in the aftermath of the Forties pipeline closure at the end of last year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While construction output saw a small bounceback in April after a poor start to the year, over the longer-term this sector continues to contract with significant falls across most types of work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Construction orders fell for a second successive quarter after recent boosts from large rail projects. However, new housing orders reached their highest level since before the economic downturn. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The trade deficit widened as exports fell by more than imports, with exports of goods and services both declining. Exports of machinery, aircraft and pharmaceuticals all saw notable falls.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Make that a triple-dose of bad news! UK construction output fell by 3.3% year-on-year in April. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fourth drop in a row, and the longest negative run since May 2013. In a double-dose of bad news, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade gap with the rest of the world has worsened. The total UK trade deficit widened by \u00c2\u00a31.9bn to \u00c2\u00a39.7bn in the three months to April 2018, due mainly to falling exports of both goods and services. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: Goods exports fell \u00c2\u00a33.1 billion, due mainly to falls in exports of machinery, pharmaceuticals and aircraft, while services exports also fell \u00c2\u00a32.5 billion in the three months to April 2018. Falling volumes was the main reason for the declines in exports of machinery, pharmaceuticals and aircraft in the three months to April 2018 as price movements were relatively small. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade in goods deficit improved \u00c2\u00a30.6 billion with countries outside of the EU and worsened \u00c2\u00a31.2 billion with countries inside the EU in the three months to April 2018. In April alone, the trade gap widened to nearly \u00c2\u00a35.3bn. Britain ran a surplus of \u00c2\u00a38.7bn on services, but that was more than wiped out by a \u00c2\u00a314bn deficit in goods. Total industrial production in the UK fell by 0.8% last month, dragged down by that worrying 1.4% slide in manufacturing. Energy production fell by 2%, thanks to the warmer weather. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers have suffered their biggest monthly fall in over five years -- raising new worries about the strength of the economy. UK manufacturing output fell by 1.4% in April 2018, new figures from the Office for National Statistics show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest monthly fall since October 2012, when it shrank by 1.8%. The ONE warns: There is widespread weakness with 9 of the 13 sub-sectors decreasing and this is a continuation of the recent slowdown in this sector. Over the last three months, manufacturing output has now fallen by 0.5% - the worst performance since May 2017. The ONS blames \u00e2\u20ac\u0153decreases in electrical equipment (9.4%), and basic metals and metal products (1.8%).\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More to follow.... Donald Trump told fellow G7 members that America was tired of other countries imposing unfair tariffs. The data, though, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back this up. According to the World Bank, the average tariff on goods traded between countries has now fallen to 2.9%, thanks to various trade deals. G7 countries actually have lower tariffs -- at just 1.6% for goods coming into the UK, France, Germany or the US. Of course, there are still significant tariffs on some goods - such as milk imports into China, or tobacco imports into the US. But by unilaterally slapping tariffs on steel imports, Trump risks driving up the global tariff burden. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy minister has said the G7 meeting has bolstered unity among European Union members. Peter Altmaier told reports in Brussels that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The commotion at the G7 summit in Canada has brought the European Union closer together. It is important we show unity at all levels.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Four EU members took part in the G7 meeting - Germany, France, Italy and the UK. Like Canada, the EU is expected to hit back at America with a range of retaliatory tariffs on July 1st, in response to the US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Chancellor Angela Merkel took an unusually blunt line, saying that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to withdraw from the G7 communique by tweet was sobering and depressing. She told the ARD broadcaster that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow ourselves be ripped off again and again. We will act too. The Canadian dollar is dropping this morning, in the face of deteriorating relations between Washington and Ottawa. The loonie (as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s known in financial circles) has shed 0.3% against the greenback to C$1.296. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a modest fall, following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that Canadian PM Trudeau was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very dishonest and weak.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump is particularly angry about Canadian milk, where domestic subsidies and high tariffs protect Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s farmers from the vicissitudes of the dairy market. But that centralised \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsupply management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 system does seem to work; it avoids both bankruptcies and gluts by guaranteeing farmers a decent price. Trudeau is determined to support it. Ding! European stock markets are open, and rallying despite the lack of progress at the G7 meeting. In London the FTSE 100 has gained 35 points, or almost 0.5%, with similar gains in Frankfurt and Paris. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX has jumped by over 1%. Traders are jittery about the acrimony seen in Canada last weekend, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets, but also hopeful of progress in Singapore. Van Dulken explains: Thankfully, there is more optimism about the US President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. Potential for a meaningful discussions about de-nuclearisation on the Korean peninsula could diffuse some of the tensions between US and North Korea, improve the global mood and gain Trump some brownie points after this weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s events at the G7. South Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has led the rally in Asia today, on hopes that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next summit will be more productive than his last one. The Kospi index has gained 0.75% as traders prepared for the historic Trump-Kim meeting tomorrow. There are also gains in Japan and India, although China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark index has dropped into the red. David Madden of CMC Markets says investors are hoping for a breakthrough: The US President left the G7 summit early in order to prepare for his meeting with Kim Jong Un, the North Korean leader. The meeting will take place today in Singapore. There has been a bit of toing and froing about the meeting, but now it seems as if it is finally going ahead. Last summer there were some volatile sessions on global stock markets on account of the heightened tensions between the US and North Korea because of the regime\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear weapons programme. The meeting between the two leaders could greatly improve political relations around the world. President Trump has launched another tirade at the rest of the G7, as he prepared for his summit with North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kim Jong-un in Singapore on Tuesday: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It was a bad weekend for fans of the rules-based international order, as the meeting of top world leaders struggled to meet even the lowest expectations. Relations between America and the rest of the G7 look worse than ever, after Donald Trump left the meeting early, refused to sign the official communique, and accused his host Justin Trudeau of making \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfalse statements\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Getting all the adults in one room is meant to deliver progress and resolve differences, but not this time. Instead, the G7 has taken another step backwards, with Trump accusing the rest of the world of treating America like a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPiggy Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. So, the US is sticking to its new tariffs on steel and aluminium, and Canada is vowing to hit back with its retaliatory tariffs on US goods from July 1 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite being accused of treachery by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic advisor. The scale of the debacle suggests that the alliances and structures build up over the last 70 years are now creaking alarmingly, raising the dangers of a full-blown trade war. The financial markets, though, are remarkably unconcerned by events in Quebec. Asian stocks have risen overnight, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei gaining 0.5%. European markets are expected to rally too; Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is expected to creep higher today too. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says investors are shrugging off the G7 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets appear able to shake off geopolitical risks with stocks showing firmness in the face of a pretty torrid weekend for free trade. Asian shares have risen and futures point to the FTSE opening up around 0.2%, with smaller rises for the DAX and CAC. After a stormy G7 meeting, the US seems to have turned its back on its allies and is prepared to ratchet up the pressure on trade. Ostensibly this should not be good for risk, though markets appear deaf at present to such rumbings. This is brinkmanship that may ultimately end up working to the advantage of the US; but it is also likely to depress investor sentiment, and therefore growth through the second part of 2018. Nevertheless, expectations coming into the event were exceptionally low and so there has been little negative reaction in the markets so far.

Since the start of 2016, the public sector has almost been as vital to the economy as during the global financial crisis, and demonstrates yet again that governments do create jobs and economic growth. </p> <p>Something odd happened to the narrative of the Australian economy over the past year. After the end of the investment phase of the mining boom, the story was that the switch had clearly been made towards more export-oriented growth. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/jun/07/growth-with-a-grain-of-salt-its-the-same-old-story-as-households-miss-out\">Growth with a grain of salt: it's the same old story as households miss out | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It made sense. Once we got through the wild swing of the GFC years, the contribution of exports to our economic growth continued to rise. By September 2016 it was contributing 1.3% pts to GDP growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the highest recorded for over 15 years. </p> <p>But since then, rather surprisingly, it has fallen:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Contribution of exports to annual GDP growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/bmNUY/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Now this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that the export phase is over \u00e2\u20ac\u201c indeed the expectation is that export growth will pick up. But it highlights how little our economic growth is dependent upon exports, and how subject our exports are to weather (cyclones are not good for our exports) and international economics winds. </p> <p>Historically the biggest driver of our economy has been domestic demand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c spending by households and the public sector and investments by the private and public sector. </p> <p>Through 2015 and 2016 the contribution of exports to our economic growth was almost on a par with that of domestic demand, but that was as much a reflection of how weak domestic demand was as it was about how strong export growth was:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Contribution to annual GDP growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eNSZY/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So in some ways, while decline in importance of exports is counter to the narrative of the export boom, it fits with the historical picture of our economy. </p> <p>In many ways this is good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if only for our nerves.

                "bodyText":"The past two years have been a very good demonstration of the importance of the public sector in keeping the economy growing when the private sector is weak. Since the start of 2016, the public sector has almost been as vital to the economy as during the global financial crisis, and demonstrates yet again that governments do create jobs and economic growth. Something odd happened to the narrative of the Australian economy over the past year. After the end of the investment phase of the mining boom, the story was that the switch had clearly been made towards more export-oriented growth. It made sense. Once we got through the wild swing of the GFC years, the contribution of exports to our economic growth continued to rise. By September 2016 it was contributing 1.3% pts to GDP growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the highest recorded for over 15 years. But since then, rather surprisingly, it has fallen: Now this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that the export phase is over \u00e2\u20ac\u201c indeed the expectation is that export growth will pick up. But it highlights how little our economic growth is dependent upon exports, and how subject our exports are to weather (cyclones are not good for our exports) and international economics winds. Historically the biggest driver of our economy has been domestic demand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c spending by households and the public sector and investments by the private and public sector. Through 2015 and 2016 the contribution of exports to our economic growth was almost on a par with that of domestic demand, but that was as much a reflection of how weak domestic demand was as it was about how strong export growth was: So in some ways, while decline in importance of exports is counter to the narrative of the export boom, it fits with the historical picture of our economy. In many ways this is good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if only for our nerves. GDP figures are mostly reported in the media in seasonally adjusted terms (for no good reason), but the chart of seasonally adjusted exports can look a bit like a heart monitor, so it is probably good that we are not overly reliant on them to gauge every three months how we are tracking: But while it is not unusual that we are once again reliant mostly on domestic demand, the makeup of that demand is not typical. When we look at the breakdown of how domestic demand is contributing to our economic growth we see that through 2016 and 2017 public spending \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both consumption and investment has become more important than in the three years beforehand. Household consumption remains the biggest factor (not surprising given it accounts for 60% of the economy) but its importance remains relatively flat and subdued. Similarly during 2016 and 2017 the private sector side of investment was actually detracting from economic growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because of the sharp fall in mining investment: The importance of the public sector spending \u00e2\u20ac\u201c mostly in health, aged care, the NDIS and infrastructure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is apparent when we take away the contribution of the public sector from GDP growth.

                "bodyText":"The fair work ombudsman has launched legal action against Foodora, alleging its food couriers should be classed as employees rather than independent contractors. In what could become a landmark case for the gig economy, the ombudsman is arguing that Foodora workers are entitled to the minimum award wage, and the company should be fined hundreds of thousands of dollars for underpayment, sham contracting and breaches of the Fair Work Act. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Sign up to receive the top stories every morning Foodora and other companies like UberEats and Deliveroo class their workers as independent contractors. This means they are not entitled to award wages, penalty rates, leave or other protections under the Fair Work Act that employees receive. Some food app riders say they end up earning as little as $6 an hour. Foodora riders are paid per delivery, and in May a spokeswoman said the current rate was between $7 and $9 per delivery. The claim, filed in the federal court on Tuesday, focuses on three Foodora couriers: two 19-year-olds from Melbourne and a 30-year-old from Sydney. The fair work ombudsman, Natalie James, said the level of control that Foodora exerted over the three workers meant that they were legally employees. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Courts have found again and again that merely labelling the relationship to be one of independent contracting does not make it so,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The activity of delivering food from restaurants and fast food outlets to customers is not new, and nor is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for what determines who is and is not an employee entitled to award rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Foodora and other delivery companies argue that their workers are contractors because they provide their own bikes and vehicles, have the flexibility to choose when to work, and can refuse or delegate work. In 2001 a landmark high court case found that bicycle couriers who were forced to wear the uniform of their courier company were employees, not contractors. However, in the UK, a court found in November that Deliveroo riders were in fact contractors. Current Australian labour law holds that a mix of multiple factors of control will determine whether a worker is an independent contractor or employee. James said the ombudsman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation into the three Foodora workers showed a high level of control \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including the fact that riders had to wear branded uniforms. She said Foodora exercised control over the workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hours, location and manner of work; and the fact that Foodora riders could not negotiate pay, and could not develop their own customer base while working meant they were not independent contractors. The ombudsman claims the three workers were underpaid by $1,620.74 over four weeks, and also missed out on superannuation. If found to be in contravention of the Fair Work Act, Foodora could be penalised $54,000 for each contravention. The Transport Workers Union is also arguing for delivery riders to be considered employees, and has filed legal action against Foodora for unfair dismissal on behalf of several couriers. The union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national secretary, Tony Sheldon, said app-based food delivery needed to be regulated. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sham-contracting comes as no surprise to the thousands of delivery riders,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But action must go broader than just one company and just a few riders.

The ombudsman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case will proceed to a case management hearing in Sydney on 10 July.",

Thanks also to the base effects caused by the 5.3% m/m drop in gasoline prices in May of last year, that rise in energy prices pushed headline CPI inflation up to 2.8%, from 2.5%. With crude oil prices stabilising in recent weeks, gasoline prices are likely to be more neutral for inflation over the rest of the year.</p> </blockquote> <p>Inflation is devouring most of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay rises, flags up economist <strong>Ulrik Bie</strong>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/UlrikBie/status/1006519933382135808\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">With US CPI inflation at 2.8% in May, annual growth in inflation-adjusted weekly earnings remains stuck at 0.5%.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap. Wage growth in the UK has slowed, in the latest sign that British households is struggling. Basic earnings rose by 2.8% per year in the February-April period, down from 2.9% a month earlier. Total pay, including bonuses, only rose by 2.5% -- meaning inflation ate virtually all the increase. Unions warned that wage growth was too slow to help families recover from the financial crisis. Economists say the wage growth slowdown cuts the chance of interest rates rising in August. The government hailed the news that employment was at a record high. Unemployment remained at a 43-year low of 4.2%. American consumers are also being hit in the pocket, with CPI inflation hitting a six-year high last month. Energy costs were a key factor, as US citizens faced higher prices at the gasoline pumps Economists say the figures mean the Federal Reserve is certain to raise interest rates at the end of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting tomorrow (on Wednesday). The markets are subdued today, as investors digest the Trump-Kim summit. The FTSE 100 is down 16 points (0.2%), while the Dow Jones industrial average is down 21 points (-0.1%). Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, says markets have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more pressing concerns\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The long-term importance of the Korea-U.S. summit is obvious but the event itself was always going to be something of a sideshow. All eyes were on the topic of denuclearisation, and, just as importantly facilities to verify that, but whilst North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kim Jung Un reaffirmed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unwavering\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd commitment to the aim, agreements appeared vague and their scope limited. Verification was discussed, according to U.S. President Donald Trump, in a lengthy post-summit presser, but he gave no indication of whether North Korea was inclined to move towards the kind of stringent corroboration needed. So, grounds for optimism on a new North-South Korea order remain, but talks have merely confirmed there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a long grind ahead to fulfil that promise. That may be all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting, GW Rating agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s says America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic at the sight of inflation jumping further above its target: Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s says: U.S. inflationary pressures are gradually developing, not surprising given the rise in global commodity prices, the tightening in the domestic labor market, and above-trend GDP growth. The headline consumer price index increased 0.2% in May, matching the gain in April. Food prices were unchanged, while energy rose 0.9%. Excluding food and energy, the CPI was up a trend-like 0.2%. On a year-ago basis, the headline and core CPIs increased 2.7% and 2.2%, respectively. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a slam dunk that the Fed will raise interest rates at the conclusion of its meeting Wednesday, and odds favor that it signals a total of four rate hikes, rather than three, this year. Though policymakers sound hawkish, there is no immediate need to panic; the central bank should let inflation temporarily run above target. Philip Smeaton, chief investment officer at Sanlam UK, reckons Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade disputes are helping to push US inflation higher. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Underlying upward pressure from tariff discussions, tax cuts and low employment has helped stoke the inflationary fires. And while the Fed won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too concerned about inflation ticking above its target, it does pave the way for an interest rate rise later this week. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-trade policies have certainly added to this inflationary pressure. While the US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiation style has often been more bluster than action, it looks like some tariffs will go live, and he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem too concerned about the short-term effects if it has a lasting impact in the longer term. However, [Federal Reserve chair Jerome] Powell will be keeping a watchful eye on the ongoing discussions and any further effects these may have on growth and inflation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Michael Pearce of Capital Economics points out that fuel and energy are getting more expensive: The increase in headline inflation to a six-year high of 2.8% in May is partly due to the rally in energy prices, but it is also reflects another solid monthly gain in core CPI, which will keep the Fed on course to raise interest rates tomorrow. We expect underlying inflation to trend gradually higher from here, which will prompt the Fed to hike rates twice in the second half of the year. A 1.7% m/m rise in gasoline prices last month pushed the energy index up by 0.9% m/m. Thanks also to the base effects caused by the 5.3% m/m drop in gasoline prices in May of last year, that rise in energy prices pushed headline CPI inflation up to 2.8%, from 2.5%. With crude oil prices stabilising in recent weeks, gasoline prices are likely to be more neutral for inflation over the rest of the year. Inflation is devouring most of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay rises, flags up economist Ulrik Bie: Greg Daco of Oxford Economics predicts America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bankers will raise interest rates twice more this year, starting tomorrow. This chart from Bloomberg shows how US inflation has now running over the official 2% target for months, and is now at its highest level since 2012: BREAKING: Prices in America are rising at their fastest pace since 2012. The US consumer prices index rose to 2.8% per annum in May, up from 2.5% in April. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little higher than expected, and the highest inflation rate since February 2012. It surely means the Federal Reserve is certain to raise US interest rates on Wednesday. Prices rose by 0.2% during the month. Core inflation (which strips out volatile items) rose to 2.2%, another sign that inflationary pressure are building. European stock markets continue to be underwhelmed by the results of Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historic summit in Singapore. In London, the FTSE 100 has dropped into the red - down 20 points at 7718. The Frankfurt and Parisian markets are looking becalmed too. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lacklustre response to what Trump claimed was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very important event in world history\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear that the US president has achieved much, in return for granting Kim such as high-profile meeting. North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153complete denuclearisation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sounds good, but today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t include concrete targets. Of course, it will take more than one meeting to reach a truly momentous deal. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our analysis: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also some surprise that Donald Trump has agreed to suspend \u00e2\u20ac\u0153War Games\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the region, on the grounds they are expensive, provocative and inappropriate. Dr Moritz Pieper, an expert in International Relations at the University of Salford, sees a long road ahead: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The historic meeting between Trump and Kim can be a first step in a longer-term process that might eventually see a peace treaty for the Korean peninsula and North Korean denuclearisation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But both sides have different views of what denuclearisation means. The US line has always been that it wants to see complete, irreversible and verifiable dismantlement of North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear programme in return for aid and sanctions lifting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or relief. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But North Korea is unlikely to agree to give up its nuclear weapons. This is seen as North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security guarantee \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the nuclear deterrent is seen as key for regime survival. The president of ZEW, Achim Wambach, reckons German investors are being spooked by geopolitical perils: Explaining today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop in sentiment, Wambach says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest escalation in the trade dispute with the United States and fears about policies by the new Italian government that could destabilize the financial system are leaving their mark on the outlook for Germany. In another alarming development, optimism among German investors has sunk to its lowest in nearly six years. The ZEW institute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly index of morale has slumped to -16.1, down from the -8.2 recorded in May, and the lowest level since September 2012. The trade dispute between Europe and the US, and the election of a populist government in Italy, could be a nasty cocktail for German investors. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also seen exports and factory production fall this year, a sign that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy may be slowing down. Economists are concerned... The broader picture is that UK wages are still below their pre-financial crisis levels in real terms, and struggling to catch up: Public sector pay packets have lagged behind since 2015, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthanks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay cap on nurses, teachers et al. They suffered the brunt of the fall in real wages last year, as inflation ravaged pay packets. The slowdown in UK wage growth last month will concern the Bank of England, which has predicted that earnings will accelerate in 2018. Weak economic growth in the first quarter of this year prevented the BoE from raising interest rates in May. If wage growth remains weak, it could deter a rate hike this summer too. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, suspects that UK interest rates may remain at 0.5% until 2019. The Bank views wage growth as a key indicator when considering whether to raise rates. Disappointing figures here, combined with confirmation that the economy grew by just 0.1% in Q1, should put paid to any talk of a summer rate rise. Policymakers had been thought to be considering raising rates in August, but I still think a rate rise this year looks unlikely. The Bank will almost certainly want confirmation that the Q1 growth figure was just a blip before raising borrowing costs. Women taking part-time jobs makes up the biggest proportion of job creation in the last year, followed by men taking full-time jobs. This helped to push the female employment rate to a record high of 71.3% (compared to 80% for men). Young Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trust chief executive Dr Carole Easton OBE says more help is needed: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The record rate of women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment is welcome, although the Office for National Statistics has pointed out that this is in part due to women retiring later. At the other end of the scale, young women are struggling to find work and make ends meet. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Young women tell us they want to work and be able to live independently but today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures show that nearly half a million are still out of work and full-time education \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 11,000 more than this time last year. Esther McVey, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, says the steady job labour market is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153success story\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The employment rate has never been higher \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with over 3.3 million people moving into work since 2010. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Great British success story with businesses from Exeter to Edinburgh creating jobs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c helping, on average 1,000 people find a job each and every day since 2010. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And with the increase in the personal tax allowance, this Government has ensured that people are keeping more of their money before they begin paying tax \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning more take-home pay, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more money in your pocket for you and your family. At just 2.8%, UK pay growth is well below the 4.5% enjoyed in the run-up to the financial crisis. Conor D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Arcy, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, says earnings growth remains disappointing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK jobs market has continued to impress in 2018, with employment remaining at a record high and female unemployment falling to its lowest ever level. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re yet to see the good news on jobs feed into wage pressure, with nominal pay growth still below 3%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the easing of inflationary pressures is helping pay packets to stretch that little bit further, there is still no sign of a long overdue pay rebound in Britain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Industrial unrest hit a record low in April, with fewer walkouts than ever before. The ONS reports that: there were 3,000 working days lost from five stoppages in April 2018, the lowest number of stoppages since monthly records began in January 1931 1,000 people took strike action, one of the lowest figures on record This highlights how union power has waned in Britain in recent years -- perhaps one reason that wage growth is now so mediocre. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), is worried that UK wage growth is slowing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While pay is still outpacing price growth, the slowdown in earnings growth is a concern. Delivering sustained rises in real pay growth is likely to prove an uphill struggle amid weak productivity and a sluggish economy. As a consequence, household finances are likely to remain stretched, particularly given weak household savings and high debt levels. The slowdown in earnings growth, together with the recent weakness in a raft of other economic indicators, undermines the case for tightening monetary policy. Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, fears that the UK labour market may have peaked. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The juxtaposition of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increase in the employment rate to a record 75.6% and yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news of lay-offs at both Poundworld and Jaguar Land Rover will be lost on nobody and we think that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report could soon be revealed as a high water mark for job creation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The recent claimant count trend has been increasing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it sits at 3\u00c2\u00bd year high currently - and employment readings within the PMI sentiment surveys have been deteriorating so an increase in joblessness soon would not come as surprise. This could also contribute to a slowing of wage gains, something that we have seen already this month.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This wage slowdown means that real basic pay growth in the UK (basic earnings minus inflation) remains just 0.4%. And total real pay growth is zero -- with inflation eating up pay and bonuses. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady has warned that wage growth is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stuck in the slow lane\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. At this rate pay packets won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recover to their pre-recession levels for years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to speed things up. Extending collective bargaining would boost living standards and help workers get a fairer share of the wealth they create. The number of unemployed people in the UK dropped by 38,000 in the last quarter, to 1.42 million. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs data is weaker than expected, says Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Andy Bruce: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment rate has now been at a record high of 75.6% for two months running - a record dating back to at least 1971. At 4.2%, the unemployment rate hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been lower since March-May 1975: But this apparent strength is not reaching workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pockets. Regular pay growth is now dropping, having hit its highest level since 2015 last month. Newsflash: Wage growth in the UK has slowed, even though the economy continues to create jobs. Basic pay growth slowed to 2.8% per year in the three months to April, the latest labour market report shows. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 2.9% a month ago, suggesting that wage growth is faltering. Total pay growth (including bonuses) also slowed, to 2.5% from 2.6%. The unemployment rate, though, remains at just 4.2% - its lowest level in 43 years. And the economy continued to create jobs -- 146,000 new workers were taken on in the last quarter, down from 197,000 in the January-March quarter. The ONS says: There were 32.39 million people in work, 146,000 more than for November 2017 to January 2018 and 440,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 years who were in work) was 75.6%, higher than for a year earlier (74.8%) and the joint highest since comparable records began in 1971. There were 1.42 million unemployed people (people not in work but seeking and available to work), 38,000 fewer than for November 2017 to January 2018 and 115,000 fewer than for a year earlier. More to follow! Economist Shaun Richards says we should watch out for total wage growth in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay including bonuses). It dropped to 2.6% last month, down from 2.8%. Overnight, Larry Kudlow - the director of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Economic Council - was hospitalised after suffering a heart attack. Trump broke the news on Twitter, shortly before his summit with Kim. Kudlow, a former TV personality and Wall Street economist, only joined the White House in March. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important advisor to Trump, and a supporter of free trade, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear who might cover his duties while he recuperates. Kudlow hit the headlines on Sunday after accusing Canadian PM Justin Trudeau of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153essentially double-crossing President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Paul Donovan of UBS thinks investors should focus on the crisis at the G7, rather than Trumps\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with Kim. He explains: The US president seems to have a better relationship with the North Korean leader than with the Canadian leader. Markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care too much about North Korea. Markets do care about US relations with Canada. Sue Trinh of RBC says investors shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too excited by Kim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to work towards \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomplete denuclearisation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the Korean peninsula. Both sides stand far, far apart on what denuclearisation means. To the US, it means NK must deliver complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation. To Kim, it means NK suspends nuclear and missile tests in exchange for major economic concessions and the US stepping back as torchbearer for the Asian region (basically dismantling its alliance with South Korea and ultimately the region as a whole). Kim has never announced the intention of abandoning his existing nuclear arsenal, which he calls a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153treasured sword\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Per previous peace deals, the main issue will be the pace of implementation, which includes agreement on a verification protocol. South Korean President Moon suggested it could be the start of a process lasting up to two years or longer. So let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s get back to what really matters for markets for the time being \u00e2\u20ac\u201c next up, US CPI, voting on the EU Withdrawal Bill and the FOMC and ECB meetings. European stock markets have opened higher as traders digest the historic US-North Korea summit in Singapore. After holding hours of talks, Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un have sat down before the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s media and signed a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomprehensive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 agreement, pledging to work towards peace on the Korean peninsula. Photos of the document also show that North Korea has committed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153work towards\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd complete denuclearisation. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a welcome aspiration, but not a full-blooded commitment it will actually happen. Kim hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agreed to any explicit missile reductions, for example. But still, the Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index has gained 0.4% in early trading, on relief that the Singapore event has gone better than the G7 summit. Trump declared that the two leaders had enjoyed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153really fantastic meeting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while Kim spoke about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a big prelude to peace\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is up a modest 6 points. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re tracking all the developments here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we learn how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market is faring, as the warning lights flash on the UK economy. Overnight, recruitment firm ManpowerGroup has reported that company bosses are at their most pessimistic since 2012 -- due to worries over Brexit and the high street slowdown. My colleague Richard Partington explains: Watched by the Bank of England and the government for early warnings of hiring spurts or downturns, the quarterly poll of about 2,000 major employers from nine different industry sectors across the UK found a net balance of only 4% planning to hire more staff rather than cutting back. The weakest outlook from the survey was reserved for the banking and finance industry, which recorded the worst outlook since the depths of the financial crisis almost a decade ago, suggesting job cuts may be on the way over the summer. With manufacturing output hitting a six-year low yesterday, and construction output also disappointing, the economy appears to be at its weakest point since the eurozone crisis was raging six years ago. So, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment figures will be scrutinised for signs of weakness. Economists are expecting the jobless rate to remain at 4.2% in April, a 43-year low, with basic pay rises unchanged at 2.9%. But, the number of jobs created over the last quarter could drop to around 110,000, from 197,000 in the three months to March. That could signal that the labour market is cooling. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada explains: Even though there have been a number of large surprises to the upside in the employment data over the last six months, it will be very difficult for gains in employment to match last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very strong +197k 3/3m. For the unemployment rate, we expect it to remain at 4.2% for a third consecutive month. As ever, average wages will be the more closely watched measure, but on this occasion we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect major changes and look for the excluding-bonus measure to remain 2.9% 3m/yr. Also coming up today It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big day for Brexit, as parliament votes on an amendment to give MPs give parliament a meaningful vote on the final deal. This would put the House of Commons in charge if MPs were to reject the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final divorce deal was rejected by MPs into the hands of the Commons. It aims to avoid MPs facing a choice between the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal or no deal, but Brexiters fear it could lead to a second referendum. Sterling could be volatile if Theresa May fails to block the amendment. We also get the latest American inflation figures. The annual US CPI is expected to rise to 2.7%, from 2.5% in May, as the cost of living accelerates. The US Federal Reserve is already expected to raise interest rates tomorrow, following a two-day meeting starting today. The agenda 9.30am BST: UK unemployment statistics 10am BST: ZEW survey of eurozone economic sentiment in June 1.30pm BST: US CPI inflation for May",

FTSE 100: -1.1% at 7,682 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.7% at 13,021 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.2% at 5,518 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -1% at 22,272 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -1.2% at 9,837 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.7% at 390 Our full story on the US trade tariffs will be updated here: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thank you for reading the blog and for all your comments. Have a great weekend and please join us again on Monday. The bell has gone on Wall Street and US markets are down: Dow Jones: -0.5% at 25,047 S&amp;P 500: -0.3% at 2,774 Nasdaq: -0.4% at 7,727 It hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken Beijing long to respond to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to impose a 25% tariff on $50bn of Chinese imports. As expected, it plans to retaliate. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commerce department has issued a statement: China is unwilling to have a trade war, but the Chinese side has no choice but to strongly oppose this, due to the United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 myopic behaviour that will harm both parties. We will immediately introduce tariff measures of the same scale and strength. All the results from the previously reached by the two parties will be invalid. US investors are feeling nervous after President Trump announced plans to slap a 25% tariff on $50bn of Chinese imports. China has promised to retaliate in equal measure, raising the prospect of a full-blown trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies, and that is weighing on sentiment. Peter Cardillo, economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York: It has gotten investors nervous. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to probably mean a cautious and bumpy ride for the stock markets. US futures are all trading lower. The opening bell rings in less than 10 minutes. Speaking on Fox News, President Trump said that he regarded China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s President Xi Jinping as a friend, but it was time to take action to reduce America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit. Look, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my friend. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a wonderful guy, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great guy. But at some point we have to straighten it out. President Trump has just made his way down to the Fox News base outside the White House for an unscheduled interview. Among the various subjects covered are the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very big tariffs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the US will impose on $50bn of Chinese exports. Trump said: The trade war was started many years ago by them and the United States lost It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official. Donald Trump has given the green light to a 25% tariff on $50bn of goods imported from China. The tariffs will apply to a total of 1,102 products and will be divided into two parts, the White House has confirmed. The first set of tariffs will apply to $34bn of Chinese imports, on 818 product lines, effective from 6 July. The second set will apply to $16bn of imports, on 284 product lines. More soon. The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to cut the maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) from \u00c2\u00a3100 to \u00c2\u00a32 will not take effect until 2020, it has emerged. Tom Watson, deputy leader of the Labour Party and shadow culture secretary, said the government was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pathetic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after bookmakers persuaded the government to delay the introduction of the new rules. He added: Capitulating to a two-year delay is a pathetic move from a fundamentally weak government. Those who praised the government when the announcement was made will feel badly let down. They are already rolling back on their promises and allowing these machines to ruin more lives. Gamblers stand to lose an extra \u00c2\u00a34bn in the intervening period, based on the average \u00c2\u00a31.8bn a year in revenues taken by the machines, which critics say are highly addictive and allow huge losses to rack up quickly. Read our full story here: Craig Erlam at currency firm Oanda, says the prospect of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are causing a market wobble. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a relatively mixed start to trading in Europe on Friday and the US is on course to post small losses at the open, as the focus shifts from central banks back to trade. US President Donald Trump is expected to announce tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports today that will once again stoke fears of a trade war and protectionist policies and likely trigger a response from the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy. Trump has been picking fights with a number of countries on trade in an attempt to address the large deficit the US runs and China is clearly his primary target. Markets will always be vulnerable to trade spats between countries and while the response to the G7 meeting may have been quite muted, that is more likely a sign that such an outcome was in line with expectations than markets becoming less sensitive to it. The biggest concern here is naturally that this will continue to escalate and more and more counter-tariffs will be imposed, something that will harm all economies and weigh on investor sentiment. Investors across Europe are feeling less chirpy as they await confirmation of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to impose tariffs on $50bn of Chinese imports. France is bucking the trend: FTSE 100: -0.8% at 7,707 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.1% at 13,098 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.2% at 5,541 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -1.1% at 22,249 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -1.1% at 9,844 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.3% at 392 Eurozone inflation jumped to 1.9% in May from 1.3% in April, Eurostat confirmed in its final estimate. The figures appear to add weight to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest inflation forecasts, which were revised up on Thursday, to 1.7% in both 2018 and 2019, from 1.4% previously. Here is how May annual inflation rates compare across the EU: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign ministry has said this morning that Beijing will respond swiftly to any US tariffs, as Donald Trump prepares to unveil revisions to his initial tariff list targeting $50 billion of Chinese goods. The euro is heading for its biggest weekly loss in 19 months after Mario Draghi, president of the ECB, said there would be no rate hike in the eurozone until after the summer of 2019. The currency is up 0.2% against the dollar at $1.1591, but on track for the worst week since November 2016. McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is the latest company to ditch plastic straws, with plans to them with the paper version in all its UK and Ireland restaurants from September. The fast food giant currently uses 1.8 million straws a day in the UK, and said it was responding to what customers wanted by moving away from the single-use plastic straw. Companies are under mounting pressure to find alternatives to single use plastic products that are polluting the oceans and harming wildlife. Paul Pomroy, chief executive of McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK and Ireland, said: Reflecting the broader public debate, our customers told us they wanted to see a move on straws but to do so without compromising their overall experience when visiting our restaurants. Over the past few months we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been working closely with supplier partners to find a solution that works both for our customers, and that the supply is there given the size of our business. The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambitious plans, combined with strong customer opinion, has helped to accelerate the move away from plastic and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m proud that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been able to play our part in helping to achieve this societal change. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says Tesco had managed to shrug off the malaise facing the wider retail sector: Tesco had a confident start to the year, despite the Beast from the East, and maintained its sales momentum into a tenth consecutive quarter. The recently acquired Booker business flaunted a sparking performance in the first few months of the year, and is already looking like a nice little growth engine for Tesco. Booker is now benefiting from the Tesco distribution network, a good example of how [chief executive] Dave Lewis intends to wring \u00c2\u00a3200 million of annual synergies out of combining the two businesses. Tesco is one of the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top performer this morning, at a near four-year high of 255p. Tesco shares are up 2% this morning at a near four-year high of 255p. Investors have been cheered by the news that sales at the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest supermarket rose for a 10th consecutive quarter in the 13 weeks to 26 May (Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first quarter). Sales at stores open for more than a year rose 1.8%, as trading improved after the snow disruption of the beginning of the period. Tesco completed the \u00c2\u00a34bn takeover of Booker, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest wholesaler, in March. Dave Lewis, Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, gave his assessment: Our growth plans are on track and we are pleased with the momentum in the business. We remain well-placed to serve our customers better and deliver on our medium-term financial ambitions. We are delighted with initial progress on Booker, and are focused on delivering the synergy benefits that our merger brings. Trading is underway in Europe and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mixed picture so far. Markets were boosted on Thursday by the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revelation that it would phase out its bond-buying programme by the end of this year. Investors continue to digest the move - which came earlier than expected - this morning. As it stands, European shares are on course for their best week in more than three months. Here are the latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,771 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: 0.3% at 13,142 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.4% at 5,551 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.3% at 22,416 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.2% at 9,936 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.2% at 394 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The prospect of a trade world between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies is back in the spotlight as Donald Trump is expected to say today that he will press ahead with tariffs on $50bn of Chinese imports. Trump gave the green light at a meeting of his top trade advisors on Thursday. Reuters reports: Trump is due to unveil revisions to his initial tariff list targeting $50 billion of Chinese goods on Friday. The list will contain 800 product categories, down from 1,300 previously. Trump no longer believes that Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s influence over North Korea is a compelling reason to ease up on trade talks now that his administration has opened up a direct line of communication with the nuclear-armed country, [an] administration official said. Beijing has reiterated that it will respond \u00e2\u20ac\u0153appropriately\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to any measures imposed by the US. Also coming up Tesco has reported a 1oth consecutive quarter of rising sales, despite snow disruption at the beginning of the period and a gloomy consumer backdrop. More on that soon.

After a terrible 2016, which saw full-time employment go backwards, 2017 boomed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the largest increase in the percentage of adults working full-time in a calendar year observed since the bureau of statistics started recording labour force figures on a monthly basis in 1978. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/04/best-of-comment-is-free-australia-subscribe-by-email\">\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4160\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for the best of Guardian Australia opinion\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email of editors' picks\" data-form-campaign-code=\"AU_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up.\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Not surprisingly the government is loathe to let go of the year as the main reference point. </p> <p>For example the minister for jobs and innovation, Senator Michaelia Cash, <a href=\"http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansards%2Fb85e71d5-2553-4839-9ed8-7d251c360afa%2F0096%22\">referred to it last month when she boasted to parliament</a> of 2017 being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the strongest year of jobs growth on record.

In seasonally adjusted terms, the number of full-time jobs since December has actually fallen.</p> <p>And with the fall also goes the likelihood \u00e2\u20ac\u201c however slight it already was \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of wages growth improving anytime soon. </p> <p>While the drop in unemployment to 5.4% is always welcome (although in trend terms the rate has been at 5.5% now for 10 straight months), more and more (as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/aug/22/why-unemployment-is-no-longer-the-best-indicator-of-the-economys-health\">I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve noted</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/jun/19/higher-wages-would-be-nice-mr-lowe-but-weak-unions-make-it-unlikely\">over the past</a> <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-17/jericho-falling-unemployment-rate-masks-the-real-worry/6549272\">three years</a>) the level of underemployment is the crucial measure. </p> <p>In May the underemployment rate rose to 8.5% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c still down on the record high of 8.9% reached at the start of 2017, but after falling for a year it is now trending the wrong way. </p> <p>Once upon a time this would not have been a major concern. If the unemployment rate fell, then so too would the underemployment rate. </p> <p>Now, not so much.</p> <p>Back in February 2013 when the unemployment rate was also at 5.4%, the underemployment rate was just 7.3% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that is a difference of around 160,000 more people being underemployed.</p> <p>That is a lot of extra spare capacity in the labour market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c people who would take more hours over a pay rise. </p> <p>The issue for the government as it seeks to go to an election trying to persuade voters they are better off now than they were in 2016 or 2013 is that not only is wages growth unlikely to improve while underemployment remains high, the economy has changed such that even should the situation improve, wages will likely go up by less than we would have once expected. </p> <p>The Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe noted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/13/australias-bank-chief-warns-low-wages-growth-will-hurt-economy\">in a speech</a> this week that while there were cyclical issues at play that were keeping wages growth down, there were also structural changes to the economy. Chief among these was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153changes in the bargaining power of workers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an increase in the supply of workers as the global economy becomes increasingly integrated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. </p> <p>The two are connected. </p> <p>It is not migration numbers per se that is the issue, but that temporary workers brought in are being done so by companies seeking to ensure lower levels of unionised labour and higher levels of non-permanent staffing, which combined reduces the capacity for workers to argue for higher wages. </p> <p>In effect the system is changing to keep underemployment high in order to ensure that wages growth remains low. </p> <p>And that is just how businesses like it. </p> <p>Heck, the mouthpiece for the business in the media, <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/opinion/editorials/the-real-news-about-wages-and-fairness-in-australian-economy-20180614-h11eac\">the Australian Financial Review</a> this week editorialised that those worried about low wages growth were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whingeing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and workers should be happy given the solid wages growth they got during the mining boom (yes, a decade ago).</p> <p>I guess the governor of the Reserve Bank must now be included as one of those whingers. He noted that the long period of low wages growth \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is diminishing our sense of shared prosperity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it is clear that the slow growth in wages is affecting our economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>In the old days the solution was higher productivity. But even here the issue is tied with Lowe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talk of the global supply of workers.

                "bodyText":"The news was not good this week for those hoping for an end to the weak wages growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c weakening employment figures suggest little chance of wages growth improving, and a speech by the head of the Reserve Bank suggests the problem is unlikely to be improved soon. Last year was certainly a good one for jobs. After a terrible 2016, which saw full-time employment go backwards, 2017 boomed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the largest increase in the percentage of adults working full-time in a calendar year observed since the bureau of statistics started recording labour force figures on a monthly basis in 1978. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday Not surprisingly the government is loathe to let go of the year as the main reference point. For example the minister for jobs and innovation, Senator Michaelia Cash, referred to it last month when she boasted to parliament of 2017 being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the strongest year of jobs growth on record. In excess of 415,000 more jobs were created and, colleagues, three-quarters of those jobs were full-time jobs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The prime minister on 31 May also told parliament, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come a long way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c record jobs growth last year, 415,000 jobs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But alas, 2018 has not been as good. The latest labour force figures out this week showed that rather than the 415,000 figure of 2017, the past 12 months has seen just 303,900 more people employed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c still a solid result, but certainly no longer the record-breaking number the government was once able to talk about. The picture gets worse when we turn to full-time employment. In seasonally adjusted terms, the number of full-time jobs since December has actually fallen. And with the fall also goes the likelihood \u00e2\u20ac\u201c however slight it already was \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of wages growth improving anytime soon. While the drop in unemployment to 5.4% is always welcome (although in trend terms the rate has been at 5.5% now for 10 straight months), more and more (as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve noted over the past three years) the level of underemployment is the crucial measure. In May the underemployment rate rose to 8.5% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c still down on the record high of 8.9% reached at the start of 2017, but after falling for a year it is now trending the wrong way. Once upon a time this would not have been a major concern. If the unemployment rate fell, then so too would the underemployment rate. Now, not so much. Back in February 2013 when the unemployment rate was also at 5.4%, the underemployment rate was just 7.3% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that is a difference of around 160,000 more people being underemployed. That is a lot of extra spare capacity in the labour market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c people who would take more hours over a pay rise. The issue for the government as it seeks to go to an election trying to persuade voters they are better off now than they were in 2016 or 2013 is that not only is wages growth unlikely to improve while underemployment remains high, the economy has changed such that even should the situation improve, wages will likely go up by less than we would have once expected. The Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe noted in a speech this week that while there were cyclical issues at play that were keeping wages growth down, there were also structural changes to the economy. Chief among these was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153changes in the bargaining power of workers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an increase in the supply of workers as the global economy becomes increasingly integrated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The two are connected. It is not migration numbers per se that is the issue, but that temporary workers brought in are being done so by companies seeking to ensure lower levels of unionised labour and higher levels of non-permanent staffing, which combined reduces the capacity for workers to argue for higher wages. In effect the system is changing to keep underemployment high in order to ensure that wages growth remains low. And that is just how businesses like it. Heck, the mouthpiece for the business in the media, the Australian Financial Review this week editorialised that those worried about low wages growth were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whingeing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and workers should be happy given the solid wages growth they got during the mining boom (yes, a decade ago). I guess the governor of the Reserve Bank must now be included as one of those whingers. He noted that the long period of low wages growth \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is diminishing our sense of shared prosperity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it is clear that the slow growth in wages is affecting our economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In the old days the solution was higher productivity. But even here the issue is tied with Lowe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talk of the global supply of workers. It is not just about temporary workers coming here, but businesses being able to offshore workers in order to reduce labour costs in work that once was considered imperative to be done by local workers. And technology in the past was also seen as the answer for driving higher productivity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c better machines to enable workers to produce more. But now we see reports that are not about improving labour productivity but reducing labour. This week, Business Insider\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul Colgan reported on analysis which estimated that automation could enable the big four banks to cut 40,000 workers over the next five to 10 years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or around 25% of their staff. Hardly the type of productivity growth that is going to lead to better wages or household incomes. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a great story, and it is why as we get closer to the election the government will need to explain why in the face of evidence to the contrary, voters should believe their predictions that wages growth will soon improve. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an argument that in some ways echoes the labour market itself. Being underemployed is better than being unemployed, and voters are more likely to be patient for better wages if employment is growing well and unemployment is falling. But if the jobs growth continues to slow it will more and more feel to workers like they have seen the best the government can deliver, and that best did not include an improved standard of living. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

                "bodyText":"Investors have been rattled by the escalation of the trade dispute between the US and China, pushing stock markets lower once more. On top of that come concerns about the political situation in Germany, with the issue of immigration putting pressure on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition government. But signs of optimism over the issue has seen markets come off their worst levels. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished virtually unchanged, down just 0.03% or 2.58 points at 7631.33 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.36% to 12,834.11 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.93% at 5450.48 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.41% to 22,099.27 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.83% lower at 9769.4 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 168 points or 0.67%. Elsewhere, on a quiet day for corporate and economic news, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bosses warned the UK economy was facing its weakest growth since 2009, a bigger UK challenger bank emerged as Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank Group took over Virgin Money, and the boss of VW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Audi division was arrested following the Dieselgate scandal. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Global markets have started the week on a weak footing, as trade fears continue to play the primary role in determining market sentiment. With both the US and China set to impose a raft of tariffs on 6 July, there is likely to be an increasingly unstable and anxious market environment as we progress towards that deadline.... However, equally as important is the huge uncertainty we are seeing build in Germany, with Angela Merkel clashing with the leader of their coalition partner (CSU) over her stance on immigration. It is no doubt that immigration remains Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Achilles heel, and with the chancellor desperate to maintain a coalition to maintain her dominance over German politics, markets are understandably jittery at the thought of any political upheaval in the biggest economy in Europe. Markets are still in the red, amid US-China trade fears and worries about the political situation in Germany. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Things got pretty ugly after the US open, the Dow Jones following in the footsteps of its Eurozone peers by posting some heavy losses. The Dow plunged 240 points as the session got underway, a sharp decline that took it back below 24850 and to its worst price in 12 days. The index is struggling under the weight of the escalating US-China trade war, with Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to push forward with tariffs on Beijing last Friday causing another nasty flare-up of international posturing. The Eurozone indices, softened up by the trade war stuff, found themselves incredibly susceptible to the political problems in Germany, with the clash between the CDU and CSU bloodying the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading rooms. The DAX dropped 1.8%, wiping out the post-ECB growth seen last week, and leaving it struggling to hold above 12800; the CAC was in-step with its German sibling, falling 1.6%, with the IBEX down 1.1% and the FTSE MIB slipping 0.6%. Though still at its worst intraday price since the end of May, shedding half a percent to return to 7600, the FTSE managed to avoid the pain seen elsewhere. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely because Brent Crude rebounded by 1.3%, lifting BP and Shell alongside it, while the pound fell 0.3% against both the dollar and the euro as it speculates about Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England meeting. The pound has come under pressure amid the latest Brexit developments - peers are currently debating the EU withdrawal bill which can be followed in our politics live blog - and ahead of the latest Bank of England meeting on Thursday. With the Bank widely expected to leave interest rates on hold, the pound has slipped 0.32% against the dollar to $1.3240 having earlier fallen as low as $1.3227. Dan Smith, investment analyst at Thomas Miller Investment, said: The Bank of England (BoE) holds a monetary policy meeting this Thursday (21 June) and is widely expected to make no change to interest rates. Incoming data continues to show that the UK economy is not firing on all cylinders. Consumer spending, employment and business confidence surveys have been fairly solid and supportive of growth, whilst industrial production and manufacturing have been exceptionally weak. The minutes of the meeting will be closely scrutinised to see whether policy members sit on the optimistic or pessimistic side of the fence in regards to recent data, with the tone of the minutes likely to set expectations over the possibility of an interest rate rise in August. The increased trade tensions between the US and China continue to unnerve investors, with Wall Street falling sharply at the open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 238 points or 0.95% while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both opened almost 0.7% lower. Elsewhere the oil price is heading higher ahead of a key meeting of Opec later this week. Brent crude is currently up 1% at $74.18 a barrel, recovering some of its recent losses. Saudi Arabia and Russia had been widely expected to agree to increase production, boosting supplies and lowering prices. But talk that this may not happen after all - or perhaps not by as much as previously expected - has halted the slide in crude. On top of that, the escalation of the trade dispute between the US and China has also helped lift prices by raising new concerns about its effect on global growth, and thus demand for oil. The arrest of Audi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive does not mean the truth about Dieselgate is any closer, says consumer rights law firm Your Lawyers, which is leading the steering committe for a group litigation order against Volkswagen. The firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director Aman Johal said: Audi CEO Rupert Stadler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest and investigation over fraud and false advertising indicates that we may still be no closer to the full extent of the truth behind the Volkswagen Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dieselgate scandal. Stadler is one of 20 suspects being investigated at Audi for false claims about its diesel vehicles. Perhaps the widening probes will lead to greater clarity on how the automotive giant was able to cheat customers around the world, and which individuals within the VW Group are personally responsible. There are around 60,000 people in the UK that are calling for justice against Volkswagen as part of a class action claim that our firm is on the Steering Committee for, but owners only have until 26 October 2018 to make their case. Unless Volkswagen chooses to do the right thing by its customers and pay compensation, we will pursue them for justice in the High Court. We will be closely monitoring Stadler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case and will continue to fight for justice for Volkswagen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victims. German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports that Audi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board will soon appoint an interim chief executive, following Rupert Stadler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest this morning. The appointment will be made at a supervisory board meeting convened at short notice on Monday. Audi insists that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the presumption of innocence remains in place for Mr. Stadler\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but the company also recognises that an interim replacement is now needed. More here The Volkswagen emissions scandal centred on the use of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153defeat devices,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which allowed VW cars to recognise when they were being tested in the lab and enter a low-emissions mode. Otherwise, they would generate more pollution than permitted under EU and US rules, but also provide higher performance. Volkswagen tied to pin the blame on a couple of rogue software engineers, but prosecutors believe the scandal runs deeper. Last summer, VW engineer James Liang was jailed for 40 months in America, and fined $200,000, after admitting helping to design software to cheat US emission tests. Liang had led VW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Diesel Competence unit in the US. Associated Press reports that 20 people are under suspicion in the Audi probe, adding: Volkswagen has pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the United States and nine managers, including former CEO Martin Winterkorn, were charged there. Two are serving prison terms; Winterkorn and the others remained in Germany and are unlikely to be extradited. German news agency DPA is reporting that German prosecutors arrested Rupert Stadler on fears that he might undermine the ongoing investigation into the VW diesel emissions scandal. The investigation is focused on claims that Audi sold at least 210,000 diesel-engine cars fitted with cheat software in the United States and Europe over several years. Last summer, Audi diesel engine engineer Giovanni Pamio was arrested by Munich\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prosecutors, and then charged by US authorities over the scandal. Shares in Volkswagen have fallen 2% in Frankfurt, following Stadler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest (Audi is one of VW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest divisions) More details of Audi CEO Rupert Stadler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest are coming in. He was detained at his home in Ingolstadt, the Bavarian city, in the early hours of this morning, prosecutors say. This makes Stadler the most senior Volkswagen executives arrested since the German carmaker was caught rigging diesel emission tests. The Munich prosecutor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As part of an investigation into diesel affairs and Audi engines, the Munich prosecutor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office executed an arrest warrant against Mr Professor Rupert Stadler on June 18, 2018,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: Over in Germany, the boss of automaker Audi has been arrested by police investigating the emissions scandal. Audi chief executive Rupert Stadler was detained this morning, according to parent company Volkswagen. A VW spokesman told Reuters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We confirm that Mr Stadler was arrested this morning. The hearing to determine whether he will be remanded is ongoing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The arrest comes a week after prosecutors raided Stadler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apartment, as they widened the investigation into how Volkswagen used \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccheat software\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in its cars to trick emissions tests. Last month, Audi admitted that another 60,000 A6 and A7 models with diesel engines have emission software issues -- further deepening a scandal that began in 2015. David Madden, CMC Markets analyst, says investors are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153caught in the middle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between the US and China. Stock markets are broadly lower today as traders are increasingly worried about the prospect of a trade war. Tensions between the US and China are escalating, and we are not any closer to an agreement being reached. We are expecting the Dow Jones to open down 115 points at 24,975 and we are calling the S&amp;P 500 down 9 points at 2,770. Back in the UK, the takeover battle for Virgin Money is over -- putting hundreds of jobs at risk. Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank Group (CYBG) has sealed a \u00c2\u00a31.7bn deal to merge with Virgin, turning two small challenger banks into one larger one. The move could be a blow to the North East economy, where Virgin owns many of Northern Rock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets. My colleague Julia Kollowe explains: Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank Group (CYBG) and Virgin Money have agreed to create the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sixth-largest bank, with 6 million personal and small business customers and total lending of \u00c2\u00a370bn. The banks expect to make \u00c2\u00a3120m of annual savings by by 2021 by reducing overlap between their operations. This will result in a 16% reduction in the combined group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 9,500-strong workforce that CYBG hopes to achieve by attrition \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that is, when people leave they will not be replaced. It declined to say how many of the combined group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 250 branches will be closed. However, the plan is to retain Virgin Money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head office in Gosforth, Newcastle, for at least three years. More here: European stock markets have started the week on the back foot, as fears of a global trade war intensify. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest companies, has dropped by 0.5% after America and China imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on Friday. Chinese media have launched a stinging attack on Trump, calling his government \u00e2\u20ac\u0153selfish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rude\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for imposing new charges on imports from China China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Global Times said Beijing had no choice but to retaliate: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It reinforces the difference in images of the two countries: one challenges the foundation of global trade through sudden attacks; and one that is prepared to defend itself in a trade war that it cannot avoid.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, Head of Investment at interactive investor, says markets are finally beginning to wake up to the risks of a global trade war. The negotiating style of President Trump had allowed investors to assume that his threats were hyperbole and part of his unique diplomatic style, and that he would step away from the brink rather than risk undermining the positive impact his previous policies have had on the stock market. However, the US decision to press forward and take on China makes the risks far more pronounced and the real danger is that the Chinese retaliation may start a chain reaction that is difficult to stop \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially as Trump likes to have the last word. The current position on tariffs is unlikely to cause a full-blown rout for markets, but the prospect of further escalation and reprisals could cause considerable damage to the global economy, increasing the risks and anxiety. In another sign of economic weakness, London house prices have fallen for the 10th month in a row. Rightmove reports that asking prices in the capital are down 0.9% compared with May, and are 1.0% lower than a year ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the 10th monthly fall in a row, as the once-hot London property market continues to cool. London is particularly vulnerable to the threat of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as tens of thousands of financial jobs could be lost. Prices have dropped particularly sharply in the centre over the last 12 months (although the average property is still priced north of \u00c2\u00a31.3m). Property prices in the north are still rising, though, helping to push the national asking price up by 0.4% this month. Lack of supply in Northern areas is helping to keep prices up, says Miles Shipside, Rightmove director and housing market analyst: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The reduction in property choice for buyers in the north compared to a year ago is a result of property for sale being snapped up, meaning it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more of a sellers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 market there. In marked contrast the jump in buyer choice in southern regions shows there are signs of a sellers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 market in some areas.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here are all the key points from the British Chamber of Commerce\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new economic forecasts: UK GDP growth forecast for 2018 is downgraded from 1.4% to 1.3%, down from 1.5% to 1.4% in 2019, rising to 1.6% in 2020 (unchanged) Quarter-on-quarter GDP growth is forecast to rise by 0.4% in Q2 2018, from 0.1% growth in Q1. Growth in household consumption for 2018 is expected to slow to 1.0%, before rising to 1.4% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020 Inflation will continue to ease, but will not fall below the 2% target until 2020. The next interest rate rise, by 0.25%, is forecast to occur in Q4 2018, followed by a further increase to 1.0% in Q2 2019, with no further rises expected over the remainder of the forecast period Unemployment will remain at 4.4% in 2018, rising to 4.5% in 2019 and 2010 Average earnings growth will continue to slightly outpace inflation over the forecast period, with growth of 2.7%, 2.9%, and 3.0%, compared with inflation of 2.5%, 2.3%, and 1.9% Export growth of 2.8% in 2018, 2.9% in 2019, and 2.9% in 2020 is expected. This compares with import growth of 1.7% in 2018, 2.5% in 2019, and 3.0% in 2020 Growth in the construction sector is expected to slow significantly in 2018, with 0.7% growth, compared to 5.7% in 2017. The sector picks up slightly in the remainder of the forecast period, with 1.3% and 1.5% in 2019 and 2020 respectively Services sector growth is expected to slow to 1.2% in 2018, before picking up to 1.5% in 2019 and 1.9% in 2020 Business investment is expected to remain weak, with growth across the forecast period of 0.9% in 2018, 1.2% in 2019, and 1.7% in 2020 The BCC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy forecasts could actually be too optimistic, if the Brexit process ends messily or if Donald Trump manages to create a full-blown trade war. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, explains that the UK is vulnerable to external shocks: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While Brexit uncertainty and the weakness in sterling have weighed on overall UK growth, it is the failure to deal with the longstanding structural issues from weak productivity to the deep imbalances in the UK economy that continue to undermine the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth potential. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The risks to the outlook are on the downside. A messy departure from the EU would likely slow UK GDP growth further over the medium term. The prospect of an escalating trade war is now a key downside risk to our forecast as it could mean much weaker export and business investment growth than implied by the current forecast. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain is facing its weakest growth since the financial crisis, as uncertainty over Brexit and fears of a global trade war hit confidence. So warns the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), which has just downgraded its growth forecast for the UK. It fears that consumer spending, business investment and trade are all weakening, leading to weak wage growth and stretched households. In short, Britain is trapped in a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctorpor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, it warns, with growth expect to fall to just 1.3% this year. That would be the weakest performance since 2009 (down from a previous forecast of 1.4%). The service sector is expected to struggle, with growth slowing to 1.2% in 2018 (that would be the weakest outturn since 2010.) The BCC has also cut its forecast for 2019 from 1.5% to 1.4%. It predicts that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net trade position will weaken in the next few years, as exporters struggle but imports pick up. Adam Marshall, director general of the BCC, says the government must act to help businesses through the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctesting times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ahead: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A decade on from the start of the financial crisis, the UK now faces another extended period of weak growth amidst a backdrop of both domestic and global uncertainty. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our forecast should serve as a wake-up call to government - as it demonstrates that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbusiness as usual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is not an option when it comes to the economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With firms facing ongoing Brexit uncertainty, increasing global protectionism and instability in some parts of the world that will impact on costs and profits, now is the time for more robust action to support business confidence and investment. Marshall also warns that MPs can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply fixate on Brexit, given the other problems in the country: Businesses across the country want to see far more urgency around fixing the fundamentals here at home and a concerted effort to lower the high costs of doing business. Also coming up today... Tensions between the US and China are rising, after president Trump approved tariffs on $50bn of Chinese goods last Friday. China swiftly hit back by imposing its own tariffs on US products. These geopolitical tensions are weighing on the markets; Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stoxx 500 index has dropped by 0.3% in early trading after losses in Asia. European investors should also keep an eye on Germany, where a deepening row over migration could bring down the government. Angela Merkel is refusing to bow to pressure from her own interior minister to turn away asylum-seekers who have registered in other European countries. Merkel hopes to find a Europe-wide solution, but pressure is building on the chancellor. Otherwise it looks like a quiet day, leaving the City free to anticipate England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening World Cup game (KO: 7pm BST).",

                "bodyText":"The escalation of the potential trade war between the US and China following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat of new tariffs on $200bn worth of goods has sent a shudder through the markets. With Wall Street lower - and the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing all its gains so far this year - European markets have ended the day in downbeat mood. The FTSE 100 was among the better performers, helped ironically by sterling hitting a seven month low. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 0.36% or 27.48 points to 7603.85 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.22% to 12,677.97 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.1% at 5390.63 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.07% to 22,084.33 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.14% lower at 9755.4 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 342 points or 1.37%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. More on Navarro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, from Associated Press: The White House is not planning any imminent talks with China on the trade dispute, the FT is reporting (\u00c2\u00a3). Peter Navarro, a senior US trade adviser told reporters on a press call that China had been given a chance to address US complaints over the past year, and no more discussions were planned. The prospect of US mid-term elections could determine how the trade dispute plays out, with some suggesting Trump will continue to play hardball to prove to the voters that he is still putting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153America first.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But this could backfire. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said: The only potential stop for Trump could be the reality of mid term elections. A large percentage of the US population are not going to be happy about paying more for imported goods. This is a long shot and still sufficient time away for damage to the markets to continue, however it could also prevent this trade war from spiralling out of control. Here are some major US companies with trade links to China: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the market losses following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s escalation of the trade dispute with China: US stock markets fell sharply on Tuesday morning, following similar drops across the world, as investors feared that escalating tensions could trigger an international trade war. Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional $200bn in levies on Chinese goods on Monday evening, days after the US announced $50bn in tariffs aimed at punishing what the US administration sees as unfair trade practices. China has already said it will retaliate for last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move and said it would escalate its response if further tariffs were imposed. Monday night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move sent global stock markets sharply lower and the Dow followed suit when it opened, dropping over 340 points (1.37%) in early trading. The S&amp;P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq also fell close to 1%. Some of the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest exporters were among those most affected. Boeing dropped 3% and construction and mining equipment maker Caterpillar shed 2.7%. Tech companies, too, felt the pinch with Apple down 1.5%. The full story is here: US markets continue to fall, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down more than 400 points or 1.6%. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: There was no let up on Tuesday, the US open extending the disastrous trading that began on Monday. Plunging 400 points to hit a 2 week nadir, the Dow Jones was the latest index to display its abject terror at the trade war Donald Trump seems intent on provoking. The Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s day was made worse by the strength of the dollar; though the greenback struggled against the yen, it stomped all over the euro and the pound, sending the single currency and sterling to 19 day and 7 month lows respectively. Over in the Eurozone, where political issues in Germany cut the legs out from under the region on Monday, the situation was just as nasty. The DAX shed 200 points for the 2nd consecutive session, leaving it on track for its worst close since the start of May, while the CAC lost 1.5%. It was cable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.6% fall that arguably helped the FTSE avoid the kind of gory losses seen by its US and Eurozone peers. Though hardly something to celebrate, the UK index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.5% decline was nevertheless half of its post-open drop, and roughly a third of the losses incurred elsewhere. Emerging markets are also under pressure as the fears of a trade war grow. A US tech industry group is very unhappy about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned tariffs, saying they raise prices for Americans, harm US competitiveness, and will hinder economic growth. Jose Castaneda, spokesman for the Information Technology Industry Council, said: The Trump Administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to escalate trade tensions with China is irresponsible and counterproductive. We appreciate President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to protect the United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccrown jewels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but tariffs are simply the wrong way to do it. Tariffs will harm U.S. workers and businesses from Silicon Valley to Silicon Prairie. The White House needs to work with our allies to create lasting change with China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c too many jobs and livelihoods are at stake to get this wrong. A trade war which would benefit no one may not actually happens, says Chris Payne, managing director at GWM Investment Management: Despite all this tit-for-tat posturing, an all-out trade war is unlikely to ensue because it will not benefit anybody, especially China whose economy is going through a major deleveraging process. It should also be noted that China will soon run out of US goods on which to impose retaliatory tariffs which will move this negotiation to a more sensible and constructive forum. Although as noted previously, China could slap higher tariffs than 10% if it really wanted to push back at Trump. Fears of an escalation in the trade tensions between the US and China have sent US markets sharply lower at the open. President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose a 10% tariff on $200m of Chinese goods has led to new warnings from Beijing that it would retaliate. So the growing prospect of an all out trade war, and the damage that would cause to the global economy, has sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down around 1.3% in early trading. This means the Dow has given up all its gains of the year. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have also opened in the red. Meanwhile the Vix index of volatility hit a two week high of 14.67 before recovering to 14.18, still up 15% on the day so far. Time for a recap, as investors brace for the Wall Street open, in just over 10 minutes. Stock markets around the globe are suffering losses after Donald Trump took another step towards a trade war. Overnight, Trump instructed US officials to draw up plans for tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports, in the latest tit-for-tat move between the two countries. Trump said he was acting because China had outlined $50bn of tariffs on US products over the weekend [a response to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original tariffs laid out earlier this year]. China hit back, accusing the US of blackmail. The Commerce Ministry declared: This practice of extreme pressure and blackmail deviates from the consensus reached by two parties through many negotiations, and it also disappointed the international community. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the U.S. side becomes irrational and issues the list, China will have to adopt measures that are comprehensive measures in quantity and quality in order to make strong countermeasures.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The move rocked markets in Asia, sending Chinese stocks reeling to their lowest level since summer 2016. Equities in other regions also fell, as investors dumped riskier assets and economists warned a trade war would hurt growth. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 slumped by 80 points at the open, but has currently clawed back half of those losses. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the situation: FTSE 100: down 0.5% German DAX: Down 1.2% French CAC: down 1.1% Japanese Nikkei: closed down 1.8% Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng: closed down 2.8% China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite: closed down 3.8% Commodities, such as oil, wheat and soybeans, have also fallen. There is also drama in the foreign exchange markets, with most currencies falling against the US dollar. Sterling has fallen through $1.32 for the first time since November 2017. Analysts fear that the world could be heading towards a trade war, unless the US and China can ratchet the pressure down again. Miles Eakers, Chief Market Analyst at global payments firm Centtrip, says investors are right to worry. Any retaliation by Beijing is likely to fuel the escalating trade war with Washington, which will in turn have a negative impact on equities and increase risk aversion. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors are not the only ones troubled by the current situation. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest superpowers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shift towards protectionism has global ramifications. International companies may grow less competitive due to tariffs and the cost of raw materials purchased overseas could rise by 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c20%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly possible that any further action from the US or China could put an end to the current 10-year bull market run.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yuan has fallen to its lowest level against the U.S. dollar in more than five months today, as trade tensions escalated between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. Reuters has the details: The yuan opened onshore trade at 6.4450 per dollar, and weakened to a low of 6.4754 at one point. It ended at 6.4743 by the official close of domestic trading in the late afternoon, the weakest such close since Jan.11. If it ends the late night session at the same level, it would have lost nearly 0.6 percent against the dollar for the day, its worst daily performance since Jan.6, 2017. Beijing controls the value of the yuan closely, which means it could use its currency to retaliate against America. A weaker yuan makes Chinese exports more attractive overseas, so could mediate the impact of tariffs. That might infuriate Donald Trump, though, who already thinks the yuan is unfairly weak..... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve put together a Q&amp;A on the US-China trade dispute: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Why is Trump imposing the tariffs? During the 2016 election campaign, Trump promised to protect American jobs and to renegotiate US trade deficits with countries around the world. The US has the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest trade deficit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning it buys more goods and services from other countries than it sells overseas \u00e2\u20ac\u201c worth $568bn last year. China is responsible for the bulk of the deficit in terms of goods, exporting $376bn more to the US than it bought from US producers. Raymond Ma, portfolio manager at Fidelity International, predicts that the trade battle between the US and China will hurt company profits - which likely leads to weaker wage growth and more job cuts. Ma warns that the situation could escalate further: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest development suggests the recent d\u00c3\u00a9tente in US-China trade talks has slipped. Indeed, recent months have seen economic relations between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies in a dance best characterised as two steps backwards for every step forwards. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The concern now is how China could retaliate against President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest action by increasing its own reciprocal tariffs. Such a move could push up input prices, which may prompt Chinese companies to either pass on the increased costs to consumers or allow them to eat into profits; neither outcome is favourable. Commodity prices are also sliding today. Oil is down 1.5%, sending the cost of a barrel of US crude down by one dollar to $64.87. That reflects concerns that a trade war would damage economic growth, leading to less demand for energy. US cotton and soybeans futures both fell by 2.5%, as traders calculate that American farmers could lose out badly. Last weekend, China announced retaliatory tariffs on US exports such as electric cars, soybeans and whiskey, in response to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original $50bn of tariffs -- a move that triggered Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new threat against $200bn of Chinese goods and services. The US stock market is expected to fall sharply when trading begins at 9.30am New York time (2.30pm BST). America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones industrial average is being called down 330 points, or 1.3%, as traders react to the latest twists in the trade spat between the US and China. Craig Erlam of financial trading firm OANDA says risk aversion is rising fast: With China showing no desire to be bullied into submission, with its Commerce Ministry promising to retaliate to any new tariffs and its Foreign Ministry reaffirming that while it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a trade war, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not afraid to engage in one, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to see how and when this ends. Moreover, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to fully grasp just how much damage will be done in the process, particularly with the European Union also drawing up counter-tariffs against the US. The clear escalation that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s occurred in recent days has shaken investors and appears to brought an end to the good run that US stock markets had been on since the start of May. While Chinese stocks are faring much worse at the moment, US companies are obviously not immune to a trade war and could come under more pressure unless both sides find a solution. The US dollar has hit its highest level in almost a year, as traders scramble to protect themselves from a trade war. The US dollar index (which measures the greenback against a basket of other currencies) has gained 0.5% today to levels last seen in July. Obviously the pound is one casualty, but the damage is wide-spread; the euro is down 0.6% at $1.155, the Australian dollar is down 0.8%, the Swedish krona shed 1.4% and the Indian rupee lost 0.5%. At first glance that may seem odd; if America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy will be hurt by tariffs, why is the dollar attractive? Answer: tariffs will drive US inflation up, forcing more interest rate rises to control the cost of living, making the dollar a higher-yielding asset. This capital flight out of emerging markets will cause serious pain. Any developing-market company which has issued debt in dollars, but earns revenue in its local currency, faces higher repayment costs. Emerging market policymakers may also be forced to hike interest rates to prop up their currencies, which will damage economic growth. Analyst group Oxford Economics has estimate that economic growth in the US and China would suffer a hit if reciprocal tariffs are imposed: They say: By threatening to impose 10% tariff on an additional US$200 billion of imports from China, President Trump has upped the ante on the trade conflict between the two. China has quickly vowed to retaliate - and if such an escalation does materialise, it would have significant economic impact on China, the US and the rest of the world, at a sensitive time for the global economy. In principle, there is still room for negotiation and we cannot rule out de-escalation in the coming weeks. But attitudes seem to be hardening. Meanwhile, deeper conflicts are also hard to resolve. Indeed, it looks like the probability of a full-blown trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies is rising. In terms of economic impacts, we estimate that 25% US tariffs on US$50 billion plus 10% tariffs on US$200 billion worth of imports from China, with one-to-one retaliation by China, would reduce real GDP growth in China and the US by about 0.3 percentage points and 0.2 percentage points, respectively, in 2019-20. Seema Shah, Senior Global Investment Strategist at Principal Global Investors, fears that the global economy will suffer as China and the US march towards a trade war. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest escalation in trade tensions between China and the United States should have investors worried. Recall that the original tariffs on about US $50 billion worth of Chinese imports motivated sharp declines in equity markets, despite not being expected to have a meaningful impact on the global economy. The latest ratcheting up in the trade dispute may trigger even more severe market turmoil. After all, not only will this latest round of tariffs have a direct negative impact on China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth outlook and the rest of the Asia region via the integration of global value chains, but China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inevitable retaliation will surely hurt the U.S. economy in turn. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Emerging markets have had to contend with a long line of challenges this year. Rising U.S. interest rates, the strengthening U.S. dollar and higher oil prices have already made it a tough six months, and this lurch towards protectionism will be felt most acutely in already vulnerable emerging market economies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Several experts are warning today that the US and China are heading towards a full-blooded trade war. With Trump threatening a swathe of fresh tariffs, and Beijing vowing to retaliate, the situation is escalating fast. Professor Davide Castellani, professor of international business at Henley Business School, warns that China could hurt large American firms, potentially turning US public opinion against the tariffs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The risk of an all-out trade war between the US and China is becoming more and more concrete. Both parties do not want to back down, because they would signal to the other party that they could use the threat of trade war in the future to further their negotiation position. However, in the long run, the US policy position may be weaker, since they are up for mid-term elections soon. When the effects of tariffs will unfold with higher prices for US consumers and possible disruptions in value chains, due to higher costs for intermediate inputs, the mood towards tariffs in the US might change. China is much less vulnerable to this threat, due to the nature of its political system. On top of this, China may resort to more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcqualitative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 measures that could make business more difficult for US firms in China. This will put further pressure on US Congress and Administration from large US MNEs [multi-national enterprises]. Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit in Singapore, warns that manufacturers across Asia could suffer badly from a US-China trade dispute. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The collateral damage from an escalating U.S.-China trade war will be widespread, hitting many Asian countries that are part of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing supply chain in sectors such as electrical and electronic products. Sean Callow, senior currency strategist at Australian bank Westpac, says investors are getting anxious: We are starting to see signs of deepening market concern now that we can effectively confirm that a bilateral trade war is under way between the US and China. There seems little doubt that the prevailing mood in global markets is that investors were a lot happier with US economic policy in 2017 when it was focused on tax cuts than in 2018 when it has switched to trade protectionism. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory bosses fear that fresh tariffs on Chinese imports will cost jobs. Kip Eideberg of the Association of Equipment Manufacturers says Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest threat is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrible news for equipment manufacturers in the United States\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He also points out that consumers will pay the price too: Trade war fears and Brexit uncertainty have combined to drag the pound down to a seven-month low. Sterling has dropped by half a cent against the US dollar to $1.319, the lowest since November 2016. Other currencies are also dropping against the US dollar, as traders seek a safe-haven asset. But the pound is also suffering from political angst; UK PM Theresa May faces a fresh showdown with rebel MPs who are demanding a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153meaningful vote\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit deal with the EU. Fiona Cincotta, Senior Market Analyst at City Index, says May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political challenges are hurting sterling: The dollar was one of the few assets benefiting from the Sino-US tensions and rose against a basket of currencies. The pound, however, was bogged down by domestic problems and declined below $1.32 for the first time since November. Theresa May continues to struggle to get any Brexit-related decision approved by the Parliament and a vote by the Lords is about to make her life even more difficult because it will require that the Commons approve any Brexit deal reached between the government and Brussels. Our Politics Live blog is tracking all the action: Asian tech firms who supply components to Apple have been hit hard today, due to fears that a trade war would hurt demand. Marketwatch has the details: IPhone-camera maker Cowell Holdings skidded 11.5% in Hong Kong to fresh record lows, while smartphone-lens maker Sunny Optical pulled back a further 5% and acoustics firm AAC Technologies fell 3.3%. In Taiwan, Sunny peer Largan Precision was off 5.2%. Apple product assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry dropped 2.3%. The selloff came despite a report that the Trump administration has told Apple that tariffs would not be placed on iPhones imported from China. CEO Tim Cook had told the White House that imposing tariffs against Chinese goods could hurt Apple. American consumers will feel the pain if Trump imposes 10% tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports, as he threatened last night. As Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale explains, such tariffs would be paid by customers in the US: $200bn of goods represents over a third of likely 2018 imports from China. The important point to note about the escalation, which will surely result in a Chinese response, is that while the tariffs imposed may be lower on the expanded range of goods, they will include more consumer goods, and therefore have a more direct impact on US consumers apart from anyone else. Away from the political implications, these tariffs will deliver higher prices to the US and weaker growth to China. In due course we will find out how Chinese policy-makers respond Asian stocks have hit a six-month low today, Bloomberg reports: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has suffered a late rout, as investors in Shanghai shivered at the prospect of fresh US tariffs. The benchmark Shanghai composite sank by 3.8% percent to close below the 3,000 mark at 2,906.43. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest level since late June 2016. Reuters reports that speculators were badly hit by the selloff: The slump risks triggering fresh margin calls in a highly-leveraged stock market, potentially causing a downward spiral that could derail Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to lure the listings of high-tech giants. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market is so fragile. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where the bottom is,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said David Dai, general manager of Shanghai Wisdom Investment Co Ltd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more rewarding watching the World Cup.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Elsewhere, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei ended down 1.7% while the Hong Kong Hang Seng index lose 2.8% European stock markets are a sea of red, as trade war fears ripple through the trading floors. DING DING: Shares are falling sharply in London at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 index of top shares has shed 1%, or 80 points, to 7551 - the lowest level since the start of May. The mood in the City is decidedly edgy, as traders worry that Donald Trump will trigger a full-blown trade war with China - with serious consequences for the global economy. Mining stocks are among the big fallers, with Anglo American losing 3% and Glencore down 2.6%. Technology firm Micro Focus has also shed almost 3%. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: Global sentiment is on the back foot amid signs that neither side will back down, potentially taking global commerce a step closer to an unwelcome trade war. It is impossible for China to retaliate in kind to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new threat. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because China imported $170bn from America in 2016 -- $115bn of goods and $55bn of services. So by threatening to impose 10% tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods, Trump is (deliberately?) putting a tit-for-tat response out of Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reach. However, China could technically impose a higher tariff on that $170bn, which would certainly escalate the situation even further. Simon Rabinovitch of The Economists explains: Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat has met with an immediate, chilly response from Beijing, implying that the US is losing the plot. The Ministry of Commerce in Beijing has vowed to hit back if the US actually imposes $200bn of fresh tariffs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the U.S. loses its senses and publishes such a list, China will have to take comprehensive quantitative and qualitative measures and retaliate forcefully. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Markets are sliding today after president Donald Trump escalated America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade dispute with China. Overnight, Trump threatened to impose a 10% tariff on $200bn of Chinese imports, a tit-fot-tat move that could trigger a full-blown trade war. Trump is angry that China is imposing tariffs on $50bn of US imports - in retaliation to his original tariffs on $50bn of Chinese goods. He wants Beijing to back down, or else he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll ratchet up the trade dispute between the two powers. The president declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unfortunately, China has determined that it will raise tariffs on $50 billion worth of United States exports. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Further action must be taken to encourage China to change its unfair practices, open its market to United States goods, and accept a more balanced trade relationship. China has already responded firmly, accusing Trump of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153blackmail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and promising \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong countermeasures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if America goes through with its $200bn threat. The news has sent Asian investors reeling. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has fallen by 2.7% and Japan is down 1.7% in a wide-ranging rout. European markets are expected to slide too, with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 called down 55 points (0.7%). Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says the City is increasingly worried about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach to trade: Things have changed overnight after President Trump upped the ante by threatening another $200bn worth of tariffs at a 10% rate on a whole new raft of Chinese goods and services, if China went ahead with their retaliation measures. This upping of the ante saw markets in Asia slide and unlike yesterday haven bond markets rallied as US treasury yields slid back, the Japanese yen gained and gold rallied. As such European markets look set to continue their losing streak and open lower.

Meanwhile evidence of rising demand came from the weekly US figures, which saw a 5.9m barrel decline, the biggest drop since mid-January. On the other hand there was a 3.3m barrel rise in gasoline stocks compared to expectations of a 1m fall.</p> <p>Brent is currently up 0.19% at $75.22 a barrel. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Crude oil is also in focus, with a whole raft of comments coming from OPEC member states ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big production decision. Despite an initial rebuttal of a production increase proposed by Russia (via Saudi Arabia), we are seeing a gradual shift in tone which will likely see some form of rise in output come Friday.</p> <p>For markets, the line in the sand seems to be the 1 million barrels a day level. Anything less than that will be seen as a compromise given the Saudi target is closer to 1.5 million barrels a day. We have seen the biggest drawdown in US crude inventories since January, but the impact has been offset by a rise in gasoline supply.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b2a72c3e4b06f2cac880075\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-20T15:29:23.616Z\">4.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our first take on the David Drumm sentencing:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/20/david-drumm-former-chief-of-anglo-irish-bank-sentenced-to-eight-years-in-jail\">David Drumm, former chief of Anglo Irish Bank, sentenced to eight years in jail</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b2a7115e4b06f2cac880056\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-20T15:22:57.727Z\">4.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jun/20/china-trump-trade-war-fears-grow-uk-factories-business-live?page=with:block-5b2a4196e4b06f2cac87fd7e#block-5b2a4196e4b06f2cac87fd7e\">the Anglo Irish case </a> and former chief executive David Drumm has been sentenced to eight years in jail for his part in the fraud, but will serve six with mitigating circumstances taken into account. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b2a64d4e4b06f2cac87ff9b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-20T14:30:44.506Z\">3.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Investor enthusiasm appears to be waning, with markets coming off their best levels.

There was little for the index to really work with on Wednesday, beyond the ever-looming threat of a full-blown trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. </p> <p>The Eurozone, which started the week poorly and then went downhill from there, saw its initial tame recovery gradually chipped away at until nothing was left. That means the DAX is back struggling to keep its head above 12700, while the CAC tumbled below 5400 after switching from a 0.3% rise to a 0.2% loss. </p> <p>Only the FTSE remained in the green with any real substance, and even then its 0.6% increase was half of the growth posted at lunchtime. Though the UK index broadly just followed the direction of trading from around the Western world, sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reversal of its initial losses also helped erase some of the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains.

This beats Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $35 all-cash, $65bn bid but we must assume that Comcast is ready to come back with an even stronger offer.</p> <p>This offer from Disney is probably a little bit stronger than expected and [Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] Iger will be looking to kill off Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid once and for all. However, the rationale for Comcast remains the same, the question is only how much debt it can afford to carry. If it gets its way total debt would rise to $170bn according to Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, with just $6bn in cash on its books. Disney will also take on Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $14bn debts, giving this bid an enterprise value of more than $85bn. </p> <p>Debt is a concern for investors here and points to market-top behaviour. The amount of debt both companies are prepared to assume is arguably a worry, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a case of innovate or die in the face of competition. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign of just how desperately these two legacy media groups want the assets of Fox. In their attempt to contend with cord cutters like Netflix they are risking leveraging themselves up to a degree that makes them susceptible should the current benign market conditions deteriorate. </p> <p>Sky shares are trading up 3% today at \u00c2\u00a313.82 on the news but they could go higher if Comcast really goes big. Even it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the appetite for all of Fox it could settle to swoop for Sky only and bag those important European subscription revs.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b2a5700e4b06f2cac87fea7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-20T13:35:01.055Z\">2.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets have joined in the generally positive mood after the week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-offs as trade tensions between the US and China escalated.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 80 points or 0.33%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.325 and the Nasdaq Composite 0.5% better.</p> <p>But General Electric shares are down after the group was pushed out of the 30 share Dow after more than a century.

                "bodyText":"The prospect of a trade war between the US and China has put markets under pressure this week, and although there was some recovery today, it was by no means convincing. As well as continuing uncertainty over the effect of the proposed tariffs, oil prices were volatile ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meeting. Meanwhile the pound edged a little higher after the UK government won a key Brexit vote. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 23.55 points or 0.31% at 7627.40 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 0.14% to 12,695.16 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.34% at 5372.31 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 0.16% to 22,120.58 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.34% to 9788.9 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 10 points or 0.05%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a pretty volatile day for stock markets, as well as crude. And the pound has not been left out. From a low of $1.3149 against the dollar it hit a high of $1.3215 after the UK government won a key Brexit vote. It is currently at $1.3206, up 0.21%. Our politics live blog has all the latest details on the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s narrow success in seeing off a potential rebellion: Oil prices are edging higher ahead of the key Opec meeting which begins on Thursday and following a bigger than expected fall in US crude stocks. The oil producers are expected to agree to increase output but the key question is by how much. Meanwhile evidence of rising demand came from the weekly US figures, which saw a 5.9m barrel decline, the biggest drop since mid-January. On the other hand there was a 3.3m barrel rise in gasoline stocks compared to expectations of a 1m fall. Brent is currently up 0.19% at $75.22 a barrel. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Crude oil is also in focus, with a whole raft of comments coming from OPEC member states ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big production decision. Despite an initial rebuttal of a production increase proposed by Russia (via Saudi Arabia), we are seeing a gradual shift in tone which will likely see some form of rise in output come Friday. For markets, the line in the sand seems to be the 1 million barrels a day level. Anything less than that will be seen as a compromise given the Saudi target is closer to 1.5 million barrels a day. We have seen the biggest drawdown in US crude inventories since January, but the impact has been offset by a rise in gasoline supply. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our first take on the David Drumm sentencing: Back with the Anglo Irish case and former chief executive David Drumm has been sentenced to eight years in jail for his part in the fraud, but will serve six with mitigating circumstances taken into account. Investor enthusiasm appears to be waning, with markets coming off their best levels. Connor Campbell, market analyst at Spreadex, said: The Dow Jones, which at one point looked like it was going to reclaim 150 points, ended up starting the US session flat, the wrong side of 24700. There was little for the index to really work with on Wednesday, beyond the ever-looming threat of a full-blown trade war between the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest economies. The Eurozone, which started the week poorly and then went downhill from there, saw its initial tame recovery gradually chipped away at until nothing was left. That means the DAX is back struggling to keep its head above 12700, while the CAC tumbled below 5400 after switching from a 0.3% rise to a 0.2% loss. Only the FTSE remained in the green with any real substance, and even then its 0.6% increase was half of the growth posted at lunchtime. Though the UK index broadly just followed the direction of trading from around the Western world, sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reversal of its initial losses also helped erase some of the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains. The pound rose 0.1% against the dollar and the euro \u00e2\u20ac\u201c granted, not a lot in the context of its recent performance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as the government appeared to come to a compromise over the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmeaningful vote\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 issue, but couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gain any more momentum thanks to Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impending Bank of England meeting. US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross has been speaking about the trade dispute with China. He says President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy is to make it clear to China that continuing on its current path would be more painful that changing its behaviour. Back with the bids for 21st Century Fox, and Neil Wilson at Markets.com says the market is now waiting for Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next move after Disney increased its offer: As was expected, cash was added to the all-share offer as a sweetener and the deal is now worth $38 a share, up from its previous $28 offer that was worth c$55bn. This beats Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $35 all-cash, $65bn bid but we must assume that Comcast is ready to come back with an even stronger offer. This offer from Disney is probably a little bit stronger than expected and [Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] Iger will be looking to kill off Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid once and for all. However, the rationale for Comcast remains the same, the question is only how much debt it can afford to carry. If it gets its way total debt would rise to $170bn according to Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, with just $6bn in cash on its books. Disney will also take on Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $14bn debts, giving this bid an enterprise value of more than $85bn. Debt is a concern for investors here and points to market-top behaviour. The amount of debt both companies are prepared to assume is arguably a worry, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a case of innovate or die in the face of competition. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign of just how desperately these two legacy media groups want the assets of Fox. In their attempt to contend with cord cutters like Netflix they are risking leveraging themselves up to a degree that makes them susceptible should the current benign market conditions deteriorate. Sky shares are trading up 3% today at \u00c2\u00a313.82 on the news but they could go higher if Comcast really goes big. Even it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the appetite for all of Fox it could settle to swoop for Sky only and bag those important European subscription revs. US markets have joined in the generally positive mood after the week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-offs as trade tensions between the US and China escalated. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 80 points or 0.33%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.325 and the Nasdaq Composite 0.5% better. But General Electric shares are down after the group was pushed out of the 30 share Dow after more than a century. GE, one of the original members of the Dow, will be replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance. Back with trade disputes, and the European Union has confirmed it will begin charging import duties of 25% on a range of US products on Friday. The move is in retaliation to the US tariffs imposed on EU steel and aluminium. The EU tariffs will be placed on \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.8bn worth of goods, from Harley Davidson motor bikes to bourbon and peanuts. Over in the US, and the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit widened in the first quarter, but by less than forecast. Reuters reports: The Commerce Department said the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, widened by $8.0 billion to $124.1 billion, or 2.5 percent of national economic output, in the first three months of the year. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the current account deficit to widen to $129.0 billion from the previously reported $128.2 billion in the fourth quarter. The figures also showed that US companies brought back cash from overseas after a December 2017 tax change. Companies paid out dividends of around $305bn from foreign receipts. Newsflash: The takeover battle over Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox group has taken another twist. Disney has raised its offer for most of 21CF to $38bn per share, up from a previous offer of $28 per share. That takes the value of the offer up to around $70bn, from $52bn previously. Disney has also tweaked its offer to include a cash component - previously it was only offering shares. It beats Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rival all-cash offer of $35 per share, and seemingly puts Disney back in poll position. Over in Dublin, one of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fallen bank bosses is being sentenced over his role in the financial crisis. David Drumm, the former CEO of Anglo Irish bank, faces a prison term after being found guilty of conspiracy to defraud and false accounting earlier this year. The case relating to banking transactions he was involved in at the height of 2008 financial crisis. By circulating deposits between Anglo and Irish Life &amp; Permanent (IL&amp;P), the bank created the impression that its deposits were \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.2bn larger than was actually the case. Tom Lyons, deputy editor of The Sunday Business Post, is tweeting from the court room. He reports that Drumm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team is defending his actions, while also recognising that a custodial sentence is on the cards.... Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says investors should be cautious about joining today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally. He points out that the trade spat between China and the US could escalates again soon. Asian and European stocks rose today as markets attempted to shrug off trade war threats. While the improved risk appetite could elevate stock markets higher, the sustainability should be questioned as fears over trade tensions remain a key market theme. Global equity bears could transform the current rebound into a classical dead cat bounce if trade tensions between the United States and China continue to escalate. The US stock market is expected to rise when trading begins in a couple of hours, ending several days of losses. Yesterday the Dow lost 287 points, or 1.1%, wiping out its 2018 gains. The Bank of England could face a major shake-up if Labour wins the next election. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is unveiling a swathe of proposed reforms to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank today. The headline-grabbing elements include opening an office in Birmingham, a shift away from its base at London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Threadneedle Street. The most intriguing element - setting the Bank a productivity target, alongside its current mandate to control inflation. These ideas aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Labour policy yet, but they could be considered for its next manifesto: Chris Giles of the FT suggests the Bank could have some issues with a productivity target: Good news: UK factory orders have risen, helping manufacturers to boost their output. The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest healthcheck on the sector has found that manufacturing order books recovered in the last quarter, while the volume of output increased strongly. The CBI says: 33% of manufacturers reported total order books to be above normal, and 20% said they were below normal, giving a balance of +13% 20% of firms said their export order books were above normal, and 11% said they were below normal, giving a balance of +9% 43% of businesses said the volume of output over the past three months was up, and 13% said it was down, giving a rounded balance of +29% Anna Leach, CBI Head of Economic Intelligence, believes Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial sector may be picking up pace after a recent lull. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The recovery in orders and a return to bumper growth in production suggests the lull in manufacturing activity may be over. While risks to demand persist from Brexit and escalating global trade tensions, firms can work with the Government to nurture a pro-enterprise environment that helps UK growth to shift up a gear. UK housebuilder Berkeley has called the top of the London housing market. After some bumper years, Berkeley told shareholders that profits will drop by 30% in the 2018/19 financial year, as the sector returns to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd times. Chairman Tony Pidgley says that new housing starts in London have dropped by a third in the last two years (or since the EU referendum, basically). Pidgley blames Brexit uncertainty for the drop in activity: It is telling that some funders and builders are choosing to exit the market when faced with the degree of risk and regulation that now confronts development in the capital where macro and political uncertainty, including Brexit, are leading to this caution. This is a great shame as London is a fantastic world-class city with unique attributes that will last long beyond the current hiatus which is only exacerbating the well documented under-supply. Stocks are recovering because investors are snaffling up bargains after Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout, says Ken Odeluga of City Index. He believes the People Bank of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention overnight is reassuring the markets: European stocks are posting solid gains with similar demand building in Dow, S&amp;P and Nasdaq contracts. This follows chunks of buying interest in Asia-Pacific shares. It looked very much like bargain-motivated flows juiced by a window of benign currency conditions, particularly in Japan, Hong Kong, S. Korea and Australia where benchmarks all added around 1%. Chinese equities also enjoyed a bounce, though to a lesser extent, with precarious sentiment capping Shanghai and Shenzhen gains as investors read the PBoC stepping in as corroborating a sense of crisis. The central bank recommended a reserve ratio requirement cut\u00e2\u20ac\u201dessentially looser policy\u00e2\u20ac\u201dafter fresh tariff threats. Elsewhere in the markets, cryptocurrency prices are falling after another digital coin exchange was hacked. The South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb says it lost 35bn won ($31.5m) worth of virtual coins to hackers. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the second such breach in a week, highlighting the risks of investing in crypto (as coins are virtually anonymous, they can be almost impossible to recover). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the damage: Two hours into the trading day, and European markets are all comfortably higher. Shares are up across the board, as traders shake off some of their fears about a devastating trade war. Analysts at FXPro say: Markets are taking a breath right now and retracing some of the moves over the past number of sessions. Whether this turns into a broader rally or the selloff is resumed remains to be seen. Stock markets are higher after support was found in the European session yesterday and US and Asian traders built on the foundations of that support. Sterling has hit a new seven-month low this morning, as the UK government faces another crunch vote over Brexit. Parliament will vote on the EU withdrawal bill, the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flagship piece of Brexit legislation, later today. And one group of MPs are refusing to drop their demand for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmeaningful\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vote in the scenario in which Britain can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree a Brexit deal. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve insists that parliament must have a chance to protect the UK economy, in the event of a no-deal. Grieve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s amendment has been been sent back to the Commons by the House of Lords, amid claims that Theresa May \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdouble-crossed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Grieve last week by promising to address his concerns, then pulling a u-turn. The vote could be close, if Grieve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s band of backbench Conservative MPs hold firm. Some pro-Brexit Labour MPs could vote with the government, though, which would be a headache for opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn..... This uncertainty has knocked the pound down by 0.2% to $1.315, the lowest since November 2017. Those calming words from the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China are helping markets recover from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout. In London the FTSE 100 has jumped by 80 points, or 1%, to 7683 (partly helped by a weaker pound). Other European markets are also higher, with Germany up 0.4% and Spain gaining 1% following the rally in Asia overnight. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets reckons investors are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153calming their fears about the current US-China trade tariff dispute\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly because neither side has actually imposed tariffs yet -- just made lots of threats. Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada explains why things might calm down: On the trade front, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re likely to see a two month \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchibernation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as the US works through the legal process for the next $200bn of tariffs and China awaits the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 formal response. The boss of Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs has predicted that China and the US still step back from a devastating trade wars. Lloyd Blankfein says that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to add tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports are a negotiating tactic: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you would do if it was a negotiating position, and you wanted to remind your counterparty just how much fire power you had to bring to the negotiation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Blankfein is hopeful that Washington and Beijing won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mutually destroy their economies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a suicide pact on this...\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I suspect we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to cause the economies to collapse with Smoot-Hawley on steroids. The protectionist Smoot\u00e2\u20ac\u201cHawley Tariff Act of 1930 imposed tariffs on more than 20,000 imported goods. It was meant to protect US workers after the Wall Street crash of 1929, but actually appears to have hurt economic growth and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prevent the Great Depression. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only one flirting with a bear market. After days of losses, the Philippines PSI index has fallen almost 20% from its recent peak. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose more tariffs on China is dominating the newspapers across Asia today. The China Daily newspaper \u00e2\u20ac\u201c often a good window into Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has accuse the US of trying to hurt the Chinese economy. It says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Faced with this heightened intimidation from the U.S., China has no choice but to fight back with targeted and direct measures aimed at persuading the U.S. to back off, since it appears that any concessions it makes will not appease the Trump administration, which wants to suck the lifeblood from the Chinese economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beijing will have to ensure that Washington is aware that there will be heavy price to pay every action it strikes against China if it is to avoid being a victim of the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing blood lust.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Global Times also put the boot in, saying Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration was the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest destabilising factor. A raging fever of nationalism rising in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sole super power sends an alarming signal. Nationalism is a challenge to globalization. Rising nationalism and protectionism could hinder the process of globalization and jeopardize the world order. The US often points an accusing finger at alleged economic nationalism of other countries including China, but now, the reality is that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s truculent nationalism is posing the biggest threat. And in Hong Kong, the Apple Daily newspaper produced quite a front page... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Could Donald Trump really trigger a trade war with China? With neither side backing down, the markets getting nervous after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff hit shares and commodities across the globe. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose new tariffs on $200bn of Chinese exports has investors worried, with Beijing already vowing to retaliate. Overnight, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central banker urged people to remain strong and calm. People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China governor Yi Gang told the Shanghai Securities Journal that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy remained solid, and that there was no reason to panic. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China still has good economic fundamentals and resilient growth. The yuan is one of a few currencies that have appreciated against the US dollar this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m fully confident about the health of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital market based on the fundamentals.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yi also pledged that the PBOC would act to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fend off systemic financial risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and prepare for the danger of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153potential external shocks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fend off systemic financial risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Yi Gang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments helped to stem another day of losses in China, where shares are on the brink of a bear market (down 20% from their peak). Other Asian equity markets also recovered a little, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Topix up 0.5% and Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P 500 gaining 1.1%. European traders might also recover their poise today, after Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says investors fear the consequences of a trade war: Global GDP could stand to be hit by 2% - 3% should the trade war continue and spread, to put this into context the Great Recession wiped out 6% of the global GDP, so this trade spat is by no means insignificant. For weeks the market has been relatively complacent that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tough protectionist rhetoric were merely a negotiating tool; however, the realisation that the US President is willing to go ahead with his threats has sent a shiver through the markets. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy appears to be to raise the stakes until China is forced to capitulate, by opening up its markets to American goods and addressing intellectual property theft concerns. But if that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen, the world economy could find itself on a rocky road. Also coming up today.... Top central bankers are gathered in Sintra, Portugal, for a conference organised by the European Central Bank. Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell, Bank of Japan chief Haruhiko Kuroda, and ECB president Mario Draghi will all speak. Plue, we get a new healthcheck on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories and the latest oil inventory figures from America The agenda: From 9am BST: European Central Bank conference in Sintra, Portugal 11am BST: CBI industrial trends survey of UK factories 3.30pm BST: US weekly oil inventory figures",

                "bodyText":"Time to wrap up, after a busy day. Donald Trump has threatened to widen the mounting trade dispute between US and the EU by imposing a 20% tariffs on European cars. The move came as Brussels imposed retaliatory levies on American products including bourbon whiskey, Levi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jeans and Harley-Davidson motorbikes. Shares in European carmaker fell following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning. Traders worried that tariffs could hurt carmakers such as BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen, who all contribute to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus in car sales. The Opel cartel has agreed to raise production levels. Oil producers agreed to boost output by up to one million barrels per day, following intense talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The oil price rose following Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move, as some analysts had expected a larger increase in production. The Bank of England has warned that the UK economy would be badly hurt if China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy crashes. New research found that the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tied to China and Hong Kong were greater than previously thought. Greece has welcomed last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt relief deal, that extends the maturity on some Greek bonds by a decade. Finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has said the Greek government is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153happy with this deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but will not forget the suffering of the last eight years. Creditors in House of Fraser have approved plans to close 31 of its 59 stores with the loss of up to 6,000 jobs. The 169-year old department store chain faced going into administration if its plan to shut stores and impose rent reductions on 10 other outlets was rejected. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW European carmakers would suffer badly if America imposed a 20% tariff on exports. The EU car industry is a major exporter -- selling \u00e2\u201a\u00ac192bn of motor vehicles overseas in 2016. The US is the biggest single export market for EU carmakers, with 25% of all exports. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s followed by China (16%) and Turkey (7%), followed by Japan, South Korea, Russia, Australia, Norway and Canada. However, the European Union only imported \u00e2\u201a\u00ac77bn of cars, meaning it ran a chunky surplus with the rest of the world. Turkish car factories contributed 20% of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car imports, followed by Japan with 19% and then America with 14%. So European carmakers have more to lose if the car trade across the Atlantic were to freeze. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s belligerent demand that European auto firms make cars in America ignores the fact that several already have large factories in the US. Daimler, for example, makes Mercedes SUVs in Alabama. BMW has a large factory in South Carolina. Both factories make cars for export abroad, so they could be badly hit if China imposes tariffs on US-built cars [which is why Daimler issued a profits warning on Wednesday night] Ironically, US carmakers such as Ford and General Motors have partnerships with Chinese firms - meaning most of the cars they sell in China are made locally. Thus, they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be hurt by Chinese tariffs on imports. As the FT put it yesterday: It is one of the tantalising ironies of the trade war between the US and China: German carmakers BMW and Daimler could end up as the biggest losers. After decades of investing in American states that back Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Republican party, the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest car exporters by value are likely to be hurt most. Looking back at the Opec deal.... this chart suggests today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a massive difference to the oil market. It shows that Iraq, Iran and Venezuela are all unable to boost their production. So the total supply increase will be less than the headline figure of one million barrels per day. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opposition Labour party has warned that tit-for-tat tariffs between the US and Europe will cost jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. Barry Gardiner MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow International Trade Secretary, says president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel industry will backfire. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald Trump said he would welcome a trade war and could win it but the workers in the motorbike factories in Wisconsin, Missouri and Pennsylvania are the foot soldiers he is prepared to sacrifice. Nobody wins in a trade war and Donald Trump may finally come to realise that his attack on steel workers in Europe was not such a good idea after all, as the European Union is forced to reciprocate with retaliatory tariffs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to see a trade war and, ultimately, these tariffs need to be removed by both sides as we begin to work together to address the real issue of global overcapacity in steel and unfair market practices. Shares in European carmakers are falling, as Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose tariffs sends a shiver through the sector. Fiat has shed 2.6%, BMW are down 2.1% and Daimler (which issued a tariff-related profits warning this week) have lost another 1.1%. American auto-makers are also suffering; traders may be anticipating retaliatory action from Europe against US cars. Newsflash: Donald Trump has just threatened to impose fresh tariffs on European carmakers. In a tweet (what else?) the US president said his administration would make EU cars 20% more expensive in the US, unless Europe lowered its tariffs and barriers on US products. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat comes as Europe starts to impose fresh tariffs on US goods, in retaliation to America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs on steel and aluminium from the EU. Bourbon whiskey, Levi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jeans and Harley-Davidson motorbikes imported from the US are all on the list of US products which will now cost rather more in Europe. The oil price is continuing to strengthen following Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement - which will not please Donald Trump! Brent crude (sourced from the North Sea) is up over 2% now at $74.64 per barrel. US crude oil has jumped by 3%, or two dollars per barrel, to $67.58. Analysts at Danske Bank say today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement should keep oil prices up in the months ahead. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) today agreed to lift output by one million barrels per day, effective from 1 July. The aim of the deal is to return total compliance to the current output agreement to 100%. Compliance has been well above 100% this year since some countries, notably Venezuela, have seen a drop in production. The price of Brent crude rose about $1/barrel to above \u00e2\u201a\u00ac75/barrel on the news. The fact that oil prices are rising when OPEC is returning supply to the market reflects a concern in the market heading into the meeting that OPEC would agree to raise output further than the level needed to ensure 100% compliance. For the rest of the year, the deal today reduces the upside risk to prices from the risk of lower output in, e.g. Iran and Venezuela, since OPEC now effectively has established a mechanism which opens the way for other countries to increase production correspondingly. Reminder, Iran has been unwilling to accept a supply boost, at a time when US sanctions are hurting its energy sector. Saudi Arabia, though, had pushed for an increase - under pressure from Trump to get energy prices down. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement looks (at first glance) like a compromise. Output will go up, but in practice by less than some analysts had expected. President Donald Trump may have missed the boat. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just tweeted that Opec must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantially\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd increase oil production, but of course the agreement has already been announced. Unless Trump is getting his dissatisfaction in early... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official: Opec has reached an agreement to raise oil production by up to one million barrels per day. UAE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy minister Suhail Al Mazrouei, who is also OPEC president, has just announced the plan in Vienna. It partly unwinds the 1.2m bpd cut which Opec agreed back in 2016, which helped to drive the oil price higher. Al Mazrouei told reporters that the increase is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a little bit less than 1 million barrels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd above Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current output. However, in practice the increase will be less - because many Opec members aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in a position to raise their output. Al Mazrouei said Opec had made \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the best choice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, balancing the interests of its members and other producers. Opec also hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t revealed which countries will raise their output, and by how much. Leaving the meeting, Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy minister said the deal added up to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153less than 700,000 barrels per day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in practice. Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy minister, Khalid al Falih, said the agreement would allow countries with spare production capacity to boost output. Newsflash: House of Fraser has been given approval by creditors to close 31 stores, resulting in up to 6,000 job losses, the Press Association reports. That follows this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with HoF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s landlords, where they were asked to vote on a plan to shut more than half its stores and cut the rent on another 10 of its 59 outlets. Oxford Economics predicts that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal (if confirmed) will push the oil price higher. Journalists in Vienna are waiting patiently for the Opec press conference begin. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chatter that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s communique will focus on getting Opec members to comply with the current production curbs. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is rallying hard today, partly thanks to the jump in the oil price. The FTSE 100 has gained 98 points, or 1.3%, to 7654 points. Mining companies and energy producers are leading the rally, with BP up 3% and Royal Dutch Shell up 2.7%. Or maybe not... An Opec announcement could be imminent... Back in the UK, the Bank of England has warned that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy poses a greater risk to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability than previously realised. New analysis from the Bank has found that a Chinese \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard landing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 would have a serious impact on the UK economy. If China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit boom blows up, Britain will suffer serious economic harm, they say. As the BoE puts it: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit boom is now one of the largest and longest running ever recorded. Indeed, rapid credit expansions, such as China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, have typically preceded financial crises. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economists have forecast that a modest shock would knock 3% off China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP, and reduce UK GDP by up to 0.5%. A full-blown financial crisis that wiped 10% off China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy would knock 1.4% off Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP, they believe. But the full impact could be twice as bad, due to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcamplification effects\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that would drive down asset prices and rock the currency markets. The Bank warns: We find that the effects via standard channels from a modest fall in Chinese GDP are larger than our previous estimates, primarily due to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasing role in global trade. A more extreme shock which triggers amplification mechanisms \u00e2\u20ac\u201d such as a larger financial market reaction \u00e2\u20ac\u201d could potentially double the effects from the standard channels alone.... The financial market reaction to a China crash is as yet untested; hence, a more extreme shock to exchange rates and asset prices could occur, resulting in greater declines in demand for UK exports and wealth and investor confidence. The BoE has also calculated that the City is more exposed to China than previously thought, thanks to its links with Hong Kong. Unlike most countries, the UK is unique in having both sizable direct exposures to mainland China, and indirectly via UK banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exposures to Hong Kong. Together, UK banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exposures to mainland China and Hong Kong exceed exposures to the US, euro area, Japan and Korea combined, despite the UK economy being a fifteenth of the size of these economies combined. You can read the report here. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing official from Opec yet.... Bloomberg and Reuters are both reporting that Opec has agreed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcin principle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to lift their production cap by one million barrels per day. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what the Saudis have been lobbying for at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, following pressure from Donald Trump to push oil prices down. But the actual increase will actually only be 600,000bpd, compared to what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually being produced today, as not every Opec member can boost production. Oil is actually pushing higher on the back of this news, with Brent crude now up 2% at $74.40 per barrel. Another newsflash from Vienna: Opec ministers have been discussing how to ensure everyone is fully complying with the supply freeze agreed in 2016: Reuters newsflash: OPEC SOURCE SAYS MINISTERS ARE NEARING AN AGREEMENT My colleague Adam Vaughan reports that Opec ministers are inching towards a deal. From Vienna, he writes: Major oil producers are set to pump around 1m more barrels a day to help cool crude prices as part of an Opec deal, according to Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy minister. Khalid Al-Falih said he was hopeful an agreement would be reached on Friday, minutes after meeting Iran, which has been the key holdout to a rise in output. Delegates privy to the negotiations in Vienna told the Guardian that talks had been fraught but they thought the cartel could maintain unity despite divisions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An agreement was reached yesterday to release the equivalent of about 1m barrels to the market; it will be distributed pro rata,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Al-Falih said on Friday, of an Opec committee meeting on Thursday. The deal has not been formally signed off yet, however. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Saudi Arabia is unique. All of our spare capacity is available at short notice,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. He acknowledged not all of the cartel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s members could increase output, in a reference to countries such as Venezuela. More here: If you own an Aston Martin, then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re probably not short of a few bob already. But the luxury carmaker is keen that its rich customers should get even richer, by offering them cheap shares in its upcoming stock market float. Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Kleinman has the details: James Bond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carmaker is drawing up plans to hand millions of pounds of discounted stock to wealthy customers as part of a London listing expected to value it at up to \u00c2\u00a35bn. Sky News has learnt that Aston Martin is working on incorporating a customer share offer into an initial public offering (IPO) that has been earmarked for the autumn. Details of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans have yet to be finalised, but are expected to be unveiled alongside a new employee share scheme at the time of the long-awaited flotation. If it proceeds, the customer offer would form part of efforts by Aston Martin to build demand for its shares in what would be one of the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most prominent stock market listings for many years. Of course, shareholders would normally only make gains if Aston Martin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares rise after the float. But the beauty with discounted shares is that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re much more likely to make a profit..... Opec insiders report that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153closed door\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd session of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting has begun. With the cameras switched off, and no journalists in the room, this is the opportunity for energy ministers to agree production increases, or not.... Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says the financial markets are increasingly edgy about today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meeting. The clashes between Saudi Arabia and Iran over whether to increase production has created \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a growing sense of uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he says: And while Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal is important, traders are also wondering whether the cartel can maintain its current agreement with Russia to curb production. That deal has been crucial in keeping output down, and prices up. Otunuga says: While Saudi Arabia and Russia have proposed to ease supply curbs, other members including Iran, Iraq, Algeria and Venezuela are against such a move. With Iran already storming out of preparatory discussions yesterday, investors should fasten their seat belts in preparation for potential fireworks today. If Iran continues to reject the deal to raise output and gathers support from other cartel members, talks are at risk of ending in an impasse. Such an undesirable outcome is likely to create uncertainty and will spark fears over the future of OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 18-month agreement with Russia to limit production. A market-friendly outcome could be a scenario where Iran makes a last-minute U-turn to cooperate, consequently allowing Saudi Arabia and Russia to move forward with a gradual production increase. Newsflash: UK supermarket chain Asda has cut its fuel prices, in response to recent drops in the oil price. Asda is shaving 2p per litre off its unleaded petrol, and 1p per litre off diesel prices. This follows a fall in crude oil prices - with Brent dropping from $80 per barrel to $74 in the last month. Motorists suffered a surge in prices on the forecourt in recent weeks, as the oil price jumped to its highest levels since 2014. Asda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move suggests other retailers could also trim prices.... Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister told has reporters that Opec won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply take instructions from Donald Trump, who has been lobbying for lower oil prices. Associated Press has the details: Iranian oil minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said as the group met Friday that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we are not here to receive instruction from President Trump and apply it and implement it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked whether he supports increasing production, he replied: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some of the countries are against any increase, and ask them. I am not representative of them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As mentioned earlier, Zanganeh also said $70 per barrel was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd oil price, AP adds. Back in Vienna, security officers have now emptied the Opec meeting of journalists, so the serious negotiations can get underway. Here are some photos of the main players speaking to reporters: Back in London, landlords are arriving to vote on House of Fraser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal to shut half its stores and lay off 6,000 staff. Most people heading into the meeting refused to comment but those who did speak said they thought the vote would be approved. House of Fraser are making the cuts to preserve the rest of their business. If creditors reject the plan (a company voluntary arrangement), then the whole business could collapse. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meeting has been difficult, Ecuador\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister Carlos Perez tells us. Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Khalid Al-Falih tells us he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hoping to get a deal to increase production limits today. Across the conference room in Vienna, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh is also surrounded by journalists. Zanganeh is a crucial player at this meeting, having walked out of talks on a production increase yesterday. He says that this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting with the Saudi delegation was good, and that Iran is happy with oil at $70 per barrel (Brent crude is trading at $74 today). Asked if a deal will be reached today, Zanganeh says cryptically that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we are cooking something\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Kuwait\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister says he will support a production increase of one million barrel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s per day (Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal), or less. Boom: Iraq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister has told Adam that a change in Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s targets will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153definitely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd be agreed today. No-one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggesting that supply targets will be reduced, so this suggests an increase will be waved through. Saudi oil minister Khalid Al-Falih is surrounded by a gaggle of reporters seeking answers. He insists that no-one should expect to see an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immediate flood\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of oil onto the market following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Oil supply release will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gradual\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Al-Falih says, suggesting the impact of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be seen until the end of the summer. Al-Falih is talking about a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnominal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 increase in production of one million barrels per day, split between Opec and non-Opec members. But in practice the actual increase will be less, he reckons Finally, the oil ministers are taking their seats in Vienna. Energy reporters have been unleashed from their imprisonment on the stairwell, and are firing questions now.... While Saudi Arabia and Iran negotiate, scores of journalists are still kettled on a stairwell waiting to be allowed into the meeting. My colleague Adam Vaughan reports that some are even wearing trainers, to give them an advantage in the race to speak to ministers. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Amanda Cooper reports that other \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcside meetings\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 are now taking place, as ministers continue to haggle about production levels... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy reminder of what the various Opec ministers hope to achieve today, from Jon Andersson, head of commodities at Vontobel Asset Management. Saudi Arabia want OPEC+ (OPEC and Russia) to increase production to please the US. In other words they want to show a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbearish\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 headline number to demonstrate to the US that they are listening and playing their part in balancing the market. Russia wants OPEC+ to increase production because they together with Saudi Arabia are the only ones that can significantly increase production in the near and medium term. In addition they will not be able to increase production during the winter so they strongly favour a decision to increase now compare to later this year. Iran don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want OPEC+ to increase production because they will be forced to reduce production as a consequence of US sanctions. Current expected loss around 1 million barrels per day All the other OPEC and non OPEC participants will play along. So what might happen? Andersson sees two likely scenarios: If OPEC increase by 500,000 to 1 million barrels per day, that will offset the expected loss from Iran in H2. A possible (but unlikely) scenario is that Iran veto an production increase and that OPEC decide to postpone the decision to the next OPEC meeting in September. The Opec meeting is running late! The opening session should have started 45 minutes ago, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a hiatus. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a rumour that Iranian oil minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh and his Saudi counterpart Khalid A. Al-Falih are holding a private meeting. Presumably they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to reach agreement on production limits before the meeting formally starts - when journalists are allowed to quiz minister. Amir Paivar of BBC Persian TV makes a good point: Why should Iran agree to boost Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s production targets when US sanctions are squeezing Iranian supplies down? Last week Donald Trump tweeted that Opec was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcat it again\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - keeping oil prices too high. Presumably the president wants to put pressure on the cartel, but this intervention means Iran won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to lose face today..... A date for your diaries..... Impressive can-kicking, even by eurozone standards! Jake Robbins, Manager of the Global Alpha Growth Fund at Premier Asset Management, thinks Opec will probably agree to pump more oil at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153OPEC look likely to raise production targets for the first time since late 2016, with the likes of Russia looking to cash in on the much improved oil price since the introduction of the policy. OPEC has been surprisingly disciplined over the past couple of years and successfully pushed oil to levels that are now profitable for the majority of producers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unfortunately for OPEC, the higher price has also encouraged further expansion from non-OPEC producers, most notably the US shale producers who have benefitted the most from OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supply constraints. Now some members are keen to also make the most of the higher oil price, particularly many in the Middle East and Russia who require the cash to cover big budget deficits. Any increase will probably end the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bull run\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the oil price, Robbins adds, as it could lead to another oil glut. Anxiety over today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meeting is pushing the oil price higher this morning. Brent crude has gained almost $1 to around $74 per barrel, a rise of 1.3%. That reflects uncertainty over whether Opec ministers will agree a production increase, and how large it will be. Analyst Daniel Lacalle thinks a 500,000 barrel per day increase is most likely - or just half what the Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are aiming for. Despite Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resistance, Opec last night drew up a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpreliminary deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to raise production by around one million barrels per day. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no certainty that Iran will back the deal today, as Bloomberg explains: In a night of drama in Vienna, the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, which includes Russia and Saudi Arabia, recommended a supply boost despite Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, the Iranian oil minister, walking out of the meeting and predicting OPEC won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convince him to back an increase. Iran could wield a veto over any formal deal on Friday, but such a move wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily prevent additional oil coming onto the market. Riyadh could seek to assemble a coalition of countries ready to pump more within their existing agreement, act unilaterally to boost output or abandon the 2016 cuts deal entirely. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meeting is overshadowed by a raft of political tensions, from the Saudi-Iran proxy war in Yemen to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new sanctions against Iran. The AFP newswire points out that Washington is putting the Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s under pressure to lower the oil price, ahead of Congressional elections this autumn. Saudi Arabia, backed by non-member Russia, is now pushing to raise production again in order to meet growing demand in the second half of 2018. But the proposal has run into resistance from Iran, Iraq and Venezuela, who would struggle to immediately raise output and fear losing market share and revenues if other countries open the spigots. Iran is particularly vocal about its objections as it braces for the impact of fresh US sanctions on its oil exports after President Donald Trump quit the international nuclear agreement. But Riyadh, which cheered Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the nuclear pact, is under pressure from Trump to boost output in order to lower oil prices ahead of November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s midterm elections... More here... My colleague Adam Vaughan is attending the Opec meeting in Vienna. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heard that a deal to raise oil production is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153likely today\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Opec oil ministers are meeting in Vienna today for a crunch meeting that could lead to a production boost, or could end in disagreement and disorder. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major oil-producing countries are under pressure from the US, China and Russia to pump more crude and bring down oil prices. But there are divisions at the heart of Opec. Saudi Arabia favours a supply boost, of perhaps one million barrels per day, but Iran, Iraq and Venezuela are all opposed. Yesterday, Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister walked out of preparatory talks, raising the prospect that a deal won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be reached. This split threatens to undermine the consensus at Opec, two years after the group agreed a production freeze that helped to drive oil prices higher. Motorists, consumers, and countries which are net oil importers, would probably welcome a production increase - as it might prevent prices rising higher. Opec members, though, have enjoyed higher oil prices, so will be reluctant to burst the bubble. The meeting starts shortly, but a final decision may not come until Saturday when Russia (not an Opec member) joins discussions Also coming up today: Greece is celebrating after its eurozone creditors finally agreed a debt relief deal that will help Athens exit its bailout programme. Following late-night talks in Luxembourg, eurozone finance ministers hammered out an agreement to make Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge debt pile more manageable. Under the plan, the repayment dates on almost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100bn of bailout loans will be pushed back 10 years, with the earliest repayment deadlines shift from 2023 to 2033. The eurogroup also agreed to hand Greece a final loan tranche of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn. That gives Athens a cash reserve of around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac24bn as it returns to the financial markets in August. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a significant moment, three years after Greece came to brink of leaving the euro area. Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has hailed the decision, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It took a bit longer than we expected, but ended in a very good way. I think it is the end of the Greek crisis ... a historic moment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggles aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over. It will still be under strict supervision from its creditors, even after the bailout ends, and must run high budget surpluses for decades to come to bring its debt pile (at a staggering 180% of GDP) down. Meanwhile in the UK, high street chain House of Fraser is asking its creditors to vote on plans to shut more than half its stores. If the deal goes through today, 31 department stores will close with the loss of 6,000 jobs. If it is rejected, the company could fall into administration. What a choice...

Initially traders were rather complacent that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threats were just a hardball negotiating tactic. However, he has more than proved that his intentions are far more serious and damaging; this realisation has struck market sentiment hard.</p> <p>Global equities are falling sharply today, with indices on both sides of the Atlantic succumbing to losses of over 1%. The fear that is driving the markets here is at what point does this end? How much damage needs to be done to the economies involved and global trade in order for Trump to decide enough. This is a huge uncertainty in this very dangerous game of economic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chicken\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as investors are starting to see US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sino relations sink past the point of no return. In the absence of any optimistic news over the global trading climate, we can expect the current sell off to intensify over the coming sessions.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b310640e4b0385b28423372\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-25T15:13:09.904Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Regarding that tweet from US treasury secretary Mnuchin, Chris Beauchamp at IG said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The new week has begun on a firmly negative footing, as equity indices around the globe suffer heavy losses, with trade wars getting the blame once more. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, the US administration itself appears divided as the Treasury Secretary tweets out that planned measures regarding intellectual property will encompass all countries and not just China.</p> <p>It seems the US is hell-bent on falling out with everyone, increasing the risk that trade wars will do what all the other worries of the past nine years have failed to do \u00e2\u20ac\u201c namely stop the great bull market in equities. The usual havens are in demand as investors seek refuge from the turmoil, with the ten-year Treasury yield dipping below 3% once more \u00e2\u20ac\u201c investor concerns about what a 3% yield would do seem awfully quaint compared to the genuine concerns about the impact of trade wars. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b3102ece4b01266b4b88042\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-25T15:04:06.784Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Falling oil prices in the wake of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision by Opec to increase production - Brent crude is down 1.8% - is another factor in the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market slump.</p> <p>But the trade tensions continue to dominate, and the markets may have been too complacent up until now about the impact to the global econom. Neil Wilson at Markets.com made a number of points about the state of play:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First, markets have been pretty relaxed about the trade war escalation and so the events of recent days necessitate a repricing of risk that is arguably overdue. </p> <p>Second, Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for restrictions on Chinese investment in US companies does mark step up in tensions and makes a full blown trade conflict more likely. Three, taken on their own the restrictions on investments would have a bigger economic impact - i.e. on corporate earnings - than fairly small beer tariffs would if there is no escalation. Four, US equities are still just about flat for the year, which given the massive ramp up through Jan is not a terrible performance. From a technical viewpoint, as long as we see the Dow hold its 200-day SMA - which at time of writing it is managing to do - we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still in an upwards trending channel from the April lows. </p> <p>The US should confirm tariffs on Chinese imports and the investment curbs by the end of this week - it could be a pivotal few days but there is still some hope -albeit fading - that the White House will step back from the brink.

                "bodyText":"The escalation of trade tensions has sent investors scurrying for the sidelines, amid growing fears of an all out global trade war. Reports that Donald Trump planned to block Chinese companies investing in US tech companies and could also restrict tech exports to China set the tone for the day. Comments from the US treasury secretary that the reports were inaccurate did little to limit the damage, especially since Steve Mnuchin suggested the restrictions might not apply just to China. On top of that, the impact of EU tariffs at a company level was demonstrated by the decision of motor bike maker Harley-Davidson to move some production out of the US. The final impact on European markets was pretty grim: The FTSE 100 fell 2.24% or 172.43 points to 7509.84, its worst daily performance since 6 February this year Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax, already weak on worries about the impact of tariffs on its key car producers, dropped 2.46% to 12,270.33 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.92% at 5283.86 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished 2.44% lower at 21,355.19 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 1.78% at 9617.9 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 382 points or 1.55%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest report on the trade wars and Harley-Davidson move which is helping cause the market woes: On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Unsurprisingly in the current circumstances, the VIX volatility index is moving higher: Amid the increasing trade tensions, things could get worse from here for markets, says Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index: Trade war fears appear to be ramping up almost daily. Initially traders were rather complacent that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threats were just a hardball negotiating tactic. However, he has more than proved that his intentions are far more serious and damaging; this realisation has struck market sentiment hard. Global equities are falling sharply today, with indices on both sides of the Atlantic succumbing to losses of over 1%. The fear that is driving the markets here is at what point does this end? How much damage needs to be done to the economies involved and global trade in order for Trump to decide enough. This is a huge uncertainty in this very dangerous game of economic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chicken\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as investors are starting to see US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sino relations sink past the point of no return. In the absence of any optimistic news over the global trading climate, we can expect the current sell off to intensify over the coming sessions. Regarding that tweet from US treasury secretary Mnuchin, Chris Beauchamp at IG said: The new week has begun on a firmly negative footing, as equity indices around the globe suffer heavy losses, with trade wars getting the blame once more. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, the US administration itself appears divided as the Treasury Secretary tweets out that planned measures regarding intellectual property will encompass all countries and not just China. It seems the US is hell-bent on falling out with everyone, increasing the risk that trade wars will do what all the other worries of the past nine years have failed to do \u00e2\u20ac\u201c namely stop the great bull market in equities. The usual havens are in demand as investors seek refuge from the turmoil, with the ten-year Treasury yield dipping below 3% once more \u00e2\u20ac\u201c investor concerns about what a 3% yield would do seem awfully quaint compared to the genuine concerns about the impact of trade wars. Falling oil prices in the wake of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision by Opec to increase production - Brent crude is down 1.8% - is another factor in the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market slump. But the trade tensions continue to dominate, and the markets may have been too complacent up until now about the impact to the global econom. Neil Wilson at Markets.com made a number of points about the state of play: First, markets have been pretty relaxed about the trade war escalation and so the events of recent days necessitate a repricing of risk that is arguably overdue. Second, Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for restrictions on Chinese investment in US companies does mark step up in tensions and makes a full blown trade conflict more likely. Three, taken on their own the restrictions on investments would have a bigger economic impact - i.e. on corporate earnings - than fairly small beer tariffs would if there is no escalation. Four, US equities are still just about flat for the year, which given the massive ramp up through Jan is not a terrible performance. From a technical viewpoint, as long as we see the Dow hold its 200-day SMA - which at time of writing it is managing to do - we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still in an upwards trending channel from the April lows. The US should confirm tariffs on Chinese imports and the investment curbs by the end of this week - it could be a pivotal few days but there is still some hope -albeit fading - that the White House will step back from the brink. Harley Davidson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to pull US jobs is a timely reminder to the administration that trade is not a zero sum game that either won or lost. Although some members of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team seem to be rowing back on the Chinese reports: It is hard to know which would be better: that the US is targeting China alone on technology or that it plans to expand its attacks further afield as well. A bidding war could be on the cards for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading satellite company Inmarsat. Earlier this month US group EchoStar had a bid rejected by Inmarsat, and since then it disclosed a 3% stake in its target. Now Paris-based Eutelsat has said it is currently evaluating its own offer for Inmarsat, pushing the UK group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares around 4% higher. Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline is accelerating, sending other markets lower in its wake, as the global trade tensions continue to grow. Investors have been increasingly concerned about the fallout from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions on tariffs, and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s developments - the threat of more restrictions on China and Harley-Davidson cutting some US production - are confirming their worst fears. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 are down around 1%, with the Nasdaq Composite nearly 1.4% lower on Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tech plans. In Europe the FTSE 100 has dropped 1.9% while in Germany - whose car production would be hard hit by US tariffs - the Dax is down 1.8%. Shares in Carnival, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest cruise company, have dropped more than 8% after it cut its earnings forecast for 2018. In the second quarter it said revenues had risen by 10.4% with earnings per share up from 52 cents a year earlier to 78 cents, helped by higher ticket prices and on-board spending. But increased fuel costs and adverse exchange rates mean that it now expects its full year earnings to be $0.19 a share lower than it forecast in March. A weak start to trading in New York: Ding ding! The US stock market is open for trading....and trade war fears are biting. The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen by 160 points, or 0.65%, to 24,420. Technology shares are dropping, following reports that the Trump administration will block Chinese companies from investing in the US, and also restrict US tech exports to China. Alphabet (Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company) is down by 1.7%, semiconductor maker nVidia is down 2.1% and aircraft maker Boeing is down 2%. Harley Davidson is also dropping, down 2% after outlining its response to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs on US goods. Bloomberg points out that Harley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales in Europe hit their highest level since 2011 last year (as a share of total sales). Clearly the company can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to lose sales in such a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccritical market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (which is why it will swallow the tariff cost itself, while it moves production out of America). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to Harley-Davidson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to move some US production overseas, from former White House press spokesman Tony Fratto.... ING economist Carsten Brzeski isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed either: Peter Alexander of NBC News points out that Donald Trump has previously hailed Harley-Davidson as a great US business. CNN has a good first take on the Harley-Davidson news: Harley-Davidson is already taking a hit in the trade fight between President Trump and European allies. The company is shifting some production of motorcycles for European customers out of the United States to avoid EU retaliatory tariffs. The EU is imposing tariffs on $3.2 billion worth of American goods, including motorcycles, orange juice, bourbon, peanut butter, motorboats, cigarettes and denim. They are a response to the Trump administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Europe. For motorcycles, the EU is raising its 6% tariff to 31%. That will make each bike about $2,200 more expensive to export, Harley said. Harley is not raising prices for customers. The company said it will take a hit of $30 million to $45 million for the rest of this year. Harley-Davidson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (HOG) stock fell 2% in premarket trading. Donald Trump won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be happy to hear that Harley-Davidson is moving some production out of America. The president singled out the motorcycle maker in his first State of the Union speech in February 2017, telling Congress that he would help companies like Harley-Davidson sell their goods abroad. As the new president put it: I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House. At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They said that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good. I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales. They told me \u00e2\u20ac\u201d without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent. They weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even asking for change. But I am. I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE. Instead, Trump has provoked the European Union into imposing higher tariffs on \u00c2\u00a32.5bn of US imports, by slapping tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into America. Harley-Davidson isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only US company being hurt by Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs. A nail manufacturer in the mid-west state of Missouri says it has lost 50% of its business in two weeks, thanks to the new tariffs on steel imports. Mid Continent Nail Corporation imports steel wire from Mexico, so has seen prices surge to uncompetitive levels thanks to the 25% tariff on imports imposed by Trump earlier this year. The company has already laid off 60 temporary staff, and could axe another 200 by the end of July unless it gets a tariff exemption, quickly. According to local news outlet Missourinet, Mid Continent Nail Corporation produces half of the nails made in America, but has seen orders tumble as customers find cheaper products elsewhere. Shares in Harley-Davidson have fallen almost 2% in pre-market trading in New York. Traders are calculating that absorbing the $100m annual cost of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs will hurt Harley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet know how many US jobs will be affected by Harley-Davidson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to move some production from America to Europe. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s base in Milwaukee, Wisconsin could be hit badly. Wisconsin is one of the rural states that backed Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, heartened by his promise to Make America Great Again and bring jobs back home. Harley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement, though, shows that trade wars aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good and easy to win\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as Trump once claimed.... NEWSFLASH: Harley-Davidson is planning to move some manufacturing out of America in response to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs on motorcycle imports. Harley-Davidson has just announced that the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs will have a serious impact on its business. The average tariffs on a Harley will rose to 31%, from 6% today, adding $2,200 to the average price of a motorcycle exported from the US to Europe. Such a burden could make Harley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s uncompetitive in Europe. So the company has decided it must shift production of motorcycles for EU destinations from the US to its international facilities to avoid the tariff burden. The company says: Harley-Davidson expects ramping-up production in international plants will require incremental investment and could take at least 9 to 18 months to be fully complete. It says this is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153only sustainable option\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to ensure Harleys can still be sold in Europe (where it sold almost 40,000 last year). It says: Increasing international production to alleviate the EU tariff burden is not the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preference, but represents the only sustainable option to make its motorcycles accessible to customers in the EU and maintain a viable business in Europe. That could be serious blow to Harley workers in America - and a stark example of the damage that a trade dispute can cause. Europe implemented tariffs on imports of US goods, including motorbikes and bourbon, in response to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new tariffs on steel and aluminium. In the short term, Harley says it will absorb the cost of the tariffs, rather than passing it onto customers - costing it up t0 $100m per year It says: Harley-Davidson believes the tremendous cost increase, if passed onto its dealers and retail customers, would have an immediate and lasting detrimental impact to its business in the region, reducing customer access to Harley-Davidson products and negatively impacting the sustainability of its dealers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 businesses. Therefore, Harley-Davidson will not raise its manufacturer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggested retail prices or wholesale prices to its dealers to cover the costs of the retaliatory tariffs. The Stoxx 600 index of European shares is on track for its biggest one-day fall in a month, according to Reuters data. European car firms are partly to blame, following Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to impose 20% tariffs on auto imports from the EU. Renault are down 2.8%, Daimler has lost 2.5, while car parts firm Continental has shed 3.6% (fewer car sales means less demand for tires and brakes). Analysts at FXPro say traders are shunning riskier assets, thanks to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s repeated threats to impose tariffs on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading partners. Over the weekend President Trump indicated that if trade barriers and tariffs against the US were not removed that he would have no choice but to add further sanctions against those countries targeting the US. The stock market selloff is gathering pace. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is now down 96 points, or 1.2%. Mining stocks are helping to drive the selloff, with Anglo American down 3.3% and Antofagasta losing 2.6% - and dragging the sector down to a seven-week low. That reflects concerns that a trade war will hurt global growth, and dampen demand for commodities like iron ore, copper and nickel. Oil giants are also falling, matching a drop in the price of crude after the Opec cartel agreed to raise production levels last week. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: With a troublesome US open on the horizon, the European indices saw their losses intensify as Monday went on. The FTSE was one of the worst performers at the start of the week. Not only was the UK index dealing with the same trade war fears gripping its peers, it also had to process Brent Crude\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.2% decline, a move that took the black stuff back towards $74.50 per barrel and left Shell and BP down 1.1% and 1.8% respectively. This in turn forced the FTSE 90 points lower, taking the index back under 7600 and only 50 points away from last Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 7 week nadir. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is defying today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downturn, after Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an was reelected as the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president last night. The Istanbul bourse has jumped by 1%, although the Turkish lira is sliding after an early rally. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AKP party won 52.5% of the votes, giving it an unexpected outright majority in a crucial election for Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency has sweeping new powers to appoint officials and set security policies, following a constitutional shake-up last year. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has promised to use his new powers to fight terrorism and improve Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubled economy. But having overseen a crackdown since an attempted coup in 2016, Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is likely to keep running Turkey in an autocratic manner. Vincent-Fre\u00c4\u203ade\u00c4\u203aric Mivelaz of Swiss Bank explains: Erdogan is likely to act unilaterally (in politics and economics) without consulting the opposition. Among the five parties making the parliamentary threshold of winning 10% of votes, cooperation will not be easy. The constitutional reform of April 2017 reinforces the power of the president (abolishing the office of the Prime Minister, allowing direct appointment of top officials, allowing intervention in the legal system and state-of-emergency powers) and its allies in the Nationalist Movement Party in the parliament. Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alliance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is projected to win 342 seats out of 600 in the parliament, giving little power to the opposition. Emerging markets expert Charlie Robertson of Renaissance Capital warns that Turkey faces troubles ahead. The US stock market is heading for losses when trading begins in almost four hours time. The futures market suggests the Dow Jones industrial average will drop by 150 point, or 0.7%. The technology-focused Nasdaq could lose 1%, amid concerns that tech companies are being dragged into Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade dispute with China. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank tried to calm nervous investors yesterday. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China relaxed the rules on commercial banks, allowing them to hold less cash. That should encourage them to pump more than $100bn of liquidity into the economy, to help Chinese firms. But this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to prevent another day of falling share prices in Shanghai - where the market lost more than 1% today. After two hours trading, European stock markets are falling deeper into the red. The FTSE 100 has now shed almost 1%, down 70 points at 7612. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has lost 1.2%, helping to knock the Europe-wide Stoxx 600 down by around 1% too. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Blue Monday in the markets. The dark mood over global markets returns, on increasing pessimism that a full-blown U.S.-China trade war may be unavoidable. Technology firms are leading the selloff, following those reports that American firms will be blocked from selling some tech to China - and that Chinese firms will not be allowed to invest in US rivals. In London, IT firm Micro Focus has fallen over 4%. Chipmakers such as BE Semiconductor (-3.7%) and Infinion (-2.7%) are also suffering. Odeluga explains why the markets are worried: The latest White House trade restriction against China might be an unprecedented ban of firms, at least 25% Chinese-owned, from investing in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153industrially significant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd U.S. technology companies. If the Treasury proposals, outlines of which were reported by the Wall Street Journal, are enacted, Beijing would have little choice but to react in kind. That could mean potential clampdowns on U.S. technology firms active in China, from the smallest to the largest. Newsflash: EU banks aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t properly prepared for the risk of a hard Brexit, according to the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top European watchdog. In a new report, the European Banking Authority has warned that financial institutions haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drawn up contingency plans in case Britain leaves the EU without a deal in March 2019. Crucially, the EBA is concerned that London and Brussels may not agree a transition deal that would allow UK-based banks to maintain their current links with Europe, and vice versa. The EBA also urges banks not to assume that politicians will find a magic solution to the trillions of pounds worth of cross-Channel contracts that could be left in limbo after Brexit. The EBA warns that: a) progress in the preparations of financial institutions for the potential departure of the UK from the EU without a ratified withdrawal agreement in March 2019 is inadequate; b) the recent political agreement on a transition period, while welcome, does not provide any legal certainty until a withdrawal agreement is ratified at the end of the process for the departure of the UK from the EU; c) there remains a material possibility that, despite the best efforts of both sides to conclude a ratified withdrawal agreement, this may not be possible, in which case the UK would leave the EU on 30 March 2019 by operation of law without a transition period; and d) the necessary mitigating actions take time, and should be pursued without further delay Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full report Ouch: German business morale has deteriorated, as the threat of a trade war casts a shadow over Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. Munich\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IFO institute has reported its business climate index has dropped to 101.8 this month, down from 102.3 in May. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that German businesses are finding life tougher this year. IFO chief Clemens Fuest explained. Companies were less satisfied with their current business situation. Their business expectations, by contrast, remained slightly optimistic. The tailwind enjoyed by the German economy is calming down. After a strong 2017, the IFO survey has been deteriorating for much of this year. Carsten Brzeski of ING points out that domestic political tensions in Germany are also hurting the economy, as Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition threatens to split over migration The next two weeks could dramatically change the political landscape in Germany and in a worst case scenario even lead to a fall of the government and new elections. For the economy, this would mean further delays of the urgently needed investments, new structural reforms and strengthening of the monetary union. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always hope... Six drops and one stagnation in the last seven months or in other (soccer) words: six losses and one draw. This is clearly not a promising trend. However, as seen last Saturday in the World Cup match between Germany and Sweden, never count out Germany. Hope dies last, even if it takes until the very last second. Even before these latest threats, there were concerns that trade war fears are hurting the global economy. Yesterday the Bank of International Settlements (which represents central banks) warned that growth could falter if nations imposed more protectionist measures on each other. BIS chief Agust\u00c3\u00adn Carstens warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Indeed, there are signs that the rise in uncertainty associated with the first protectionist steps and the ratcheting up of rhetoric have already been inhibiting investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Wall Street Journal says the Trump administration is determined to protect US companies from having their tech secrets snaffled by Chinese rivals. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got trillions of dollars seeking our crown jewels of technology,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said White House trade adviser Peter Navarro last week. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There has to be a defense against that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Financial Times says Chinese investment in America could tumble, if Trump blocks China from buying into US tech companies. According to the Rhodium Group consultancy, Chinese foreign direct investment in the US plunged more than 90 per cent to just $1.8bn in the first half of 2018 compared with the same period last year. In 2016, Chinese companies made a record $46bn in foreign direct investment in the US. The exact scope of the investment measures has been the subject of internal discussions in the Trump administration in recent days, say people familiar with the debate. It is unclear how quickly restrictions would take effect and if they would apply to Chinese investments in venture capital funds, which provide much of the seed money for US technology start-ups. But according to officials and people briefed on the discussions, the administration has decided to restrict China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to invest in or acquire US companies in the industries identified by Beijing in its so-called Made in China 2025 plan. Xi Jinping, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, has set a goal of leading the world in those ten sectors, which include aerospace, AI, robotics, medical devices and railways. US firms are concerned that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be blocked from selling some tech products to China, says Politico: Like the tariffs that Trump imposed on $50 billion in Chinese imports \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and those he has threatened to impose on $400 billion more if Beijing retaliates \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the new investment restrictions and export controls are intended to pressure China to stop unfair trade practices that threaten the United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 technological leadership. Trump is expected to invoke his emergency powers to protect national and economic security to put the restrictions in place. But the administration is already getting pushback from bureaucrats who think it would be a misuse of the export control system, and from businesses that fear the approach will further disadvantage U.S. firms trying to enter the Chinese market Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest threat against China has hit European markets. Shares are down across the region in early trading, with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX both losing 0.6%. The threat that Chinese firms could be blocked from investing in US tech companies has worried the City, as Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains In the latest escalation of the trade war Trump has decided to take aim at Chinese investments. A draft series of restrictions on inbound Chinese investments are due to be published later this week, in a move which could have great long-term consequences on the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sino economic relationship. Once again details remain very sketchy, with the scope of such a measure still under discussion. It is now very difficult to get away from the fact that neither side has any intention of backing down in this game of economic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chicken\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of a trade war between America and China have ratcheted up another notch, hitting confidence in the markets. Overnight, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emerged that President Donald Trump is drawing up a fresh crackdown on Chinese investment in the US. New rules, which could be announced within days, would prevent firms with at least 25% Chinese ownership from acquiring American companies involved in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcindustrially significant technology\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, such as robotics, electronic cars and aerospace. Trump is also planning to restrict US companies from selling certain technologies to China, using \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enhanced export controls\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to the Wall Street Journal. Such a move would further damage relations between Washington and Beijing, following the threat of tit-for-tat tariffs. The Trump administration is embracing increasingly aggressive restrictions on what they see as China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unfair trade practices. These latest measures could undermine China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to become a world leader in emerging technologies. As the WSJ explains: The twin initiatives, set to be announced by the end of the week, are designed to prevent Beijing from moving ahead with plans outlined in its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made in China 2025\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd report to become a global leader in 10 broad areas of technology. The Treasury Department is crafting rules that would block firms with at least 25% Chinese ownership from buying companies involved in what the White House calls \u00e2\u20ac\u0153industrially significant technology.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ceiling may end up lower than that, according to people familiar with discussions finalizing the plans. The news has hit Asian markets, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite indices both falling by 1%. European stock markets are expected to follow suit, with the FTSE 100 dropping in early trading. Last Friday, Trump threatened to impose new tariffs on European car makers, declaring that they should set up factories in America instead. That rocked the share prices of Fiat, BMW and Daimler. Trump also fired a warning shot at America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade partners over the weekend. The president tweeted that they must drop trade barriers and tariffs - even as he slaps them on US imports - or else... No wonder investors are worried.... Also coming up today... We get the new IFO survey of German business morale, which may show another decline, plus the latest US home sales. In Dublin, Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank and the International Monetary Fund are hosting a two-day conference on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the euro at 20\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It will examine the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance over its first two (sometimes turbulent) decades. IMF Christine Lagarde will give the opening speech this morning.

Having confounded the worst forecasts of doomsayers ahead of the vote two years ago, the British economy has since slowed to become one of the worst performing in the developed world and shows increasing signs of fragility. Writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), said the fallout from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disastrous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit vote and the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153calamitous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd negotiating strategy are having a damaging effect on business investment in the UK. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[Brexit is] scaring businesses to death \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 No wonder many thousands demonstrated against the Brexit madness last weekend,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. To gauge the impact of the referendum outcome on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in five cases the outcome was better than expected. The latest dashboard shows better news for the economy as retail sales jumped by 1.3% in May from a month earlier, comfortably beating expectations for a rise of just 0.5%. Inflation also held steady at 2.4% in May for the second month running, despite petrol prices rising to the highest levels for almost four years. There was more good news from surveys of business activity recorded by IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, showing a strong rebound for the UK economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominant services industry, as well as recoveries in output for the manufacturing and construction industry from the slowdown triggered by heavy snowfall and freezing weather earlier in the year. However, the surveys jar with official figures from the Office for National Statistics released over the past month showing the weakest monthly performance for UK factories in April since October 2012. Factory output fell by 1.4% on the previous month, compared with economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts for growth of 0.3%. Andrew Sentance, another former member of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MPC, said reasonably healthy growth for the world economy in the coming months should continue to benefit British manufacturing in the short term. However, writing in the Guardian, he said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the bigger worries for the UK manufacturing sector relate to the longer-term outlook\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recent warnings from a range of manufacturing firms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including Airbus and BMW \u00e2\u20ac\u201c indicate there could be significant job losses if the Brexit deal creates new trade barriers for manufactured goods,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. The concerns are likely to prove troubling at a time when Donald Trump is stepping closer to a full-blown trade war with the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major trading partners, which could have a damaging impact for growth. Oxford Economics estimates the trade tariffs pledged by the White House so far could slow economic growth in the US and China by as much as 0.3%, while the World Bank warned of a slowdown for global trade akin to the one seen during the financial crisis. Harley-Davidson plans to shift the production of some of its bikes out of the US in response to retaliatory tariffs on motorcycle imports put forward by the EU, after Trump imposed steel and aluminium tariffs on his traditional allies. There were better signals for the labour market in recent weeks despite the clouds hanging over the economy, with about 146,000 more people able to find a new job between February and April. However the official figures also show a surprise drop in wage growth that could trouble the Bank of England, as it prepares to raise interest rates from as early as August. Threadneedle Street put consumers on notice at the latest meeting of its rate-setting panel for an increase in the cost of borrowing, with the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Andy Haldane, arguing in favour of an immediate hike. However, there are warnings from business leaders and some economists against an increase just before Britain leaves the EU. Blanchflower said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK economy is slowing and the last thing it needs is a rate rise. This is getting embarrassing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

Trump is warning the company of a big tax being levied should it move production to Thailand, and we are seeing an important proxy play out for future cases given the growing impact this trade war is having on US-based firms.</p> <p>US consumer confidence has taken a knock this month, with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conference Board survey highlighting a particularly noticeable decline in future expectations. While many believe that the US will emerge in an improved economic standing in the aftermath of this current trade war, the fact is that we have a huge degree of anxiety over how this will play out. With China eradicating tariffs on Soybeans (one of the biggest US exports to China) from five Asian countries, it is clear that China is positioning itself for a further breakdown in US-China trade relations.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b32596ae4b0bef28bb9a648\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-26T15:21:43.383Z\">4.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There may not be a full blown trade war but markets will continue to be hit by the continuing tensions, says Ingvild Borgen Gjerde at Capital Economics:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite the small rebound in equity markets today, fears of a global trade war have increased further this week. This, together with a likely slowdown in the US economy next year, will probably continue to weigh on equities.</p> <p>The news over the weekend that the US is taking further steps towards implementing protectionist policies, and that it is broadening its approach, strengthen the perception that we are genuinely moving closer to a full-blown trade war. This, rather than the proposed measures themselves, explains yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off in equity markets.</p> <p>Information technology (IT) stocks were hit particularly hard yesterday, which is not surprising. Admittedly, the measures are meant to protect US technology. But they could hurt the sales of US IT firms in China, or limit their ability to operate there.</p> <p>However, some of the stocks that fell the most in the US were consumer discretionary stocks, with very limited exposure to China. And some of the IT firms with larger-than-average exposure to China fared better than those with less exposure.</p> <p>Indeed, the stocks of the so-called FAANGs, the group of large US consumer discretionary and IT firms, were among the hardest hit stocks in the US yesterday. (See Chart.) This follows surprisingly strong performance so far this year, and suggestions that the FAANGs are emerging as some form of safe haven amid rising global trade tensions.</p> <p>....We disagree with this notion. While most of the FAANGs might not be very exposed to China, they are still highly cyclical. They are therefore particularly vulnerable, as a trade war would raise the risk of an economic slowdown.</p> <p>We still do not anticipate a full-blown trade war, and we do not expect the protectionist measures implemented or proposed thus far to kill the current economic expansion on their own....However, as equity markets usually lead the economy rather than the other way around, the current escalation of trade tensions is adding to the pressure on global equity markets. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, cyclical sectors remain particularly vulnerable in this environment, with or without exposure to China. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b324fd9e4b0bef28bb9a5a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-26T14:39:21.213Z\">3.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Markets are managing to hold on to their - fairly limited - gains.

It has been heading lower for a while and is down another $8 an ounce to $1257 so far today. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Gold has been falling sharply of late, dropping by a good $50 in the space of nine trading days. At the time of writing, the yellow precious metal was trading around $1257, its lowest level since December 18. The perceived safe haven metal has been unable to find much demand from flows out of the equity markets which have been tumbling amid concerns over global trade disputes and the outlook for rising interest rates.</p> <p> Indeed, the trend of central banks turning hawkish has continued in recent weeks. The Fed has indicated that it will probably raise borrowing costs two more times this year, while the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE will end at the end of this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c albeit the first rate rise has been delayed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and there are now more hawks at the BOE (3) than expected (2). </p> <p> As central banks tighten monetary conditions, yields could rise further. This means the opportunity cost of holding noninterest-bearing assets like gold will increase (on a relative basis) along with expectations for higher borrowing costs. Unfortunately for gold, which is priced in the dollar, interest rate expectations in the US have been rising faster than in other regions. This has helped to underpin the dollar and undermine foreign currencies, and pressurised buck-denominated gold further. </p> <p> Thus, for gold to make a meaningful comeback, the dollar will have to depreciate and depreciate sharply. This can only happen if incoming US macro data were to deteriorate sharply, or the global economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in particular, the EU \u00e2\u20ac\u201c starts to expand at a faster pace than the US economy. However, as things stand, this looks unlikely and we therefore may see further dollar strength in the coming days and weeks. So, the outlook for gold looks bleak. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fc3645165db580f3939650d1b298177a42b54f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fc3645165db580f3939650d1b298177a42b54f3/0_125_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gold bars at YLG Bullion International Ltd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gold bars at YLG Bullion International Ltd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b323c19e4b025d39df45154\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-26T13:15:50.246Z\">2.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A few minutes until Wall Street opens and the futures market is predicting the US markets - like those in Europe - will stage a minor recovery.

                "bodyText":"With enthusiasm draining away as the close of trading approached, European markets failed to hold on to the bulk of their early gains, limited as these were anyway. The fears about a trade war after Donald Trump raised the stakes in his attacks on China and elsewhere continued to dominate sentiment. A rise in the oil price gave a lift to the FTSE 100 but elsewhere markets slipped back by the close, in some cases into negative territory. An early rise on Wall Street did little to support shares elsewhere. So the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 28.08 points or 0.37% at 7537.92 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.29% to 12,234.34 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.05% at 5281.29 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB edged up 0.3% to 21,419.27 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.2% at 9637.4 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 80 points or 0.34%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the latest on the spat between Donald Trump and Harley-Davidson over trade tariffs: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the criticism of the Bank of England over its expenses: On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. A London magistrates court says Uber can continue operating in London, but for a trial period: A court decided the ride-hailing firm should be awarded a new, 15-month probationary licence, after being told of sweeping changes to its practices. The ride-hailing firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future in one of its biggest global markets had been in jeopardy after Transport for London ruled last September that it was not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fit and proper\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to hold a private hire vehicles operator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s licence. At the start of a two-day hearing, Uber admitted that London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original decision not to renew its five-year licence had been correct. TfL cited concerns about public safety and security, including reporting of crimes, and background checks on drivers. But Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyers convinced Westminster magistrates court that it had since cleaned up its act, while continuing to operate in the capital pending its appeal. Chief magistrate, Emma Arbuthnot, said that Uber should pay all costs of the appeal. TfL\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyer said a figure of \u00c2\u00a3425,000 had been agreed. Our full report is here: The nervous gain made by markets in the wake of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls is hardly a convincing recovery. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: There is little reason to believe that this respite from the recent selling in the larger markets is anything more than a breather before the pressure starts once more. No one is showing any signs of backing down in the escalating and dangerous trade war that was started by the US. Today, the focus of US President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ire is iconic motor cycle manufacturer Harley Davidson, which is threatening to get round the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retaliatory import tariffs by increasing production outside the US. Trump is warning the company of a big tax being levied should it move production to Thailand, and we are seeing an important proxy play out for future cases given the growing impact this trade war is having on US-based firms. US consumer confidence has taken a knock this month, with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conference Board survey highlighting a particularly noticeable decline in future expectations. While many believe that the US will emerge in an improved economic standing in the aftermath of this current trade war, the fact is that we have a huge degree of anxiety over how this will play out. With China eradicating tariffs on Soybeans (one of the biggest US exports to China) from five Asian countries, it is clear that China is positioning itself for a further breakdown in US-China trade relations. There may not be a full blown trade war but markets will continue to be hit by the continuing tensions, says Ingvild Borgen Gjerde at Capital Economics: Despite the small rebound in equity markets today, fears of a global trade war have increased further this week. This, together with a likely slowdown in the US economy next year, will probably continue to weigh on equities. The news over the weekend that the US is taking further steps towards implementing protectionist policies, and that it is broadening its approach, strengthen the perception that we are genuinely moving closer to a full-blown trade war. This, rather than the proposed measures themselves, explains yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off in equity markets. Information technology (IT) stocks were hit particularly hard yesterday, which is not surprising. Admittedly, the measures are meant to protect US technology. But they could hurt the sales of US IT firms in China, or limit their ability to operate there. However, some of the stocks that fell the most in the US were consumer discretionary stocks, with very limited exposure to China. And some of the IT firms with larger-than-average exposure to China fared better than those with less exposure. Indeed, the stocks of the so-called FAANGs, the group of large US consumer discretionary and IT firms, were among the hardest hit stocks in the US yesterday. (See Chart.) This follows surprisingly strong performance so far this year, and suggestions that the FAANGs are emerging as some form of safe haven amid rising global trade tensions. ....We disagree with this notion. While most of the FAANGs might not be very exposed to China, they are still highly cyclical. They are therefore particularly vulnerable, as a trade war would raise the risk of an economic slowdown. We still do not anticipate a full-blown trade war, and we do not expect the protectionist measures implemented or proposed thus far to kill the current economic expansion on their own....However, as equity markets usually lead the economy rather than the other way around, the current escalation of trade tensions is adding to the pressure on global equity markets. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, cyclical sectors remain particularly vulnerable in this environment, with or without exposure to China. Markets are managing to hold on to their - fairly limited - gains. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positivity managed to carry over into the US session, though the gains were nothing compared to Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. The Dow Jones managed to rise 0.3% after the bell, sending the beleaguered US index back above 24300. This despite another strong day for the dollar, with the greenback rising 0.4% against both the pound and the euro, sending the former below $1.323 and the latter towards $1.165, and jumping half a percent against the yen. The most recent Conference Board consumer confidence reading had little impact on either currency or index, the possible negative impact of the worse than expected month-on-month decline countered by the upwards revised figure from May. Commenting on the US data Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said: Consumer confidence declined in June after improving in May. Consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment of present-day conditions was relatively unchanged, suggesting that the level of economic growth remains strong. While expectations remain high by historical standards, the modest curtailment in optimism suggests that consumers do not foresee the economy gaining much momentum in the months ahead. It should hardly come as much of a surprise, given the amount of talk about the recent trade tensions, but US consumer confidence has slipped back in June, coming in below expectations. The Conference Board consumer confidence index fell from 128.8 in May (itself revised up from 128) to 126.4. Analyst had forecast a level of 128. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest report on the new spat between Donald Trump and Harley-Davidson: President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened Harley-Davidson with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big tax\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and said the motorbike company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to shift some motorcycle production overseas, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will be the beginning of the end\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A day after the company announced it was moving some production overseas to mitigate the impact of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tariffs on European steel and aluminium Trump used Twitter to say the company is using \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tariffs/Trade War as an excuse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to hide previously announced plans to move jobs to Asia. The Milwaukee-based company said on Monday it came to its decision because of retaliatory tariffs it faces in an escalating trade dispute between the US and the European Union. Trump warned Harley-Davidson that any shift in production \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will be the beginning of the end\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump said in one of several tweets on Tuesday. He was referring to tariffs Harley-Davidson would face on motorcycles produced overseas and shipped back to the US for sale. The president has held up the motorcycle maker as an example of a US business harmed by trade barriers in other countries, but Harley-Davidson had warned that new US tariffs could negatively affect its sales. Trump recently imposed steep tariffs on aluminium and steel imported from Canada, Mexico and Europe in his attempt to reduce trade deficits between the US and its trade partners. But those countries have treated Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s action as an insult and have chosen to respond in kind. The US and China are also volleying back and forth over tariffs. The full story is here: After Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump, US markets have indeed managed to open in positive territory, even if the gains are not particularly convincing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 47 points or 0.2% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.19% higher and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.29%. Technology stocks, which on Monday were among the biggest fallers after Donald Trump latest trade threats hit the sector, are leading the recovery. Gold is typically seen as a haven for investors in times of market turmoil, but not at the moment. It has been heading lower for a while and is down another $8 an ounce to $1257 so far today. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said: Gold has been falling sharply of late, dropping by a good $50 in the space of nine trading days. At the time of writing, the yellow precious metal was trading around $1257, its lowest level since December 18. The perceived safe haven metal has been unable to find much demand from flows out of the equity markets which have been tumbling amid concerns over global trade disputes and the outlook for rising interest rates. Indeed, the trend of central banks turning hawkish has continued in recent weeks. The Fed has indicated that it will probably raise borrowing costs two more times this year, while the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE will end at the end of this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c albeit the first rate rise has been delayed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and there are now more hawks at the BOE (3) than expected (2). As central banks tighten monetary conditions, yields could rise further. This means the opportunity cost of holding noninterest-bearing assets like gold will increase (on a relative basis) along with expectations for higher borrowing costs. Unfortunately for gold, which is priced in the dollar, interest rate expectations in the US have been rising faster than in other regions. This has helped to underpin the dollar and undermine foreign currencies, and pressurised buck-denominated gold further. Thus, for gold to make a meaningful comeback, the dollar will have to depreciate and depreciate sharply. This can only happen if incoming US macro data were to deteriorate sharply, or the global economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in particular, the EU \u00e2\u20ac\u201c starts to expand at a faster pace than the US economy. However, as things stand, this looks unlikely and we therefore may see further dollar strength in the coming days and weeks. So, the outlook for gold looks bleak. A few minutes until Wall Street opens and the futures market is predicting the US markets - like those in Europe - will stage a minor recovery. After Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 328 point decline, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open up around 40 points. Getting back to the trade wars.... Donald Trump has savaged Harley-Davidson for deciding to move some production out of America to avoid EU tariffs on US goods. The president accused the motorbike manufacturer of misleading customers yesterday, by using tariffs as an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexcuse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to shift jobs. He says it will be the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbeginning of the end\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for Harley, unless it scraps the plan. Overnight, the Financial Times spoke to Harley workers in Milwaukee. Most apparently still support Trump, and think he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s using his business smarts. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it unless it needed to be done, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very smart businessman,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one Harley employee whose name is embroidered on his work shirt \u00e2\u20ac\u201d though he asks not to be quoted by name. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s playing poker: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hit you with this, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hit us with that, I think this will bring them to the table \u00e2\u20ac\u201d unless he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s completely crazy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd chimed in another....

Reuters has the details: The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next governor must embody values of inclusion and accountability, as well strong economic skills, the new chair of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s court of directors said on Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those values include inclusion, they include accountability, they include collaboration, decisiveness and empowerment. We would want that in the new governor,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bradley Fried told lawmakers. Incumbent governor Mark Carney is due to step down on June 30, 2019, and finance minister Philip Hammond is expected to announce his successor before the end of this year. Fried also acknowledged the criticism for only having one woman (Silvana Tenreyro) on the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee which sets interest rates. That image doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t match the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to inclusivity and equality, Fried insisted. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also only one woman (Elizabeth Stheeman) on the Financial Policy Committee alongside 12(!) men - including two facing tough questions about their trans-Atlantic flights.... Back in parliament, the new chair of the court of the Bank of England has faced some uncomfortable questions about expenses. Bradley Fried has been asked to justify how two members of the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee, Donald Kohn and Anil Kashyap, ran up \u00c2\u00a3390,000 of travel expenses in the last two and a half years. This is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a simply staggering sum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Conservative MP Simon Clarke. Is it really a sensible use of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resources? Fried argues that Kohn and Kashyap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expertise mean it was value for money, given the skills which they provide to the FPC. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the context of the skills we needed on the committees at the time\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Having seen these committees in action and the contributions they have made, as high as their expenses have been, so staggering, I think, has been their contribution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Anil Kashyap is a professor at the University of Chicago, while Donald Kohn is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Both men are travelling between London and America to attend FPC meetings - with the Bank picking up the tab. Clarke says his constituents would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gobsmacked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to hear that one return flight from Chicago for Mr Kashyap to attend a meeting in February cost \u00c2\u00a311,084.89. Clarke says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These meetings must be scheduled months in advance. I cannot understand how that figure was arrived at. Are FPC members allowed to fly first class, he wonders. Our people fly business class, replies Fried, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll check this issue. Onto taxis! Donald Kohn, it transpires, took a flight from Washington to London costing \u00c2\u00a38,000 and added an extra \u00c2\u00a3469 in taxi fares. Clarke says this is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just unconscionable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He adds that there are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disturbing echoes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the culture that was exposed by the House of Commons expense scandal in 2009. As if this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough, Clarke reminds Fried that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2016 summer party cost \u00c2\u00a3100,000. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one hell of a party\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Is that public money? if it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, whose money is it? Fried says he will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reflect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on this issue and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153figure out with our financial manager what framework is appropriate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Clarke puts his finger on another dubious issue. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sports Centre facility at Roehampton - where it costs \u00c2\u00a31,464 per year to a humble member of the public, but Bank staff only pay \u00c2\u00a350 a year. That, Clarke says, is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an extraordinary good deal, and suggests an extraordinary subsidy being offered here\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. How does that fit with the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mandate of promoting monetary and financial stability? Fried admits that the issue will be examined: Roehampton is part of what we look at. We will be looking at Roehampton. Andy Bruce of Reuters has dug out an example of Donald Kohn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expenses - including more than \u00c2\u00a356,000 in one three-month period last year. The Chinese stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide into a bear market today has sent shivers through the financial world, particularly in Asia. With shares down 20% since January, and worries about trade rising, investors fear more losses ahead. Qian Qimin, strategiest at Shenwan Hongyuan Group in Shanghai, says the threat of trade protectionism could push shares lower. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market may keep falling since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still hard to gauge the impact of trade tensions. Investors will keep cutting risk.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Analysts at Danske Bank have warned that some international companies could pull out of China, leading to an outflow of capital. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We envisage that US companies in China will increasingly repatriate profits as they risk being caught in the crossfire in the trade war. The prospect that America blocks some technology exports to China (and maybe other countries too?) is also alarming traders. Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo, explains why such a move would be significant: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unlike the seemingly spur-of-the-moment tweets by President Trump and the retaliatory exchange of tariffs, Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid to protect intellectual property is an issue at the heart of a trade row between two powers battling for future global supremacy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning out to be a long-term bearish factor for the financial markets, as the United States is unlikely to back down at least through its midterm elections.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jonathan Haskel seems to be talking sterling down, even before he gets his knees under the table at the Bank of England. Sterling has dropped by half a cent today, to $1.322, as Haskel tells MPs that there may be more slack in the UK economy than we think. If he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right, that could mean interest rates rise more slowly. Haskel is generally coming over as a more dovish policymaker, which is significant as he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacing the hawkish Ian McCafferty... The man who will be replaced by Jonathan Haskel is also speaking this morning, explaining why he voted (in vain) to raise UK interest rates last week. Ian McCafferty, who leaves the Bank of England monetary policy committee this summer, is arguing the economy is much stronger than official figures suggest. In his final major speech, McCafferty declares: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We should not dally in making the next move. In his view, low unemployment is starting to drive wages higher and energy prices are rising - both of which could keep inflation above the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Continuing with the slow reduction in monetary stimulus without undue delay could well prevent the need for a more aggressive tightening later on. Over in parliament, economics professor Jonathan Haskel is being quizzed by MPs about his appointment to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee. Haskel has warned that rising protectionism could threaten the UK economy by driving up costs and hurting economic demand. Haskel told the Treasury committee: If protectionism were to break out into a widespread trade war I would of course be very concerned, for in such a situation economies would have higher inflation (due to higher import costs), lower demand (due to confidence etc.) and likely lower supply (to the extent that supply chains were interrupted that couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t otherwise be established). Haskel also warns that Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effect on the UK economy is still very uncertain. On productivity (his specialist area), Haskel says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less pessimistic than some other experts. He believes that some firms are making significant investment in artificial intelligence which aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet bearing fruit. Haskel is due to join the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee in September, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now being grilled about gender balance, following the row over his appointment (over four female candidates). He says that Imperial College, where he works, are making efforts to improve the pipeline of female candidates into economics. This includes outreach programmes and efforts to engage with schools (Imperial experts who will turn up and perform a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whole load of explosions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). Wes Streeting MP jokes that the Treasury Committee might enjoy a demonstration; Haskel gently points out that the House of Commons has already had one near-miss with explosions.... Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister has warned that a trade war would be disastrous, not least for the United States. Speaking during a visit to India, chancellor Philip Hammond has told CNBC that we are living in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncertain times\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd right now, thanks to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach to trade and tariffs. He told CNBC India: The old certainty for many decades has been that the United States was completely wedded to open markets and free trade. And now the United States is questioning the value, the fairness, of some of our arrangements. Hammond warns that a full-blown trade was could be devastating. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I very much hope that we can avoid a full scale trade war (because) that would be a disaster for everyone, not least for the United States. Hammond also pledge that the UK would remain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an outspoken proponent of open markets and free trade, low tariffs barriers and low non-tariff barriers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The chancellor is one of the key voices pushing for a relatively \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, under which Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existing trade links with Europe are largely maintained. This chart shows how China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai composite index has fallen pretty steadily since its recent peak at the end of January. The slump in Chinese shares this year will worry policymakers in Beijing. Many small investors will have suffered hefty losses as the Chinese market has slid 20% from January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high. Financial speculation could destabilise the economy, at a time when officials are trying to tackle financial risks and shadow banking problems without hurting growth. Peter Garnry of Saxo Bank says China is under pressure to settle the trade dispute with America: After yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumbles, European traders will have approached their desks nervously today. But so far, the City looks relatively calm. The FTSE 100 has rise by 23 points in early trading, having plunged by 173 points yesterday. The news that China has fallen into a bear market hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t caused a wider panic. The French and German markets have also risen by around 0.3%, as investors try to digest some mixed messages from the White House overnight. Wall Street was spooked last night by treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that America could restrict investment from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all countries that are trying to steal our technology.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That message was then undermined by trade advisor Peter Navarro, who went on TV to declare: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no plans to impose investment restrictions on any countries that are interfering in any way with our country. This is not the plan.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to wait and see what Donald Trump signs off later this week. In the meantime, these escalating tensions are making investors increasingly nervous, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets. If the US stops Chinese investment in certain US sectors, it will have a strong counteraction. Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin has said that more details on this would follow by the end of this week and this is going to keep investors even more nervous. On top of this, Trump administration is further adding to this uncertainty by keep sending conflicting statements; one person would say it is fake news and another would say more details on the topic would emerge sooner than later. Dickie Wong, head of research at Hong Kong-based broker Kingston Securities, says the gloom is deepening in China, as America threatens to escalate the trade dispute. Wong says (via CNN): It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a combo effect of concerns about the trade war and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP growth. Last week Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports, on top of the $50bn already being targeted. Newsflash: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has fallen into bear market territory, as fears of a trade war with America hits confidence. The Shanghai Composite index has dropped 0.5% today, which means it has fallen more than 20% from its recent peak in January. Energy stocks and banks led the selloff today, as traders worried that escalating trade tensions would hit Chinese economic growth and financial stability. Reports that the US will soon block Chinese firms from investing in America, and restrict the export of cutting-edge technology to China, has sent a shiver through the trading floors. Airline stocks also had a bad day, amid worries that the weakening yuan would drive up the cost of servicing debts issued in US dollars. Bloomberg reports that anxiety in China is growing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pessimism will keep growing as many companies are on the edge of margin calls and bond defaults,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Sun Jianbo, China Vision Capital president in Beijing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index will fall at least 10 percent from the current level.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trade war fears are hitting currencies across the developing world today. Jameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy at FXTM, explains: Concerns over the possibility of an upcoming trade war are expected to remain front and centre of investor focus once again today. The Chinese Yuan, Malaysian Ringgit, Thai Baht, Indian Rupee and Indonesian Rupiah are once again trading lower against the Dollar, while the Japanese Yen is still outperforming as a result of investor reluctance to take on risk during an atmosphere of market uncertainty. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. The markets are edgy today after growing worries of a trade war sent shares sliding on both side of the Atlantic yesterday. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff wiped 328 points, or 1.3%, off America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones industrial average while the Nasdaq shed 2%. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yuan has slumped to a near six-month low, as the threat of a deepening dispute with America hit confidence. Analysts believe Washington will press the button in tough restrictions on Chinese investment in the coming days, which would further escalate tensions with Beijing. US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin denied last night that America was targeting China, saying that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all countries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which pilfer US technology could face restrictions. Mnuchin may have been trying to help, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually raised fears of a broader crackdown by the US. As Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets puts it: This trade spat story looks to have good legs on it everyone. Buckle up. In weak trading, the yuan has fallen to 6.5573 against the US dollar today, the lowest since last December. The news that US motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson would move some production out of America, thanks to EU tariffs, also hit sentiment yesterday. Analysts warned that it shows the perils of tit-for-tat trade barriers: Having triggered the current flurry of tariffs, Donald Trump has tweeted that manufacturers should be patient: But other US companies may follow Harley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead, to avoid Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new 25% tariffs on some US goods. Also coming up today MPs will be kicking the tires of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newest central bank policy maker, Jonathan Haskel, who joins the Bank of England in September. Haskel is a productivity expert, but the City don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know much about his views on monetary policy. The hearing may provide some hints on whether he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a hawk or a dove, and thus likely to vote for interest rate hikes. Haskel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appointment caused a stir last month; he was the only man on a five-person shortlist, so the Treasury missed the opportunity to tackle the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gender problems. On the data side, the CBI is publishing its estimate of UK retail sales this month. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already had one piece of bad retail news - struggling Carpetright has just posted a whopping loss of \u00c2\u00a370.5m for the last year, as it presses on with its store closure plan. Carpetright also warned that some suppliers are tightening credit terms, following \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcadverse publicity surrounding the Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restructuring\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Plus, the latest survey of US consumer confidence is released later today. It hit a three-month high - will trade tensions have weakened it? The agenda: 10am BST: Professor Jonathan Haskel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appointment hearing for the Monetary Policy Committee at parliament 11am BST: CBI survey of UK retail sales in June 3pm BST: US consumer confidence for June",

David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Equity markets are higher now that it seems the US is taking a more relaxed position regarding investment from China. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) will access international investment in the US. Traders are viewing this less aggressive way to monitor overseas investment in the US as a boost for international relations. </p> <p>Traders welcomed the initiative as the government now appears to have a body that will deal with the issue, and it should lead to less confusion about which investment is allowed and which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.

Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Equities are reaching for the stars once again, with healthy gains across the board. Many market watchers will remember when it was the Fed that was scared into policy changes by financial market volatility. Now the financial markets appear to be doing the same to the US president. Trade war concerns remain high on the agenda, but the White House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on using existing legislation rather than new rules has helped boost risk appetite.</p> <p>Having tied himself so closely to the stock market early on in his presidency, Mr Trump will be wary of anything that prompts a sustained rout in equities. Of course, he may decide that the political advantages of talking tough on trade outweigh those arising from a buoyant stock market. But for now investors will be pleased that a softer tone is being adopted.</p> <p>Also helping equity markets this afternoon is oil, which has enjoyed a stellar week. OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move to raise production did not dispel concerns about a supply shortage, and those concerns have only increased thanks to US jawboning on Iranian exports, a Canadian shutdown and now a fresh drop in US crude stockpiles. So long as OPEC keeps a lid on production increases, we can expect further bullish momentum in oil. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b33a33de4b0bef28bb9b17b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-27T14:49:52.972Z\">3.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with John Lewis Partnership, and analyst Greg Lawless at Shore Capital was positive about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jun/27/uk-house-price-growth-falls-bank-of-england-financial-stability-business-live?page=with:block-5b335358e4b02f6ecf5e89e3#block-5b335358e4b02f6ecf5e89e3\">the moves the business has outlined</a> to deal with a tricky retail environment:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This looks a sensible path for JLP to navigate given the structural shifts across the current retail landscape.

The stronger balance sheet allows a commitment to continue to invest \u00c2\u00a3400- \u00c2\u00a3500m per annum over the next three years.

This includes \u00c2\u00a3500m of fresh investment over the next few years.</p> <p>Here are some highlights (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve bolded up the key points):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is widely acknowledged that the retail sector is going through <strong>a period of generational change</strong> and every retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response will be different. For the Partnership, the focus is on greater differentiation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not scale. We have clear plans to build on our strengths and to sharpen our points of difference in both Waitrose and John Lewis.</p> <p>These plans include <strong>further investment</strong> in and development of unique products and service, together with a greater emphasis on own brand and innovation.</p> </blockquote> <p>On current earnings:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We expect the Partnership\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s half year profits before exceptional items \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which are always much lower and more volatile than the second half \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to be <strong>close to zero</strong> this year. For the full year there are a wide range of possible outcomes, given the market uncertainty, but we are currently assuming that <strong>profits before exceptional items will be substantially lower than last year</strong>.</p> <p>The Partnership currently expects to see profit growth in Waitrose, a decline in John Lewis and significant extra costs at the Partnership level as a result of<strong> greater IT investment</strong>, which will be a big driver behind the overall profit change.</p> <p>Today the Partnership has announced that it will take steps to <strong>strengthen its balance sheet by a further \u00c2\u00a3500m</strong> over three years to invest in product and service innovation.

                "bodyText":"Global stock markets have been pushed around by the trade tensions between the US and, notably, China, and signs of a softer tone from the Trump administration has given them a lift today. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Equity markets are higher now that it seems the US is taking a more relaxed position regarding investment from China. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) will access international investment in the US. Traders are viewing this less aggressive way to monitor overseas investment in the US as a boost for international relations. Traders welcomed the initiative as the government now appears to have a body that will deal with the issue, and it should lead to less confusion about which investment is allowed and which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Recently, different members of the Trump administration seemed to be on different wavelengths from one another, and that added to the uncertain economic environment. Dealers are now happy to enter the market and pick up relatively cheap equities. The trade dispute is still ongoing, so investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 optimistic mood may not last too long. Rising oil prices have also helped push shares higher, particularly in the commodity sector. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 83.77 points or 1.11% higher at 7621.69 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 0.93% to 12,348.61 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.87% at 5327.20 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 0.65% to 21,557.91 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.22% higher at 9658.6 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently Elsewhere John Lewis Partnership warned this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits would be well below last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures, and said it was getting rid of five Waitrose stores. Our full story is here: On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Over in the US, and President Trump is back tweeting about Harley-Davidson (which said it would move some production out of the US due to his tariff plans) and not, perhaps surprisingly, about China (there is still plenty of time for that, of course). Markets continue to recover after the signs that the Trump administration may be taking a more conciliatory tone with China. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Equities are reaching for the stars once again, with healthy gains across the board. Many market watchers will remember when it was the Fed that was scared into policy changes by financial market volatility. Now the financial markets appear to be doing the same to the US president. Trade war concerns remain high on the agenda, but the White House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on using existing legislation rather than new rules has helped boost risk appetite. Having tied himself so closely to the stock market early on in his presidency, Mr Trump will be wary of anything that prompts a sustained rout in equities. Of course, he may decide that the political advantages of talking tough on trade outweigh those arising from a buoyant stock market. But for now investors will be pleased that a softer tone is being adopted. Also helping equity markets this afternoon is oil, which has enjoyed a stellar week. OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move to raise production did not dispel concerns about a supply shortage, and those concerns have only increased thanks to US jawboning on Iranian exports, a Canadian shutdown and now a fresh drop in US crude stockpiles. So long as OPEC keeps a lid on production increases, we can expect further bullish momentum in oil. Back with John Lewis Partnership, and analyst Greg Lawless at Shore Capital was positive about the moves the business has outlined to deal with a tricky retail environment: This looks a sensible path for JLP to navigate given the structural shifts across the current retail landscape. The group is playing to its own core strengths with an increased focus on differentiation, innovation and enhanced service. The work in recent years from a balance sheet perspective (slowed the investment in physical space growth, reduced the discretionary pension increases and reduced partnership bonuses) has put it in a stronger position. The stronger balance sheet allows a commitment to continue to invest \u00c2\u00a3400- \u00c2\u00a3500m per annum over the next three years. The group is targeting a net debt to EBITDA of 3.0x ratio over the next five years, suggesting capital discipline over the medium-term. JLP is now being more realistic in recognising that group profits need to be rebased as it faces into its challenges and charts its own path. The expectation is that there will be no let-up in the headwinds and it is right that the group is being more realistic in its appraisal of the sector. Perhaps other retailers might also want to consider the wider sector implications of JLP acknowledging the current retail environment. Crude prices have been rising in recent days, giving a boost to commodity stocks and markets such as the FTSE 100 where mining and oil companies are well represented. Despite Opec agreeing to increase production, the price was supported on Tuesday by Donald Trump calling for buyers to cut their purchases from Iran, Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third largest producer. Now a bigger than expected drop in US crude stocks has suggested growing demand, and pushed prices higher. Crude stocks dropped by 9.89m barrels last week, compared to expectations of a 2.6m decline. Gasoline stocks grew by 1.16m but this was less than the forecast 1.3m increase. Brent crude is now up 2% at $77.82 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has added 2.7% to $72.5. US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin is predicting strong growth for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy in the second quarter. He told CNBC he was expecting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big number\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd . And although he made it clear he had no advance sight of the figures, the comments have helped push Wall Street even higher. Signs that the Trump administration may been trying to ease tensions with China have given US markets a lift at the open. As reported earlier the US is moving away from a blanket ban on Chinese firms investing in US businesses, and instead is talking about using a strengthened security review process to deal with the issue. The news has helped push the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 108 points or 0.46%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.2% higher and the Nasdaq Composite 0.33% better. There are also some new US figures showing an improvement in the goods trade balance to -$64.85bn in May, down $2.5bn. Exports for May were up $2.9bn to $143.6bn, while imports edged up $0.4bn to $208.4bn. Still with the US, and new orders for capital goods fell unexpectedly in May, although April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure was revised sharply higher. The commerce department said that orders for non-defence goods excluding aircraft slipped by 0.2% compared to forecasts of a 0.5% increase. But the April figure is now reported as a 2.3% rise, much better than the original estimate of a 1% gain. Analysts trying to work out how this might affect US interest rate policy might have a difficult time, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at GKFX: Over the past few years investors have got used to equities rallying on the back of data releases, irrespective of the numbers surprising to the upside or downside. Strong data has reinforced the view that the US economy is powering ahead, at least when compared to other developed countries. But at the same time, disappointing numbers have led to the belief that the US Federal Reserve would decelerate monetary tightening. After all, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen repeatedly from both Janet Yellen and her predecessor as Fed Chair, Ben Bernanke. However, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a growing perception that the current chair, Jerome Powell, is doing things differently and that under his lead the Fed is prepared to tighten unless there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a significant market disruption. Consequently, data disappointments are unlikely to receive the positive reaction that they once did. This shift in sentiment is something to be aware of as we approach the second half of this year. Newsflash: Donald Trump may have backed away from escalating the trade dispute between America and China. US officials have revealed that the Trump administration is moving away from plans for a blanket ban on Chinese firms buying stakes in US companies. Instead, the US government is pushing Congress to strengthen a panel called the Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS), to protect US intellectual property rights. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a less confrontational approach, which will calm fears that the row between Washington and Beijing was escalating ever higher. Earlier this week, there were reports that the US would use national emergency laws to prevent Chinese companies from investing in the US - and possibly other countries too. But now, the White House seems to have backed away from such an inflammatory step. One official told CNBC that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We considered a number of different mechanisms for addressing the concerns articulated regarding the acquisitions of sensitive technologies that may threaten U.S. national security, national interests. In the end the president and his advisers settled on the idea that we have a strong and effective mechanism through the CFIUS process ... and that is a mechanism that can be used in the flexible and aggressive way to combat the practices that are troubling to the president.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Investors have welcomed the news, sending shares higher. In London the FTSE 100 index is now up 55 points, or 0.7%, and Wall Street futures are recovering too. Back in London, the governor of the Bank of England has defended the huge cost of flying policymakers around the globe. Mark Carney was questioned about the revelation that two members of the Financial Policy Committee spent \u00c2\u00a3390,000 on flights between them in the last couple of years. In response, Carney told reporters that it was absolutely right to question the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expenses - before explaining that its officials are jet-setting around the world to attend important international meetings. Carney says he personally went on 52 trips in the last year, at a cost of \u00c2\u00a3312,000. Some of that cost is covered by Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other jobs (he also chairs committees for the Bank of International Settlements), getting the average price down to \u00c2\u00a33,000. As Carney says: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a lot of money, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a consequence of having to go to these various meetings. The governor points out, a little defensively, that he was slaving away last weekend while luckier souls were watching England overcome Panama, sunbathing, or wrestling with a barbeque. As Carney puts it: I spent what was a glorious weekend here, I hear, in Basel, chairing a group of global governors dealing with issues around Brexit, emerging market risks, the future of financial reforms... And I was very pleased to be able to get back on Sunday night so I could come into work on Monday morning. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on John Lewis: The John Lewis Partnership has said it will make no profit in the first six months of this year and is to close five Waitrose stores as tough trading on the high street takes its toll. The group said its full-year profits, to be announced next March, will also be substantially lower than last year. It operates 50 John Lewis outlets and 350 Waitrose shops. JLP blamed market uncertainty and cited significant extra costs as a result of greater IT investment, which would be the main cause of the profit decline. Waitrose will shut four convenience shops and one small supermarket, affecting aabout 200 staff. The four convenience stores are being sold to the Co-Op. Sir Charlie Mayfield, the JLP chair, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is very important that we feel the jeopardy of what is happening right now. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a blip, it is a major shift and it has a while to run.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Waitrose is expected to see profit growth, but that will be offset by a decline at John Lewis. The group said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is widely acknowledged that the retail sector is going through a period of generational change and every retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response will be different. For the partnership, the focus is on greater differentiation, not scale.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd... More here: Newsflash: The Waitrose store on Camden high street will become an Aldi. The discount chain has exchanged contracts to acquire the Camden store - one of the five being shut by John Lewis. It intends to reopen the site in Spring 2019. While Waitrose is firmly upmarket (although it does run a popular Essentials range too), Aldi has grown its market share strongly by focusing more on price. Graham Hetherington, Aldi regional managing director, says North London shoppers will appreciate the difference: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Camden store is an opportunity to reach customers in a busy London borough, many of whom may not have experienced Aldi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s award-winning, quality products at unbeatable prices before. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect details of the agreement to be finalised in autumn and work will then begin to refit the store with a view to opening in spring next year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: The Co-op has swooped in to buy the four small Waitrose stores being axed today, saving them from closure. The Co-op has exchanged contracts to take over the Little Waitrose convenience stores in Manchester (on the approach to Piccadilly railway, and in the financial centre of Spinningfields). It will also take over the store on Colmore Row in Birmingham City Centre, and Portman Square in central London. Stuart Hookins, Co-op Director of Property Portfolio and Development, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are pleased to have worked with Waitrose to agree the purchase of four of its convenience stores. Our acquisition and refit programme forms a fundamental part of our food strategy. Our aim is for stores to be at the heart of local life, creating stronger communities and offering great quality products conveniently, when and where our members and customers need them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This should also avoid job losses. Waitrose Partners at those shops being acquired by the Co-op will transfer to the Co-op under TUPE (Transfer of Undertakings, Protection of Employment regulations). Waitrose has also promised to find opportunities for staff wh want to say with them. The slide in John Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits this year highlights the wider crisis in British retail, says Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy group Retail Economics, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even the mighty John Lewis has not been able to escape intensifying pressures building on UK high streets. The impact of rising sourcing costs, higher operating costs and the turbulent consumer environment has flatlined profits. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a growing sense of panic for the retail sector as the intergenerational shift in behavioural trends is fragmenting the market. The emergence of the sharing economy, mass personalisation at scale and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economy has put the emphasis on retailers to differentiate themselves from their competitors. But the pace of change is accelerating and the race is on to pivot business models in a move to become fit-for-purpose in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s digital age.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd John Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits are being eaten by Amazon, and Brexit uncertainty, says Bloomberg: The operator of department stores and Waitrose supermarkets said it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unable to give a precise annual profit forecast because of economic uncertainty, some of it linked to the pending departure from the European Union. With Brexit less than a year away, consumer confidence will suffer further in the second half, Chief Financial Officer Patrick Lewis said. The announcement from John Lewis, at a strategy day Wednesday, continues a run of bad news from U.K. store chains. Brexit is squeezing their costs and prompting consumers to keep closer tabs on budgets, compounding the damage from the rise of online shopping. Newsflash: The Bank of England has issued a warning that Europe needs to do more to prepare for Brexit. In its new financial stability report, the BoE says that progress has been made in protecting UK households and businesses against Brexit disruption but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153material risks remain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It is particularly concerned that the EU hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t created a temporary permission regime to allow financial firms to continue trading across Europe after next March. Without such a regime, trillions of pound worth of derivative contracts are at risk, plus millions of insurance contracts. The Bank says: Progress has been made, but material risks remain. The biggest remaining risks of disruption are where action is needed by both UK and EU authorities, such as ensuring the continuity of existing derivatives contracts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As yet the EU has not indicated a solution analogous to a temporary permissions regime.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd BoE governor Mark Carney is speaking to reporters in London now, warning that the rise of protectionism could hurt the global economy. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have more details shortly... Here are the five Waitrose stores that are closing as part of the strategy announced this morning: Spinningfields, Manchester Manchester Piccadilly Colmore Row, Birmingham Portman Square, London Camden, London The first four are convenience stores, while the Camden store is a small supermarket. John Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman has now weighed in on Brexit, saying it is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunthinkable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that Britain leaves the EU without a deal. He made the comments at this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s media briefing, as he outlines the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to shut five Waitrose stores and boost investment. Reuters has the details: Britain is unprepared to leave the European Union without a deal and chaos would ensue were it to happen, the chairman of department store group John Lewis said on Wednesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A no deal Brexit is in my view a pretty much unthinkable scenario,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Charlie Mayfield told reporters. Martin Lane, managing editor of money.co.uk, is alarmed that profits across John Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business have all but evaporated so far this year. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise John Lewis have seen a fall in consumer demand, but to make close to no profit is worrying to say the least. John Lewis are struggling to soak up rising costs whilst improving their own infrastructure. The strategic move to close a few Waitrose stores is part of a wider plan to innovate rather than expand. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With numerous high street retailers going into administration since Christmas, this news will surely have the John Lewis board members in crisis talks. Lane believes that Waitrose are losing out to cheaper rivals, as consumers cut back. John Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s department stores face an even bigger nemesis - the internet. With lack of wage growth and rising living costs it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s become evident that shoppers are tightening their purse strings and saving where they can. Cheaper supermarkets like Aldi and Lidl are growing in popularity which leaves Waitrose out in the cold. John Lewis on the other hand are battling an even bigger battle - the online retail market. With the recent news House of Fraser are having to shut a large number of their stores, the worry is that John Lewis may end the same way. The partnership has its work cut out to recover from this. The boss of John Lewis Partnership, Paula Nickolds, is briefing reporters about the challenging retail world: Waitrose chief Rob Collins is also there: The company is also rebranding, to emphasise the partnership element of its business: The John Lewis Partnership has now issued a statement, confirming that profits are taking a tumble this year and that several Waitrose stores are being shuttered. The news comes in a strategic update, outlining its plans for its department stores and supermarkets. This includes \u00c2\u00a3500m of fresh investment over the next few years. Here are some highlights (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve bolded up the key points): It is widely acknowledged that the retail sector is going through a period of generational change and every retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response will be different. For the Partnership, the focus is on greater differentiation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not scale. We have clear plans to build on our strengths and to sharpen our points of difference in both Waitrose and John Lewis. These plans include further investment in and development of unique products and service, together with a greater emphasis on own brand and innovation. On current earnings: We expect the Partnership\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s half year profits before exceptional items \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which are always much lower and more volatile than the second half \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to be close to zero this year. For the full year there are a wide range of possible outcomes, given the market uncertainty, but we are currently assuming that profits before exceptional items will be substantially lower than last year. The Partnership currently expects to see profit growth in Waitrose, a decline in John Lewis and significant extra costs at the Partnership level as a result of greater IT investment, which will be a big driver behind the overall profit change. Today the Partnership has announced that it will take steps to strengthen its balance sheet by a further \u00c2\u00a3500m over three years to invest in product and service innovation. This will be achieved by rebuilding profitability at Waitrose, creating more value from the property estate, and conducting a review of the Partnership\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension scheme. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation that five Waitrose stores will close: Unlike many of its competitors, the John Lewis Partnership has a well balanced and well located store portfolio, with 353 Waitrose shops and 50 John Lewis. As we develop our plans to prioritise differentiation we will continue to make adjustments to our overall estate, including exit or closures, but at a rate that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in line with what we have seen over the last few years. To this end, Waitrose today announced the disposal of four convenience shops and one small supermarket. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement is clearly bad news for John Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 85,000 staff, who effectively own the Partnership. Each employee is a partner, who receives a percentage of their annual salary in a profit-related bonus each year. In 2017-18 the partners only got a 5% bonus, the lowest in over 60 years, after profits slumped by 77%. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bonus could be even more miserly. More gloom from John Lewis Partnership chairman Charlie Mayfield: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is very important that we feel the jeopardy of what is happening right now. John Lewis is briefing reporters about its plans now. Chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield warns that the retail slowdown isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153blip\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and could continue for some time: Newsflash: John Lewis has warned that its profits will be substantially lower than a year ago. In the latest gloomy news to hit Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sector, the John Lewis Partnership admits that profits in the first half of the financial year could be close to zero. It is also planning to close a handful of small Waitrose stores - including one in Camden, two Little Waitrose outlets in Manchester and one in Birmingham. More to follow! Worries that Donald Trump will trigger a destructive trade war are weighing on the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets again today. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark CSI 300 index slumped by 2% today to a two-year low, leaving it firmly in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbear market territory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (more than 20% below its peak in January). Other Asian markets also slipped, with the Hong Kong Hang Seng index down 1.8%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a bad few weeks for emerging market shares, as nervous investors pull money out. As this chart shows, the entire region is worryingly close to bear market territory: European markets are also on the back foot. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has dropped by 0.75% this morning, as concerns that Trump might slap tariffs on European car imports mount. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC is down 0.5%. Things look better in London, though, where the FTSE 100 has lost just 10 points (-0.15%). Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ongoing trade war concerns continuing to weigh on investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Economist Howard Archer of EY Item Club has spotted that UK house prices actually flatlined in the last three months, compared to the previous quarter. This is the first time that prices haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t risen on a quarterly basis since the third quarter of 2012 - another sign that the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cooling. Archer says people are being cautious because interest rates could rise soon - making a mortgage less affordable: Housing market activity is expected to remain lacklustre as the extended squeeze on consumer purchasing power only gradually eases, confidence is relatively fragile and appreciable caution persists over engaging in major transactions. Potential house buyers may also be concerned that they are likely to face further interest rate hikes over the coming months (we believe the Bank of England is more likely than not to raise interest rates from 0.50% to 0.75% in August \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although it could be delayed until November). Furthermore, house prices are relatively expensive relative to incomes Worries over Brexit are keeping some potential housebuyers out of the market, keeping prices subdued, says Jonathan Samuels, CEO of the property lender, Octane Capital. With Brexit on the horizon, households feeling the pinch and interest rate uncertainty lingering, a lot of prospective buyers are sitting tight. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nationally, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re witnessing the revenge of the regions, with the East and West Midlands in especially barnstorming form. Wales also has a significant spring in its step.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdLondon is in a league of its own once again, but sadly, for homeowners in the capital, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the bottom league. North London estate agent Jeremy Leaf says sellers need to be realistic about prices, particularly in his patch: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOn the one hand, the squeeze on incomes and unrealistic asking prices is reducing activity and confidence to move, particularly in price-sensitive areas such as London. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOn the other hand, the market continues to be supported by low interest rates and overall supply shortages, although we have found recently that listings and viewings are on the rise. This will translate into more sales if buyers and sellers recognise the new market realities.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, reckons we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll avoid a full-blown house price crash: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tight supply, a healthy labour market and a continued lengthening of mortgage terms - 30-year loans now are common - will help to prevent prices from falling outright. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But it is inevitable that house prices will grow at a slower rate than households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 incomes during a period of rising mortgage rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd House prices in the North are closing the gap on their Southern cousins. Northern property prices have risen by 3.3% in the last year, a vigorous performance compared to the South\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s softer growth of just 0.5% (dragged down by London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1.9% decline). But.... that only makes a small dent in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing divide. Prices in London, for example, are still more than 50% higher than in 2007 when the financial crisis stuck. In swathes of the North, though, prices are below those levels. House prices growth is slowing in most parts of the UK, Nationwide reports. The Midlands has seen the strongest house price growth recently, followed by Wales and Scotland. But while London lags behind, the average price in the capital (\u00c2\u00a3469k) are still more than twice the national average (\u00c2\u00a3215k). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. House price growth in the UK has fallen to its lowest level in five years, in the latest sign that the market is cooling. Nationwide, the building society, has reported that annual house price growth slowed to 2% this month. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the slowest rate since 2013, with the market dragged down by falling prices in the capital. London was the weakest performing region in the last quarter, Nationwide reports, with prices down 1.9% year-on-year. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, blames weak economic growth and tight household finances, saying: Surveyors continue to report subdued levels of new buyer enquiries, while the supply of properties on the market remains more of a trickle than a torrent. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking further ahead, much will depend on how broader economic conditions evolve, especially in the labour market, but also with respect to interest rates. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Subdued economic activity and ongoing pressure on household budgets is likely to continue to exert a modest drag on housing market activity and house price growth this year, though borrowing costs are likely to remain low. More details and reaction to follow... Also coming up today The Bank of England will highlight key threats to the UK economy when it presents its latest financial stability report this morning. Governor Mark Carney is also facing questions over the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conduct and culture, after it emerged yesterday that two policymakers have run up almost \u00c2\u00a3400,000 in travel expenses in the last couple of years. MPs called the expense \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstaggering\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as we covered in yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liveblog: The criticism is mounting this morning.... The stock markets are still edgy about the prospect of a US-China trade war. Shares have dropped again in Shanghai, but traders hope for a better day in Europe. Retailers could also be under pressure today, as Britain runs low on beer! Not great timing, with the World Cup coming to the boil. Plus, the oil price could be volatile as America puts pressure on other countries to stop buying oil from Iran. The latest oil inventory stats will show whether supplies are holding up.
