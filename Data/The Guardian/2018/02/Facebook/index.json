And, luckily for the ailing dollar, the numbers didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disappoint: the headline figure came in at 200k, far higher than both the 181k expected and the 160k posted in January, with wage growth also outperforming forecasts to remain unchanged at 0.3%. </p> <p>This, alongside a better than expected consumer sentiment reading from the University of Michigan, allowed the dollar to regain some ground lost this week. Against the pound the greenback rose 1%, sending cable back below $1.413, while against the euro the dollar jumped 0.7%, taking the currency away from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $1.25-crossing 3 and a bit year peak. </p> <p>All this hawkishness was toxic for the Dow Jones, which plunged 300 points once the bell rang on Wall Street to hit 25900 for the first time in over a fortnight. This Dow drop only exacerbated the losses in Europe; the DAX and CAC both fell 1.3%, with the former on track for its worst close since September last year, while the FTSE slipped 0.7% to strike a sub-7450, near 8 week nadir. </p> <p>As for Bitcoin, while things are still bad, they are nowhere near as disastrous as they were at lunchtime. It had at one point found itself trading at $7750, a price not seen since the end of November, only for a wave of buyers to rescue it from those lows and send it back above $8650. Still, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly been a week to forget for the cryptocurrency, with a hat-trick of bad news \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a shift in regulations in South Korea, a Facebook ban on ads for the product, and an investigation by the US CFTC \u00e2\u20ac\u201c causing it to shed around $3000 per Bitcoin. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a748180e4b08ad1ec3ee490\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-02T15:21:11.069Z\">3.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With the dollar recovering in the expectation of an imminent US interest rate rise, the pound has lost some of its recent gains.</p> <p>Sterling is down more than 1% on the day against the dollar to $1.4119, its biggest daily fall since November last year.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a748009e4b0839ae39a8564\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-02T15:17:46.392Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The university of Michigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey may have come in better than expected but it did show the consumer sentiment index at its lowest level since September. However chief economist Richard Curtin was positive about the overall picture:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Consumer sentiment has remained largely unchanged for more than a year at very favorable levels. The January Sentiment figure was just 0.2 Index-points below December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, and just 1.1 points below the 2017 average of 96.8--which was the highest yearly average since 2000. Stock price increases and the passage of tax reforms were mentioned by all-time record numbers of consumers. To be sure, there were small offsetting declines among lower income households and residents of the Northeast.</p> <p> Consumers continued to expect growth in jobs and incomes, but anticipated a slightly higher inflation rate. Importantly, the motivating force behind purchase decisions has shifted from discounts on prices and interest rates to increased confidence in future job security and growth in wages as well as financial assets.

It has naturally sparked questions of whether a larger correction is in store. The Dow Jones has pulled back 3% while the FTSE 100 has dropped nearly 4.5%. These are relatively small moves and based on recent experience, the mostly likely scenario is dip-buyers step in to send markets back up again. However, maybe this time will be different. The market has reached some new extremes in sentiment during January and certain risk-factors, notably the rise in bond yields, could point to further stock market declines.</p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conceivable that the Bitcoin bubble bursting has meant retail equity investors were meeting less margin calls.</p> <p>Rising bond yields have put stock markets on high alert. 2.6% was the first \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworry level\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in 10-year US treasuries. A 3% 10-year treasury yield is the big kahuna for a larger stock market correction. After many stops and starts in US interest rate rises, investors increasingly seem to be feeling like this tightening cycle could be here to stay. The phenomenon is global though. The UK gilt yield has hit its highest since May 2016. India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year bond yield hit a fresh 22-month high.

Economist James Knightley says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US jobs report is very strong with payrolls rising 200,000 versus expectations of 180,000. There were some chunky upward revisions too, but the big story is wage growth which looks much, much better. Wages are now growing 2.9% year on year (the fastest rate of growth since 2009) with last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure revised up to 2.7% from 2.5%. Unemployment stays at 4.1%, but given the strength of this report it is hard to argue against a March Fed rate hike now.</p> <p>Wage growth has been the missing link in the strong economic growth, tight jobs market story. We have been hoping for some time to see a turnaround and it does finally look as though something is happening. It backs up evidence from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Federation of Independent Businesses small business survey, which showed the net proportion of businesses raising worker compensation is at its highest since 2000. The report also showed you have to go all the way back to 1989 to find when the index indicating the net proportion of businesses that plan to raise worker pay was higher. </p> <p>Given companies such as WalMart have credited Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts as a way for them to afford higher worker pay we suspect we will see the wage numbers pick-up further. Rising wages and robust economic growth is also supportive for our 3% headline CPI call for this summer.</p> <p>Consequently, it will need a big shock to prevent the Fed from hiking in March, but it could happen in the form of a damaging government shutdown should politicians fail to resolve their differences \u00e2\u20ac\u201c next deadline is February 8. Nonetheless, it looks more and more likely that we will have to revise up our call for three Fed rate hikes this year to four.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a746cb2e4b08ad1ec3ee381\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-02T13:52:48.966Z\">1.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US firms are facing a real scramble to find staff to hire, reckons Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist of RSM.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/joebrusuelas/status/959423304594575360\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">US January NFP: Strong Employment Report.

Selling pressure at the moment is intense as there has been nothing but bad news for bitcoin bulls of late.</p> <p>The key concern facing the bulls is the CFTC investigation into Tether and the Bitfinex exchange. Claims of full dollar convertibility are under scrutiny. Given there are about 2bn tether coins in existence, there should be a $2bn account somewhere but Tether has yet to prove it or have accounts audited.</p> <p>The idea that Tether is creating coins to buy bitcoin is straight out of satire. If bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, then this is Ponzi squared; printing fake money to buy a different type of fake money in order to ramp up the price of the latter. If it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t likely to cause real world losses for many investors it would be hilarious.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we see the jaws of the regulatory crunch closing on other fronts with moves to ban or greatly restrict trading on bitcoin gaining traction worldwide.

This would boost small businesses, and tackle the uncompetitive nature of the current outsourcing market. It would also protect the government from another Carillion crisis.</p> <p>Secondly, public contracts should not be awarded solely on the basis of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153value for money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Government contracts should be seen as an opportunity to create public value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where value is understood in holistic rather than narrow economistic terms. The government should account for the wider economic and social impact of its suppliers when determining which supplier should be awarded a particular contract. The Labour party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposals to account for the quantity and quality of employment created by a supplier, the nature of its corporate governance, its environmental impact and its attitude towards tax suggests how this could be done.</p> <p>Thirdly, we need to call time on private financing. If the government wants to build a major infrastructure project it should do so through historically cheap public borrowing, on the public balance sheet, justifying the investment based on the economic, social, or environmental impact. Good public investment done well more than pays for itself in the long run. It should also expand its definition of investment to include investment in human as well as physical capital \u00e2\u20ac\u201c spending on healthcare and education is just as much of an investment in the long-run economic capacity of this country as investments in roads and bridges.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More here: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2018/02/problem-outsourcing-not-carillion-market-itself\">The problem with outsourcing is not Carillion but the market itself</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a743884e4b0839ae39a81dc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-02T10:12:34.890Z\">10.12am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Carillion: 377 staff made redundant</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>NEWSFLASH: Nearly 400 Carillion staff have just been made redundant, following its fall into liquidation last month.</strong></p> <p>The Official Receiver says it has managed to save more than 900 jobs, but 377 more have lost their jobs.

                "bodyText":"New York traders will be catching their breath and counting their losses after this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declines. So, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our updated news story on the markets today: Wall Street ended its worst week in two years on Friday with another sharp fall as markets in Europe also continued to tumble from the record-high levels reached less than a month ago. Investors headed for the exits amid growing fears over a bond market rout, triggered by early signs of inflation in the US as economic growth accelerates and wages appear to finally be rising after years of stagnation. US government bond yields, which rise as prices fall, hit the highest level since January 2014. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 665 points to end the day down more than 2.5% and falling below 26,000, the record level it hit on 17 January. The sell-off came after the US labor department released a better than expected monthly jobs report, sparking fears of a sharper rise in interest rates. It was the first time since June 2016 that the Dow had fallen more than 500 points. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all from us for this week. Thanks for reading and commenting. Goodnight! Bitcoin, incidentally, is still off its earlier lows. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down 5% today at $8,556. The Dow finished 665.75 points lower. So it you round it down..... Each of the 30 companies on the Dow fell today. The worst performers were Chevron (-5.5%), Exxon (-5.1%) and Goldman Sachs (-4.5%). Tech stocks also had a bad day, with Apple down 4.3%. Over on the Nasdaq (which lost 2%), Alphabet slid by 5% after Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company missed expectations with its financial results last night. What caused the selloff? There are several factors, but the most significant may be today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report - showing wages rose by 2.9% over the last year. That increase in earnings could push up inflation, forcing US interest rates higher. It was a poor week for the S&amp;P 500 (a broader stock market index than the Dow) Traders on Wall Street will be nursing bruises; the Dow has lost 1,095 point this week. This looks like the third-biggest one-day points decline on the Dow ever! It also looks like the biggest points decline since the aftermath of Lehman Brothers collapse. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that historic. In percentage terms, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls are much less dramatic - but still a concern... NEWSFLASH: The US stock market has recorded its worst week in two years, after a wave of selling hit Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has tumbled by almost 670 points, or 2.5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest percentage fall since June 2016, the day after the Brexit vote, and means the Dow has shed over 1,000 points this week. One important point - a 600-point plunge isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t what it used to be, due to the strong market rally over the last 15 month. Wall Street is staggering towards the finishing line.... with five minutes to go, the Dow is down 675 points or 2,5%. Inflation fears, worries about the bond market, and rising political tensions are all hitting the markets today, according to CNN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest market report. Ken Odeluga, market analyst with City Index in London says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a smorgasbord of negativity...It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been pretty nervous all week.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Earlier today, president Trump approved the release of a memo alleging that the FBI had been biased against Trump over their investigations into possible Russian interference in the US elections. That move is weighing on investors, according to Ian Winer, head of equities at Wedbush Securities. He warns: There looks like a breakdown of the institutions in our country. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No matter what side you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not good.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Dow is now at a three-week low: Make that a 624-point fall...! Heading into the last hour of trading, the Dow is now down 576 points, or 2.2%. This could be the US stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst day since the aftermath of the Brexit vote.... The selloff is gathering speed! The Dow Jones industrial average is now down by 500 points, or almost 2%. Oil giant Exxon is still the biggest faller, down 5.5%, followed by Chevron (-4.1%) and Apple (-3.4%). Investors seem to be increasingly spooked by the prospect of US interest rate rises, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent US jobs report - which showed a pick-up in hiring and wages. Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco, explains: A big wage growth number is the biggest risk to the stock market rally, because it means the Fed may get more aggressive in raising interest rates. Here are a few photos from Wall Street, as traders try to keep pace with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our colleague Richard Partington on the stock market losses today: Wall Street was heading for its worst week in two years on Friday as markets in Europe also continued to tumble from record-high levels reached less than a month ago. Investors headed for the exits amid growing fears over a bond market rout, triggered by early signs of inflation in the US as economic growth accelerates. US government bond yields, which rise as prices fall, hit the highest level since January 2014. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell almost 400 points in early trading in New York, hitting a low of 25,787. Amid a widespread sell-off, the biggest fallers were Apple, Visa and oil firms Exxon and Chevron. In Europe, the FTSE 100 recorded its worst week since April last year when Theresa May called the snap election, dropping by 47 points to 7,443, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax fell 1.7%. The worst week for stocks under Donald Trump comes after one of the best years in history for shares in 2017 and just a week after the Dow hit a record high of 26,617. More here: With two and a half hours trading to go, Wall Street is solidly in the red. The Dow is down 1.5%, or almost 400 points, at 25,789 points. The wider S&amp;P 500 is off 1.1%, while the Nasdaq has lost almost 1%. Given the losses earlier this week, Marketwatch agrees that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on track for the worst weekly losses in two years. The markets in Mexico, Brazil and Canada are also having a bad day.... US wages may be growing, but so is inequality, says Dominic Rushe It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a long, slow recovery for US workers but wages finally appear to be growing again, according to the latest jobs report released on Friday. But behind the headline rate the figures show \u00e2\u20ac\u201c once more \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that inequality is on the rise. On Friday the labor department released its latest monthly jobs update. The US added 200,000 new positions in January, higher than expected, but the real surprise was in wage growth. Hourly earnings rose 0.3% in January, enough to lift the annual rate up to 2.9%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This may be the start of a welcome trend in wage gains, and marks the highest percentage increase in average hourly earnings since 2009,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said US secretary of labour Alexander Acosta. A tightening labour market and unemployment at 4.1% (a 17-year low) appears finally to be making its way into people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pockets as employers are forced to raise wages in order to attract talent. But the big numbers hide an ominous trend. For many Americans, slow wage growth isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just a hangover of the post-2008 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great recession\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. For those without a college degree the sluggish rate of growth can be traced back to the 1970s, and the more recent slump deepened that inequality. The full report is here: It was a bad day all round for global markets. The FTSE 100, as we mentioned earlier, has suffered its worst week since last April With poor results from Deutsche Bank to add to those of Daimler earlier this week, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has also dropped sharply, recording its biggest weekly fall since February 2016. And Wall Street continues to come under the cosh, as the better than expected jobs and confidence numbers add to the belief that interest rises are on the way. Investors have begun to take seriously the fact that central banks are removing the financial punchbowl which has powered markets for the past few years, and perhaps at a faster pace than had been expected. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 46.96 points or 0.63% to 7443.43 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.68% to 12,785.16 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 1.64% lower at 5364.98 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished down 1.44% at 23,202.66 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.81% lower at 10,211.2 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 358 points or 1.37%. Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide continues. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 384 points. The FTSE 100 has closed down 0.63% at 7443.43, as part of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global market sell 0ff. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index is down 2.9%, making it the worst weekly performance since 21 April last year when it lost....2.91%. That incidentally was the week Theresa May decided to call a snap UK general election. Happy days. A quick summary of how bad it has been this week for US markets: Back with bitcoin, and it has been through the classic rollercoaster ride today. Having fallen as low as $7625 it is now actually in positive territory for the day, up 0.12% at $9010. More on the disparities in the US wage growth data: Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The US open made a miserable day all the worse for the European markets, while Bitcoin managed to pull back from the brink. Following Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkish hold from the Federal Reserve, there was arguably more interest in this non-farm Friday than there has been for a while. And, luckily for the ailing dollar, the numbers didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disappoint: the headline figure came in at 200k, far higher than both the 181k expected and the 160k posted in January, with wage growth also outperforming forecasts to remain unchanged at 0.3%. This, alongside a better than expected consumer sentiment reading from the University of Michigan, allowed the dollar to regain some ground lost this week. Against the pound the greenback rose 1%, sending cable back below $1.413, while against the euro the dollar jumped 0.7%, taking the currency away from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $1.25-crossing 3 and a bit year peak. All this hawkishness was toxic for the Dow Jones, which plunged 300 points once the bell rang on Wall Street to hit 25900 for the first time in over a fortnight. This Dow drop only exacerbated the losses in Europe; the DAX and CAC both fell 1.3%, with the former on track for its worst close since September last year, while the FTSE slipped 0.7% to strike a sub-7450, near 8 week nadir. As for Bitcoin, while things are still bad, they are nowhere near as disastrous as they were at lunchtime. It had at one point found itself trading at $7750, a price not seen since the end of November, only for a wave of buyers to rescue it from those lows and send it back above $8650. Still, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly been a week to forget for the cryptocurrency, with a hat-trick of bad news \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a shift in regulations in South Korea, a Facebook ban on ads for the product, and an investigation by the US CFTC \u00e2\u20ac\u201c causing it to shed around $3000 per Bitcoin. With the dollar recovering in the expectation of an imminent US interest rate rise, the pound has lost some of its recent gains. Sterling is down more than 1% on the day against the dollar to $1.4119, its biggest daily fall since November last year. The university of Michigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey may have come in better than expected but it did show the consumer sentiment index at its lowest level since September. However chief economist Richard Curtin was positive about the overall picture: Consumer sentiment has remained largely unchanged for more than a year at very favorable levels. The January Sentiment figure was just 0.2 Index-points below December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, and just 1.1 points below the 2017 average of 96.8--which was the highest yearly average since 2000. Stock price increases and the passage of tax reforms were mentioned by all-time record numbers of consumers. To be sure, there were small offsetting declines among lower income households and residents of the Northeast. Consumers continued to expect growth in jobs and incomes, but anticipated a slightly higher inflation rate. Importantly, the motivating force behind purchase decisions has shifted from discounts on prices and interest rates to increased confidence in future job security and growth in wages as well as financial assets. This renewed sense of confidence was responsible for the recent declines in savings rates. he tax cuts will increase discretionary spending once higher energy bills due to the unusually cold weather are paid. Monetary policy will need to tighten in the year ahead, but given consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decade long experience with record low interest rates, only modest increases in interest rates will be sufficient to curb any excesses. Overall, the data signal an expected gain of 2.8% in real personal consumption expenditures during 2018. The upbeat consumer confidence figures have sent Wall Street even lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 300 points or more than 1.1%. More positive news for the US economy, adding to the belief that the Federal Reserve will be ready to raise interest rates next month. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index came in at 95.7 in January, up from an initial reading of 94.4 and better than the expected figure of 95. It was however slightly lower than December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final reading of 95.9. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, suggests the slump in bitcoin could be one of the reasons for the current weakness in global stock markets: Markets participants found themselves in the rare position of witnessing falling prices this week. It has naturally sparked questions of whether a larger correction is in store. The Dow Jones has pulled back 3% while the FTSE 100 has dropped nearly 4.5%. These are relatively small moves and based on recent experience, the mostly likely scenario is dip-buyers step in to send markets back up again. However, maybe this time will be different. The market has reached some new extremes in sentiment during January and certain risk-factors, notably the rise in bond yields, could point to further stock market declines. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conceivable that the Bitcoin bubble bursting has meant retail equity investors were meeting less margin calls. Rising bond yields have put stock markets on high alert. 2.6% was the first \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworry level\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in 10-year US treasuries. A 3% 10-year treasury yield is the big kahuna for a larger stock market correction. After many stops and starts in US interest rate rises, investors increasingly seem to be feeling like this tightening cycle could be here to stay. The phenomenon is global though. The UK gilt yield has hit its highest since May 2016. India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year bond yield hit a fresh 22-month high. Rising interest rates mean the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgoldilocks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scenario for markets is warming up to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdaddy bear\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. As expected US markets are in negative territory after the better than expected jobs figures gave a boost to the flagging dollar. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 217 points or 0.8%, on track for its worst weekly performance since January 2016..The S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.6% while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.55% lower. The rise in average earnings is not spread across the board: Here are the jobs data charts: Pantheon economist Ian Shepherdson reckons the jobs data should be good for shares. Wall Street futures have improved as we approach the opening of the US market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now forecast to open around 200 points lower, better than the 250 loss predicted in the immediate aftermath of the better than expected jobs figures. Kully Samra, UK managing director at Charles Schwab expects US rate rises this year. And increased market volatility: The US economy started 2018 on a positive note as the labour market continues to tighten. This latest set of job numbers supports the view that that some of the weakness in December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service-providing industries would revert in January. Tightening labour market conditions and indications of a pickup in wage growth will be welcomed by the Fed which has expressed concern over benign inflation. While the Fed held interest rates steady on Wednesday, we expect a hike in March as Jerome Powell is expected to continue down the familiar path of keeping inflation under control without raising rates so far or so fast as to stifle the improvement in growth expected this year. We continue to believe the Fed will hike rates at least three times this year and that, along with the paring of its balance sheet, historically-low financial conditions may start to tighten. However, with the outlook for inflation continuing to be carefully monitored, we do expect a higher level of volatility in the stock market this year relative to 2017. The big picture is that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has been creating jobs each month since early into Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first term, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s held steady under Donald Trump too. The upbeat US jobs figures makes it likely there will be an interest rate rise in March barring unforeseen circumstances, according to ING Bank. Economist James Knightley says: The US jobs report is very strong with payrolls rising 200,000 versus expectations of 180,000. There were some chunky upward revisions too, but the big story is wage growth which looks much, much better. Wages are now growing 2.9% year on year (the fastest rate of growth since 2009) with last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure revised up to 2.7% from 2.5%. Unemployment stays at 4.1%, but given the strength of this report it is hard to argue against a March Fed rate hike now. Wage growth has been the missing link in the strong economic growth, tight jobs market story. We have been hoping for some time to see a turnaround and it does finally look as though something is happening. It backs up evidence from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Federation of Independent Businesses small business survey, which showed the net proportion of businesses raising worker compensation is at its highest since 2000. The report also showed you have to go all the way back to 1989 to find when the index indicating the net proportion of businesses that plan to raise worker pay was higher. Given companies such as WalMart have credited Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts as a way for them to afford higher worker pay we suspect we will see the wage numbers pick-up further. Rising wages and robust economic growth is also supportive for our 3% headline CPI call for this summer. Consequently, it will need a big shock to prevent the Fed from hiking in March, but it could happen in the form of a damaging government shutdown should politicians fail to resolve their differences \u00e2\u20ac\u201c next deadline is February 8. Nonetheless, it looks more and more likely that we will have to revise up our call for three Fed rate hikes this year to four. US firms are facing a real scramble to find staff to hire, reckons Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist of RSM. President Trump will probably enjoy today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While criticism of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s embattled White House continues to mount, job growth continues to go through the gears, with the latest nonfarm payroll figures proving job creation remains a competence within the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capabilities. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Buoyant domestic and global demand, particularly for the manufacturing sector, appear the drivers in higher-than-anticipated numbers, and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal stimulus package is clearly a shot in the arm for economic growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, with the economy close to full employment, increased pressure on wages looks an inevitable consequence. So higher inflation is surely on the cards, with taller interest rates set to arrive over the coming months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A good jobs report = falling shares and bonds. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because traders suspect it means US interest rates will rise faster than expected, as inflation worries encourage central bankers to empty the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpunch bowl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of loose monetary policy. Financial experts like the look of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US labor market report. This is from Christopher Vecchio of DailyFX.com: Jeremy Cook of World First and Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Economics are both impressed by the wage growth: Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeanna Smialek suggests that the Phillips curve may not be dead after all (the idea that inflation rises when unemployment falls). Economist Shaun Richards has spotted that bars and restaurants hired more staff last month: The dollar has climbed and US bond yields have risen following the better then expected jobs and wages figures. But the expected opening losses on Wall Street have increased according to the future market, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average forecast to open down around 250 points. Before the jobs data it was around 220 points lower. The dollar index has risen 0.3% to 88.95 while 10 year Treasury yields have hit a near four year high at 2.818%. And the price of 30 year bonds has fallen more than a point with yields at their highest level since March 2017. BREAKING: The US economy created 200,000 new jobs last month, a little more than Wall Street had expected. December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure have been revised up too, to 160,000 new jobs (from 146,000). The US jobless rate remains at 4.1%, a 17-year low. Wages rose too, by 0.3% during the month and a healthy 2.9% year-on-year (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s average hourly earnings) It looks like a pretty decent jobs report, at first glance. Well, this rather sums up the crypto bubble. Long Blockchain Corp -- formally known as Long Island Iced Tea -- has announced that it has abandoned plans to buy bitcoin mining equipment. Long Island rebranded itself as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcblockchain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 company late last year, a move that caused its share price to quadruple. It is pressing on with its proposed merger with technology companyStater Blockchain Limited, but has ditched plans to buy \u00e2\u20ac\u01531,000 Antminer S9 mining rigs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to mine new bitcoins. More here.... Tension is building in the markets as investors brace for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report, due at 8.30am East Coast time (1.30pm in the UK). As usual, Wall Street experts have a range of predictions. The consensus is that 180,000 new jobs were created in January. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the wage growth figures that could move the markets; a (welcome) rise in earnings would make US interest rate rises more likely -- potentially bad news for bond prices and shares too. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide, and Nouriel Roubini\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns:: Hold onto your hats. Bitcoin is clambering off the mat, and bouncing back to $8,500. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a 5% loss today, though... This is turning into a rather bad day for digital currencies. Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin et al are all suffering double-digit losses. Despite the recent plunge, bitcoin is still worth rather more than a year ago.... Bitcoin is being hit by two different issues (as explained earlier). Firstly, you have the growing threat of regulation, with India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister pledging yesterday to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceliminate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the use of digital currencies by criminals. That follows similar similar warnings from politicians in the UK, US and South Korea. Secondly, you have the investigation into Bitfinex (a leading digital currency exchange), and crypto firm tether. Regulators are questioning whether tether, whose coins are used to trade digital currency, are actually fully backed by US dollars as it claims. As Bloomberg explains: Tether\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coins have become a popular substitute for dollars on cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide, with about $2.3 billion of the tokens outstanding as of Tuesday. While Tether has said all of its coins are backed by U.S. dollars held in reserve, the company has yet to provide conclusive evidence of its holdings to the public or have its accounts audited. Skeptics have questioned whether the money is really there. This double-dose of bad news is sparking a rout across the sector, sending bitcoin sliding through $8,000 (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $7,888 right now). Neil Wilson of ETX Capital reckons that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the wheels are coming off the bitcoin bandwagon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The regulatory crunch appears closer than ever and sooner or later this market could be headed back down to earth. Selling pressure at the moment is intense as there has been nothing but bad news for bitcoin bulls of late. The key concern facing the bulls is the CFTC investigation into Tether and the Bitfinex exchange. Claims of full dollar convertibility are under scrutiny. Given there are about 2bn tether coins in existence, there should be a $2bn account somewhere but Tether has yet to prove it or have accounts audited. The idea that Tether is creating coins to buy bitcoin is straight out of satire. If bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, then this is Ponzi squared; printing fake money to buy a different type of fake money in order to ramp up the price of the latter. If it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t likely to cause real world losses for many investors it would be hilarious. Meanwhile, we see the jaws of the regulatory crunch closing on other fronts with moves to ban or greatly restrict trading on bitcoin gaining traction worldwide. Ultimately if the CFTC decides bitcoin prices have been manipulated it casts a huge shadow of bitcoin and entire crypto market. At Davos last week, a series of experts cast doubt over bitcoin -- those predictions seem to be being born out today.... Ouch! Bitcoin has just tumbled through the $8,000 mark. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now trading at $7985 on the Bitstamp exchange, down over 11% this morning as volatile trading continues to rock the digital currency sector. This inflicts further losses on those who bought into bitcoin late last year. Bitcoin has now lost around 40% of its value this year (bitcoin started the New Year at $13,880), and 60% since its all-time peak in December. The US stock market is heading for another bath. The Dow Jones is being called down around 220 points, or 0.8%, amid nervousness ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll jobs report. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 index is now down 1.1% - and facing its biggest weekly loss since the US presidential election in November 2016. In London, the FTSE 100 is extending its recent losses. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down another 28 points, or 0.3%, at 7461, its lowest level since 15 December. Investors are ignoring last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong results from Amazon, in favour of fretting about the bond market again. Bond yields (which rise when prices fall) are climbing, on the back of concerns that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts will drive up US borrowing. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA says trading is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rocky\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Europe today. He points to the volatility in the bond market, where UK and German government debt has weakened: Gilt yields are at their highest since May 2015 and Bunds at their highest since September 2015. This may well be contributing to the declines we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen recently across Europe \u00e2\u20ac\u201c along with the corresponding appreciation of the euro and pound \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and could now be taking its toll on US stocks. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily mean we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve entered a risk-off period or that stocks are headed for a correction but a sharp rise in yields, as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen, can also weigh on equity markets. The FT has a good take on the anxiety in the bond markets: The US is heading into some of its biggest budget deficits outside of wars and recessions as Congress debates increasing ceilings on federal spending on top of December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trillion-dollar tax cuts. Lawmakers are contemplating lifting caps on defence and non-defence spending as they seek a funding deal in coming weeks. The Bipartisan Policy Center, a non-partisan think-tank, predicts that Congress will settle on plans that drive the deficit to 5.7 per cent of US gross domestic product in 2019 as annual borrowing exceeds $1.1tn. That would be well short of deficits as a share of GDP reached after the Great Recession or the second world war. But it would be comparable to the shortfall after the recession of the early 1980s under Ronald Reagan, even though the US is now at or beyond full employment and the global economy is in its strongest upswing in a decade.

Economics professor Nouriel Roubini has just been on Bloomberg TV, blasting bitcoin as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153biggest Ponzi scheme in human history\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Roubini claims that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153charlatans and swindlers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd drove digital currencies to record levels last year, before cashing their profits. Ordinary punters, who bought bitcoin when it was trading around $20,000, have lost 60% of their shirts since, says Roubini. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rob Davies on the job losses at Carillion: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good piece in the New Statesman today about the problems in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outsourcing sector, and the lessons to be learned. In it, Grace Blakeley argues that the demise of Carillion, and Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial problems, show that the outsourcing market is failing, and must change. Blakeley says: Firstly, rather than granting contracts to a small number of huge multinationals which then commission other, smaller specialist firms to do the work, the government should get rid of the middle man and deal with suppliers directly. This would boost small businesses, and tackle the uncompetitive nature of the current outsourcing market. It would also protect the government from another Carillion crisis. Secondly, public contracts should not be awarded solely on the basis of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153value for money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Government contracts should be seen as an opportunity to create public value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where value is understood in holistic rather than narrow economistic terms. The government should account for the wider economic and social impact of its suppliers when determining which supplier should be awarded a particular contract. The Labour party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposals to account for the quantity and quality of employment created by a supplier, the nature of its corporate governance, its environmental impact and its attitude towards tax suggests how this could be done. Thirdly, we need to call time on private financing. If the government wants to build a major infrastructure project it should do so through historically cheap public borrowing, on the public balance sheet, justifying the investment based on the economic, social, or environmental impact. Good public investment done well more than pays for itself in the long run. It should also expand its definition of investment to include investment in human as well as physical capital \u00e2\u20ac\u201c spending on healthcare and education is just as much of an investment in the long-run economic capacity of this country as investments in roads and bridges. More here: The problem with outsourcing is not Carillion but the market itself NEWSFLASH: Nearly 400 Carillion staff have just been made redundant, following its fall into liquidation last month. The Official Receiver says it has managed to save more than 900 jobs, but 377 more have lost their jobs. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re now being told to contact the JobCentre. The employees whose jobs have been saved work on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153infrastructure, central and local government, and construction contracts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They are now being transferred to new employees who have taken on these contracts. Carillion employed almost 20,000 staff in the UK, so thousands more Carillion workers still face an uncertain future. A spokesperson for the Official Receiver says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As part of the ongoing liquidation of the Carillion group I am pleased we have been able to safeguard the jobs of 919 employees today. Most staff are transferring on existing or similar terms and I will continue to facilitate this wherever possible as we work to find new providers for Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other contracts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite best efforts it has not been possible to secure the jobs of 377 staff, who will be made redundant. Those affected will be entitled to make a claim for statutory redundancy payments. The Jobcentre Plus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Rapid Response Service stands ready to support any of these employees by providing advice and information so people can move into a new job as quickly as possible. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I recognise that this will be a worrying time for all those affected, their families and local communities. I would like to thank all staff for their professionalism throughout the liquidation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am expecting many employees working on other Carillion contracts to transfer in the coming weeks and we are continuing to keep the workforce updated as these are arrangements are finalised.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Noble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association, fears that we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen the full impact of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse yet. Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply says political and economic uncertainty is hitting the UK construction sector, pushing it towards stagnation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The blocks to progress included a sharp rise in costs and a shortage of key materials, which contributed to longer lead times as supplier capabilities were stretched to their limits. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Against this challenging backdrop, though larger orders from cautious clients also failed to materialise, firms retained a sunny disposition with optimism at a seven-month high and a slight rise in employment continued. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With construction teetering on the edge of contraction, this surprise outcome will serve as a jolt to policymakers, that the impact of political and economic uncertainty remains large at the beginning of 2018.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sam Teague, Economist at IHS Markit, says there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much New Year cheer in the building sector: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI data indicated a difficult start to 2018 for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector, underlined by business activity growth slumping to a four-month low and new orders sliding back into decline. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A contraction in house building added to lacklustre commercial building and civil engineering markets, and reduced inflows of new work suggest overall activity could slip into decline in February. Furthermore, cost pressures remained intense, fuelled by shortages of input materials and high costs for imported products. Max Jones, global corporates relationship director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, says the collapse of Carillion has hit the construction sector. Jones explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has clearly been a month like no other for the sector, so this drop in the PMI reading comes as no major surprise. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The impact of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liquidation has rippled down the supply chain and shaken confidence across the industry. There have inevitably been fears for the sub-contractors with exposure to the collapse, though some have drawn down on emergency support from banks, including the \u00c2\u00a350m Lloyds fund. Tens of thousands of small construction companies, and other suppliers, across the UK were hit by Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock liquidation in early January. Work was halted at two major hospitals, while other firms were forced to lay off staff as they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unlikely to be paid for work carried out for Carillion. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction industry has slowed to near stagnation, and housebuilding is in decline. Data firm Markit reports that UK building companies experienced a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153subdued start to 2018\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with total industry activity barely rising. Its monthly construction PMI, which measures activity, dropped to just 50.2 for January from 52.2 in December. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worryingly closed to the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. In another blow, housebuilding activity shrank - while civil engineering work picked up. Job creation across the construction industry also slowed, to an 18-month low. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fresh hit to apprentices already reeling from the collapse of Carillion last month. Markit says: A return to contraction in residential building activity was accompanied by near-stagnant commercial and civil engineering activity. New orders declined, linked by many companies to market uncertainty. On a more positive note, confidence towards future growth prospects improved, with many firms anticipating an increase in new project wins later in the year. More to follow... This is turning into bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst week since 2013.... Of course, bitcoin has always bounced back from its previous slumps (five years ago it was worth just $20). But is this time different?.... Telecoms group BT is also having a bad morning. Shares have fallen over 5% to 241.3p, a five-year low, after some underwhelming results this morning. Profits over the last nine months are down 9%, and the company has also reported a fall in TV customers - despite splashing out on live Ashes coverage (given England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance, perhaps they should have spared us....) My colleague Mark Sweney points out that BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer division seems to be slowing, while its IT services division continues to struggle.... At the risk of labouring the point..... Economics professor Nouriel Roubini says the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmother of all bubbles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is now deflating fast: European stock markets are on the back foot again this morning, with losses across the board. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is the worst performer. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being dragged down by Deutsche Bank, which has lost almost 6% after reporting a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac497m loss for 2017 (alongside that $70m fine) Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Naeem Aslam of Think Markets on bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline: Bitcoin below 10K tells you only one message which is the upward momentum has died out and the odds are that we would continue to consolidate or grind lower. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx agrees that bitcoin is firmly on the back foot. The biggest story this Friday didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t belong to the traditional markets, however, but Bitcoin. Opening Monday at $11700 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c remember at its 2017 it hit $20000 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is now struggling to keep its head above $8400, following a week that dealt blow after blow to the cryptocurrency. First there was the introduction of new regulations on anonymous trading accounts in South Korea, one of Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest markets, followed by reports that Facebook would be banning cryptocurrency adverts on its site. Now comes the news that Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pre-Christmas rise is being investigated by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission for market manipulation, closing out a horrible few days for the previously ascendant product. Deutsche Bank has been fined $70m (\u00c2\u00a349m) by US regulators for attempting to rig a benchmark for interest-rate derivatives and other financial instruments. The bank agreed the settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission after investigators found traders sought to manipulate rates from 2007 until May 2012. It is alleged the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff knew they were breaking the law, with one trader telling a broker that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a lot of people would actually do jail time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if practices were exposed. James McDonald, the CFTC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director of enforcement, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no room in our markets for manipulation. We will continue to work hard to stamp it out, wherever we find it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A spokesperson for Deutsche Bank said it had co-operated with the investigation and had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153undertaken significant efforts to remediate benchmark-related activities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets reckons bitcoin is following a familiar pattern: Miles Eakers, chief market analyst at Centtrip, says Bitcoin has made a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153woeful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd start to the new year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The drop followed comments made by India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Minister of Finance, Arun Jaitley, that the Indian government \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdoes not consider cryptocurrencies legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto-assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We anticipate there will be more of such protectionist regulation. This is likely to put Bitcoin under more strain, causing it to drop to the $8000 a coin level.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd January was a cruel month for digital currency fans, and February isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turning out much better. Bitcoin has fallen by 5% this morning to $8,521, its lowest level since late November. That means it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lost more than half its value since peaking near $20,000 in the week before Christmas. The selloff follows reports that American regulators are investigating whether last autumn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price surge had been caused by market manipulation. According to Bloomberg, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has been investigating the Bitfinex exchange and a cryptocurrency company called Tether. Fortune Magazine has a good explanation: Specifically, regulators are curious about Bitfinex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with virtual currency Tether, which the exchange claims is pegged to the dollar. So in theory, one dollar equals one Tether. Tether has become a popular way for some investors to buy Bitcoin on exchanges. But the CFTC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probe feeds into worries that Tether may not be actually backed by the dollar, as Bitfinex has provided little proof of the relationship, critics say. That hazy relationship has fueled concerns that Bitfinex may be simply creating Tether coins out of thin air and using Tether to buy Bitcoin\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthereby propping up the price of the latter asset. Digital currencies have also been hit by the news that Facebook is banning all adverts for cryptocurrencies. India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister added to their woes, by saying his country doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept cryptocurrencies as legal tender and pledging to fight their use for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153illegitimate activities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we discover how America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market is faring, when January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll is released. Economists predict that around 180,000 new jobs were created last month, up from December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing 148,000 (which might get revised today). That should leave the jobless rate at just 4.1%, which is a 17-year low, although it could possibly drop to just 4.0%. If so, expect some gleeful tweeting from President Trump...... The key issue, though, is whether wage growth picked up. It could rise to 2.6% from last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.5%, which could fuel expectations of higher inflation in America. Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics says: The tightening labour market is yet to put much upward pressure on wage growth, but with core inflation now starting to rebound we suspect that average hourly earnings will not be far behind. Signs of inflationary pressures have already been hitting the bond market in recent days, sending prices down and yields to their highest level in several years. So we could see more action there today. Meanwhile in the UK, we get a new health check on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building sector. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Construction PMI report is expected to show that growth slowed a little in January. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also got financial results from BT and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Deutsche Bank (more shortly....) European stock markets are expected to open a little lower, led by Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda. 9.30am GMT: UK Construction PMI for January 1.30pm GMT: US non-farm payroll jobs report 3pm GMT: University of Michigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey of US consumer sentiment",

                "bodyText":"Poundland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s risque Christmas ads featuring a naughty elf playing strip poker and performing a sex act on a Barbie doll have been banned by the advertising watchdog. The budget retailer posted a series of eight images showing a toy elf in suggestive poses with other toys in the run-up to Christmas. The campaign, dubbed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Elf behaving bad\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, ran on Poundland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Twitter and Facebook accounts with images including the elf on a donkey with the line \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell Rudolph I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found a new piece of ass\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Other images showed the elf having drawn a pair of breasts on a car windscreen, sitting beside a sketch of a penis-shaped Christmas tree, and thrusting a toothbrush between its legs in a sexual manner. The Advertising Standards Authority received 85 complaints that the ads were offensive for depicting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153toy characters and other items displayed in a sexualised manner\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and should not have been put on social media where children could see them. Poundland defended the campaign, arguing it was based on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153humour and double entendres\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that were not intended to be understood by children. The company added that Twitter and Facebook also have policies that are meant to ban under-13s from having accounts. Poundland said it never sought to encourage anyone other than adults to follow its Facebook and Twitter accounts, and that it did not intend to offend anyone. The ASA said Poundland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s social media pages were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not age-gated and could be seen by anyone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The ad watchdog also said that the irreverent Christmas campaign had been shared widely on social media and would have been seen by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a large number of people, including some children\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The ASA banned the campaign saying that depicting a child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s toy in such a sexualised manner, with sexual references and acts, where it could be seen by children was irresponsible and likely to cause widespread offence. After the publication of the ruling, Poundland goaded the ASA on Twitter with a message from the elf locked up at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wormwood Scrubbers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd prison. The tongue-in-cheek message said Britain was the home of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153saucy postcards, Carry On Films and panto\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so it was a shame that the ASA found the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153double entendres hard to swallow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.",

He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the perfect figure for explaining to hardcore voters why the world is the way it is.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Hungarian-American hedge fund owner first hit the headlines in Britain in 1992 after he earned a reported $1bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the title \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the man who broke the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by betting on Black Wednesday. He was back on the front pages on Thursday after it emerged that his foundation had contributed \u00c2\u00a3400,000 to the Best for Britain group, which aims to stop Brexit. The Daily Telegraph called the public, well-advertised campaign a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153secret plot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and described Soros as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a rich gambler \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 accused of meddling in nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s affairs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, prompting angry accusations that it was dredging up antisemitic slurs and shadowy Jewish conspiracies. For much of the 1990s and early 2000s, Soros \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who was born in Budapest in 1930, survived Nazi-occupied Hungary, emigrated to the UK in 1947, then settled in the US and made his fortune on Wall Street \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was a low-key, even appreciated figure. His Open Society Foundations (OSF), the first of which opened in 1984, in Hungary, have funded NGOs advancing human rights, the rule of law, education, public health, LGBT and Roma rights, a free press, and even public transport networks across central and eastern Europe and in more than 120 countries. The OSF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s endowment currently stands at about $18bn, making it the third largest charitable foundation in the world. Since 1979, and Soros\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first act of philanthropy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c scholarships for black South African children under apartheid \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it has given away $14bn. Poland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former president, Bronislaw Komorowski, awarded the financier one of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highest honours in 2012 for his contribution to post-communist civil society. Orb\u00c3\u00a1n himself spent a year at Oxford university in 1989 on a scholarship funded by Soros. But the tide turned against the financier during Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2015 refugee crisis, when his generous backing for the charities helping migrants, and support for the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resettlement plan, brought him into direct conflict with ultra-conservative, right-wing governments including Orb\u00c3\u00a1n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The Hungarian prime minister, on course for re-election next month, now calls Soros \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an American financial speculator attacking Hungary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153destroyed the lives of millions of Europeans\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and has based his election campaign on attacking a supposed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Soros plan\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to flood Hungary with Muslim migrants. Posters have been put up featuring a photograph of the philanthropist, who has donated $400m to Hungarian NGOs, bearing the words: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let Soros have the last laugh.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It is not only in the country of his birth that Soros is demonised. The OSF was ejected from Russia in 2015, as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the security of the state\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Last year, a leading MP from Poland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party called Soros \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the most dangerous man in the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, claiming he was financing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anti-Christian and anti-national activities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The chair of Romania\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling Social Democrats say he has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brought evil to Romania\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Macedonian rightwingers have launched a group called SOS: Stop Operation Soros. In the US, Soros\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support for groups protecting gay and lesbian rights and campaigning to reduce police violence has made him a target for rightwing attacks, further fuelled by donations to Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential campaign and a $10m donation to combating hate crime following the 2016 election of Donald Trump. Rightwing media claimed Soros \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brought in protesters from all over the country\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the anti-Trump Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s March last January. The conservative Breitbart News website has published numerous articles claiming to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153expose Soros\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global network \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 financing liberal, open-border causes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Some attacks go further. The philanthropist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jewish roots and successful career as an international financier mean he fits easily in the role of what the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, the Jewish rights group, called the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153global, manipulative Jewish monster who can be blamed for all evils and problems\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Reviving old antisemitic conspiracy theories, Russian media, for example, have routinely focused on Soros\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jewish background; the state-funded broadcaster RT tweeted in 2016 that he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153did not get his pound of flesh this time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In the US, alt-right campaigners opposed to HR McMaster also used a cartoon showing Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national security adviser being manipulated by puppet masters labelled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Soros\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rothschilds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rothschilds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd label was later changed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Saudis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after complaints of antisemitism.) In Britain, the pro-Brexit campaign Leave.EU has tweeted drawings portraying the Labour MP David Lammy as a puppet with his strings controlled by Soros, and labelled the financier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s philanthropic operations \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Soros Web\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.",

The government has announced plans to build a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac19bn cash buffer that would allow the debt stricken country to cover debt repayments once the bailout programme expires. </p> <p>Market turbulence in the form of more corrections, however, could yet dash plans to create the safety net. Volatility in the wake of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off caused the government to delay trade of the seven -year bond by 48 hours proving that while Greece has progressed both fiscally and in terms of structural reforms it is still at risk of exogenous forces.

Quite possibly so, if we do, what should we do?</p> <p>We stand by our view that the next bear market will be triggered by an expectation of the end of the business cycle. We may now be late cycle, and the end may now be sooner than many had expected, but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it is imminent. So, with the global economy broadly strong, and many companies delivering robust earnings, we think this is a buying opportunity.</p> <p>These periods of correction and uncertainty are not pleasant but they should not be seen as unusual.

As a result, algorithmic trading continues to be an area of focus for the FCA and other regulators across the globe.</p> <p>In general, we are encouraged that firms have taken steps to reduce risks inherent to algorithmic trading. However, further improvement is needed in a number of areas. For example, some firms lacked a suitable process to identify algorithmic trading across their business and did not have appropriate documentation in place to demonstrate suitable development and testing procedures are maintained. In these cases, firms also lacked a robust and comprehensive governance framework.</p> <p>Additionally, firms need to do more work to identify and reduce potential conduct risks created by their algorithmic trading strategies. This includes delivering suitable market abuse training for staff involved in the development and implementation processes.

But the loss was exacerbated by excessive investor complacency \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something that has clearly been removed over the past week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as well as technical factors. This removal of complacency is a healthy development, as is the reduction in equity valuations...</p> <p>We do not expect an immediate resolution of market technical quirks or an end to concerns about the pace of central bank rate hikes.

For a start the recent rise in bond yields - one of the factors behind the sudden turn in sentiment - may not be over yet. Central banks will continue to withdraw the stimulus measures which have supported the market since the financial crisis, which in turn will put pressure on bonds. And the volatility we have seen over the past couple of weeks is also unlikely to fade quickly. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For a market that has enjoyed steady gains and fairly low volatility over the course of the past two years the steepness of the falls speaks to a complacency that has been prevalent for a while now and which appears to have been shattered in the wake of a surge in volatility.</p> <p>How this plays out over the coming days depends on whether the rebound we saw on Friday can translate into some form of base for a continuation of the uptrend that has been in place for the last nine years.

                "bodyText":"After a week which saw some $4tn wiped off the value of global stock markets, there is a better mood among investors at the moment. European markets have moved higher, with the FTSE 100 up 1.3% , Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax 1.7% higher and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbing 1.5%. In early trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has added 292 points or 1.2%, even as US bond prices continue to fall. But analysts expect continued volatilty as the week progresses, with US inflation figures on Wednesday likely to be a key indicator for the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s progress. Meanwhile the City watchdog has warned that firms need to do more to deal with the risks of computerised trading. Elsewhere Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe said further rises in interest rates would be appropriate if the recovery in the global economy and an improving labour market continued to offset any Brexit weakness. Greece is considering more bond issues after successfully raising \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3bn last week. And another 4,418 jobs were saved at the collapsed contractor Carillion. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The recovery in US markets seen late on Friday is continuing as Wall Street opens, despite the continuing strength of US bond yields. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 300 points or 1.25%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are both up around 1%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening calls for the US markets: Shares may be moving higher in the wake of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound on Wall Street, but US bond yields are also on the rise. Normally bond yields fall when markets rise, but 10 year US treasury yields remain at four year highs. Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at Forex.com, said: Have stocks and bond yields decoupled again? Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reversal and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bullish follow-through in the stock markets have not been supported by rising government bond prices. As bonds have continued to sell-off, yields have pushed further higher. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has now climbed to above 2.9% for the first time since early 2014. Should yields march further higher \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is quite possible with the upcoming US inflation and retail sales data to look forward to on Wednesday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then there is a possibility the equity markets could be in for another volatile week. Indeed, we think that far too much technical damage has been incurred in the indices for the bulls to make a quick comeback and with all guns blazing...So, Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bounce may well prove to be a mere dead-cat bounce for stocks. Meanwhile, Greece is watching the markets carefully with an eye to launching more bond sales before its final bailout program ends in August. Helena Smith reports from Athens: After successfully raising \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3bn from its sale of a seven-year bond last week, Athens is now looking to complete at least two more bond sales as part of wider steps to reinforce market access and show investors it can go it alone. The Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has hinted that future issues could include a three-year bond \u00e2\u20ac\u201c launched around the time of the March 4 general elections in Italy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a ten-year bond. The government has announced plans to build a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac19bn cash buffer that would allow the debt stricken country to cover debt repayments once the bailout programme expires. Market turbulence in the form of more corrections, however, could yet dash plans to create the safety net. Volatility in the wake of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off caused the government to delay trade of the seven -year bond by 48 hours proving that while Greece has progressed both fiscally and in terms of structural reforms it is still at risk of exogenous forces. The seven-year bond was sold at a yield of 3.5% with UK investors leading the pack of more than 200 hedge funds, banks and fund managers who lodged bids. The stock market falls we have been seeing are not unusual but did take longer than expected to happen, says Richard Stammers, investment strategist at European Wealth Group. And things are likely to remain volatile, he says: We expect the short term to remain bumpy - possibly very bumpy. The definition of a correction is 10% off from the recent high and of a bear market, 20% off from the year high. So, whilst we are not in bear market territory, we need to recognise for every short term bounce there could be an equal and opposite slide back. Could we see lows of 15%? Quite possibly so, if we do, what should we do? We stand by our view that the next bear market will be triggered by an expectation of the end of the business cycle. We may now be late cycle, and the end may now be sooner than many had expected, but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it is imminent. So, with the global economy broadly strong, and many companies delivering robust earnings, we think this is a buying opportunity. These periods of correction and uncertainty are not pleasant but they should not be seen as unusual. What was unusual was that it took so long to happen. Here is Reuters on the interest rate comments from Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe: Vlieghe said on Monday that a further rise in British interest rates was likely to be appropriate if a strong global economy and a labour market pick-up continued to offset Brexit headwinds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A further rise in interest rates is likely to be appropriate if all those trends continue and we are on a trajectory. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just one hike in November and then we take a very long break,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said at a panel discussion hosted by the Resolution Foundation, a think tank. The central banker also said the level of interest rates that the BoE needs to reach before it starts to reverse its quantitative easing programme could come under review. Previously the BoE has said rates would need to reach around 2 percent before it started to sell its 435 billion pounds ($603 billion) of government bonds, in order to give headroom for future rate cuts during a downturn. Vlieghe said that since then the BoE had found it could cut rates below 0.5 percent. The U.S. Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing experience selling debt holdings would also influence the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision on when to start to sell assets, he said. Another 4,418 jobs at collapsed Carillion have been saved, says the Official Receiver. The staff involved are at prison facilities management, defence bases catering, and cleaning services. So far around a third of Carillion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff have had their employment confirmed. In this latest announcement, the receiver said employment for 59 staff working on paused construction projects could not be secured and they would leave the business. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at online trader XTB, said: MPC voting member Gertjan Vlieghe has been speaking this morning on a panel discussing household debt in London and remarks such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there is increased evidence that tighter labour markets are beginning to have upwards effect on wages\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if there is less credit headwind to the UK economy then we maybe ready for rate hikes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are certainly erring on the side of being hawkish. The comments are even more noteworthy given that Mr Vlieghe is deemed one of the most dovish voting members. More from my colleague Richard Partington who is listening to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gertjan Vlieghe speak at the Resolution Foundation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt conference: (for disruption, read situation - the perils of autocorrect!) City firms need to do more to mitigate the risks of algorithmic trading, according to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial watchdog. Automated trading was suggested as on of the causes of the recent stock market turmoil, with computerised selling accelarating as share prices tumbled. In a new report the Financial Conduct Authority says: Automated technology brings significant benefits to investors, including increased execution speed and reduced costs. However, it can also amplify certain risks. It is essential that key oversight functions, including compliance and risk management, keep pace with technological advancements. In the absence of appropriate systems and controls, the increased speed and complexity of financial markets can turn otherwise manageable errors into extreme events with potentially wide-spread implications. As a result, algorithmic trading continues to be an area of focus for the FCA and other regulators across the globe. In general, we are encouraged that firms have taken steps to reduce risks inherent to algorithmic trading. However, further improvement is needed in a number of areas. For example, some firms lacked a suitable process to identify algorithmic trading across their business and did not have appropriate documentation in place to demonstrate suitable development and testing procedures are maintained. In these cases, firms also lacked a robust and comprehensive governance framework. Additionally, firms need to do more work to identify and reduce potential conduct risks created by their algorithmic trading strategies. This includes delivering suitable market abuse training for staff involved in the development and implementation processes. Firms also need to consider the potential impact their algorithmic trading activity (including the combined impact of multiple algorithmic strategies) may have on the fair and effective operation of financial markets. We will continue to assess whether firms have taken sufficient steps to reduce risks arising from algorithmic trading. Vlieghe says there is increased evidence that tight labour markets are beginning to have an upward effect on wages [another reason for a possible rise in rates]. He adds: The Resolution Foundation is holding a seminar on household debt at the moment, with speakers including the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gertjan Vlieghe: The removal of some of the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent complacency is no bad thing, says Joseph Amato at investment management group Neuberger Berman: Before last week, the last meaningful market correction took place in 2016, when investors were concerned about the potential for a US recession, a China hard landing and low oil prices. But weakness was short-lived and markets have generally advanced since then. The most recent pullback seems to have been triggered by the 2.9% wage inflation reading in the US and resulting fears the Fed would accelerate interest rate increases. But the loss was exacerbated by excessive investor complacency \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something that has clearly been removed over the past week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as well as technical factors. This removal of complacency is a healthy development, as is the reduction in equity valuations... We do not expect an immediate resolution of market technical quirks or an end to concerns about the pace of central bank rate hikes. It is possible market volatility could have a negative impact on the real economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c undermining the so-called wealth effect and consumer confidence, and substantially widening credit spreads. However, there is little current indication anything like that is taking place. In fact, global economies continue to show exceptional strength \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something that should be a key driver of markets in the coming months. Robert Lea, head of global equity research at Ashburton Investments also expects markets to climb this year, albeit at a slower rate: On balance, we still expect global equity markets to rise this year. However, we expect the rate of increase to moderate. The risk of an outright bear market remains low, as bear markets normally coincide with recessions. We see a low risk of recession currently and expect growth in the global economy to continue gathering momentum. However, we continue to think the market has under-estimated the scope for a rise in inflation this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both in the US and globally. We also think the market has potentially misjudged the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desire to normalise interest rate policy. That said, rates should likely remain low, in absolute and historical terms. The Vix volatility index, which had been pretty dormant for several months before surging last week, has slipped back this morning. It hit as high as 50 last week but is now down 10% at 26 as some calm returns. One of the sparks for the recent sell-off was the stronger than expected growth in US wages, which led to speculation that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates more often than previously expected. So one of the key events this week is likely to be the latest US inflation data, which could go some way to either easing or confirming those concerns. Rebecca O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor: Investors are breathing a sigh of relief after the torrid times last week, with European equity markets rallying this morning. Buying the dip has been a very difficult call in recent days, with every attempt at engagement punished in subsequent market moves, so investors will be hoping that this is a genuine buying opportunity. The key event of the week is US Consumer Price data on Wednesday, with investors anxious to determine whether the inflation fears that have helped to drive recent market moves have been overdone or if these concerns are justified. Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Derek Halpenny said: A softer print on Wednesday would go some way to easing current investor fears. Wage inflation did not emerge in 2017 and even if you believe the data last week is a sign of things to come, usual lags mean this will not be evident in consumer prices until toward year-end or even into 2019. We suspect that investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fears over inflation should subside over the coming weeks, which will help to stabilise equity markets, long-term yields and bring levels of volatility back down. But after the scale of this equity price correction, investors are likely to remain defensive this week. Even a slight upward surprise in the inflation data could be enough to warrant a further sell-off. One of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest advertisers is warning it might take action against tech companies over online harassment, hate speech and other issues: The consumer goods multinational Unilever is threatening to withdraw its advertising from online platforms such as Facebook and Google if they fail to protect children, promote hate or create division in society. In a speech later today, Keith Weed, the Unilever chief marketing officer, will say that, as a brand-led business, Unilever \u00e2\u20ac\u0153needs its consumers to have trust in our brands\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Unilever is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest marketing spender, after Procter &amp; Gamble, and spent \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.7bn (\u00c2\u00a36.8bn) last year advertising its brands, which include PG Tips, Marmite, Dove and Persil. The company has trimmed its ad production as part of a cost-saving drive; it is making fewer TV ads and has halved the number of ad agencies it uses to 1,500. Our full report is here: European markets are holding on to their early gains, and with US futures suggesting a positive open on Wall Street, there is some cautious optimism around. But Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, warned: As proven time and again, these things can turn on a dime, and it is way, way too early to treat the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial growth with anything but caution. Still, the FTSE climbed more than 1% after the bell, taking it towards 7170, with the CAC up 1.2% and the DAX leading the charge thanks to a near 1.7% surge, one that leaves the German index back above 12300. Importantly the Dow Jones currently looks set to follow in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s footsteps, with the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s futures pointing to a 170 point rise later this afternoon. The forex markets were slightly more subdued. Both the pound and euro tried to claw back some of their recent losses against the dollar; the former rose 0.2%, but is still the wrong side of $1.385, while the latter jumped 0.3% to tease $1.227. Against each other, meanwhile, there was nothing to separate the two, with sterling flat around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.128. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really that much for investors to work with this Monday, with the focus likely on Tuesday and Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potentially week-defining UK and US inflation readings. As forecast, European markets are benefitting from the rebound on Wall Street and have started the week on a brighter note after the recent turmoil. The FTSE 100 is up 0.8% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has added 1% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.9%. With the prospect of rising UK interest rates, Brexit concerns, and the continuing squeeze on real wages, UK consumers appeared to have kept their money in their pockets last month, according to a Visa survey. Reuters has the details: British shoppers spent less last month than the year before, causing spending in January to fall for the first time since 2013, according to a survey which underscored many households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 caution about their finances and the approach of Brexit. Visa, whose debit and credit cards are used for a third of payments in Britain, said on Monday that consumers stayed away from the traditional post-Christmas sales last month. Household spending fell by 1.2 percent in January compared with the same month in 2017, with spending in shops down by 4 percent, it said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumer spending entered the new year on a downbeat note, falling for the eighth time in the past nine months, as Britons continued to cut back on spending,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Visa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief commercial officer, Mark Antipof, said. A fall in car sales weighed on the overall sales figures too. But there was better news for hotels and restaurants - as well as for hair salons and sellers of beauty products, as consumers looked for small treats for themselves. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy lagged behind stronger growth in other rich nations in 2017 as higher inflation since the Brexit vote and slow wage growth pinched consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 spending power. Annabel Fiddes, an economist at financial data firm IHS Markit which produces the survey for Visa, said concerns about Brexit were weighing on consumer confidence. But spending could pick up later this year as inflation is expected to fall back while wages rise more quickly, she added. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market turmoil, which saw Wall Street enter correction territory (losing 10% from its recent peak) and some $4trn wiped off global share values, investors will be hoping for some respite this morning. And after US markets staged a later rally on Friday and some positive moves in Asia, Europe is expected to open higher: But that does not necessarily mean everything is now hunky dory. For a start the recent rise in bond yields - one of the factors behind the sudden turn in sentiment - may not be over yet. Central banks will continue to withdraw the stimulus measures which have supported the market since the financial crisis, which in turn will put pressure on bonds. And the volatility we have seen over the past couple of weeks is also unlikely to fade quickly. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: For a market that has enjoyed steady gains and fairly low volatility over the course of the past two years the steepness of the falls speaks to a complacency that has been prevalent for a while now and which appears to have been shattered in the wake of a surge in volatility. How this plays out over the coming days depends on whether the rebound we saw on Friday can translate into some form of base for a continuation of the uptrend that has been in place for the last nine years. This may well depend on whether we see further increases in bond yields, or a rise in interest rate expectations from other central banks around the world. ..There are other concerns, US margin debt still remains near record levels and the prospect of further losses, combined with the prospect of higher rates could prompt further jitters, not to mention the untried reaction function of a whole new breed of equity investors and traders who have never experienced the type of volatility that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gone through over the last few days. It is true that economic fundamentals remain fairly solid but it is also important to remember that this is already probably priced into US equities already, given that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve now seen tax reform get passed, along with a new US budget, which in itself is likely to see bond prices come under further pressure. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already seen a raft of US companies announce significant increases in salaries and bonuses and this was followed last week, with the news that German metal workers won a 4.3% wage rise, a trend that looks set to be replicated across the world, as governments urge employers to increase minimum salaries to more acceptable levels. And the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest hedge fund is predicting that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bigger shakeout\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is coming. Echoing the complacency theme, Bob Prince, co-chief investment officer at the $160bn US hedge fund Bridgewater, told the Financial Times (\u00c2\u00a3): There had been a lot of complacency built up in markets over a long time, so we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think this shakeout will be over in a matter of days. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably have a much bigger shakeout coming. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on his comments, with an update on Asian markets: Otherwise it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fairly quiet on the economic and corporate front, although Bank of England MPC member Jan Vlieghe is speaking later this morning.",

                "bodyText":"Unilever has threatened to withdraw its advertising from online platforms such as Facebook and Google if they fail to eradicate content which \u00e2\u20ac\u0153create division in society and promote anger and hate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd . Keith Weed, chief marketing officer of the sprawling multinational, whose brands include Dove, Magnum, Persil and Marmite, said that online platforms were sometimes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153little better than a swamp\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He told major advertising, media and tech firms gathered at a conference in California: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As one of the largest advertisers in the world, we cannot have an environment where our consumers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trust what they see online.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We cannot continue to prop up a digital supply chain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one that delivers over a quarter of our advertising to our consumers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which at times is little better than a swamp in terms of its transparency. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is in the digital media industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest to listen and act on this. Before viewers stop viewing, advertisers stop advertising and publishers stop publishing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd According to the analysts Pivotal, together Google and Facebook account for nearly three-quarters of all digital advertising in the US. In the UK the two have more than 60% of digital advertising and 90% of all new digital spending. Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultimatum comes as tech and social media firms are facing mounting criticism for failing to protect children and to erase fake news, hate speech and extremism. Last year Procter &amp; Gamble, the owner of brands including Pantene and Pampers, issued a similar warningbefore cutting $100m (\u00c2\u00a372m) of digital ad spend without any negative impact on sales . Weed said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fake news, racism, sexism, terrorists spreading messages of hate, toxic content directed at children \u00e2\u20ac\u201c parts of the internet we have ended up with is a million miles from where we thought it would take us.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Unilever is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second biggest marketing spender, after P&amp;G, and spent \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.7bn (\u00c2\u00a36.8bn) last year advertising its brands, which also include PG Tips, Vaseline and Bertolli. Google said in December it would hire thousands of new moderators after coming under fire for allowing child abuse videos and other offensive content to flourish on YouTube. Weed compared cleaning up the digital supply chain with efforts made by Unilever to find sustainable sources for its food ingredients and other raw materials and said the Anglo-Dutch business would no longer \u00e2\u20ac\u0153invest in platforms or environments that do not protect our children or which create division in society, and promote anger or hate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will prioritise investing only in responsible platforms that are committed to creating a positive impact in society.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The company has trimmed its ad production as part of a cost-saving drive; it is making fewer TV ads and has halved the number of ad agencies it uses to 1,500. Ian Whittaker and Annick Maas, analysts at Liberum, said online advertising platforms such as Facebook and YouTube faced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153increasing difficulties in persuading advertisers that their product offers a brand safe environment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Moreover, given the number of videos uploaded, there will always be an element of videos slipping through the net, which is likely to fuel further negative publicity. We therefore do not see this problem going away for the online platforms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is clear advertisers are becoming increasingly wary of online\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quality and so are unlikely to shift money aggressively from TV to online as these concerns mount.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Liberum analysts said advertisers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 growing unease about tech companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lack of content control could provide an opportunity for broadcasters to take a bigger slice of the online video advertising market. ITV has a 45% share of the UK TV ad market but only 6.5% of British online video advertising, where ad rates are much higher than in TV. Online could be a big driver of future profit growth for UK and European broadcasters, they said.

The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is expected to use next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spring statement to announce the results of a consultation launched by the Treasury in November, on how to update the tax system to reflect the nature of online businesses. The financial secretary to the Treasury, Mel Stride, told the BBC on Thursday that digital companies should pay \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd levels of tax. He suggested that could mean a system in which tax is levied according to where those companies earn their revenues \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rather than simply taxing profits, which are easier to shift from one jurisdiction to another. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the moment [they] are generating very significant value in the UK, typically through having a digital platform with lots of users interacting with that platform,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stride said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That is driving a lot of value, so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking at social media platforms, online marketplaces, internet search engines \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where at the moment the tax regime is not taxing those activities fairly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to move to a situation where we are taxing those activities fairly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Treasury sources said the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first preference would be to press for reforms to the international system at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which helps the government coordinate tax policies. But if progress cannot be agreed at a global level, Britain would be prepared to unilaterally enter into various changes, Stride said. Several big digital companies have been criticised in recent years for paying very little tax in the UK, in some cases by engaging in complex avoidance schemes such as shifting the ownership of intellectual property to a low-tax jurisdiction. Facebook recently announced a shakeup in the way it pays tax worldwide, amid mounting public pressure over whether footloose multinationals make a fair contribution to society. The company was criticised for paying just \u00c2\u00a35.1m in corporation tax in the UK last year, despite revenues nearly quadrupling to \u00c2\u00a3842.4m on the back of increased advertising sales.
